How exciting.\n\nI'm very excited. There is a lot of news today. We are going to have in a little bit the CEOs of both Grammarly and Superhuman to talk through their enormous deal, the implications of it, what they're working towards, why the deal came together, how it came together. So much to get through. But Lon, first, there's a couple of news items we absolutely have to touch on. The first thing that I want to double click on for folks is that we've talked about AI regulation here on the show quite a lot. There was a push in the House and Senate to perhaps limit state level AI regulation. It appears that that is currently off the table. So if you were hoping for one national policy on AI regulation, not a great day for you. If you wanted states to have their own shot at it, well, good news. Lon, your take.\n\nThey were sort of sneaking that into the big beautiful bill was the story. There was like a little, a little hidden tiny little text at the bottom of the page that said, uh, no state for the next 10 years, I think it was, right? Like, no states can pass any limiting AI regulation. I mean, I do understand, like, far be it for me to agree with the large AI companies, like I feel like usually I'm in opposition to them and their policies. But on this one, I get it. I do understand 50 different states making their own AI regulations is going to be beyond a headache for these companies. Like, basically impossible if all the states are going in their own little direction. So I do get why you would want to make a federal level rule. I just think this one was a little aggressive. Like, you don't want to maybe make it so that states have zero power. I think you just want common sense limits on what they can do that would massively impact development of the entire American AI industry. So I think to me this feels like I, I understand the motivation, but it feels like a hammer when what you need is probably more like a scalpel.\n\nI think that's pretty fair, and there was movement on 10 years, 5 years, sticks and carrots, but it does appear to be off the table for now. We'll see what the House does. So 10 years when you're talking about any kind of rule about AI is like, well, who even, the AI will be making rules about itself by then. Like, we don't, that's so far out in terms of this stuff. I feel like it's almost useless. Like, they're going to be laughing at whatever we thought about AI today in 10 years. Can you imagine?\n\nMaybe 10 years is just the time it takes to reach AGI.\n\nYeah. Like the Westworld hosts are going to be like, they were so stupid.\n\nI only watched the first season of that. Is the second one worth watching?\n\nUm, I, if we're going to go deep on Westworld, first season easily by far the best. Season two gets real heady and philosophical and weird, which I like, but turned off a lot of people. I still thought it was good. Three and four then kind of completely skipped the rails. You don't need to keep going that far, but I do like two.\n\nAll right, fair enough. Now Lon, the other major story before we jump into our interviews today is that Cloudflare has essentially flipped the internet economics that we know and love on its head. The news here is that they have debuted a new product called pay per crawl. Essentially, it's a way for websites to not only block AI scraping and AI pings, but also to set a price for scraping their content. This matters quite a lot in two contexts. The first one is training. We all know that AI models love to go out into the internet, collect a lot of information that they then use to train their systems to become in theory smarter over time. But I think the other context that's even more important is RAG, which is retrieval, augmented generation. Essentially AI models going out to the internet, collecting information and using that as they generate a response for users. This has become a more and more, I would say, frequent use of AI scrapers out there. The problem is, as we've learned from Tolbit, as we've learned from Cloudflare's data itself, those rag queries don't really send people back. So the economics of value transfer, if you will, have become incredibly one-sided in favor of the AI companies. So pay per crawl allows companies to, allows websites to say, if you want to crawl us, here's the price. And it allows for a kind of middle exchange with Cloudflare mediating the transactions. If this takes off, if this becomes the new standard, it would revolutionize the economics of online content. The question though, Lon, is how many websites will take it up and will the AI companies play ball?\n\nYeah, I'm. It's interesting the way AI outputs are structured, they purposefully don't send you to the third party. Like even in Claude, which we use all the time, shout out producer Claude. Shut up. They sort of, it's like they're making a big show of, we are citing sources, like they don't want you to think this is hallucinated. So they're putting those footnotes, but they're so small and they don't even seem clickable. You have to really like take the onus on yourself to click through and see what websites Claude is referencing. They could make those pages look more like a Google result. You're getting a block of text explaining what you asked Claude and then here are two or three well-chosen curated links that would send you to the sources for those information. So, I do feel like there, there are other ways around this, but sure, if pay per crawl is the strategy that gets publishers and websites paid, like I'm, I'm obviously all for it. I, I feel like the big concern these days is we're doing so much with AI. We're autogenerating so many outputs. We're, we're condensing the web down to these, you know, little, little AI results. Uh, eventually we need people to be actually doing the journalism, writing the original websites, creating the sources that Claude is then scraping and like we do need to foster those kinds of businesses or they disappear and there's nothing left for AI to reference. So the way that I think about this, just to kind of build on what you're saying, Lon, is the first order impacts of pay per crawl from Cloudflare, if it becomes the norm, is that there will be better online media economics just from day one. The second order effect is that that could lead to more expensive AI subscriptions. If Claude and, you know, OpenAI and other companies are forced to pay for content and data, it might mean that they have to raise their prices. Fair enough. Third order effects. There will be a stronger online content ecosystem. Better content will be rewarded, so there'll be more of it. And then finally, I think that will yield long term better and stronger AI systems because there'll be more real data to pull from. But it's going to be expensive to get there. The question is, what's the uptake? How many websites want this? I founded a company to do this back in 2009 and uh, we failed.\n\nJust ahead, you were just ahead of the curve, man.\n\nYeah, but this is always a good excuse to pull up the old tech articles of my company's like birth and then death. Um, but I'm just saying people have been trying to solve this for so long. Micropayments for individual human visits haven't worked, but perhaps micropayments for agents are the way forward. Um, all I know is I write on the internet for money. So, I hope this works.\n\nYeah, I mean, it does make sense to me, and I know we got, we got a million things to get to today. We got to move on. But it does make sense to me to make the AI subscriptions more expensive if that is then going to be your window into the world of content, for lack of a better term. Like we understand that, you know, your Netflix subscription is expensive, but then it's funding all of these international productions like Squid Game and all the movies and whatever. Like all of that content gets created because of you're paying the Netflix subscription up front. It could be the same way you're paying Anthropic upfront for your Claude subscription, but then that is in part seeding all of this great media and content from around the web that we still want to see. We just want to access it via Claude. It's like Jason says on the show all the time, it's not that he doesn't want to hear the New York Times wire cutter tech reviews anymore. He just wants to get them through ChatGPT.\n\nYeah, I think it's really cool that this could convert a portion of consumer and enterprise AI subscriptions into effective media subscriptions. It's a pretty interesting model.\n\nInvestors like me are not going to invest in your business unless you're structured properly. So founders, if you're serious about raising money, you need to set up your business the right way. And that starts with a registered agent.

Go to northwestregisteredagent.com/twist today. Um, but you're right. We have to move on. All right.\n\nMarket. We got to do a poly market.\n\nYes, we do. Uh, and I have picked one that is very, very apppropo to the current moment because why not keep talking about what you and I love the most, which is of course, mergers and acquisitions in the AI space.\n\nOf course, mergers and acquisitions in the AI space because I speak English. All right. So this is a poly market that asks, will Apple acquire Perplexity before September? Now I had picked this before the Grammarly Superhuman news dropped. We knew, Lon, going into this that Apple has sniffed around uh, Perplexity. We've heard that Meta has sniffed around Perplexity. And so I think this is a perfectly fine thing to bet on. I'm just surprised that it hasn't moved more in the wake of the Grammarly Superhuman deal because I think we're seeing more AI first products buy one another. And I think that that same pressure probably implies that Apple really does need to buy an AI champion. So I almost want to say this looks a little bit undervoted, if that makes sense.\n\nYeah. I mean, I think Perplexity of all of the major AI companies, for it feels like it makes the most sense. We know Apple's looking around and senses that Apple intelligence may not be ready for prime time and they may want Siri to be powered by a, a more established, you know, better sort of regarded model. Um, and Perplexity. We keep talking about, I, I, I think we keep coming back to this idea that the, the way we're gauging the best models and the most used models and the most entrenched. It's not by necessarily these benchmarks of like, can it take the, you know, the LSAT and get a perfect score. I don't even know what the benchmarks are to be perfectly honest. But the way that people use them is, are they tied into something else that I'm already using? Like the ChatGPT interface obviously gets the most use. And like Meta's AI gets a ton of use because it's baked into Instagram and Facebook and Grock gets a ton of use because it's baked into X, the everything app. And so Perplexity doesn't have that. If you want to check out Perplexity's models, you got to just go, I think it's perplexity.ai. You got to like go there and purposefully look something up using Perplexity's model. And so it makes perfect sense to me, like this feels like an obvious collaboration, like Apple needs a model to power their consumer facing apps that are already being used and Perplexity has this great model but nothing to do with it. So like bring those two things together and you have this seamless opportunity.\n\nWell, I think that people are might, I think people are not giving this as much credence because we have also seen news that Apple might work with either Anthropic or OpenAI to source their models as opposed to what's built in-house, and if they do that, the need for Perplexity goes down a little bit, Lon. Uh, but I'll also just say Apple has a history of small acquisitions, not big ones, and that's also leading against this being a possibility. But at the same time, if I'm Apple and I'm this far behind on AI, I'm probably looking for some help. So anyways, lots going on over on Poly Market. We got to get some interviews because there's a lot of news bubbling. As we said, we have the CEOs of both Grammarly and Superhuman here to answer all of our questions about their enormous deal that shook technology markets this morning. And then after that, we're going to hear from the CEO of Labelbox, all about AI data labeling and how startups are working to fill the gap that Scale AI's exit to Meta may have formed. And in the background of that, you will see the glorious Stanford campus. So, please enjoy the California sunshine. And then to close off, Apptronik, all about humanoid robots. How much progress have we actually made today? How quickly will we see these in market? It is a TWiST500 extravaganza. I hope\n\n\nEveryone enjoys it. We've been working very hard to get a lot of these interviews done to bring you what you can't find over there on Twitter. All right, Lon, let's hear from the CEOs of Grammarly and Superhuman.\n\nThis morning, Grammarly, an AI powered writing tool, announced that it will acquire Superhuman, a well-known email service popular and beloved by power users around the world. Recall that Grammarly was in the news as 2024 came to a close for buying KOD, a startup that built AI infused enterprise collaboration tools. The company also sports 40 million daily active users and more than $700 million worth of annual recurring revenue. To dig into the deal to figure out why these companies are coming together, please welcome to the show. It's Shishir Mehrotra, CEO of Grammarly, previously co-founder and CEO of KOD and Rahul Vohra, founder and CEO of Superhuman. Gentlemen, welcome. I guess back to the show. I think of all of our guests, you two have to be among the absolute most frequent. So, thanks for making the time.\n\nThanks for having us back, Alex.\n\nHello. Hello. All right. So, Shishir, earlier this month you said that Grammarly is quote building a platform of AI agents that work seamlessly within your existing tools, a big vision. How does Superhuman fit into it?\n\nYeah, sure. Uh really excited about uh this acquisition, the SE today. Um as you mentioned, our goal is to build the AI native productivity suite with the apps and agents that drive productivity for every individual and every team in the world. Uh we spent lots of time talking mostly about agents and how Grammarly is the OG agent. that serves as communication assistant for over 40 million daily active users. And we're basically transforming that platform into a platform of agents that work with you beyond just your grammar agent. But simultaneously, we're also building a suite of application uh for where those agents work. And the code acquisition was actually the start of that. It gives Grammarly a natural home for one of the most common tasks uh that Grammarly users do, writing. Um but as we work to fill out the suite, we naturally turned to the next most commonly used surfaces uh which turns to email. Um emails, uh for most people the dominant communication tool people use, billions of different users, uh often the most used work app. It turns out that for Grammarly, it is actually our number one use case. So Grammarly is used more frequently in uh in email applications than any other surface. uh we help people revise something like 50 million emails per week and work across you know 20 different email providers Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, so on including Superhuman. So my view of this was I I actually looked at that category as the next obvious one for Grammarly to play in. Email is a category I've been thinking about for a long time. As we were talking about right before the show started, I actually started my career in email. I was a developer on Microsoft Outlook in the in the 1990s. Seems like a long time ago. And at the time, Outlook was the most innovative email tool in the world. And uh I got to Google right as the next one came. Gmail came in the mid-200s. And then after that, basically nothing happened. And until Rahul came along and uh you know, Rahul and I were starting Superhuman Codeup, similar times.\n\nAnd I I saw in him the same spark of I bet we can reinvent this very um unappreciated old surface. in a similar way that we were doing with documents and Rahula really extremely clear view of how to do it um and has done a really amazing job of it. So uh Superhuman was a very natural next step for us there. I I think it's a complete mind shift in how people think about email. We'll talk more about that as well. Um but for us it helps us bridge out from agents to building out the application services for the the prominent places where people work.\n\nAll right. So Rahul, Tashir just said that you had a pretty clear vision for the future. Talk us through from your end why this deal made sense and what you hope bringing Superhuman into Grammarly will unlock that you couldn't have before with just people using Grammarly as also being Superhuman users.\n\nWell, I think this deal like so many had its roots in a relationship that started a long time ago. We actually met Cheshure and I back in 2017. Uh we were at a conference and it was one of those special moments. this is why people go to conferences or why you should go when no one else was around. So, we could get into some really deep conversation. This was the lobby conference. So, shout out David Hornick and team. They do an amazing job. And as I think you know back then we only did one-on-one VIP concagege on boardings. So, I onboarded him right there and then right by the pool. And uh as those who've been through one of these onboardings know, the very last step is I would ask people to close Gmail. And he's, you know, moving his his hand around. finally clicks the closed Gmail tab and like another tab catches my eye which is an app called Krypton and I asked what it was and Shishir then proceeded to give me the best product demo I'd seen in years like it was this document but it was also a spreadsheet and a database it was a collaboration tool it was an app builder and Krypton kind of stuck at the back of my mind because that's the home planet of Superman which is adjacent to Superhuman obviously they eventually renamed KOD and then uh Shush was brought in as well as the coded team and products integramatally.\n\nAI is here. It's changing everything, including the way we do business. But Alex, I know a lot of listeners still aren't getting as much out of the AI revolution as they should be. You shouldn't just be asking a chatbot, a question you would normally ask on Google. No, your AI app should be connected to all your other systems, making your workflow smarter and more efficient. And that is why Retool was created. Retool makes it simple and straightforward to build your own custom AI powered apps integrated directly into your workspace and the tools you're already using every day. For example, imagine joining a Zoom after having a dedicated AI assistant prep all your meeting notes and then sticking around to give you important real-time context and feedback as your colleagues are talking or a skilled AI CPA keeping an eye on your books, prepping your taxes, and instantly spotting fraud. Design your own AI agents that help you get real work done today. No more writing endless integration code. No more choosing between performance or customization. Trust a platform that's already being used by over 10,000 companies. Check out retool today and get your AI doing more than just talking. Just go to retool.com/twist to learn more. That's retool.com/twist.\n\nNow, last year in his acquisition announcement, he wrote, and I have the quote here, &quot;As I watched the foundational capabilities of AI change just about how every tool and surface operates, I started drafting my 2025 planning memo for the team, I titled it the AI native productivity suite.&quot; And that was a moment where my jaw kind of hit the floor. Uh because I think as you know, our vision at Superhuman has always been to build the AI native productivity suite of choice. And email is a critical part of that suite. Shishir touched on it, but it is such a big problem. There's roughly a billion professionals in the world. And on average, this is the average number, we spend 3 hours a day on email. So that's 3 billion hours every single day or more than a trillion hours every single year. It's sometimes easy to forget this in Silicon Valley, but in general, as professionals, we spend more time on email than we do any other work app. Uh so we caught up, we had several conversations. it it was clear that we share the same vision which is to build the AI native productivity suite of choice. I think this is going to look a little bit different maybe to what people imagine when they hear that it is not just apps it's apps and agents uh and that's what we're building. So I want to get into that because when Grammarly bought Kod my my thought was okay so Grammarly is a great tool I use it around the web kod is a great tool we use it to for the twist 500.com website for example okay that's the new pane of glass that's the central interface for all things Grammarly agents and kod now with Superhuman inside the fold I'm not sure exactly where the center of gravity rests or alternatively if agents are going to follow me around the web and I'm clinging to a dated understanding of what software should be. So which direction are we going?\n\nYeah, I mean I I think our view is uh we'll do a little of both. I mean I think the way we think about is agents should be with you everywhere you are and it's very important that like Grammarly does follows you into uh hundreds of thousands of different applications but uh they also need a home and I think the way we think about KOD is we think about as the first party home for interacting with those agents and an analogy I use a lot with the team uh the product I used to work on before KOD was YouTube and for YouTube imagine if YouTube only had embeds all around the internet but there was no YouTube.com and so we kind of view uh uh together and that's how I view both KOD and uh Superhuman in this uh in this world. So just to give you an example, imagine you're writing an email to a customer and not only do you want to have your Grammarly trusted communication agent that's making sure that you get your spelling and grammar correct, you get your tone correct, uh that you're accurate, but you also have a sales agent that ensures accuracy of all your sales facts. And maybe you have a support agent that knows everything about that customer's recent support issues. Or maybe you have a marketing agent that knows exactly which feature to suggest to that customer. And all of those should happen in that in that same surface where you want to spend your most productive hours of the day. And so that's how we view them coming together.\n\nThat's a pretty broad multi- Asian framework and one that seems to spread quite far beyond the companies you've purchased today, Shishir. So being a little bit of a brat, but how many more companies are you planning on buying?\n\nI I don't I don't think I have a limit that's I mean I do think as you build the suite of the future I I think there's a lot of things that uh will will build, we'll buy, we'll partner. I don't think everything has to be done in that way. It was very important to me uh to take ownership of the most important surfaces that people work in. If you were sort of divide people's work life into what do you do all day, you produce work artifacts, documents, spreadsheets, presentation, so on and you communicate. And so that's things like email, chat, and and so on. And so these were certainly the two most important. Um, but we're we're ready to uh pull in whatever parts of the suite we need to to complete that experience.\n\nAll right. So, Raul, you wrote in a post over on the Superhuman website that email quote turns out to be the perfect place to work with agents. Um, we were joking before the show that I've almost onboarded to Superhuman like four or five times. Sorry. Uh, but I'm very curious what that might look like in practice for folks out there who either aren't current Superhuman users or are just not sure what an agentic email experience might look like in Shishir's broader vision of productivity.\n\nAbsolutely. And I think the, you know, as an industry, we're still figuring out defining exactly what an agent is, which by the way, I think is fine. At Grammarly, we have a particular point of view. I think one of the things we believe and and this is a little bit unique about our position and and I love that Shishir has this position and and the wider company as well is that it should follow you around. It should be available working wherever you do. Um you may remember I have a very deep history in that idea. My last company reportive I think was a proto agent. Like you didn't have to do anything. It was just always there working on your behalf researching people putting it on the right hand side of Gmail. Grammarly the product is a proto agent. whatever writing service you're in, it's there helping you write, helping you communicate, helping you be understood. And uh obviously the capabilities of those things now are so much more advanced than what we could do back then. But that idea of someone sitting right beside you or or like this this little thing on your shoulder that's just helping you be brilliant at what you do, very near and dear to my heart. So zooming out a bit, we think that these AI agents, they're going to work on your behalf. They're going to reason. They're going to problem solve. They're going to incorporate detailed context about your work. They're obviously going to interact with other systems and as we've started to see over the last few months, other agents. And for so many people, email is the center of where they work. It's got things like project statuses, customer communication, meeting updates, deal execution, so much more. So, you can imagine an agent triaging your inbox before you wake up. You can imagine another agent drafting I I know, right? Responses in your invoice and tone. It's all going to happen. We'll get you on the fifth time. uh an agent incorporating detailed context about your work, another agent servicing insights, scheduling meetings, and then syncing with your other systems of record, whether that's an ATS, uh a CRM, uh could be custom system, a custom integration. One of the cool things about agents is the API can literally be natural language. And so the the glue is easier to build than it ever has been. And then one of the the most far out ideas and we were talking about this just before the show. Um, and you were asking like does does email become the workbench to manage your agents? Well, I think the answer is we'll we'll have multiple places to manage our agents. Sometimes it's going to be in the flow of our work. That's the idea of the agent following you around. But sometimes you're just going to want to go through a list of things and mark those things as done and snooze those things and assign those things to other people and have blazingly fast full text search over those things and have this app whatever it is work offline and you know it starts to look awfully like an email client at the end of the day. Email actually is nothing more than a list of things to do and uh that that will that is what we're building. It's what we've always been building. I just I'll add I'll add two quick things\n\n\nAlex, I know you'll get you onboarded to the product again soon.\n\nUm, I think just first off that the task of dealing with email is its own interesting task.\nThis seems like an odd thing to brag about, but I've been a Superhuman user for years, and I had Rahul pull the stat for me.\nSo, I have a currently 144-week inbox zero streak, hitting inbox zero every week for two and a half years, and that is largely credit to Superhuman.\nSo, if you view this as a chore, we can do much better than that.\nI think there's a next level, which is now, do you communicate better?\nDo you communicate more effectively?\nUm, the, uh, how much faster do you respond to emails?\nWhat's the quality of responses?\nAnd then you start to think about it the way Rahul was just describing, that it's your workbench for working with your agents.\nAnd, you know, part of our view of it was, why do we care so much about documents and email as being two surfaces we really wanted to have the best first-party experience in is the places you work with humans are the natural places to work with agents as well, is that that's how we think our teams are about to expand, uh, as a very natural surface for us on the agent that follows you around.\nI, I love that idea.\nI love the idea of having an assistant that knows my context and can help me wherever I am.\nIs that something that you can build with technologies as kind of basic as a browser extension, or is do you need a different vehicle to bring that to market so that way it can interact with me across my workflow, 'cause not everything I do is inside of a browser?\n\nWe're all familiar with AWS, Amazon Web Services.\nThat's the cloud platform that powers so many of your favorite brands.\nBut do you know about AWS Activate?\nThat's their program for startups where they provide up to $100,000 in AWS credits for all startups.\nWhether you're backed by an investor or you're bootstrapping, money is time to keep innovating, time to delight customers, and time for you to keep gaining traction.\nYou need runway, and AWS's Activate is going to help you with that runway.\nWe hear this story from so many of our founding university companies.\nThey're finding product-market fit, the word's getting out about their product, just a little boost, finding some savings here or there to get a little extra time can be the difference between getting traction and bringing in revenue, or, hey, let's call it what it is, running out of money, okay, and shutting down.\nAWS knows this.\nThat's why they've created the ultimate toolkit for early-stage startups looking to boost growth.\nWith AWS Activate, you're going to get up to $100,000 in AWS credits, hands-on support and training, plus exclusive discounts with some of our favorite companies and tools.\nSo, start getting the support you need at every stage of your startup journey.\nTo learn more, visit aws.amazon.com/startups/credits.\nThat's right, aws.amazon.com/startupscredits.\n\nYeah, that's right.\nRight.\nI mean, I think the first off, the way Grammarly works, and if we think about Grammarly, is really, I think it's a very misunderstood product because I think people understand it as like as a proto-agent, as that OG agent, but actually, it's two separate products.\nYou know, there's one we think of as the agent platform that brings AI to you everywhere.\nAnd the other we think of as your agent, that's the, that's your high school grammar teacher in in your pocket.\nAnd the platform is actually where most of the technology has gone.\nSo, Grammarly currently works in your browser.\nIt works on your desktop.\nThere's a desktop application that works on it and on your phone.\nUm, so there's a both on iOS and Android, um, a version of Grammarly that can work across all your applications.\nSo across that, we work across 500,000 different applications, and yes, that's everything from your browser apps, Superhuman, Gmail, so on, uh, but also your desktop apps.\nSlack is a great example.\nUm, but people use Apple Notes, people use all sorts of things that are, um, uh, desktop applications as well.\nAnd we've done the hard work to be able to read what's on your screen, be able to annotate it in a way that is unobtrusive to you, and then be able to take action on your behalf.\nUh, we call that the AI superhighway.\nThat's the term we use for it.\nBringing AI right to the end user.\nAnd our view of it is that right now, we're only running one car on that highway.\nWe're running your high school grammar teacher.\nThat's the one car.\nAnd we're expanding that so that anybody can build an agent that works across all those different surfaces.\nSo it is a key part of what we're.\nSo then Grammarly's kind of backend today is the platform on which many other agents can be built, filling out this AI highway with other cars to your analogy.\n\nThat's right.\nAnd you're going to see a big shift in, uh, in the product in the next couple months, and that that'll become much, much more obvious.\nWe've been working really hard on it, and then we'll start opening up the platform.\nSo anybody can do it.\nI mean, that could be like, we, we described a couple examples earlier.\nCould be things that connect to a system like your, imagine your Salesforce agent wasn't like a Salesforce app that you had to go to, but rather an agent that was with you everywhere and had all your sales data at your fingertips and was just going through and marking up your, whether you're writing an email or a document or so marking up as you go.\nUm, you can imagine agents that represent people.\nSo, I, I want an agent for, I'm a big fan of, uh, Kim Scott's Radical Candor, and Kim's building an agent that is, hey, you really want to follow this, don't read the book and stick it on your shelf, but really have this person that's sitting next to you saying, hey, you're kind of not following the principles of the book right now.\nHere's what, here's what you should be doing.\nSo, I think that market of, you know, that the set of people I want next to me as I'm working is is sort of limitless, and we want to be the platform for doing that.\nSo just to be clear, you're saying that Grammarly is eventually going to have a app, uh, sorry, an agent marketplace where other people can build things and deploy them onto the foundation that we discussed that Grammarly's already built that interacts across a user's computing environment.\n\nYeah, that's right.\nAnd it's, it's being built on top of a marketplace we built at Koda called the PAX marketplace, which is already one of the most thriving marketplaces in the world.\nThere's about eight or nine thousand of those packs that have been built.\nThere's 800 or so in the gallery.\nAnd so there's already many of those agents already exist, and we're taking those and bringing them over to the Grammarly platform.\n\nAll right, Ro, I want to get back to you because when this news dropped, first of all, I was a little bit shocked.\nI've since kind of figured out what you guys are doing, and frankly, I quite like it.\nOver on social media, some people were a little bit confused, expressed concern that their favorite product is going to be taken into a larger company.\nSo for folks out there who are current Superhuman users who may not be Grammarly customers, uh, what assurances can you give them if any that their experience is not going to become, um, to use a common phrase, Salesforce?\n\nWell, well, without commenting on Salesforce, uh, you know, anyone who's watching this has mine and Shishir's absolute assurance that whatever that is, it's not going to happen.\nUh, Shishir, as he mentioned, has been using the product since 2017.\nCredits his success in his email to the product, and the entire team is moving over.\nThis is an acquisition not just of a product, not just of a team, but of a business, uh, an ecosystem, a brand.\nUh, it's something really truly very special, and we have every intention of fully accelerating what it is that we're building and what we're doing here.\nAs a founder, one of the most exciting things about a deal like this is that you have access to significantly greater resources.\nSo, we're going to invest more than ever in AI, as we talked about.\nUh, we're going to invest more than ever in our core email experience, even after building it for 10 or 11 years.\nWe still have a laundry list of things that we want to make better.\nWe're going to build out calendar, and we're actually very close to that.\nAnyone who's in Superhuman today will see that.\nTasks.\nWe're going to connect calendar and tasks and email beautifully together.\nWe're going to reimagine chat, redefine collaboration, pulling on everything that we've learned about work communication for the last 10 years.\nUh, and then of course, as Shia said, we're going to connect all of this up with a new way of working with agents, which we think is going to free all of us up to be more creative, more strategic, and more impactful.\nSo, uh, I get it.\nIt's, it's reasonable to to be concerned in a time of massive change.\nUh, but one of the things that really appealed to me about, uh, this particular pair-up, and and Shishir as well, being a genuine user of the product for for so many years now, is is this goal to to build, uh, that that he mentioned to me in in the past, to build a stable of some of the best AI brands in the world.\nAnd, uh, that's very different.\nHe, he gave me some examples, for example, of, uh, when, uh, when Facebook acquired Instagram, or when Facebook acquired WhatsApp, or how Google has treated YouTube.\nThat is how we want to think about Superhuman at Grammarly.\n\nSo a crown jewel, the one that retains its own identity and will be a piece of a larger puzzle.\nI like that a lot, and I'm sure that a lot of folks are going to be very glad to hear that their Superhuman experience is not going to change.\nUh, now Rahul, you sold Reportive after just a couple years of building it.\nNow, you've been working on Superhuman for a very long time.\nYou had a pretty big round back in 2021.\nI'm curious just from the founder's chair, why was this the right time to sell?\n\nThat's a great question.\nUm, I think there's a few things, you know, people often say, oh, like, was it a growth thing or like, is it a runway thing?\nUh, and you know, mostly for the insider baseball and for the other founders, I'll, I'll share the following.\nUh, we were actually growing faster than ever.\nWe grew twice as fast in 2024 compared to 2023.\nUh, we had runway for four plus years.\nWe would have been break even, uh, probably early next year by this point.\nUh, so it, it truly is none of those things.\nIt really is that technology is changing faster than I've ever seen in my whole career.\nAnd towards the end of 2024, I think a number of companies realized the magnitude of the apps and agent opportunity that we just talked through.\nAnd also they're looking at their own products portfolio.\nThey're realizing they have an email-sized hole.\nAnd I think one of the one of the skills every founder needs is is to spot the zeitgeist, to realize when that kind of thing is happening, and then to be able to go and prosecute that opportunity.\nUh, and so it was obvious to me at the end of last year that there were a number of companies that had that thought.\nAnd it makes sense.\nYou know, there's, as I said, north of a trillion hours of, uh, time go into email every single year.\nThere's no other work cap that we spend more time in.\nUh, Superhuman is almost, actually, definitely a one-of-one asset.\nLike we spent 11 years grinding to to get to this specific point.\nUh, and so that, that was why I knew it was the right time.\n\nYeah.\nJust repeat from the from the buyer perspective, this idea of an email-shaped hole in everybody's productivity suite, I think is absolutely correct.\nI think there's going to be a race to build that new AI-native productivity suite, and I felt very lucky to be able to work with Rahul and, uh, you know, come up with a deal that I think will produce great impact for our overall company, for the current Superhuman users, but is really a one-of-a-one product.\nI mean, there really is like the, the, the, the next best, uh, new email products on the market are, you know, almost unheard of, and so I, I think it's a, I think it's a great partnership to be able to bring that to a much broader group of people.\n\nYeah.\nAnd it's not like Gmail has gotten a lot better in the last 10 years, let's be honest.\nNow, Shishir, you recently secured a billion dollars worth of growth capital with General Catalyst.\nPretty interesting way to to fund growth of the business.\nI really liked it.\nYou did note that some of that was earmarked for strategic acquisitions.\nI'm curious, did you use that capital for this deal?\nAnd did you have Superhuman already in mind when you secured that capital, or did this come afterwards?\n\nUh, Rahul and I have been talking for a bit.\nSo, it was yes, it was in mind as we as we went through it.\nThe, the, uh, the specifics of the deal aren't being shared, but, uh, it was an all-stock deal, so the, the, the, the capital is being, uh, uh, allows us to take, uh, bigger bets here.\nUm, but in general, we're working through how to expand our offering as fast as we can, and having access to an extra billion dollars is a is a pretty good way to do it.\nRo, was that large pool of capital that you'll have access to now to probably use to grow Superhuman an incentive, or are you more interested in the engineering resources that Grammarly can bring to bear on your quote laundry list of, uh, of to-dos?\n\nUh, well, definitely those two, uh, distribution, grace, resources.\nI mean, there are so many reasons to to join forces here.\nIt was almost a no-brainer, pretty clear, actually, in our first conversation that Shashir and I had.\n\nWow.\n\nOkay.\nSo, Shishir, then just to wrap us up here, because I think everyone wants to know how this is going to play out in the real world, but, uh, your company's enormous, 700 million ARR, making a lot of big deals, uh, IPO plans this year, next year, people are talking about everyone getting finally out, are you one of those companies?\n\nNothing to announce now.\nI think we're, we're pretty busy building.\nUh, I think it is quite the gold rush right now as the the world adjusts to AI, changing many things that we just didn't think were possible.\nI mean, the idea that we're going to have agents rewriting and rewriting all our emails for us just seemed kind of crazy, and now it's completely possible, and, uh, you know, we're very focused on on growing that.\nUm, and you know, when, when we're ready, we'll, we'll take it out to the public markets.\n\nAll right.\nWell, here's hoping that you guys can eventually take these agents to become so smart that they can, instead of writing the email for me, simply contact someone else's agent, handle the communications, and\n\n\nBring back the context I need because then we can just cut off the whole middleman and short circuit email for the future.\nBut in the meantime, Shishir Mehrotra and Rahul Vohra, thank you both so much for coming back on the show.\nCongrats on the deal and I guess go build.\nThanks, Alex.\nBye.\nNow, you may have seen a major news item in the last couple of days.\nMeta and Scale AI have come to a 14-15 billion dollar deal.\nThat investment threw an enormous amount of light onto the realm of data labeling.\nAnd in the coverage of that enormous news event, a company called LabelBox said that they might generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue this year.\nNaturally, that got us thinking.\nWe looked into the company.\nWe absolutely had to learn more.\nSo, please join me in welcoming CEO and co-founder of LabelBox.\nIt's Manu Sharma.\nManu, welcome to the show.\nThank you for having me, Alex.\nReally excited to be here.\nAnd if you're watching the video version of this, I will note that Manu is not using a virtual background.\nHe is on the Stanford campus which just goes to show I think the connection between AI work and academia is holding strong.\nUm but Manu just to start what is data labeling and can you tell me a little bit about the difference between humanled data labeling and uh machineled data labeling?\nYeah, Alex.\nSo, uh, nearly every AI breakthrough that we have experienced since Alex Net, um, all of these models have actually been trained on human generated data.\nBack in the days, um, uh, you know, when around maybe let's say 2017 to 2020, um, supervised learning, which is a technique to uh, build computer vision models.\nYou may have seen like lots of self-driving cars work starting popping up at that time.\nThey were all trained with humanlabeled data and kind of labeling at that time used to be fairly uh trivial.\nUh you know you're kind of looking at an image and saying like hey that's a car that's a pedestrian and things like that.\nAnd that fundamental technology or technique was widespread for all kinds of um computer vision applications.\nAnd uh after um kind of the transformer uh kind of innovation or breakthrough appeared a lot of the focus um went into kind of uh making that unsupervised learning stack work.\nAnd turns out even in that paradigm uh you know these models are learning from let's say all the web data which of course is human generated for all these decades um on the internet.\nUm and then there's also a technique called post training where um you know the uh very experienced humans are uh teaching these AI models to be better assistant and now the state-of-the-art is that um these models obviously are very capable across the board.\nUm however they still lack reliability with agents and um and you know performing kind of day-to-day tasks.\nThey're getting better but even those kind of skills have to be taught by um through human data uh believe it or not and um now you know um uh there is sort of perhaps a misconception that you know um the like it's kind of machine generated data or human data uh the state-of-the-art or the frontier is essentially hybrid data like there are like most of the latest cutting edge um data sets that are being generated that you improve these model capabilities uh are fundamentally kind of uh AI assisted.\nSo you know these experts um humans across wide range of domains in human knowledge, coding, mathematics, physics, you name it.\nThey're they uh they actually use uh AI systems um to u to kind of produce the very best signal uh that is then used to uh enhance the capabilities of the models.\nSo we've had machineled data labeling, we've had humanled data labeling, and now we have AI assisted human data labeling.\nDo you think that's going to be the state-of-the-art for a a long period of time, or is this just one more iteration on a cycle of constant change?\nUm, so I believe that um the um there is um uh a long road uh to make these models highly capable and u kind of be fully integrated in the economy.\nSo when you look at um kind of the adoption of these AI systems, they are obviously amazing and really changing the the way we do work.\nUm however, these agents are still not as reliable.\nUm these agents still need to be um taught how to um kind of fully automate a task.\nUm you know, whether it's uh maybe even software engineering like you know, you can you're coding with humans in the loop essentially.\nUh but I think you know when will be the time where AIs can actually write code for days uh or weeks and humans are sort of like steering or sort of managing them and these examples kind of are across the board you know when will the AIS be able to be 100% uh act as a customer service on on your business behalf and sort of like resolve all these issues and you know these kind of capabilities are um very um uh lucrative to solve and they require a ton of new kinds of data and you have to generate this data somehow and um one of the best uh techniques um that you know we are pioneering and is essentially uh using kind of um technology AI and software and workflows with human experts uh to uh very cost-ffectively capture human uh expertise in the data which then is used to um uh kind of train these models through re reinforcement learning.\nAll right.\nNow, when I think about you guys, I think that what you described falls into your kind of uh data factory uh concept.\nCan you explain that for folks who might not be familiar with uh what you guys are saying there?\nYeah, for sure.\nSo, um in the data labeling uh business um or let's call it like data generation for um post training for these models um there is a number of uh kind of ingredients that goes into it.\nUh so first of all you have to have a um uh a network that is um uh attracting and assessing really high-end talent who um exhibits certain knowledge that is superior than the AI.\nUm it could be you know uh just sort of like a base uh kind of IQ like you know so humans can have the have like high agency to learn new things and kind of do things that AIs can't do but then also there is kind of deep expertise you know whether that's u let's say an aircraft design it could be um medicine and and healthcare and so forth and so you have to have that sort of uh network and bench and that's really just a starting point and so you may have seen like number of companies popping up as a export staffing agencies model and they're all they're really doing is helping some of these AI labs to uh hire talent.\nNow we take that idea further.\nWe call it data factory because you you kind of need a workforce to obviously um uh operate in some sort of a uh setting to actually produce human data.\nSo Labelbox uh has been in the you know in business for over like seven years u building that technology platform.\nSo um so we build all the tools, the workflows um and techniques to actually um produce the data and so we have a network and then on top of that there is a um kind of fairly complex and sophisticated technology platform which uses AI and software and things like that to allow these experts to work uh in a manner that produces the very best data at a very cost-ffective um kind of uh parameters and that vertical ized stack, what we call is data factory.\nAnd sort of this analogy kind of really holds where you know when you're building a factory or you're operating a factory you've got to have infrastructure machines assembly lines the workflows the practices but then you also need the workforce and label box is fully verticalized in the sense that we actually produce the data and uh and offer that to the our customers uh that uh that in a manner you know that that they can actually get the data very quickly in a matter of hours if not days.\nUm and it's really the data that you know these AI labs want ultimately to um to continue to uh win in the race.\nYeah, it's interesting because if you go back to the SAS era, there was a lot of discussions about software versus services and how you wanted to be a majority software business.\nYou might sell services at cost simply as an enablement tool for your software business.\nBut it really feels like the way you're describing the data race for AI, there is a strong human component in it, at least at the expert level.\nHow does that impact how you price and sell label box services?\nBecause I'm curious how you think about the two different sides of the uh data factory.\nYeah, totally.\nSo uh it's a fantastic question and observation.\nSo um you know for first five years of our company uh we primarily sold SAS uh we basically built the world's leading data labeling platform and our platform would be is used by over 30% of Fortune 500 companies.\nUm and they kind of in this context our our customers are bringing their own workforce um and operating the entire data labeling operations on our platform and um and you know in those context it would be sort of like a SAS based pricing systems you know where uh it's based on how much consumption or data customers are generating and they're paying some kind of um uh kind of a correlated cost uh that uh to us on that.\nAnd when we decided to fully verticalize and get into kind of data services business um you know just over a year ago uh we um now we are pricing essentially on the data like how um uh per as example perhaps and and and sometimes it's the value that our data is bringing among our customers.\nSo for example, just even a couple of weeks ago, you know, we were uh we enabled one of our one of the leading AI labs to increase the state-of-the-art performance by 15% on a data set that we created for them.\nAnd that could be like valuable like extremely valuable to that company, you know, in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars of value generated.\nUm you know, the models is bumps up in a leaderboard and they are able to um onboard more workloads and things like that.\nAnd so so that is fundamentally like how we're pricing.\nIt's based like on the value of the data we're generating for customers.\nIs it hard to price?\nBecause I feel like value from data is uh squishy and you guys if you're pricing that way probably want to charge more because you think it's more valuable and they might want to say oh you know it was only so good.\nSo how do you handle that tension?\nYeah, there's always that um uh kind of a um uh discussion uh around u the data and the cost and the value and uh you know we are um it is fundamentally hard to price um and it's a it's a new frontier for not just us but many other companies the native AI apps companies who are essentially like a very similar model where they're kind of automating some workflow um and so forth and in our business particularly the challenging part is that every few months the state-of-the-art is um kind of um uh uh at a much higher end um you know so for example a year ago a lot of the data we were generating were was around um kind of basic assistance like teaching English skills like how to write great essays now we are um uh producing RL environments for these labs to kind of like uh do this reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards very different technical skill set needed very sophisticated data That's and um you know ultimately data data is actually becoming more costlier and the reason is that the expertise needed uh is becoming um more um uh uh kind of more complex or more kind of nuanced.\nUm however with that said um we um we are um proud to be saying that we are actually uh one of the leading companies in the sense like when you look at the data and the cost uh we are able to we are the unmatched uh in that performance or the parto curve and we are able to do that because of a very strong technology stack that is operating on top of the kind of the expert network.\nI I really appreciate that answer in answer that explains it kind of top to bottom.\nMano, I want to go back in time.\nYou guys last raised the publicly known round was 110 million led by SoftBank and it was announced in uh very early 2022.\nThat was prehat GPT's launch and what you might call the starting gun of the Gen AI era.\nI presume the market moved towards you uh in that year.\nSo, how much did the release of ChatgBT speed up demand for your company's services?\nAnd then if you can how much did you guys grow last year?\nYeah.\nSo um the um the demand has um increased substantially.\nI mean it's really um all engines on fire you know in over since since um since actually like when we decided to enter the data services market.\nSo uh kind of a bit of a history um uh just about um uh up to uh less than a year ago we decided to enter data services market.\nUp until then, we were essentially um selling enterprise platforms across uh across the world across these like enterprises and I'm proud to say that we are powering most of the AI labs now uh and and so we've grown from basically entering the market to now powering a substantial workloads uh for nearly all the big AI labs and um uh you know we've been growing very fast um since then um and basically in hyperrowth kind of trae factory and I think um this latest news and kind of the market dynamics that over the last two weeks has further catalyzed or accelerated that growth um and uh you know so it's been really exciting times at labelbox and um you know um uh there challenges around like how do you scale that quickly and uh you know meet customers and all that and so you know this I call still that to be a challenge but at least it's a a fun challenge.\nI I do want to just verify something.\nYou did say that they the the sale of scale to Meta and its customers leaving could actually generate hundreds of millions in new revenue for Labelbox.\nIs that a 2025 metric or is that a total contract value over kind of a multi-year period number?\nUm we expect substantial revenue over the next 12 18 months for sure.\nUm we're experiencing it already right now.\num uh at a much higher steep curve um um and um you know it gets harder and harder and larger numbers but you know we are we are very very excited about uh what's next in the next 12 18 months.\nI appreciate that.\nNow uh with the exit of scale um it could kick off some consolidation in and around your space.\nYou mentioned some of the startups that are kind of popping up in your domain, admittedly targeting kind of a fraction of what you're doing, but I'm I'm curious with your history of capital raises and success of the company and growth, are you guys interested in going into the market and maybe buying some smaller companies?\nWe do get uh quite a few um uh interest or inbounds uh almost every other week from uh kind of uh smaller players or companies and you know we are always assessing uh when the right fit uh is and and when it makes sense.\nSo u certainly like uh we are we're very open to it.\nUm a lot of it really comes down to um you know the comp um complimentary complimentary kind of strengths and and weaknesses and and sort of that match.\nUh but we are actually uh seeing a lot of M\n\n\nM&A activity and interest kind of boiling in the market across within our industry. Just because I have you here and I get to ask you this by M&A activity bubbling up. Is anyone trying to buy you or is this all companies that are reaching out to you as a possible acquirer?\nUm, it's the latter. Yes.\nOkay. Any names that I think it would be wise to say that curiosity, it wouldn't be wise to say those things, but you know, um, but let's just say like many, many players are interested in joining forces with sort of leading companies and so forth.\nSo, um, you know, I think like any other category, right? Like, um, there's a lot of enthusiasm, there's a lot of interesting players that have different techniques and different bets that they make, and at some point you expect like, you know, there will be some sort of consolidation, and um, and I think, um, now that the markets are more opening up for M&A, I think we we are feeling it, we're seeing that through just like all kind of movements.\nAbsolutely.\nNow, one thing that I was surprised by, just given how well the company appears to be doing from where I sit, is that at least publicly, you guys haven't gone back to the capital markets and and raised more. Uh, is that simply because you've been running the company pretty efficiently?\nYes, that's right.\nUm, we've, um, you know, uh, we've, um, we've generally ran the company fairly conservatively when it comes to capital and efficiency and things like that. And, um, and we really wanted to be very sure and intentional, um, you know, when we go into kind of data services market that we are going to enter to win and have all the key components and kind of capabilities needed for us to kind of demonstrate that.\nI mean, just over a year ago, we were not doing anything in this space entirely, and um, and so in just like last four or less than four quarters now that we are plugged into all these labs and we are getting winning the market share from kind of the other providers, um, is really exciting, and I think, you know, we are, uh, we might, you know, we might do something in in the future.\nSo, one thing that struck me as interesting about your background is that you've worked with drones before and uh, kind of a tangentially related point. I was also surprised to see that Uber is getting into the the data labeling game in a more serious way. What's going on with people that deal with real world hardware systems getting into the the data side of AI?\nWhat should we take away and learn from that?\nU Alex, so um, I've been very interested in technology across the board. And so when I was in school, I actually was uh doing a lot of research in uh neural networks. In fact, uh I remember my earliest times was I was trying to make flight control system in airplanes um like powered by neural networks, and you wouldn't believe like at that time the neural networks were like three or four layers and you could count the neurons in mat lab and simulink, and you know, it's just a testament on how fast the technology has moved just from like a decade ago.\nUm, and so, um, so in in engineering, of course, you know, a lot of my work was in genetic algorithms and like these algorithms to optimize things, and so a lot of my interest kind of um, I suppose, um, when I was in software technology startups in Silicon Valley, drone deploy and planet labs, I saw computer vision starting to take off, and then I sort of like all these things kind of came to me and say like, hey, you know, I would love to build a company here, um, and I think there's an opportunity to build some enduring company that kind of sits in between this what we call AI and and humans.\nUm, I do think that you know, over the next few like like we are going to we're moving into a world where we will be steering multiple if not millions of AIs, and we would still want to be able to manage them and um, kind of keep them aligned, and I do believe that to do that, you still have to talk to the AI in some fashion, and uh, and that data interface uh, is essentially what LabelBox is trying to build, and the techniques and all these like details will continue to evolve.\nOf, um, you know, just how like the labeling has changed over the last six years. I think it will be very different in the next few years too, but I think the intrinsic need to continue to manage the AIs will remain the same. Um, and so we are kind of at that frontier and always, you know, want to build awesome tools and services there on at that layer.\nMono, if I'm tracking you correctly, you're saying that the way to speak with or interact with AI models is essentially through bringing them data. Is that correct?\nThat's right.\nThat's right.\n100%.\nThe um, the way you um, uh, ensure AIs are uh, behaving the way you want it to do or is representing your businesses or is performing, you know, certain agentic tasks, you still want some checks and balances, you still want some, you know, evaluation data sets to, you know, test it before you roll things out or when, uh, when things go wrong, when exceptions happen, uh, you want to be able to have some sort of a human in the loop to make that sort of, uh, judgment like, hey, why did it got wrong and how how to teach it to get better.\nAnd, um, you know, I think we are very early in the innings of, um, like, you know, uh, in in AI adoption. I think is going to power a ton of the economy over the years, and there's going to be just um, um, insatiable appetite for new forms of data that uh, ultimately represents humans, uh, human preferences and human intent to um, to trans translate that to AI systems.\nMonet, thank you so much.\nUm, what's the URL and where can people find you on the internet?\nUm, so um, uh, labelbox.com.\nI'm actually not as po kind of present in on the social media, but uh, you could probably find me on LinkedIn, old school guy, and uh, and on Twitter, I have a handle manuero manuero.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWell, please enjoy Stanford in mystead.\nI miss California.\nBonnie will have you back on in a couple months.\nAppreciate you.\nAwesome.\nThank you for having me, Alex.\nToday we have another TWiST500 interview for you.\nToday we're not talking about just LLMs up in the cloud.\nNo, we're going to go back to planet Earth and talk about physical things, robots.\nBut not just robots.\nMy favorite subcategory of that group.\nIt is humanoid robots.\nThere's a lot of companies working on this space.\nEveryone from Tesla down to a number of startups.\nAnd they're making really big progress, moving us towards a world in which we are not as reliant on human labor as we are today, but instead can ask our friendly robots to do some stuff for us.\nSo, please join me in welcoming to the show.\nIt's Jeff Cardinz from Apptronik.\nJeff, how you doing?\nI'm doing pretty good.\nThanks for having me on.\nI want to point out that I did ask about the cactus and his background before we started.\nAnd he said, quote, \"It's a Texas thing.\"\nSo, I didn't know that, but Jeeoff, I do love to learn and I'm glad you've taught me about I guess Austin based botany.\nIs it actually a Texas thing or is that uh more of a you thing?\nWell, I think what I said was I'm from Texas, so we have to represent.\nUh, but no, it was a joke.\nWe uh Texans are very proud of being from Texas, though, so I like to\nI have noticed that.\nI have noticed that.\nAll right.\nSo, Apptronik is a company that's been on my radar for years now.\nI think pretty much since you guys announced Apollo, that was back in 2023.\nIt is your humanoid robot.\nI think it's 5'8 in about 160 lb, can carry about 55 lbs, and has a relatively smiley and and happy demeanor to it.\nSo, just to start, um, what did I miss there and what has changed in the Apollo model since, uh, it was first announced?\nYeah, I think I mean, I think you covered the basics pretty well there.\nUm, we've made a lot of robots, particularly a lot of humanoids since we got started.\nWe're on our 15th iteration of uh, robots since we got started.\nWe've done about 10 iterations of humanoids.\nI think, you know, the key thing for us is really a much more robust version.\nSo the first version that we showed of Apollo 1 was uh really an engineering prototype, not designed for mass manufacturing.\nWe only made a handful of those systems.\nWe have the new version of Apollo.\nApollo 2 is now built and online in the lab.\nMuch more robust, uh much more scalable, really wins in every sort of performance category we care about.\nStill roughly targeted the same payload, little bit larger battery to achieve that 4hour runtime that we're targeting.\nA lot of times there's a caveat in robotics where if you look at runtime of the robot, it depends on what it's doing.\nSo if you're living, you know, lifting peak loads the whole time, you're going to get one run time versus you're doing something light duty.\nUh so we've we've learned a bunch from Apollo 1 and then poured that all into Apollo 2.\nBut we'd already done a lot of humanoids.\nhad a pretty good perspective of what we wanted to build and Apollo at the time was the robot that we always wanted to build and really just continuing in the same legacy that we started with.\nSo, you said the word robust a couple times.\nI'm curious what that means in a robotic context.\nDoes that mean just literally more more durable or does that mean uh just more capable of a wider array of of tasks?\nI'd say both.\nYou can think of the you know the hardware is you don't want to be hardware limited, right?\nSo you need a stable platform that you can train and build models on top of.\nSo if the robot's breaking every you know day or for you know whatever uh your meantime between failure is you can only make so much progress.\nThere's a huge overhead cost of maintaining unstable hardware.\nSo sort of the foundational thing you have to get right in this space is you need a stable platform that you can build on top of.\nAnd once you have a stable hardware platform you can start to build more.\nyou can make them more affordable and cheaper, but kind of that's the base case thing that you need.\nAnd these humanoids are are pretty complex as you as you really dive into it.\nSo that was the key thing we wanted from the next version is a really stable, robust platform to build on.\nSo going from Apollo 1 to Apollo 2, is Apollo 2 sufficiently robust and and market ready to kind of go past the the testing stage with partners?\nAnd we can talk a little bit about with whom you're working in a second, but is Apollo 2 a robot that you're ready to kind of take to market in numbers?\nI mean, I think we're probably going to build, you know, in the hundreds of Apollo twos.\nSo, I would say we're still going to be piloting.\nI've tried to be very honest about where I think the humanoid market is at overall.\nYou know, the the thing I like to point out is humanoids are something that humans have been thinking about for thousands of years.\nYou know, we conceived of humanoid robots before we conceived of computers.\nYeah.\nIdeal that we could build, you know, mechanical machines that could do things we didn't want to do.\nAnd and we're at the very front end of the humanoid market overall.\nAnd so, we're still going to be piloting for all intents and purposes for the next year.\nAnd we're going to be learning a lot from these pilots as they advance.\nAnd I think it's important to sort of define what we mean by a pilot.\nUh because everyone defines this differently, but yes, we're not at the point where we have a turnkey humanoid that you can drop into your environment and you can just pay it to do work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nI would argue that nobody has that yet, though I think we're there's several companies that are really on the path to get there.\nSo, I still think of Apollo 2 as the next generation of system that is out in the world.\nIt's doing meaningful work, but we're still learning a lot from it.\nI we don't have it dialed in.\nWe're ready to start building tens of thousands of these things just yet.\nYeah.\nWell, there there's a range there between can drop it in can do anything and needs to be hardcoded to lift a box.\nSo can you just for me who's not spending every day in the lab in the warehouse watching these things grow and develop how far along is Apollo 2 compared to I don't know a human laborer in a warehouse setting or in say a factory setting\nso I think the days of hard coding something to uh you pick up a box those days are over right so we we have reached this inflection point not just in humanoid uh robotics but in robotics as a whole to where it's very clear that learning is going to be the future so really everyone's that's why there's so much excitement andor hype depending on you know how you think about it is because there's this paradigm shift in the way that we can train robots all together and learning is clearly the winner and and the new paradigm I think what we're working on now is as we get the ability to do these tasks we're starting to climb the ladder towards task mastery out in the wild so can we actually start to do these tasks at the same rate that a human can do them and in that it depends on the task that we're working on.\nSo, we're working on a range of different tasks and we're not as fast as a human today.\nSo, I'm not going to make that claim.\nThere's narrow portions of a task or a use case that we can start to approach parody with humans.\nBut if you look at the range of things that are involved in even a single use case, we can't do everything at rate uh for a human.\nAnd so, this is the work that we're doing is we're climbing this ladder of performance uh towards task mastery.\nDoes it matter if a humanoid robot can be at par with humans for a task at speed?\nBecause my thinking is if you can take a humanoid robot and plop it in where you had a human, it can work not 24 hours a day, but call it 22 hours of the day.\nSo like it has more capacity to do more total time at work.\nSo does it need to be at the same kind of speed par?\nNo, it doesn't.\nThat's a great point.\nI think that's uh something that some folks get confused about.\nNo, it doesn't.\nIt depends on the application though.\nSo, you know, at the end of the day, it's simple ROI math, right?\nIs how much does the robot cost relative to what you\n\n\nAre you paying today to do a task? And then what's the rate of that system? And you're just going to do a calculation to determine is the ROI better and sort of moving to this new technology or should we stick to the same thing we're doing today? In many cases, the interesting thing is that businesses don't have that decision to make because there's a massive labor shortage. So they don't, you know, this idea of do I stick with what I have today? It's like, well, I have a huge shortage and this is a big challenge and a big pain. And so this shift towards technology to humanoids is very interesting. But some of these tasks run already today, three shifts a day. So they're running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So there's not that bleed over time that you're talking about where if the robot was half the price, you could put, you know, less robots and let it run more robots and let it run longer. Um, so it depends on the application, but there are plenty of applications that might be two shifts a day where you could let the robots run longer or you could throw more robots at the application, have twice the robots running and you could still accomplish the same effective amount of work. Uh, so yeah, that's interesting.\n\nOn the ROI point, I just did some quick Googling and uh I I live near Massachusetts and apparently according to the internet, Amazon warehouse workers in Massachusetts make about 16 bucks an hour. So, when I consider ROI for a humanoid robot that might go in and take on a task where you can't find a human, um, should I be considering like the value output of that humanoid has to be at least like X dollars per hour and kind of set that rate compared to human wages? I guess my question, Jeeoff, is that just feels a little outdated to me as a concept. And so, I wonder if I'm chasing the rabbit down the wrong hole here.\n\nI think that's the simplest way of viewing it, but it all depends on really what, you know, what customers are interested in. So there's a whole component where a lot of times in logistics and other things, you might have a line that's actually doing the work that's kitting or sorting something. Then you might have a quality control line where you have a separate process where you're checking to make sure things are done properly. There's opportunities where you can have a robot do both of those things at the same time. And so then you can look at that equation differently. There's also sort of fully burdened labor rate. If you look at many of these applications, we're looking at about a $25 an hour fully burdened rate where uh you have overhead. Sometimes in logistics, you're paying temp agencies for many of these workers. Um and they're trying to flex up and flex down depending on the total work that's needed. And so you sort of have to take this holistic picture where it's maybe very rudimentary, but sort of coming in if you're way out of the ballpark. If you're $40 an hour compared to this $16 an hour, you're just not in the game. Uh but there are more sophisticated ways of looking at it and it depends on the customer really.\n\nYeah, fully burdened labor costs if you've never had an employee might not make sense to you, but if you've had an employee, you know exactly what we're talking about. Um I want to talk about Google DeepMind though. Guys announced a partnership with them. Google, of course, is deep in the AI game. I was watching F1 this weekend and they had written Gemini on every single thing they could. And so I'm I'm kind of curious what that partnership unlocks for Apptronik. Is it just a lot of like help support? Is it just cheaper model access? Are you guys collaborating directly on feeding in, you know, your data into their systems? What does that look like and how does it help?\n\nYeah. Well, I think it's interesting if you look at, you know, and Google working together. I've I've characterized this as the space race of our time and it just so happened you have Apollo and Gemini uh kind of teaming up here. We didn't plan that uh you know that working out that way. But you know my view is is this is something that humans have been thinking about for thousands of years and if we really want to solve it we need the best people in the world working together on this. I think there's another story which is if you look at the east verse the west if you look at you know what's happening in China relative to what's happening in the west I think that's an another thread that we could pull but my view coming into this was you know this is the future I've dreamed about since I was a kid and now that we're in the window to make it happen we we don't want to have an ego about doing everything we want to work with the best teams in the world that are sort of mission aligned in terms of what we're trying to do and and for us it was very clear that, you know, Google really had the legacy uh and the scale to really help us make a dent and really make some progress here. So, what we're doing is a range of things. We're working together in a very deep way. Uh Google's a big investor in Apptronik as well, and we're really working together to try to push, you know, the boundaries of what's possible here, really push the industry forward. So them on the model side, us on the platform side, uh, but then really coming together and testing this out in the world, um, and getting it out, you know, from the lab out into the real world, hopefully in a really big way.\n\nDoes it also imply that Google might become an Abronic customer at some point in time in the future because they have a lot of facilities, data centers, like they have a lot of physical inventory that they have to take care of.\n\nI think the sky's is the limit. You know, it's still early in terms of our engagement together. We've been working together for about a year. Uh we have a lot of respect for what they're doing, not just the technology they have, but the way that they've done it. I think if you think about things like AI safety and other things, I think it's going to be even more important as you start to put this on a highly capable uh dextrous humanoid robot. And I've always respected the way that they've handled this. And so, um you know, we'll see. The the partnership's still pretty early on. We still got a lot to prove on our side as well. Uh but yeah, the sky's is the limit in terms of uh what we can do together.\n\nWell, just as a small aside, as you approach commercial viability over the next year, I really would love to stay as a breast as possible of what you guys are working on. So, please keep me in the loop because it sounds like this is the kind of rubber meets the road moment of all the work that has come before and now, you know, you're out in the field actually testing and trying things. But Jeeoff, you're not the only one. You mentioned China earlier. Uh I've been thinking a lot about competitiveness between our nation and our economic and political rivals over in uh in China. Now I think everyone watching this is familiar with a number of American human robotic companies figure etc. Uh where does China stack up compared to us in terms of their similar projects and um do you think we're going to be leading at the national level or do we have some catching up to do?\n\nI think we're leading today. Um you know the the US made early bets in the humanoid space. We did something called the DARPA robotics challenge in 2013 to 2015. So we injected you know call it 100 million plus into this sector over a decade ago. Uh Google itself actually made big investments in the humanoid space almost a decade ago as well. They bought up a lot of humanoid companies and really um injected a lot of capital into the space even then. So, we've had a head start in this space, but China's going to be a real contender, and they're moving very quickly, and they have a national strategy, which is something we don't have yet. We're working on this today. Uh, but they, you know, they're several years into their national strategy. They also just announced a 1 trillion yuan national fund to fund their domestic robotics ecosystem. That's about 138 billion. Uh for those that want to do don't want to do the math uh or the you know the conversion just divide by six and a half it's close enough.\n\nYeah. So I mean they're they're going to be a real force and I think they have the supply chain and they have the manufacturing prowess and they have the will to do it right. This is society transforming technology. Think about what an economy is. An economy is productivity per person. Change the number of productive units in an economy, you change what an economy is, right? And so, um, this is something that we really need to take seriously and that we need to really compete. And one of the things I think the Chinese are doing well is they're working together. So, so much of what I hear in Western media is this focus on competition. How do we stack up versus Tesla or any of the other groups that we're competing against? And if you look at the Chinese, they're sharing data, they're sharing models, they're really working together with sort of a national strategy. Um, and so I think that's something that we really need to think about as we sort of play this out because the implications are going to be really big as we move ahead. But there are some great companies over there and they're moving quickly. So I don't disagree from a high level about your point about sharing data, working together, moving ahead as a group, but also your last round was 350 million plus another 50 and change that came on. There's a lot of money behind you expecting you to win. How do we balance the power of private investment and freerange capitalism with the idea of sharing and being a little bit more collaborative because to me those seem to be at odds with one another. But if there is a way to to move forward faster as a national industry, I I would love to hear it. Jeeoff.\n\nYeah. Well, I mean I think I should say we're playing to win. You know, we've been at this for a very long time. I think you know this is we talked about the partnerships that we have um but I do think there are things we can work together on for example we worked with groups like agility and Boston dynamics uh pushing a national robotics strategy that's something where a rising tide lifts all boats we should be both sort of funding at the R&amp;D level sort of more investment in research labs and other areas this is what something that China's done a good job of and we should also be encouraging uptake of robotics nationally. Uh this is a challenge that we've had sort of broadly in the US is sort of uptake of automation overall across a variety of different sectors. And so these are areas that we can work together on that we can help push together. And you know, we're still going to be competing as fiercely as anybody else. Uh but you know, where we can find ways to work together, we should.\n\nTrying to avoid politics as much as possible. I'm going to phrase this in a way that I think you can respond. It doesn't seem like right now there's a rising appetite at the federal level to invest in basic R&amp;D. Is that something that could slow down aggregate improvement in the American humanoid robotics industry or is that actually not a concern in this particular domain?\n\nI mean the simple answer is yes. I think if you look at just competitively US versus China, you know, if they're going to pour $138 billion into their sector, you know, what's our answer to that, right? And so people talk about the money that us or figure have raised, but if you compare that, you know, it's a drop in the bucket and you know, we do have, you know, Tesla that has a significant balance sheet, uh, and we have others. Uh, but I do think at the fundamental level, we're still early days for humanoids. things, batteries, motors, uh all sorts of, you know, areas of fundamental research that we want to advance. And so, you know, my view is is that's maybe that's not where this administration wants to play. So, then let's look at other areas that are going to be important. Let's focus on the uptake and the adoption of these robots across different sectors. How do we incentivize businesses if they're going to compete globally and we're going to reshore manufacturing? How do we incentivize those businesses to buy American robots? This is an area that I think that they can and will play. So, you know, it's early days, right? This is think of this is the 1980s for personal computers or something like that. Uh where it's the beginning of a major industry. I think we're at the front end of a 40-year cycle here uh in robotics. And so, um, there's a lot of different ways that we can build and grow this sector as we move ahead.\n\nIf we're going to make fun analogies, I I have to make one in return. So, does that mean with us being in the 1980s equivalent of the PC era, today humanoid robotics, does that make the Apollo 1 like the Commodore 64 of humanoid robotics? Like, where would you rank it compared to the historical progression in PCs?\n\nI mean, I hope it's like the Apple 2, right? Well, I was going to say the the Apollo 2 is going to be like the Apple 2. I was trying to throw you a bone.\n\nYeah. Yeah. No, I mean, look, I I think, you know, these analogies don't hold perfectly, but I do think the PC analogy is the best analogy. I sort of characterize traditional industrial robots like mainframe computers. And you can think of humanoid robots as effectively the personal computer. My view is that humanoid robots are the best chance for robotics to scale beyond the limited applications that they're in to the broader market as a whole. We need this generalpurpose platform that's much more versatile than these than these robots that we had in the past. And if you sort of take that analogy, I think it's important to point out that it's early days. I think 50 years from now, there's these debates in humanoids that I sort of get a kick out of that are like, are humanoids hype? Are they reality? You know, is it actually going to be next year? or is it going to be two years? And it's like in the grand scheme of things, nobody's going to care if it's plus or minus two years. My investors certainly care and I try to be very sort of honest about where I think we're at. But I think we have reached this inflection point and I think 50 years from now,\n\n\nEveryone's going to be telling their grandkids about being alive at the time when humanoid robots came about and all of the ways that the world changed and improved as we sort of rolled these out into broader society.\nYou know, they're also coming at a great time because as the world ages, we need more caretakers and so forth.\nAnd, you know, that's going to, I think, open up a lot of spaces for this kind of labor over the next 15 to 20 years, which is long enough to get it right in my view.\nAll right.\nUh, Jeff, just one more before I let you go.\nYou guys are building in Austin, Texas.\nWe started the show with that with a little bit of a joke, but honestly, there has been a lot of folks that are moving to the Texas area to build hardware companies.\nAlso, a lot in Southern California, especially in a defense context.\nI'm curious why the company picked Austin and um has it proved to be net accredited to the business to be in uh the little blue dot in the middle of a sea of red.\nYeah.\nUm you know, I mean, we we picked Austin because we're from Austin.\nSo, we we spun out of the University of Texas at Austin.\nHookum.\nUm\nOh, sorry.\nI had it backwards.\nThere you go.\nYeah, hook them.\nClose enough.\nUm but you know, my my thesis was though I sort of looked at what I called the new economy in Texas.\nAnd you know, we are traditionally an oil and gas state.\nOne of the ways I've sort of explained is you can think of us like Saudi Arabia where or the Middle East where it's not just that we want new industries, we're going to need them over some time period.\nAnd we have this legacy industry that's been built up.\nAnd so my thesis coming out of grad school was that robotics was going to change.\nAI was going to make a big impact in what robots were going to do.\nAnd we were going to need major domestic robotics companies, major domestic OEMs.\nAnd the options were really the east coast in Boston or the west coast in California.\nAnd for a number of reasons, I always believe that Texas was the best choice out of all of those.\nI think in robotics, geography matters, right?\nWe can we have the Texas Mexico corridor component manufacturing and things that are going to be very difficult to do here in the US can be done in Mexico.\nWe can build a supply chain up where we can leverage the existing uh automotive supply chain in Mexico into robotics and then we can get anywhere in the US in less than 24 hours.\nAnd so this was my thesis 10 years ago was that Austin would be the place to build this kind of company.\nThis was prior to Tesla and many of these other groups moving to Austin.\nAnd I think it's been a good bet overall.\nSo I think Texas still remains a good bet.\nUh it's still early in the Texas uh in sort of story if you think about tech and you think about Austin where it's going to go.\nBut yeah, it's been great for us and it's been awesome to see, you know, all the folks move here.\nAnd it's been really interesting to see these bets that you have when you don't know any better as a graduate student uh actually start to pay off where people are starting to talk about Austin and humanoid robots and you know uh we were we were kind of right about some of the bets we made early on and we'll we'll see how it develops.\nSee everyone, it's not just podcasters in Austin.\nThere's a lot more going on there.\nUh Jeff, thank you so much.\nAnd by the way, when you do ship my Apollo 2, u my address, I'll just text it to your team and you can just have it delivered whenever you want.\nNo worries.\nAppreciate it.\nYeah, sounds good.\nAll right, Jeff, what is the website?\nAnd uh quickly before you go, a role that you're hiring for, you're having a hard time landing the right uh person.\nUh the website is Apptronik.com.\nApr.com and we're always hiring technical talent.\nSo all across the engineering stack, if you're a great engineer, you want to build the future, uh you want to do it in a way that is designed uh to have the best future for humans, then you should come work for us and come check out what we're doing at Appronic.\nAll right, thanks Jeeoff.\nTalk to you soon.\nThanks for having me.\nThanks.\n",
