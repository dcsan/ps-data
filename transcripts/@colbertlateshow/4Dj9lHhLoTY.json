  "cleanText": "[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nGive it up for Louis Cato, the Lacatio man.\nThere you go, friends, folks.\nFolks, before we go on, I just want to say, I hope, have a seat, y'all.\nI hope you had a chance, I hope all of you had a chance to see my interview with Waqen Phoenix earlier this week.\nHe famously doesn't do interviews like this.\nSo, it was great to have him here.\nI truly enjoyed it, and he is such a good actor that I believe he enjoyed it, too.\nAnd great news, we have even more because he was brave enough to face the Colbear questionnaire.\nI've had dozens of celebrities sit right over there and take this soul-penetrating quiz, but I've never seen anyone struggle so earnestly with the question, apples or oranges.\nYou're going to want to strap in for that one.\nBy the time it was over, we had recorded the longest Colbear questionnaire in history.\nI want the record.\nSo, hey, I have some great news for you.\nHis Colbear questionnaire ran so long, we could not fit it into our show, and I'm not sure we can even fit it into the internet, but we're going to try.\nGo to our YouTube page, which is probably down here right now, and check it out, y'all.\nFolks, my first guest tonight, my first guest tonight spent two decades as a congressman from California, where he served as an impeachment manager and sat on the January 6 committee.\nJust last fall, he was elected to the Senate.\nPlease welcome back to The Late Show, Senator Adam Schiff.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nGood to see you again.\nIt's been a bit since the last time you were here.\nYou elected, you got elected to the Senate.\nYou're welcome.\nAnd it's called the, it's called by the Co Bear Bump.\nYou remember that?\nThat's the bump.\nAbsolutely.\nUm, when you visit the red districts in your state, do you, do you ever think the people there are ever surprised that you are not, uh, the shrieking demon that Donald Trump portrays you as?\nOh, absolutely.\nI asked for a position on the agriculture committee.\nWe're the number one egg-producing state of the union, but we haven't had a senator on a in 30 years.\nAnd part of the reason I wanted to do it is this is a super important industry for the state, for the country.\nUm, but also because it would give me a window into what the deep red parts of California are like, what folks are thinking, how I can serve them, how I can relate to them.\nAnd on one of my visits recently to, but in the far northeast of the state, it's part of California that wants to secede and become its own red state.\nUm, I met with the Farm Bureau, uh, very conservative group in, in that conservative part of the state, and I could tell they were kind of standoffish, a little suspicious.\nWhat did this big city Democrat want?\nMeeting with the But Carney Farm Bureau.\nUh, and after a while, you know, they warmed up.\nI said, \"Look, I'm just here to learn.\nI want to represent you.\nI want to fight for you in the Senate.\"\nUh, and by the end of the meeting, I could tell I'd made progress because one of the farmers turned to me and said, \"I don't know why the president calls you watermelon head.\nYou have a perfectly normal-sized head.\"\nAnd, and Stephen, that's how we do it.\nThat's how we bridge the gap, one inch at a time.\nYes.\nWe, we, one watermelon head at a time.\nWe, we come to agreement on the size of my head.\nAnd, uh, well, you, you spent so much time investigating Donald Trump and sounding the alarm on his misdeeds, the, the Russell collusion, impeachment, January 6th.\nI mean, and obviously you love your state, you respect the, the, the people in your state.\nUm, what, what do you, there are parts of your state that went for Donald Trump during this last election.\nWhat do you think that they didn't hear from you?\nWhat do you think that they didn't see that other people saw in those that first term?\nWell, you know, one of the, the, uh, things that's apparent as I visit these deep red parts of California is, you know, there's a cultural divide as there is in much of the country.\nUm, there are also divisions over real substantive issues in California, fights over water between farmers and between environmentalists.\nUh, but a big part of it, too, and this to me is maybe one of the most important takeaways is we just haven't competed there.\nWe haven't shown up there.\nWe haven't introduced ourselves.\nWe haven't tried to, uh, you know, make sure that people understand we want to represent them.\nUh, people aren't going to vote for you.\nThey're not going to support you if they think you look down on them or condescend to them or even worse, you're not interested and you're just indifferent to them.\nSo I think, um, all over the country, Democrats need to be pressing the case in every part of the country, realizing we're not going to win everyone over, but there are a lot of people we can win over.\nUh, they are surprised when they meet me.\nThey, they've seen this caricature of me on Fox.\nUh, they've heard, you know, only about me from the president.\nUh, and it's kind of a revelation when I don't turn out to have horns.\nSo, this is, you know, this is part of what I think it takes to compete.\nWe have to take a quick break.\nWe'll be right back with more Senator Adam Schiff.\nEverybody stick around.\n[Music]\nHey.\n[Applause]\n",
