  "cleanText": "Welcome to The Late Show, everybody. I'm your host Stephen Colbert. Look, I don't know.\n\nOh yeah. Hey friends. I don't know what you all are talking about, but everybody I talked to is talking about what Donald Trump doesn't want to talk about. So let's talk about it. It, uh, it being the conspiracy surrounding his old dancing buddy Jeffrey Epstein. There you go.\n\nFor years, for years before he was, you know, reelected and recently since they all got into office, a bunch of high-ranking people in Trump's administration have kept promising to release the files surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, his mysterious clients, and his suspicious death. But now, suddenly, for reasons that I legally cannot think of, Donald Trump seems desperate to stop us from knowing who Jeffrey Epstein's clients were.\n\nIn fact, yesterday he said he was surprised anyone even cares about the guy. Understand it, uh, why they would be so interested. He's dead for a long time. Uh, he was never a big factor in terms of life.\n\nThat sentence was never a big factor in terms of word.\n\nHe went on, \"I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff.\"\n\nYes.\n\nNo, he's right. The Epstein saga is a total snoozefest. I mean, the most powerful man in the world is blocking information about a cabal of the rich, the famous, and the royal, befriending a con man who regularly flies off in his private plane to his private island to do super illegal sex stuff. Then the con man is arrested. People are afraid he's going to name names, but before he can, he mysteriously dies right after being taken off a suicide watch in a federal prison during the administration of the guy who is blocking the release of the information. Boring.\n\n[Applause]\n[Laughter]\n\nSex, cults, and murder are famously dull. That's why they call that movie Eyes Wide Shut, cuz everyone was asleep. But if for some reason you're still interested in finding out who's on Epstein's list, don't be. I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by the Biden in, you know, uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sure you didn't quite catch that. What did he say again?\n\nBut he But he's lying, folks.\n\nThis morning, by this morning, Trump had enough of this nonsense. He drew a line in the sand for his supporters, posting in part, \"The radical left Democrats have hit pay dirt again. Their new scam is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein hoax, and my past supporters have bought into this bull hook, line, and sinker. I don't want their support anymore. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\" And no, folks, listen. If you insist on asking me about Jeffrey Epstein, please turn in your MAGA hat, your golden shoes, your golden watch, your Trump golden guitar, and also immediately delete any NFTs you have of me as laser eyes, Top Gun Moonman, or Outer Space Lion Tamer. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nThat's my favorite. Outer space. I can do that. I really can do that.\n\nYou can't build. You can l Thank you.\n\nYou can't you can't build a brand on conspiracy theories and then get mad when people are interested in your conspiracy theories. The same reason same reason Hooters had to drop their short-lived ad campaign. If you're not here for the food, please go home.\n\nSo, so\n\n[Applause]\n\nthey have buffalo wings. So\n\nTrump is trying to make this go away, but that's not going to be easy cuz in a new poll, just 3% of US adults say they're satisfied with the information released about Jeffrey Epstein. 3%.\n\nWhich means Trump's handling of the Epstein Files has the exact same rating as Battlefield Earth does on Rotten Tomatoes, which coincidentally is the movie Jeffrey Epstein was watching right before he killed himself. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Obviously, he didn't kill himself.\n\nAnd keep in mind, keep in mind, Trump has been talking about his ties to Epstein for decades. In 2002, he told New York magazine, \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with.\" It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. But once the world found out exactly what those women were on the younger side of, Trump changed his tune.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of Jeffrey Epstein. I didn't want anything to do with him. I was not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHey, I'm not a fan. He's the kind of terrific guy that I am not a fan of. He's a lot of fun to be with and I don't like that at all. It is even said It is even said that he is a fan of the kind of beautiful women that I am not a fan of. That's it's why I spent so much time with him and his sexy friends on the No Thank you Express last week. uh to quell the onslaught of demands for more of this information.\n\nThe FBI released a video of the outside of Epstein's prison cell. But instead of quashing the conspiracy theories, it just created more because the FBI admitted the video has a missing minute, which is concerning. Okay. But to kill a guy, you'd need like three times that.\n\nBy the way, last night, an analysis by Wired revealed that the video actually had nearly three minutes cut out. Three minutes. Three missing minutes. That's not the kind of thing that calms conspiracy theorists down. Guys, guys, don't worry. Okay, the FBI says there wasn't a a a shooter on the grassy null. Okay, but we have discovered three new nles.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGrassy, sticky, and bushy.\n\nPlus, despite the administration claiming it was raw footage, Wyatt found that the video had been stitched together in Adobe Premiere Pro from two video files. Yeah. See if you can spot the edit.\n\nGo to the further analysis showed that one of the source clips was approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds longer than the segment included in the final video. So follow me down the rabbit hole. What's 2 minutes and 53 seconds long? The song God Only Knows by the Beach Boys. Where do you find beaches? On islands. Who had a private island when he was alive? Marlon Brando, whose name is an anagram of Almond Baron. What are almonds? Nuts. What's also nuts? The Jeffrey Epstein scandal. What? Really?\n\nWhat really happened to Jeffrey Epstein? God only knows.\n\nIs this a dream? Am I dreaming? Am I awake?\n\nYesterday, Trump took a break from telling us how we shouldn't care about his mysterious dead pedophile buddy and paid a visit to Pennsylvania instead. He was there to celebrate new investments in AI energy projects. But things went off the rails pretty darn quick.\n\nWhen I first heard about AI, you know, it's not my thing. Although my uncle was at MIT, one of the great professors, 51 years, whatever he was, longest serving professor in the history of MIT, three degrees in uh nuclear, chemical, and math. That's a smart man.\n\nThat's a smart man. He also had six degrees of Kevin Bacon. It was like only man to ever have four. That's four right there. Brace yourself. Uh none of that was true. Uh Trump's uncle was an MIT professor, but he was not the longest serving ever. And his PhD was actually in electrical engineering. But I'll tell you what is true. We found this real picture of his uncle uh John Trump strapped into one of his marvelous machines.\n\nNow, I don't know what it does, but uh that photo is from 1950, so I believe it injects you with cigarettes.\n\nThen, you know, for funsies, I guess, he told everybody that his uncle taught the Unabomber.\n\nTed Kaczynski was one of his students. Do you know who Kaczynski was? There's very little difference between a mad man and a genius. But Kaczynski, I said, \"What kind of a student was he, Uncle John?\" Dr. John Trump. He said, \"What kind of a student?\" Manny said, \"Seriously good.\" He said he'd correct he'd go around correcting everybody. Now, I'm no Ted Kaczynski, but let me correct you right there. None of that is true either.\n\nKaczynski did not go to MIT. He went to Harvard. Yes, but sometimes old Ted would take the cross town bus over to MIT. Then he would go around correcting people. He'd say, \"I actually didn't go to school here. You know, you don't actually know me. I'm a figment of the imagination of your dumbest nephew.\"\n\nEven more insane.\n\nLet's all go to the lobby.\n\nLet's go.\n\nHa. Even more insane. Kaczynski wasn't IDed as the Unabomber until 1996, but Trump's uncle died in 1985.\n\nSo why on earth would Trump have asked his uncle about him? Hey, Uncle John. Uncle Professor Dr. John Trump. Professor, sir, uncle. You know that random guy who isn't famous at all and lives in the woods and machines his own screws.\n\nWhat was it like when you didn't teach him? We got a great show for you tonight. Owen Wilson will be taking the cold air questionnaire and I'll be talking to Dr. Francis when we come back.\n\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nYeah.\n",
