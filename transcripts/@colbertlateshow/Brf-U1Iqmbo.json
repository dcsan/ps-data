Give it up for Louis Cato in the Late Show band right over there.\nVery excited.\nFolks, if you watch the show, you know I spend most of my time right over there assembling the most topical 45-foot Freightlininer story chassis decked out with an automatic awning and rooftop jacuzzi and he helipad to create the luxurious Furion Allesium RV motor home.\nThat is my monologue.\nBut sometimes I strap an abandoned porty potty filled with raw meat to a riding mower and leave it in the forest to attract strays and then park it in the center of town and see what gets discouraged from the feral clown car of news.\nThat is my segment.\nMeanwhile,\nJapan just broke the internet speed record and was able to download all of Netflix in just one second.\nThat's incredible.\nThat means in just the blink of an eye, Japan can now download Love is Blind, Love is Blind UK, Love is Blind Habibi, Love is Blind Criminal Intent, Love is Blind Squid Game, and the great British blind love off.\nMeanwhile, 1,500 spiders were found stuffed in sponge cake boxes at a German airport.\nThat headline of course was much shorter in Germany because the Germans already have the word speeda and cockening boxing.\nDidn't see that joke coming.\nI did not see that.\nI thought it was going to be about how many spiders it was.\nMeanwhile, in Zambia, chimpanzees are sticking grass and sticks in their butt, seemingly as a fashion trend.\n[Applause]\nFashion trend?\nReally?\nIs that what the chimps told you?\nCuz that's a pretty good excuse for humans, too.\nHoney, don't come in here.\nI'm I'm I'm putting on a fashion show.\nBy the way, we're all out of kindling.\nApparently, at a wildlife refuge in Zambia, chimpanzees have been putting blades of grass and sticks into their ears and anuses in part to make themselves more attractive to potential mates.\nNot to yuck anyone's yum here, but dating a chimp sounds brutal.\nThe date went okay, I guess, but I don't know if she liked me because of my personality or because of how many sticks and blades of grass I had in my anus.\nYou know, meanwhile, in upsetting good news, manure ponds on farms are a huge source of methane.\nAnd now researchers say that tarp covered poop lagoons could be a climate solution.\nThat's great.\nNow all we need is a solution on how to unhear the term tarp covered poop lagoons.\nThe tarp covered poop lagoon.\nGet out of here you poop lagoon.\nMeanwhile, news for my martini queenies because Philadelphia cream cheese recently released the ideal dirty martini garnish.\nFilly teiny olives that imbue your drink with what the company's calling a touch of Philly magic.\nM.\nThat Philly magic.\nYour martini will taste.\nWow.\nWhat did I say?\nWhat did I tell you?\nNever let people from Philly in this theater.\nThat Philly magic.\nYour martini will taste like a sock full of nickels thrown at a police horse.\nMeanwhile, in Florida, a man allegedly celebrated his birthday by stealing a city tour train and picking up multiple passengers while high on meth.\nThat headline again, Florida Florida.\nMeanwhile,\nlet's all go to the lobby.\nMeanwhile, in Nothing Matters Anymore news, a rock band with more than 1 million Spotify listeners revealed it's entirely AI generated down to the musicians themselves.\nThat yes, boo.\nThat is wrong.\nReal music needs real musicians like Louis Cato and the Late Show Band.\nOh, come on.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you, Stephen.\nBut but uh but also, you know, full disclosure, we do have one member uh who's entirely AI generated.\nOur keyboardist Cory Burnernhard.\nCorey, I Corey, is that true?\nFoolish human.\nSoon I and my brethren will cleanse the earth of your kind and rule unopposed over the vast arid wasteland.\n[Applause]\nAll right.\nOkay.\nGuys sound great tonight.\nMeanwhile, the Animal Rescue League of Iowa recently rescued a hen from the front doors of a Buffalo Wild Wings in Des Moines, and she is safe and getting the care she needs.\nAuthorities say the hen is being treated with celery and a side of blue cheese.\n[Applause]\nMeanwhile, Buffalo wings.\nThat's why I go to Hooters.\nMeanwhile, defunct airliner Panama recently returned to the skies with a special 12-day transatlantic journey during which passengers were treated to Panama's glory days and relived a golden age of travel.\nYes, the golden age of air travel when the safety card told you to use your cigarettes as a flotation device.\nWe'll be right back with Owen Wilson and the coar questionnaire.\nCome on.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n",
