  "cleanText": "[Applause]\nWelcome back, everybody.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nyou know my next guest tonight from his\nbreakout role as the Chechen mobster\nNoho Hank in the HBO series Barry. He\nnow stars in Superman. Please welcome to\nThe Late Show, Anthony Carrigan.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nHey.\nHey.\nNice to meet you. I'm a fan\nof your work and I've only bumped into\neach other like on the red carpet or\nsomething like that.\nYeah, red carpet stuff. But\nthis is really lovely. Are you having\nfun with Superman?\nI'm having the best time with Super. I\nmean, it's Superman, you know, it's\nYes. Like,\nright. I want to talk about that before\nwe get. I do want to talk about No Hank. Here you go. This\nput you on a lot of people's radar. The\ncheerful mobster Noho Hank\nin Barry.\nThis is a fantastic show. Haters of\ncourse. Great.\nYou know, when you're doing a\nnew role, there's a point at which you go, I think\npeople might be watching the show. What\nwas that? What was that moment for you?\nWell, I mean, I think, you know, on my\nfirst day of filming, uh, I kind of knew\nthat we were on to something special,\nthat we were really kind of cooking with\nit because I mean, my first line was,\nyou know, hey man, right? And, uh, it\nwas the first thing that came\nout of my mouth on that show. And and\nbefore I knew, I just heard people\naround the set just being like, \"Hey,\nman.\" you know, and then even like as I\nwas getting miked up, like the sound guy\nwould just, you know, just under his\nbreath, he was like, man, you know, so\nyeah, I was like I was like, \"Okay, this\nis cool. Maybe I'm not getting\nfired today.\" You know?\nUh, I've never worked with Bill Hader.\nI've had him on as a guest. We've had\nwe've had fun doing games and stuff like\nthat. He seems like a nice guy to work\nwith. What was that like?\nHe's a lovely guy. I mean, he's the\nbest. He's the best guy to work for,\nwork with. Um and I, you know, he's\nobviously he's like so funny and such a\nlegend. So, I really kind of took pride\nin in uh getting getting him to break,\nyou know. Okay.\nAnd um Yeah. So, but the funny thing is\nBill wouldn't like he wouldn't be able\nto look at you. So, that the tell\nwould be like, you know, we'd be doing a\nscene, right? And then you just see like\nthe cameras on on me and then he would\njust turn away\nand then I would just see his shoulders\ngo like that. And I knew and I knew I\ngot him as soon as I saw as soon as I\nsaw that the saw the shoulder\nshoulder bumps. Yeah. I knew I got them.\nEverybody I knew in comedy loved\nthat show. Did you run into fans in the\nwild?\nYeah. I mean, a lot of people would just\nscream my lines at me. So that was\nreally sweet. I mean, yeah, you know,\nthis that show is so special and just in\nso many ways. So yeah, tons tons of\nfans. I mean, still.\nAny people you were fans of? Because\nthat's the great thing is that when they\nrealize, oh my god, this person that I\nlove liked what I did, that's just it's\nalmost you don't know what to do with\nthat feeling.\nYou don't know. Yeah. You really don't\nknow what to do. Um Jeff Bridges\nOh.\ngot to meet Jeff Bridges, you know, and\nactually Bill\nI Yeah. No, he's the dude. I mean Yeah.\nUm\nyou know, when Bill told me that that he\nwas a fan of the show, I was so I mean I\nwas like over the moon.\nUh and the way he said it too, you know,\nhe he said something sweet. He's like,\n\"Yeah, where'd you get that bald guy,\nman?\"\nYou know, yeah, that, you know, that\nthat bald guy is great, man.\nWell, you've been very open about your\nalopecia, which causes sort of the\nradical hair loss. What was it like like\nstarting out in an industry that puts\nsuch a premium on uh sort of like uh\nstandard normative looks?\nFor sure. Sure. Well, I mean it was\nobviously like quite a journey because\nwhen I had it, you know, I had it since\nI was a kid and I I would cover it up\nbecause it was it was just spots at that\ntime. Uh so it started as something\nthat, you know, I would cover up. I had\na lot of shame over, didn't really, you\nknow, like anyone knowing that I had\nalipcia. And then getting into the\nindustry, obviously I chose the right\nindustry to, you know, get into. But um\neventually like I got to the place where\nyou know after being told I was never\ngoing to act again and um\nreally they said you should get out.\nOh fully get out. Yeah. You're never\ngoing to act again. You're not\nattractive anymore. You should stop. And\nthis was when my when my hair was just\nreally going. So you know I I found\nsomething within myself this kind of\nself-acceptance that I'd never had as a\nkid. And and now I mean that's like my\nsuperpower. So yeah.\nWell, you got another superpower.\nYou got another superpower.\nRight.\nI didn't even mean to segue.\nOh, it's a perfect segue. You should do\nthis job. You got another superpower in\na movie called Superman.\nUm, uh, you play a superhero who was in\nthe comic books but has never been\nrepresented on screen before.\nYeah.\nTell them what your name of your\ncharacter is.\nUh, character's name is Metamorpho.\nAnd what what do we what do we have\nhere? So,\nright here is the um the the first\nappearance of Metamorpho. Uh and this\nwas actually gifted to me by the\nwonderful iconic\nStephen Root, perhaps like one of the\nbest uh character actors ever to live.\nTremendous.\nAnd he we we're out at Muso and Frank\njust kind of having a couple martinis\nand and he he gave this to me when he\nfound out that I booked a part. This is\nThis is 60 years old.\nIt's I mean it's incredible. It's in\nsuch perfect condition.\nJanuary of of '65. Um you uh we have a\nclip from the movie. Anything we need to\nknow about what we're about to see?\nWell, this is a scene in which you know\nyou first see Metamorpho\nand what does he do? What's the power?\nHe can change him. He's also known as\nthe element man. So he can change\nhimself into any element, right?\nIncluding kryptonite. So yeah. So he's\ngot Superman.\nHe's a good guy. Is he a good guy or\nhe's a good guy in a compromised\nposition though? So\nlike no ho hank.\nYeah, but a bit. Yeah, typ casting, you\nknow.\nYeah, exactly.\nAll right, so you and Superman are here\ntogether.\nWe're here together and uh Yeah, I'll\nsay things are rather intense.\nI can't make a son.\nI know. I can only make something kind\nof like a sun. What? All right.\nOkay. Okay. We got hydrogen and dutium\nand we got helium and\nWhat are you doing? Hey. Hey. No. No.\nStop.\nNo. You're You're going to get all of us\nin trouble.\nBro, what are you doing? Stop.\nHe's doing something in here.\nHe's doing something.\nOh, you are not going to take me for\nthis. I am the one that saw first.\nYeah.\nThese two are going to get\nThanks so much for being here. Anthony\nSuperman is in theaters now. Anthony\nCarrigan, everybody.
