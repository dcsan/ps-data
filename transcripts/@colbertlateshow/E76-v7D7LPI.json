  "cleanText": "Senator, you know who this is, everybody.\nThis is California Senator Adam Schiff.\nOkay, we're six months into President Trump's second term.\nHow's it different this time?\n\nFundamentally, it's different because President Trump was much less successful in the first term in creating a climate of fear.\nUm, this is what he's after.\nHe wants to make the law firms afraid.\nHe wants to make universities afraid.\nHe wants to make immigrants afraid.\nHe wants to make citizens afraid.\nHe wants to make news organizations CBS and Paramount afraid.\nHe wants to make ABC afraid.\nAnd he is succeeding.\nAnd more than anything else, he wants to make Republicans in Congress afraid because he wants them to do his will.\nHe wants the judges to be afraid.\nAfraid they'll get impeached if they cross him.\nAfraid for their own personal safety if they cross him.\nUh he wants to create a climate of fear, and he has done so in six months, which is radically different than the first term.\nIn part it's different because in the first term there were at least some people to stand up to him, the Secretary Mattis's, the John Kelly's and others that had some stature who were willing to say, \"Mr. President, that's a stupid ass idea or that's an unlawful idea or I'm not going to go along with that idea.\"\nUm, and also he didn't think he was going to win, I don't think, and so they didn't have a plan in place.\n\nYes.\n\nSo last night the Senate passed something called a recision bill.\nI've never heard of a recision bill.\nIt sounds like a court-ordered appendecttomy.\nCan you explain what is a recision bill?\nWhat does it do to Congress?\n\nYeah.\nWell, first there's the big ugly bill, which was another term that probably many people hadn't heard of called reconciliation, where they massively cut health care and they cut food for hungry kids to fund a tax cut for rich people, but not content with that and the harms that's going to cause.\nThey decided they want a lot of little ugly bills.\nAnd this recision bill is a little ugly bill.\nIt's like a mini reconciliation bill.\nIt, like the reconciliation bill, only requires 50 votes and the VP, and they can cut further.\nSo, in this bill that we voted on up till about three in the morning last night, they cut um funding for AIDS and tuberculosis and malaria and public broadcasting and NPR.\n\nAnd was this money that already been allocated?\n\nIt's money that already been allocated.\nHow can, why would Congress take back what they had already passed?\nWhy are they doing it, especially for things like that?\nBecause President Trump has made the Republicans afraid.\nUm, but people get into office.\nI mean, I don't know what your motivations are.\nI'm sure they're very pure, but some people, some people just like the allure of power and it seems like Congress is giving its power away to President Trump, that they're reducing their co-equal status.\n\nCongress is absolutely giving its power away.\nAnd in this case, really the most important power we have, which is the power of the purse.\nI mean, what at the end of the day, what power does Congress have to stop a rogue executive?\nBut to defund them.\nWe have the power, if we use it, to say, \"Hey, President Trump, we're not going to let you lay off all these people because we're not going to fund all these things you want to do.\nUh, we're not going to let you, uh, you know, just grab people off the street using agents and masks, demanding people's papers, citizens and non-citizens alike.\nUm, we're going to defund you, but if we don't use that power, the president can run rogue.\"\nNow, why would we give up that power?\nWhy would Republicans in particular give up that power?\nBecause they're worried about losing their own personal power.\nThat is their own personal office.\n\nSome of them have said they're worried for their personal safety.\n\nThat too.\nThat too.\nUm, since he's pardoned his private mob.\nYou can't find a member of the House or Senate that hasn't gotten death threats.\nUh, you probably can't find many that haven't gotten death threats against their spouses, against their children.\nUm,\n\nAnd when did that start?\n\nWell, um, I would say I was in Congress for what, I don't know, 20 years before President Trump came along or or thereabouts.\nUm, if I got threatened two or three times in 20 years, that was a lot.\nUm, if I got threatened two or three times in a week during first Trump, it wasn't very much.\nUm, so under Trump, that has just accelerated.\nUh, and of course now it's not just Democrats getting threatened, it's Republicans getting threatened.\nAnd I have to imagine that there are a bunch of Republicans right now getting threatened over the whole Epstein Files stuff.\nUm, so once you unleash this idea that it's okay to use political violence and threats of violence, uh, it doesn't end up discriminating just against one party.\nUm, judges are getting threatened, city councilmen are getting threatened, uh, election workers are getting threatened.\nUh, and so this is all part of this quite deliberate campaign to uh, frighten people into submission.\nAnd the only way to push back on that is to say, \"Piss off.\"\nPiss off.\nUm, the president, as you know, has been going after me within the last couple of days ever since I led his first impeachment.\nUh, he's threatened me with jail and prosecution and called me a traitor, accused me of treason, blah, blah, blah.\nUh, he coerced Republicans into censuring me in the house, and now the latest attack on me.\nSo, I just want to direct this if this is the right camera.\nOr maybe that's the right camera.\nThat's the right camera right there.\nDonald, piss off.\n\nBut I uh I I was motorized now.\nBut I wait.\nYes.\nYes.\nUm, yes.\nBut, but Donald, before you piss off, would you release the Epstein Files?\nUm, come on.\n\nSenator, thank you so much for being here.\nFor Senator Adam Schiff.\nEverybody, we'll be right back with one of the stars of Superman, Anthony Carrian.\nStick around.\n\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n",
