He is star of the new film Eddington, which is in theaters now. Theaters now climbing the charts. And uh, we I really enjoyed our interview. I had I had a really good time and I'm so glad you're here. Really honored to stop by because I know you don't do this a lot, but after the interview, I feel like we're kind of close.\nI feel like we're kind of close. I think we made I think we made a connection.\nThat is nice. It is a nice feeling, isn't it? You know,\nthank you for saying that.\nIt is a rare feeling. It is a rare feeling, you know, hooking up the jumper cables, as I like to say, watching the energy flow back and forth, but even with like really kind of like of I mean, people's reaction to that interview was so positive and and I even after that, you know, level quality of an interview, I feel like I didn't get to know you the way I really wanted to. And there's this thing here we do at the #ColbertQuestionert. Oh my god. I want you to know. Do you I want you to know. Hold on.\nNo.\nI want you to know. Wait. I got I got to tell I\n[Laughter]\nI mean\nI want you to know this September I'll be doing 10 years of this show. I have never done that before.\nThat's the first time in 10 years. Back me up. That's the first time in 10 years. You pulled something You pulled something out of me, sir. I'm sorry.\npulled that out. Sorry.\nYeah.\nYou cracked this oyster.\nYeah. I know.\nSee, but that's what I want to do with my questions. You see, because we here at The Late Show have come up, we we we've come up with this system by which we can get to know people very quickly, very thoroughly. I mean, really, the person's fully known. And if you don't want to do it, that's fine. I understand it can be a scary prospect because by the end of this, no secrets. We'll know everything.\nI'm just saying a lot of great people have done it.\nAre you ready to face The Colbert Questionert?\nProud of you.\nProud of you.\nHit it.\nDare I ask Phoenix,\n[Applause]\nwhat is the best sandwich? Oh, first question says, \"What's what's the best sandwich?\"\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nCome on. You definitely have an idea.\nI Well, I have a few ideas.\nOkay. But if you had to pick one, like this is the sandwich. You know, I'm reaching for a sandwich.\nI guess I would do like tahini, lettuce, tomato with red onion, and sourdough bread.\nDamn, son. You had that.\nYou don't even know what that is, though.\nYou had that. Yes, I do. You had that on speed dial. Are we pickling these onions? Are we pickling these red onions?\nNo, but that's a good idea.\nThank you.\nI don't know about a tomato and tahini sandwich. How dare you?\nWhat was your first concert you attended?\nThe first concert I attended um was probably uh I think I my mom wouldn't want me to say this, but I think my parents took me to a steel pulse uh concert. It's a it's a regg steel pulse.\nYeah, it's a reggae band.\nOh, okay.\nThere was a lot of, you know, in the air.\nHey, you know what? It's legal now.\nOh, is it?\nYeah. You don't have to You don't have to do the\nNo. For years it was like\nOh, 100%.\nDon't say 100%. What is the scariest animal?\nDo any animals scare you?\nNo.\nGreat white shark.\nOkay.\nNo, I'm not I'm not I'm What do you mean not really? Well, I mean, what have you been faced with an animal that could kill you ever?\nUh, I don't think so. But what are the conditions? Like, but I mean, but I can't tell you because that's like saying, \"What are the conditions of love?\" Like, you're either scared or you're not scared. I can't I can't love.\nYes.\n[Applause]\nSome people have like I do I Spiders unnerve me. Spiders unnerve me. I grew up South Carolina's got some pretty big spiders. And as a kid, maybe snakes.\nMaybe snakes. Maybe snakes. So hard.\nHuh? Well, I I don't want to offend anyone. Like, how what percentage of our viewership is snakes?\nThere might There might be.\nThere might be. There might be. Okay.\nHere's here's an easy one. Apples or oranges?\nOkay, hold on a second.\nYep.\nWhy? Okay, so is it is it a trick question?\nNo, it's just a question. None of these are tricks.\nBut fine, but then that\nSo I'm just wondering because it implies that you have both in stock.\nSo why you have both of them in front of you and you and and they say, \"Well, why do I have why I go?\"\nCuz we only have we have we have one for you and one for me. And I'm happy that you pick the one you want.\nNo, you pick. I'll take honestly I can I'm not really hungry right now. I'm not really hungry right now. But I like both. I want you to be happy. You have power over editing this.\nI I don't want you to be angry when this is being edited.\nNo one's going to This isn't This isn't a trap.\nThis is not a trap. I am not a trapoor spider.\nOkay.\nThe scariest of all spiders.\nI think you It could It could be. Why not have half of each?\nI will. Judges, we will allow it. The judges are allowing it.\nThank you.\nNever. We've never They've never allowed that one before.\nOkay. Thank you. Thank you.\nHave you ever asked someone for their autograph?\nYes.\nMay I ask who who you've asked?\nUm Well, I didn't I didn't. My mom worked at NBC when I was young. She was a secretary to a casting director and uh and I asked her to ask him to get Erica Estrada's autograph from Chips.\nHell yeah. Oh yeah. Absolutely.\nAnd and John Travolta.\n[Applause]\nUhhuh.\nShe got it.\nShe did.\nOh, is this from Welcome Back Cotter Days? Uh uh I don't for some reason the image that I have in my head is uh is it urban cowboy is that?\nYeah, urban cowboy. Yeah.\nBut that seems not like that seems like that wouldn't be the autograph picture you'd give a kid. But maybe I don't know. But I don't maybe that's what they had. You know, maybe but I might be wrong about that. For some reason that's the image I have.\nYou have either of these still?\nOh, but I but I worked with John. So like\nOh, yeah. All right. Thud.
