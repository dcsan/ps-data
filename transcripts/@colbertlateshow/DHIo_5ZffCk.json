I've been a fan since, you know, I guess since Bottle Rocket, you know, since back in the day.\nThat was the beginning.\nYeah. Yeah. And, you know, I just thought that after, you know, after so many years I wanted to talk to you, I could, we could just go into some old normal interview right now, right? You know, talk about Stick, you know, but uh, you know, uh, I think that because I, I, it's been so long since I've had a chance to talk to you. I've wanted to for so long that I thought maybe we just try to go straight to the heart of Owen Wilson.\nYeah. Are you, are, are you, we have this thing on the show. It's called The Colbert Questionert.\nOkay.\nAnd I was wondering, are you familiar? Have you heard of it?\nYeah.\nHave you heard of it? Your friends out in Hollywood have told you about the questionnaire.\nY has made it west.\nOkay. Good. Good. It's take, it takes a fair amount of courage because these are all ergonomically designed to penetrate straight to your soul and reveal you to an audience. And you have the courage to be known.\nIt's about time. Let's, let's figure out what makes this guy click.\nOkay. Fantastic. Well, uh, brave man. So, what's going to happen right now, ladies and gentlemen? This is the Colbear questionnaire with Owen Wilson. Here we go.\nAll right. You want to hydrate or something? You want to, um...\nThat's you. Yeah. Okay.\nIt is important.\nOwen Wilson, first question of the questionnaire.\nEasy, sir. We'll ease you in. Okay.\nWhat is the best sandwich?\nWell, um, of course the little kid in you wants to find a loophole and say an ice cream sandwich, but uh,\nyou'll accept any answer. I think I, I think what I would say is, um, you know, when we would visit my grandmother and go to the beach, she would make PB&Js with the crust cut off, uh, on Pepperage Farm bread and uh, like bread like the...\nYeah, the thin, the sandwich bread and then having that, you know, nothing works up an appetite like swimming in the ocean. So that was very satisfying. You get the salty and you get the sweet at the same time.\nAnd then I had a great grandmother, too.\nYeah. What, what jelly are we talking about here?\nUh, I think it was Smuckers.\nYeah. Strawberry.\nStrawberry. Great. Yeah. And with a name like Smuckers.\nYeah.\nIt's got to be good.\nIt's got to be good. Thank you. Are they a sponsor?\nCut that out right now then. All right.\nUh oh. Uh, Owen Wilson, what was the first concert you attended? The uh, it was the Rolling Stones.\n1980, so I was 12 and it was the Tattoo U tour. And that's where Mick Jagger was wearing, uh, kind of like football pants, like with no pads and a very tight, like, very tight yellow. These were yellow, kind of canary yellow, and, um, you know, and the day before it had been just a downpour. And so the, the day that I went, uh, they were really happy. There was no rain and it was a beautiful, I mean, it was just kind of overwhelming, you know, for a 12-year-old. Uh, but...\nYou have a favorite Stone song? It's not on the question. What's your favorite song?\nUh, my favorite Stone song...\nOr anything you remember from that concert?\nYeah. Uh, well, I mean, Start Me Up, that was the big...\nYeah. That was the big hit. But, uh, my favorite, uh, I think I would have to say Tumbling Dice. Uh, okay. Or maybe the Keith Richards one. Uh, happy that he said.\nOh, yeah. Yeah. My Keith is, uh, Before They Make Me Run.\nOh, I was going, I was about just about to say that.\nI took it. It's too late.\nReally?\nYeah.\nWhat is the scariest animal?\nScariest animal? Um, I don't love rats.\nI, I would have to say... Yeah, I would have to say rats.\nRats. Uh, apples or oranges?\nWell, you can't really compare them, can you?\nOh, you just have to choose.\nYes. Um, I would choose for me, um, I, I would say apple. Like a good, like crunchy apple. Uh, well, you know, for an apple pie, you kind of need the green ones, Granny Smith. But for just an apple, I would go for just the classic red fall apple that you...\nLike a Macintosh.\nUh, yeah. Yeah. Or like a red delicious.\nYeah. Keep going. Keep going.\nGala.\nYes.\nHoney crisp.\nFuji crisp.\nHoney. Gosh.\nYeah. Cosmic crisp.\nYeah.\nYeah. Yeah. A couple of those. The Honey Crisp.\nYeah. I'm a Fuji man. I'm a Fuji man.\nOkay.\nHave you ever asked someone for their autograph?\nI have. Lots. But uh, the one I remember as a kid when I was maybe, um, maybe in college in Dallas was Oliver Stone was in Dallas filming and I saw him and I went up and I said I'd like to get an autograph for my brother Luke and he called his wife over and he said, \"This is for Luke.\" He goes, \"That's a real Texas name, isn't it?\" And so I felt like I had a real sort of moment with them. So it was more than just an autograph. I had that thing where he brought his wife over to uh, compliment or I took it as a compliment. So did Luke. That's a real text. Yeah. Did he say anything about Owen?\nNo, cuz I didn't, that didn't come up. Uh, I didn't ever say my name.\nWhat, uh, what do you think happens when we die?\nWhoa.\nYeah, we don't pull our punches here.\nQuestion. Um, I think that you hear a voice and I think that voice sounds a lot like Jim Nance.\nAnd I think that voice says, \"And now, welcome to the first tee from Dallas, Texas, Owen Wilson.\"\nAnd the angels go bananas.\nWow.\nAnd that for, and the fir, the first, and the first hole in heaven.\nYeah.\nPar four.\nPar five. Part three.\nDog leg. Par five.\nDog leg. Right. Left. There you go.\nOkay. We have to take a quick break, but when we come back, Owen Wilson will complete The Colbert Questionert.\nStick around everybody.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nYeah.\n",
