  "cleanText": "Welcome one and all to The Late Show.\nI'm your host Stephen Colbert, and I tell you it was a hot one here today in New York.\nI want to thank everyone in my audience for waiting in line under the Ed Sullivan Theater's Easy Bake Marquee.\nYou guys, oh, you guys are going to be so delicious with a layer of Duncan Hines frosting.\nAll over the country, temperatures hit triple digits in Nevada and California.\nOfficials put out heat warnings for the towns of Perump and Furnest Creek, as in I'm sweating so hard, the crack of my Perump turned into Furnest Creek.\nThe threat of dehydration led the National Weather Service to recommend that Americans in 11 states avoid alcohol and caffeine.\nNo.\nNo.\nNo.\nNot my zooies and my sleepies.\nCaffeine is how I get up in the morning, and so is alcohol.\nLittle Bailey's and the coffee is fine.\nIt's not hurting anybody.\nThe heat, this heat, all this heat may be affecting the president because, and I want to be sir, I want to be sensitive about this.\nHis skin seems to be falling off.\nTrump was speaking on the White House lawn earlier this week.\nAnd see if you can pinpoint the moment the cameraman got a little distracted.\nAt the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, it's going to be uh too bad.\nMore aggressive.\nYeah.\nThe tariffs are going to go on and other sanctions go on.\nHoly Sephora sample counter.\nThat is that is a generous shmear.\nNow, the White House says he's fine.\nThat it's it's just a minor soft tissue irritation, which is good.\nBut if he's going to put makeup on it, can we can we see that hand again?\nThat's that's that's more than concealer.\nThat's fondant.\nIs is his makeup artist the cake boss?\nAnd I just I just want to say, you know, while I make a lot of jokes about the president, I'm on TV every day and I wear makeup, too.\nSometimes I even wear it on my hand.\nAnd there's nothing weird about that, is there?\nNo.\nMr. Steven, no.\nYou are so I love you.\nNo.\nYou are so perfect and so handsome.\nI love you.\nMwah.\nMwah.\nWhy?\nWhy?\nThank you, Mr. Han.\nIt's all right.\nI would I I'm sure Trump would rather have us talk about his hand than Jeffrey Epstein.\nThat controversy is causing so much trouble for Trump that he recently ordered it to be put in a cell and for the cameras to stop working for three minutes.\nHere's where things stand.\nMAGA is furious because they think Trump is refusing to release the Epstein files.\nIn response, Trump has been saying that there are no credible files.\nAnd if there are, they're really boring.\nAnd also, Obama made them up.\nThat part is true.\nAnd you can read them on Obama's annual Summer Epstein client list.\nNow, as crazy as it is, you know, Trump is going all in on the idea that his followers have fallen for a nefarious Democratic scheme.\nAll it is is the Republicans, certain Republicans got duped by the Democrats and they're following a Democrat uh playbook.\nThat is ridiculous.\nThe Democrats have never had a playbook.\nIt's improv, baby.\nYeah, right off the couch.\nHey, we have a location and a thing we won't talk about.\nTrump is desperately looking for a scapegoat.\nYesterday, he fired the Manhattan federal prosecutor who handled the Epstein case and pulled the UNO reverse card, calling on the FBI to investigate this Jeffrey Epstein hoax, by which he evidently means he wants the FBI to investigate the folks who investigated Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking, which is weird.\nBut we could get a whole new spin-off of To Catch a Predator.\nWhy don't you have a seat there and get comfortable for that?\nNo, Chris, you have a seat.\nWhy have you been spending so much time in kitchens with perverts, federal prosecutors or not?\nIs that syndication?\nIs that on CBS?\nFederal prosecutors are not the only people Trump wants to get rid of.\nUh yesterday there were rumors that Trump was planning to fire Federal Reserve chairman and Keebler elf at Lens Crafters, Jerome Powell.\nUh here's Trump at Tuesday's Chopper Talk bad mouthing Powell.\nI have to say this.\nI think he's terrible.\nI think he's a total stiff.\nYou talk to the guy, it's like talking to a nothing.\nIt's like talking to a chair.\nWow.\nReally?\nTalking to Jerome Powell is like talking to a chair.\nMaybe that's because his job title at the Federal Reserve is chair.\nWow.\nIt's like talking to a chair.\nYou poop lagoon.\nIt's not entirely clear the the president has the power to get rid of Powell, but even the whiff of it royd the stock market yesterday.\nThat's because firing the Fed chair, who was supposed to be an independent steward of our f financial system and our monetary policy would create an issue that economists call.\n[Applause]\nIt's so beautiful.\nOne economist likened the idea of firing Powell to ripping the fabric of the universe.\nSounds extreme, but Trump's actually done that once before.\nmight want to put a little concealer on that.\nWall Street's message of abject panic must have gotten through to Trump because just a few hours after floating the idea, he told reporters that he was highly unlikely to fire the Fed chair, but made it clear he's no fan.\nHe's a terrible Fed chair.\nI was surprised he was appointed.\nI was surprised, frankly, that uh Biden put him in and extended him.\nYes.\nIt's Joe Biden's fault for picking Jerome Powell in the first place.\nCan Jim, can we see that footage of Biden appointing him as Fed chair back in 2017?\nIt is my pleasure and my honor to announce my nomination of Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nWhat?\nWow.\nJoe Biden looked terrible in that clip.\nHe was way too old to be president.\nDid you see the makeup on his hand?\nI did.\nNow, uh ladies and gentlemen, uh I have something terrible to share.\nUm cuz last night Donald Trump had a good idea.\nHe he announced that in place of high fructose corn syrup, Coca-Cola had agreed to use cane sugar for Coke in the U.S.\nReminds me of that.\nI know.\nI agree.\nIt's a great idea.\nIt reminds me of that classic jingle, I'd like to buy the world a Coke and have everybody forget about Jeffrey Epstein.\nTrump posted, \"I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using real cane sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so.\"\nI'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola.\nAll of those in authority.\nI'm talking the big polar bear, the little polar bear, seasonally Santa, and for a limited time only.\nDarth Vader, he continued, \"This will be a very good move by them.\nYou'll see.\nYou'll see.\"\nWhy does everything sound like a threat from this guy?\nIt's like your date saying, \"I couldn't decide on the chocolate cake or the salted caramel ice cream, so I got both.\nThey might even be good together.\"\nYou'll see.\n[Applause]\nYou'll all see.\nIt's possible Trump uh didn't give anybody a heads up uh because Coca-Cola released this statement.\nWe appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm for our iconic Coca-Cola brand.\nMore details on new innovative offerings will be shared soon.\nThat really sounds like the way daycare teachers talk about their most disruptive toddler.\nEveryone here at Sunbeam Learning Center appreciates Braden's enthusiasm.\nHe's really made an impression on his classmates, mainly with his teeth.\nWow.\nBut the joke's on Trump.\nBecause in trying to distract from one conspiracy, he's only brought attention to a much graver conspiracy.\nJoin me in the things I've been thinking about since 1985 cam.\nWelcome.\nIn 1985, I was an innocent young theater major at Northwestern University.\nThere I am.\nWhen out of nowhere, Coca-Cola announced a new formula aptly named New Coke.\nThe catch?\nIt was disgusting.\nSo, so bad that they said, \"Okay, okay, we're sorry.\"\nAnd they went back to what they claimed was their classic formula.\nThe catch, it wasn't.\nThe sugar had been replaced by high fructose corn syrup.\nMy theory, they knew we'd taste the difference in sweetener immediately.\nSo instead, they release new Coke as the false flag that refreshes just to trick us all.\nYou think that's crazy?\nThen how do you explain this missing footage from the Epstein jail tapes?\nI know the truth about 1985 CocaCola.\n[Laughter]\nWe got a great show for you tonight.\nLater we have one of the stars of Superman, Anthony Carrian.\nAnd when we come back, I sit down with Senator Adam Ship joint.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nYeah.\n",
