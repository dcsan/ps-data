the um the mohawk is really a scary character.\nGreat villain.\nWindow or Isle.\nDid you ever see the Road Warrior?\nOh yeah.\nOkay.\nI didn't feel like you were responding.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nI'm full.\nRoad Warrior.\nYeah, exactly.\nAnd Mad Max, obviously the first road warrior.\nThat was the second one.\nMad Max was big.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nBut thank\nYeah.\nI feel mildly attacked, but that's okay.\nSo, I'll get you back.\nMaster Blaster.\nHere you go.\nMaster Blaster.\nOkay, I'm on board.\nAnd the little kid who has the, you know, the little music thing that they throw to obviously Thunderdome.\nThunderdome for the Beyond, which greatest song.\nYes.\nWe don't need another hero.\nWe don't need to know the way home.\nYes, we do.\nAll we want is life.\nBeyond Thunderdome.\nYeah.\nSee, there we go.\nIt's a software.\nWhat I love about that song on the road, my friend, one of my my old friend, one of my producers here, Paul Danell, and I love to share the idea that how how eternal that song is.\nIt's always going to mean the same thing to everyone because no one will ever forget what the Thunderdome was.\nYou know, what can we add to this song to make sure that a hundred years from now it'll mean exactly the same thing.\nWhat about Thunderdome,\nWindow or Isle?\nUm, I I would say for sure window.\nI bet no one ever says a isisle.\nI sometimes sayleisle because I don't want to have to ask the person I got to go and go to the bathroom.\nI don't want to\nI don't mind doing that.\nI I just I want to be able to sleep to kind of put my head against the side.\nFavorite smell?\nUh, the ocean.\nYeah.\nOr jasmine.\nOr Jasmine's good.\nJasmine growing by the ocean.\nProvence would be good for you.\nYeah.\nThere you go.\nLeast favorite smell.\nUm I I don't love like a real strong like cologne or perfume.\nI'm not crazy about it's just sometimes it just can be really too much.\nEarliest memory.\nUm, yeah, you're it's you know memory is such a tricky thing.\nUm, but I I mean well just what is it and then what have your parents told you kind of the thing you think memory might be a story you were told what I feel like was uh I was still you know my mother giving me a haircut like kind of on the counter and the family across the street uh the Buckleys had moved like a few weeks earlier and we're friends with the kids so that was kind of a you know sad thing and then all of a sudden while I'm getting the haircut I see trucks, you know, coming in and I'm like, \"The Buckleys are back.\nThe Buckleys are back.\"\nBut there was another family moving in.\nYeah.\nAnd then, um, did they have kids?\nWell, yeah, that's the thing.\nThen I became friends with those kids, so you know.\nYeah.\nDo you ever keep up with the Buckleys?\nUh, no.\nI I lost I lost track of\nMaybe they're watching right now.\nYeah, maybe.\nThat would be nice.\nAnyone in the Buckley family you'd like to say hello to right now?\nTo all of them?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nCats or dogs?\nUh I would say yeah for sure dogs but but it's not like an instant thing whereas like as you know I grew up with dogs but in college there was a cat that started hanging around my apartment and I started feeding the cat.\nYeah.\nAnd I never really been around cats and then I really got attached to this cat and it's going to sound funny but yeah I named it Buckley.\nI really did.\nThat was the name.\nI know.\nThat is perfect.\nYeah.\nAnd then that's the name also we used in the royal tenon bombs for the name of the dog.\nYeah.\nLike that name buckler.\nYeah.\nGod, I didn't realize it's\nWell, that's the kind of things that's the kind of trowel work you get with the questionnaire.\nYeah.\nIt pulls all that stuff out.\nIt's quite magical.\nOkay.\nYou only get one song to listen to for the rest of your life.\nWhat is this song?\nYou don't have to listen to it continually, but when you go to listen to it, this is what you

the we're recording this the night that Brian Wilson passed.\nYeah.\nAnd so, um, he's a Wilson brother.\nI'm a Wilson brother.\nAnd, uh, so I would say, um, good vibrations.\nWhat number am I thinking of?\nIs it is it between like can you you know narrow it down like between zero and 10?\nWhat number am I thinking of?\nI'll tell you again.\nIt's a whole It's a whole number.\nIt's a whole
