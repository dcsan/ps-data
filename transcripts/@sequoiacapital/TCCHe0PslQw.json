Right now, if we think of, like, I bet you if we look, pull up our phones, well, you folks are investors. But if you're not an investor, I bet you if you pull up your phone, most of the apps on it are apps that are built by large teams for millions of users. And there's very few apps that are built just for us and the specific thing that we need. Um, and so I think as it becomes more and more practical to build like bespoke software for people or teams, we'll end up having higher and higher demand software.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to Training Data. Today we're joined by Hanson Wang and Alexander Embiricos from OpenAI's Codex team for a fascinating look at the future of software development. Codex is OpenAI's series of AI coding tools that helps developers delegate tasks to cloud and local coding agents. Unlike the original OpenAI Codex, which was developed in 2021 to autocomplete lines of code, the latest evolution of Codex can complete entire tasks for you autonomously in the background. The key difference between 03 and Codex is that while 03 is great at competitive programming, Codex has been RL tuned to be great at day-to-day enterprise development tasks. Alexander and Hanson share more about the backstory for Codex and the broader paradigm shift from snappy autocomplete to longer running background agents. Plus, they share their surprising vision for how developers will interact with AI in the future as sync and async experiences merge. Hint, it might look more like Tik Tok than your current IDE. Thank you guys for joining us. It's wonderful to have you here. Hey, thanks for having us. Great to be here. We'd love to hear a little bit more about what you guys work on. Tell us about the Codex team and your story. Well, yeah, I'm Hanson. I'm one of the researchers that helped train the Codex one model. And I'm Alex, the product lead. I think for me, uh, the name Codex is is such a great call back to the original Codex model. That was like kind of like an aha moment for me when it first came out, cuz I think GPD3 was really cool, but then Codex was like the first moment where I felt like it's like, wow, this can really do something that is going to change the world. Um, and that's like actually kind of like how I got into the whole like startup space. Um, like one of the first couple demos I did was like using Codex to do data analysis. I think it's actually like um, funny story, like I was here for as part of Sequoia's arc program. Um, that's how I met Lauren. Uh, and then uh, one of the demos we did, we actually used OpenAI Codex to do uh, data analysis, and that's how um, I started in the startup space. Um, and and I think as time went on, as like the later versions of GPT came out, uh, it became super clear that, you know, like using AI for agentic use cases was going to be the future. Um, and so I I joined the company to work on on agentic coding efforts. Yeah. And this was like, you know, a per standard uh, OpenAI style where we like the naming to be as easy to follow as possible. This is the Codex of, like, I think it was 2021. Yeah. This is pre-HBT, right? Exactly. Yeah. So it was actually like the the model powering GitHub Copilot. Um, and then recently, you know, as we were working on this product, which we'll talk about, um, we thought, you know, this is like a super fun brand, also a very apt name, you know, code, Codex, code execution, so like we decided to sort of like resuscitate the brand and like keep using it. You said resuscitate. So was Codex dormant for a while and then you all resuscitated it for the We haven't used the brand like recently. Okay. Okay. Really cool. Can you tell us a little bit about Codex the agent and and what it does? Yeah, I think um, so basically Codex is a coding agent that has its own container and its own terminal, kind of like in fully in the cloud. Uh, you give it a task and it comes, it comes back to you with a with a PR in the sort of like one-shot style, and we actually experimented with a lot of different form factors kind of along the way, but kind of in the end decided to to settle on this one. Yeah. So like, you know, we've been working on a bunch of agents, and we've been working on a bunch of coding products as well, and basically, um, in our mind, Codex is like this thought experiment for how would it work to code with AI, but where we sort of put all our effort into thinking about what would that would feel like if the AI is working on its own computer, um, you know, independently from you, and so you're delegating to it rather than like pairing with it. Um, and so, you know, some of the things that we're really proud of with this Codex launch are thinking about like the compute environment and like how do we set it up so that the agent can actually work on its own but be productive. Um, and like creating the model, which has talked more about, like, basically that isn't just good at like writing code that looks good or is functional, but also is really good at writing code that like is useful for professional software engineers and like mergeable ideally without even touching your their own computer. So, what is the difference between Codex and Codex CLI? Yeah, we've definitely gotten some questions about that. Uh, I promise this is all going to make even more sense over time. So basically Codex for us is like our brand for like agentic coding. Um, and we have this vision of, like, you know, like we're going to have this agent, and mostly the agent will work on its own computer, but it should also be able to meet you in like any of the tools that you use wherever you work, be that your your terminal or, you know, your IDE or your issue management tool. So, uh, Codex CLI is basically like Codex, like, in your terminal. So like CLI stands for command line interface, right? So it's like in your terminal, you can work with Codex, that's like your environment, and then Codex or Codex in chatbt is basically a Codex working on its own computer. Uh, today those are those are just distinct things. As a brief aside, one of my favorite things about working at OpenAI is how willing we are to cut scope and just like launch things quickly. Um, but over time, we'll actually bring those things closer together so you can really think of it as just like, it's just like Codex, and you know, it can be in JPT or it can be in your CLI. Very cool. And so what did you have to do differently for the model to make it useful beyond just writing the next line of code? Yeah. So I think um, one of the most interesting progressions, so if you go back to, you know, like the 01, like the the first reasoning model that we launched, uh, we highlighted, like, how good it is at math and even like coding competitions, like as of now, um, I used to be a competitive coder, and like, it's better than me at competitive coding. It's better than most, almost all people at OpenAI at that. Uh, but I think one of the things that we saw was that, you know, despite being good at these programming competitions, it wasn't actually that good at producing mergeable code. And so, like, we even highlighted it this in the blog post, uh, with with models like 03, like the the the code that it generates often, you know, like isn't quite to the taste or style that, you know, professional software engineer would expect. So a lot of the effort that we spent on training this model was aligning the model to basically like the taste or the preferences of of professional software engineers, and that's something that took a lot of uh, I guess, specialized training. Yeah, I have this like very like producty analogy that I like, which is like, if you take our like reync models, which are great at coding, um, they're great at coding, but it's kind of like this like really precocious, like competitive programmer, like college grad who doesn't have many years of job experience being a professional software engineer at like on a team, right? And so a lot of the work we did to go from like 03 to like Codex one was actually like the equivalent of like those first few years of job experience, where it's like, hey, like what does a good PR description look like, you know, PR titles, like how do you read the style of the codebase and then make sure your code is in the same style? How do you like test well? Uh, how do you show that you tested well? Stuff like that. What's typically the aha moment for when somebody uses Codex? Yeah, I think one of the things we have in the onboarding is like find and fix a bug in the codebase. I think that's one of the areas where uh, Codex really shines is like specifically like bug fixing. Uh, uh, just because it can actually like independently try not just to see if you know something looks a bit off, but it can actually go and then like verify that, okay, like I can try and reproduce a particular issue, and so I think like even, you know, like leading up to the Codex launch, there were a couple of bugs where, you know, like we were sitting there kind of like wondering what's going on, and honestly, like sometimes the easiest thing to do is just like paste in a description of the issue into Codex, and we were surprised how frequently, like, I'd actually end up with a usable fix. Yeah. Like, like fun story here. Um, hopefully this doesn't give away too much, but at 1:00 a.m. the night before launch or the morning of launch. Um, at 1:00 a.m. we were we were looking at a bug with like an animation, a Lahi animation. And you know, this is the kind of thing, like, okay, I guess we could cut it from launch scope. It'd be okay to launch without it. But we really wanted to get in, and we we just couldn't figure this out. Um, and so an engineer ended up like describing what the bug was and putting it into Codex. And actually, like a fun pro tip for anyone who's like using Codex is that if some if there's a really hard task, it can be useful to ask Codex to like take multiple cracks at it. So they pasted that description in and ran it four times, like, &quot;Hey, there's this bug. We can't figure out what's going on.&quot; And uh, three of those rollouts did not work. And then one of the four was just like the fix of the bug that we were stuck on for like hours at 1 a.m. before launch. And so landed the fix, you know, deployed the code, uh, and uh, the animation was in for launch. That's awesome. Maybe tell us more about how you all are using it internally at OpenAI, like, is every engineer, is every researcher using Codex now in their workflows? Yeah. And actually, can I give you the other, like, kind of magic moment? Definitely. So like one of the interesting things about Codex is that it's a very different form factor from maybe what people are used to, right? Like a lot of the AI products that people are used to, especially in software, maybe like GitHub Copilot was like the first really good one. They're really things that kind of like work with you in flow, and you're just kind of seamlessly going back and forth, kind of pairing, right? And it's flavors on pairing. Um, and uh, we think that's awesome, and like the Codex CLI is a tool that you can use in that way. But for the for Codex, you know, we really wanted to uh, push this idea of, like, you're delegating, because like in the future, we imagine that actually, um, you know, the vast majority of coding is actually going to be done independently, uh, from like the human, like, working on their computer who can only do one thing at a time. Um, and so, you know, it'll be done by, basically, it'll be done by agents working on their own computer. Um, and so that is a very different thing to delegate to an agent than it is to pair with sort of an AI model that's like in your tooling. Um, and so you have to kind of use it differently. And so when we actually were working on an alpha before launch, we would just give this agent to people and be like, hey, like, just use this however you want. And we noticed that many, many of the people trying to use our alpha of Codex were just like not really finding it super useful. Uh, and then we're like, huh, that's interesting. Let's look at how people like at OpenAI are using, like, internal tooling like Codex. And we realized there was like a big difference, which is the mindset of using it. Um, the mindset that works really well for our Codex is like kind of this like abundance mindset, and like, hey, let's try anything, um, let's try anything even multiple times and see what works. It saves me time. And so we've kind of shifted the way that we even onboard people into the product to try to create this aha moment, which is running many tasks in parallel. So like for us, if we see someone, like, trying it out and like they've run like 20 tasks in like a day or an hour, that's amazing, and like we, they're probably going to like, they've understood basically how to use the tool. Fascinating. How does that change the role of the human when you have to review all of this code? Like if two of the three work, then what do you do? Yeah. I think we've put a lot of focus on also like making the outputs easy for people to review. So like one of the things that we're proud of is like, uh, we haven't seen this in too many other tools is like the ability for the model to cite its own work. So not just uh, like the the files that have changed, but also even like the terminal outputs. So like if it ran a test and you know, like for some reason the test wouldn't work, it actually like tells you that, and it tells you, like, here's the exact kind of like terminal command I ran, here's the output. Makes it much easier to to verify the outputs. Um, but but it it is like a great point. I think we're shifting to a world where, like, a lot of the time that we spend, you know, like, normally coding, that a lot of that's going to shift to actually reviewing this, reviewing the code. Do you need humans to review the code? Because I think of code as one of those things where, you know, it compiles or it doesn't. And once it compiles, you can go and check if it does the thing it was supposed to do. Like, do you even need humans to do the code review? I I think, yeah, I mean, for the foreseeable future at least, I do think I do see that to be the case. I mean, I think a lot of it's also just like building trust with the with the early users. I think people really need to have a feeling for, like, you know, what things um, are working well, what things are not. And I think there's always just like\n\n\nSome external context about, like, you know, what makes this code correct that, you know, might be beyond what you initially provided as context.\nYeah.\nLike, if you think of, like, you know, what a developer does, and this is obviously oversimplifying, but there's, like, okay, there's coming up with what things maybe should be done, discussing them with the team, maybe deciding what to do.\nYou call that ideation.\nYou know, maybe then there's design, like, okay, what are we actually doing, and then, like, planning, how are we going to do it, then there's implementing, and then validating, you know, testing those changes, and that, you know, that's basically a loop.\nAnd that small loop of, like, implementing and then testing is what Codex is great at right now, um, although we can talk about how you can use it for planning, too.\nUm, and then there's actually deploying the code and then maybe maintaining the code, writing documentation, etc.\nAnd so, like, you know, I, I forget the exact stat, but I feel like a stat I remember recently is, like, engineers spend, like, maybe, like, 35% of their time coding.\nIt's not actually the majority of even what engineers do.\nAnd so, um, you know, the future that we're trying to build towards is that is one where, you know, if you're a software developer or even, like, in any profession, all the work that is, like, easily automatable, that's usually the grungier type of work, you're not doing, you're delegating that.\nAnd then the work that is more interesting because maybe it's ambiguous or maybe because it's really hard, that's the work that you're driving.\nUm, so we're trying to build towards that, that world.\nUm, and I think we have to get there iteratively.\nSo, for example, right now, if you're a human and you write code, another human's going to review that code, right?\nAnd so we're not going to come in and just, like, try to change that, and we're like, okay, let's plug into that.\nSo, you know, the way the product works right now is, like, you, the developer, are being accelerated by the tool.\nYou ask for some code to be written.\nYou decide if it's good, and you want to push it out to your team, and then your team can review it, and then over time, we'll basically kind of expand what we can do.\nSo we'll help more and more with, like, planning, maybe even designing, maybe even thinking about what to do in response to things that are happening in your app or at work.\nUm, and then we'll push to, like, make review easier and easier, as Hanson was describing.\nYeah.\nAnd I do think I see a future where you have, you know, like, multiple agents collaborating together.\nSo you have, you know, Codex, the Codex agent writes the code, and then maybe, like, the operator agents, the one that's testing it, and all of the things that all the different agents that we've been working on at the company can kind of, like, come together.\nThat's awesome.\nHave you seen people now that you can delegate doing writing code, people beyond engineering team start to use Codex, and as we get into the world of vibe coding, you guys are helping us bring us further down that hole?\nYeah, this is actually super funny.\nUh, we were, so the answer is yes, but I'll tell you a story.\nUm, we, uh, were working on our, uh, launch blog post, uh, with Lindsay here, and, um, we were talking about, like, what quotes to, to, you know, to quote from customers, and we had a customer that wanted to say, yeah, like, we on the engineering team love this, and also it's, like, a power tool for PMs.\nAnd I remember looking at that quote and being like, this is a really cool quote because I'm, I'm on the product team, and I use it to just, like, avoid having to bug an engineer about things or to answer questions, but I remember looking at that quote and being like, do we want that in the launch blog post because the target audience for what we're building is, like, specifically professional software engineers, not vibe coders.\nUm, so I think we ended up not including that exact line.\nBut I think over time, like, as you know, as we have agents that can help us code, I would expect more and more people to be able to contribute to code bases.\nYeah.\nYou think number of professional software developers goes up or down over time?\nThis is just my opinion, but I think it goes way up.\nHuh.\nUm, I think, uh, not vibe coders, professional software developers.\nYeah, I think so.\nUm, but, you know, yeah, in my opinion, the, the easier it is to write software, uh, then the more software we can have.\nRight now, if we think of, like, I bet you, if we look, pull up our phones, well, you folks are investors.\nBut if you're not an investor, I bet you, if you pull up your phone, most of the apps on it are apps that are built by large teams for millions of users.\nAnd there's very few apps that are built, like, just for us and the specific thing that we need.\nUm, and so I think as it becomes more and more practical to build, like, bespoke software for people or teams, we'll end up having higher and higher demand software.\nYeah.\nAs I think about how I use it, I think it just really is a multiplicative factor right now, rather than any kind, any sort of replacement, just like, espec, especially looking at the patterns of our in internal power users.\nThere's, like, a really dramatic, um, like, difference in, um, like, the top users of Codex are, like, doing, you know, 10 plus pull requests every day.\nUm, it's just, like, really such a multiplicative factor that I can't see, like, a world in which, like, it's, like, lowering the bar to creating software so much.\nThat said, I mean, I think this is a really important question, and to be completely honest, like, we don't know, and so this is something that we as a company pay a lot of attention to.\nI want to talk a little bit about the, you know, what's happening under the hood on the technology side.\nSo, you mentioned that, you know, the model itself.\nOne of the things that makes it different from competitive programming is you've, you know, you've made it more, you know, be good at the things that a professional software developer would do.\nIs that the biggest difference on the model side, or, like, should we think of it as a, you know, a close cousin of 03?\nYeah.\nUm, so, so it's, it's definitely the same model as 03 with additional, um, reinforcement fine-tuning.\nUm, but that said, yeah, I think so, part of it is kind of, like, these more, like, qualitative aspects of what makes a good software engineer versus simply, like, a good, let's say, like, coder, um, you know, like, style, even, like, how it writes comments.\nThat's, I think, that's, like, one of the things that people have noticed with other models.\nUm, and then on top of that, I, I also want to highlight, uh, one of the big challenges was, like, making good environments, uh, for the agent to kind of learn in.\nUh, and so if you think about, like, real-world, uh, software repositories, it's, like, so varied and complicated.\nUh, like, think about, like, how much DevOps has to go into, like, setting up a repository.\nAnd that's something we were kind of, like, learning the hard way with the our environment setups.\nBut, um, should we talk about the multi-repo I was showing you yesterday?\nOh, yeah.\nYeah, I was, I was showing Hanson, uh, the repo for the startup that, you know, OpenAI acquired, and so we joined, and so we were looking at that repo together, um, thinking about it for use as an environment, and Hanson's like, so, like, where are the unit tests, you know, because the agent uses unit tests to verify, and, and I was like, uh, this is a real startup that has no unit tests.\nI mean, honestly, same, so I can't complain.\nSo, yeah, like, you have all these, like, really messy environments.\nUm, so we, yeah, we, we had to, over the course of training, like, we had to basically generate these really realistic environments for the agent to learn from.\nUh, and I think, like, one of the reasons that, uh, we're able to make such, like, a, um, an end-to-end product work is that we have, like, the same environments that we use during training and the same, like, basically, this, you know, containerization infrastructure that we're using to serve in production.\nSo this, so our users are, you know, like, we're running our own computer environments, uh, when when users use Codex, they're running in the exact same environments that we're using for training.\nSo you don't have the agent saying, but it works on my machine.\nExactly.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nGood.\nUm, I think these are also the longest-running agents I've seen out of OpenAI Deep Research, maybe was the previous one that was longest running.\nUm, and my understanding is, you know, Codex can, you know, sometimes spend 30 minutes on on different tasks.\nUm, are there any kind of surprising challenges and things you've encountered just getting inference time to scale up on on, you know, a query for so long?\nMaybe I'll start with the product side, and then there's, there's many on the modeling side, but on the product side, actually, the thing that I think the most about is, like, user intent.\nIt's, like, actually, you know, if you imagine someone using, um, like, autocomplete in their IDE, it's, like, not super hard, necessarily.\nI mean, obviously, it's difficult, but it's not super hard to predict, like, what are they trying to do, like, right now, for the next, like, microcond.\nUm, but for doing a task that takes 30 minutes, it's actually, like, fairly difficult to help a user describe the task, like, they may not even know exactly what they want, uh, for 30 minutes worth of work.\nAnd so something that we spent a while debating, and it's, like, still a thing we debate, is, like, what is the right granularity of a task, uh, for someone to give to Codex, and, like, how can we make it easy so that Codex can, like, be really flexible, where you can use it for, like, oneline changes.\nUm, you can use it for, like, big refactors that you know exactly what you want, or, like, larger features where you know what you want.\nUm, or maybe can you use Codex when you don't know exactly what you want, and so maybe you should ask Codex, uh, for a plan, and then you can, like, have it Codex suggest tasks, and then, like, do those tasks afterwards.\nUm, so that's still a topic of debate and, like, iteration for us.\nYeah, I think that's actually, like, a, a good pro tip for for using it.\nIt's actually, like, really good at coming up with its own plans, and then, you know, sometimes it's really tedious to specify everything you up you want up front.\nUm, and that's kind of, like, one of the unique challenges about working, like, if you wanted to work for, you know, an hour at a time, then you kind of do have to specify a lot up front, that which means that you have to spend, like, I don't know, like, 10, 20 minutes coming up with that.\nBut if you use actually, like, the ask mode to to first, like, you know, generate, like, a high-level plan of of what you want want to do, and then you can, like, iterate on that with the model before you you know, send it off for for an hour, it really is, like, working with an intern.\nYeah.\nUh, what about on the model side?\nAnything that's surprising in terms of model behavior as it starts to run for so long?\nYeah, I think, I think our models have gotten a lot better at kind of, like, sticking kind of, like, on task as it, uh, especially, like, with these longer rollouts.\nI will say, like, there are cases where, you know, like, even there is a limit to the model's patience, even though it's, it's quite high.\nSo, so it can be frustrating sometimes.\nYou know, it's like, it goes off for, like, 30 minutes, and then, you know, that this is a case that we're working to get better at, where it's, like, you know, it's kind of like just, like, a human comes back to you.\nIt's like, sorry, I don't, I, this is too much.\nI don't have enough time to to do this.\nActually, like, that's one of the things it says.\nThat's hilarious.\nJust like an intern.\nSo, very, very humanlike in ways.\nYeah.\nUm, I'm curious how you think about the right interaction patterns and how they evolve and how the suite of products around this evolve over time.\nWe have Codex, we have Codex CLI.\nWhat else do you think is out there in the design space for engineering and building products?\nYeah, so the Codex as we launched it is really just, like, you know, it's a research preview.\nIt's a thought experiment, um, a useful one, but it's still, still very early, and what we're most proud of, um, with Codex is, uh, the model, um, and the, you know, the beginning of this, like, foundation for comput environments, and the UI we shipped is is one that we iterated towards, and there's some fun stories there.\nUm, but it's definitely not the final form factor.\nUh, and for those listening, basically, the UI we shipped, um, is, uh, an interface in chatbt where you can, like, submit a task and ask Codex to, like, either answer your question or write code, and then you kind of have this, like, something that looks a little bit like a to-do list of, like, things, uh, that you can, like, go look at merging.\nUm, really, I think for, so, so we, we built that to really lean hard into this idea of, like, an asynchronous agent that you delegate to.\nUm, but what we want to build towards is, um, a setup where you don't have to think about whether you're delegating or whether you're pairing with an agent.\nAnd it's really, it should just feel like working with a teammate, and where that teammate is, like, ubiquitously present in all the tools you work with.\nUm, so you should be able to, uh, pull up any tool that you're working in, be it your terminal, your IDE, your issue management tool, maybe your error alerting tool or your errors, you know, the tool that shows you errors.\nUm, and just ask for help.\nUh, maybe even, uh, Codex has already taken a look before you even got there, and it has, like, an opinion there.\nUm, and you could be able to ask something, be it a short question or a long question.\nIt'll just, like, appropriately decide how much time to spend before answering you.\nUm, and just, like, help you land those changes.\nUm, so basically, we want to kind of blend this idea of, like, pairing and delegation, but the first thing we shipped was just, like, the, the, the purest thought experiment.\nUm, the other thing I'll add to this is, like, one of the unique things about working at OpenAI is that we are the makers of chatbt, um, which is sort of this, you know, the AI system that most people use.\nUm, and so we don't actually see a future where, uh, as you go about your day, you're deciding whether to use, like, the Codex agent or, I don't know, your, like, shopping agent or, like, taxi ordering agent.\nBy the way, I'm just, like, naming random things here.\nUh, or your, like, marketing agent.\nUm, actually, the way we think this, this should work is you should just have, like, one assistant that you talk to, and you can ask it anything about anything, and it can just, like, do the things you need.\nUm, and so that's, you know, that's chatbt that will become our assistant.\nUm, and then if you're a power\n\n\nUser of a certain type of tool, so,\nlet's say you're a software developer,\nyou spend a lot of time in certain\nfunctional tools, then you can go into\nthat tool and have like a bespoke\ninterface with buttons with lists that\nyou can use to like efficiently go about\nyour day.\nDo you think we'll still use IDs?\nYeah, for sure.\nBut they'll evolve, right?\nLike right now they're like very\nfocused on writing code and like as\nHanson Wang was saying, like probably agents\nwill be writing more and more code, and\nso it's going to become like there'll be\na shift in emphasis uh towards like\nlanding code or reviewing code or like\nvalidating them or maybe even like a\nshift in emphasis towards planning like\nbigger arcs.\nYeah, I think we're already seeing a lot\nof people on the team, and they kind of\nlike first thing in the morning they come\nin, like they make coffee, and then they\nthey like kick off a few tasks just to\nkind of get a starting point, and then\nyou know, they come back after their um\nbreakfast and they they look at the tasks\nthat or the pull requests that got\ngenerated, then they'll take those, and\nthe ID is kind of like the place where\nyou take, you know, it's it's not, it's\nmaybe it'll get you like 80% of the way\nthere, hopefully, or even more, but\nthen there's always this like last mile\nwhere you go in and really like\nfine-tune uh based on um kind of like\nyour own vibes.\nHow do you see the broader market\nevolving?\nLike within OpenAI, you have\nso many different strategies here, and as\nyou think about async tasks, as you\nthink about some of the things that you\nmentioned moving into chat GPT, we're\nseeing a lot, an explosion of other tools\nand specialized models.\nYou obviously\nare biased, but I'm curious what your\nread is of the broader market.\nYeah,\nit's it's a crazy time to be a developer\nright now.\nLike there are just so many\nnew tools um that are just so helpful.\nLike a a fun story recently is I was in\nthe airplane and there was no Wi-Fi, and\nI I had thought that I was going to\nmaybe write some code and like build a\nthing, and there was no Wi-Fi, and I was\nlike, you know what, screw it, like it's\njust not worth my time to like even try\nto write code anymore, whereas uh you\nknow, the startup that I was working on\nlike many years ago, like part of the\ngenesis of that startup was like me\nwriting some code without Wi-Fi in an\nairplane, and I just wouldn't even do\nthat anymore because like the market is\njust like it's just changed so much, and\nI think this I think we're going to see\nlike an equivalent shift in an\nequivalent amount of time, so like in the\nnext two years coding will look\ncompletely different.\nUm, I think right\nnow most of the tools that people spend,\nyou know, that people find the most\nvalue from are tools that work really\nclosely with you, like in your\ndevelopment environment, you know, like\nbasically pairing.\nAnd I think the shift\nthat we're going to see, but we have to\nfigure out how this will happen.\nBut the\nshift that we're going to see is that\nactually the majority of code will be\nwritten by agents, and those agents won't\nbe working in your environment where you\ncan do one thing at a time, but they'll\nbe working in their own environments.\nUm, and they won't just be triggered by\nyou like thinking of specific tasks, but\nthey'll be like connected into the tools\nyou use doing work there.\nAnd so, um, I\nthink we'll see basically that shift\ntowards agents.\nI think we're going to\nhave to figure a lot out a lot about\ncode review as you were asking about,\nlike personally, like I don't exactly\nknow how that's going to work, but I do\nknow that even already at OpenAI, we're\nseeing like like much more code is\nmerged by agents, but actually also um\neven more code is generated by agents as\nfolks are like, you know, like say\nkicking off tasks four times to like\nchoose their favorite implementation.\nUh, and so it's like not 100% clear how we\nshould um how we should even like manage\nall this code uh that is that is being\nwritten.\nUm, some things that I will say\nthough, in case it's useful to the\naudience, is that uh there are definitely\nthings you can do to your codebase to\nmake it more addressable for agents.\nUm, this isn't necessarily particularly\nnovel, but you know, obviously using like\ntyped languages is really helpful.\nUm, another thing that's very helpful is\nlike having like small smaller modules\nthat are like better tested, like we joke\nabout having good test at all.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nTest, like we joke about my\nstartup's repo, but like I bet you we\nwould have written it differently if we\nwere writing it today.\nUm, and even\nthere's like small things like uh the\ncode name for this project um is WHAM.\nThis is the code name for for CEX.\nUh\nit's like wham.\nAnd when we named it, we\nwere very intentional in doing so\nbecause we knew we would have code like\nin the server, like for the website, um\nin various other places.\nAnd we wanted it\nto be really easy for the agent to like\nsearch for WHAM related code and find\nit.\nAnd so we named the project um you\nknow WHAM, and we gpped the codebase\nfirst to figure out how often was there\nlike if we would have called it\nsomething like code or or codeex or\nagent.\nYou can imagine like it would\nhave been really hard for the agent to\nnow you called it codeex.\nSo now the\nagent's going to be confused.\nWell, so\nin in the code, this this is kind of my\npoint, right?\nLike intentional design.\nLike in the code, we use the term WHAM\nlike a lot because that's actually much\neasier for the agent to find.\nObviously,\nif we didn't uh use a word like that,\nthe agent could still find its way, but\nit would have to do spend much more time\nto find the right files.\nYeah, it is it\nis cool that you know, like a lot of the\nthings that actually make the codebase\neasier for humans too, also tends to make\nit easier for the agents.\nLike good\ntests, for example.\nWriting good docs is\nis another great example where like now\nI think there's even more of an\nincentive to to do that because like not\nonly does it make your life easier, it\nmakes the agent's life easier.\nOkay.\nSorry to be the annoying VC, but Claude\nCode and Jules are also like I think\nagentic coding experiences from from\nothers.\nDo you think the mark I'm\ncurious how you think your experiences\ncompare today?\nAnd then do you think the\nmarket is probably going to converge\ntowards the same vision of what you know\nsync and async coding look like?\nAnd and\nin that version of the future, what do\nyou think OpenAI wins on?\nI think\nwe're going to see a little bit of\neverything, right?\nLike even in what you\nmentioned, like there's like tools that\nare working on your computer.\nUh there's\ntools that are working on their own\ncomputer.\nLike as I mentioned, like I\nthink we're going to see the majority of\nwork being written where like the agent\nhas its own computer, but it will still\nbe really important for us to invest in\nuh accelerating developers who are doing\nwork on their own computer too, right?\nSo ideally we get the best of both\nworlds there.\nUh, but most work is done\nuh in agent compute.\nI think the way I\nsee it as well is like I think one of\nthe the hardest part of software\nengineering really is like taking all\nthe context from the world and like\nencoding it in these requirements, these\nlike design docs and then the\nimplementation, like I think as we\nalluded to earlier, is like not actually\nlike that much of the life cycle spent\non physical coding, and so I think where\nchatbt shines is like it is this\nassistant that has you know, like has\nmemories now, it has access to like a lot\nof different connectors to um like all\nthe different tools you use, we have like\noperator deep research that have all\nthese different capabilities, and so I\nthink the vision where that like all\ncomes together is where you know, like a\ntool like Codex can really shine once it\nhas access to all that knowledge, it's\nable to like make use of that uh, and I\nthink with that it should be able to do\na much more effective job at um at you\nknow, just the coding part.\nYeah, like\nimagine like hiring a software engineer\nand like the only thing that that\nsoftware engineer can do is like take a\ntask from you and produce a pull request,\nright?\nOr or you know, it has like these\nlike very well-defined features and it can\nExactly.\nDo those things.\nUh, and then\nyou're you ask for like a random thing\nlike, oh hey, like the team is getting\ntogether, like do you mind like also I\ndon't know, getting a meeting room and\nlike leading a brainstorming, like it\njust be it would just be so frustrating\nif like you hired a teammate and they\nrefused to do that kind of work, right?\nAnd so similarly, I think like it's\nreally like we're we're building towards\na future where like agents that you're\nworking with are a little bit more\ngeneralized, like you know, to to\nreference like Hansel was talking about,\nlike you know, operator and deep research,\nlike if you think operator has a web\nbrowser, deep research has like a\ndifferent flavor of a web browser, codex\nhas a terminal, really like your teammate\nhas pretty similar tools like a human\nteammate, right?\nAnd so like the goal\nfor us eventually is to like pick places\nwhere we want to really invest in a\nspecific audience to like make rapid\nprogress.\nSo we obviously we're doing\nthat with coding with Codex or like GPT\n4.1 or we like generated specific evals\nfor that audience and then like made a\nbetter model for them for developers.\nUm, but then over time, like generalize these\nthings into like simple things that\neveryone can use.\nSo I think like again\nwith us, you know, with with OpenAI and\nlike catch PT, I feel like that's a\nplace where the products we build will\nlook very different from something\nthat's like very only specifically for\ncoding.\nWhat do you think will be the\nprimary UI that developers use to\ninteract with Codex?\nLike do you think\nit'll be chatbt, the CLI, the ID, all\nall the above?\nYeah, I think a mix of\nall the above.\nI think we just kind of\nlike want to meet developers where they\nare in that moment.\nSo it might not even\nbe like in the editor or in the\nterminal.\nMight be like on Slack, like\nyou know, someone messages you like, hey,\nlike there's a bug, and you're just like,\nhey, like go fix it.\nUm, I'll give you my\nlike fun future UI that is like not at\nall serious.\nUm, but maybe uh the future\nof of like working with agents if you're\nlike, you know, a startup founder in the\nfuture and you have like a team of just\nyou or you and a couple co-ounders and a\nmany agents actually looks like Tik Tok.\nUh, you know, uh maybe you have like\nvertical feed and it's basically an\nagent has produced video that you can\nwatch with like an idea like, hey, a\ncustomer wrote in with this request, I\nthink we should fix it, and then you\nswipe right to say uh like yeah, let's\nlet's fix this, let's do this, you swipe\nleft to to say no, we should talk, but\nsorry, it's a it's a I didn't say this\nwas going to make a lot of sense.\nI like\nand then you press and hold uh to\nprovide feedback, so you like yes, like\ndo it, but you know, uh make sure the font is\nin italic.\nUm, and so basically you have\nall these agents who are like subscribed\nto information at your company or on\nyour team, and um they're proactively\ncoming up with ideas um and you know,\ndoing them and then giving you updates,\nand you're kind of just like curating\nthe work that is being done, and they\nshow you little previews of what the\nworld could look like.\nYeah, obviously\nthat's a half joke though.\nUm, you know,\nI think that'll be like kind of the arms\nlength working with agents, and then\nyou're there's like it's definitely\ngoing to be really important for people\nto be able to like go do the work\nthemselves and like pair with agents in\nI get that it's a half joke, but it is\nlike it's a really cool visual because I\nthink everyone agrees conceptually with\nthis idea of, you know, collaborating\nand reviewing all the different changes\nan agent makes is going to look very\ndifferent from how we code today.\nBut\nlike nobody's actually given me a visual\nof what that might look like.\nSo that\nthat's a really cool idea.\nI love it.\nAwesome.\nShould we wrap with the\nlightning round?\nLet's do it.\nOkay.\nUh\nrecommended piece of content or reading\nfor for AI fans.\nUh for me that's like\nimmediate.\nIt's like the culture by Ian\nBanks.\nHave you read it?\nYes.\nIt's\namazing.\nYeah.\nUm it is uh a science\nfiction series.\nUh started being written\nin the 80s and it is uh unusually\npositive in its view of like how a\nfuture space fairing like human and\nnon-human like race could kind of look.\nUm, and there's a lot of questioning\nabout like what is the purpose and\nmeaning of life when we have AGI.\nYeah,\nI think for me it's like anything by\nRichard Sutton.\nI think that was like my\nintroduction to reinforcement learning.\nAnd I think it's like it's kind of a\njoke here that like we read the bitter\nlesson like every single day that that's\nlike kind of the philosophy of OpenAI.\nLike I think you know even with Codex,\nlike we give it a terminal and like it\nliterally uses pasix tools.\nThat's like\nthe most like bitter lesson way of\nworking with um with the computer.\nAnd\nyour favorite AI apps?\nGot to be chat\nGBT.\nYeah.\nNot touch.\nCome on.\nWe're so\nboring.\nI mean, okay.\nEither it could be\nlike a new feature that you guys have\nreleased other than Codex or something\noutside of OpenAI.\nOkay.\nSo, I guess I\ndon't It's funny.\nI I don't really think\nof AI apps.\nUm, right.\nI But I do like\nit when my life gets easier.\nSo, uh, you\nknow, some things that I like are like\nwhen you're using AI, but it's kind of\ninvisible.\nSo, like just I'm in product.\nSo, I often like file bugs and like\nLinear has a really elegant integration\nwhere when you file a bug uh from a\nSlack conversation, it just generates\nthe bug from the Slack conversation.\nBut\nthere they never say AI anywhere.\nJust\nlike you actually kind of don't even\nnotice that it's using AI.\nOh, wait.\nI I\ncame up with an answer for favorite AI\napp, Whimo.\nAh, there we go.\nYeah.\nI\nthink I mean I think for me like Copilot\nhas definitely been um the the the thing\nthat you know keeps delivering value\nevery single day for me.\nOkay.\nRobotics,\nbullish, bearish?\nBullish.\nYeah.\nWhich new application or application\ncategory do you think will break out in\n2025 other than coding?\nYeah.\nI mean, I\nthink I think when you had Issa and Josh\non, u it's kind of the same answer, but\n2025 is definitely the year of agents.\nI\nthink we're going to see agents take off\nin a lot of different categories.\nYeah,\nhave to agree with that.\nWhat type of\nagents are you most most excited about\naside from coding agents?\nYeah, it's a\ngood question.\nWell, I mean, so my take\nwould be like, you know, if we I know\nthis is meant to be rapid fire, right?\nBut like kind of the way we think of\nagents is you have reasoning models\n\n\nRight? And then you give those reasoning models like access to tools of the trade.\nUm, and then you figure out how to train that agent to do the specific function, right?\nSo it's like not just about writing, it's about journalism, or it's not just about coding, it's about software engineering, right?\nSo that's kind of what we're doing.\nUm, and in my mind, the reason I'm so excited about agents this year is because we now have a few agents shipped from OpenAI, and you know, and other companies are shipping agents too.\nAnd so we're starting to see what kind of the shape of this is and starting to like identify the primitives.\nAnd so specifically what I've been excited about is like as we bring this together and you come up with like an agent that you don't have to provision separately for every single function, but it's like an agent with a computer that has a browser and has a terminal, and it can do like multiple things without you having to exactly specify like you are my coding agent or something.\nReally cool.\nThank you so much for joining us.\nCongratulations on what you've built at Codeex, and thank you for giving us a preview of how you think the coding market will evolve and also giving us a peak into how you know longunning async agentic experiences will play out.\nReally appreciate it.\nThank you.\nThanks so much.\nThanks for having us.\nThank you.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
