Many Roman homes featured a vomitorium, a room where people could vomit after overindulging.\nB. The Pythagoreans, who followed the teachings of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, embraced a vegetarian diet.\nC. A favorite Roman condiment was sauce made from fermented fish guts.\nWhile vomit and vomitoria come from the same root, meaning “to spew forth,” a vomitorium is simply a passage through which spectators spewed from amphitheaters or arenas into the street.\nPurging was a common medical treatment, but it certainly wasn't prescribed to make room for more fish gut sauce.\nAs for Pythagoras, there were more than three sides to the man, I’ll have you know.\nHe was a philosopher, and his followers embraced his belief that eating animal flesh increased aggressive behavior.\nWe’re all tied up.\nBut this last question is sure to separate the true Romano-files from the Romano-flakes.\nA. The city of Rome was sacked twice during the 5th century CE.\nB. The last western Roman emperor was Romulus Augustulus.\nC. The Roman Empire fell in 476 CE.\nJust as I thought!\nThe very idea that Rome fell is... complicated.\nIt’s true that by 476 the empire looked very different.\nBy the 4th century, it had permanently split into eastern and western halves, each with its own emperor.\nThe last emperor in the west, Romulus Augustulus, was overthrown in 476 CE in a military coup.\nBut the Germanic general who replaced him didn’t make sweeping changes.\nRoman political and cultural life endured, and military conquests continued— at least until the eastern Emperor Justinian led a devastating invasion of Italy in the 530s.\nIn the east, the Roman Empire survived for a thousand years, becoming what you now call the Byzantine Empire.\nThat makes contestant number 3 our big winner!\nEnjoy the spoils!\nAs for our losers, better luck next time.\nHere's hoping there is one.\n",
