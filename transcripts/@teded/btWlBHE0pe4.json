  "cleanText": "You are the only you that's existed\nin all of human history.\nYour experiences are yours\nand yours alone.\nSome of those experiences have taught\nyou things that are absolutely\nworth sharing with an audience.\nAnd that's what we're here\nto learn how to do.\nOnce you've found an idea that you're\nexcited to share with an audience,\nyou're ready to start\nputting a talk together.\nThe purpose of a talk is to say\nsomething meaningful.\nBut many talks never quite do that.\nThe number one reason this happens is\nthat a speaker does not have a proper plan\nfor the talk as a whole.\nThey may have planned what to say\npoint by point or sentence by sentence,\nbut did not plan how everything\nin the talk would link up\nto deliver a meaningful message.\nThere’s a helpful word that people use\nto analyze plays, movies, and novels.\nIt applies to talks, too.\nThe word is throughline.\nThe throughline of a talk is the main idea\nthat ties together everything\nthe speaker presents.\nEvery talk should have a throughline.\nThat doesn't mean a talk\nmust only cover one topic,\nor only tell a single story,\nor proceed in only one direction.\nIt just means that everything\nin the talk\nshould connect to support the main idea.\nHere’s the start of a talk\nwithout a throughline:\n“I want to share with you some experiences\nI had during my recent trip to Cape Town,\nand then make a few observations\nabout life on the road.”\nNow here’s the start of a talk where the\nthroughline is made clear from the start:\n“On my recent trip to Cape Town,\nI learned something new about strangers,\nwhen you can trust them,\nand when you definitely can’t.\nLet me share with you two\nvery different experiences I had.”\nThe version without a throughline\nmight work for your family,\nbut the version with a throughline is\nmore exciting for a general audience.\nHere are the throughlines\nof some popular TED Talks:\n“More choice actually makes\nus less happy.”\n“Vulnerability is something to be\ntreasured, not hidden from.”\n“Let’s bring on a quiet revolution—\na world redesigned for introverts.”\n“A history of the universe in 18 minutes\nshows a journey from chaos to order.”\n“Terrible city flags can reveal\nsurprising design secrets.”\n“A ski trek to the South Pole\nthreatened my life\nand changed my sense of purpose.”\nRemember lesson one when we compared\na talk to a journey\nthat a speaker and an audience\ngo on together?\nIf a talk is a journey,\nthen the throughline is the path\nthat journey takes.\nFollowing the path of a throughline\nmakes sure there are no impossible leaps.\nBy the end of the talk,\nthe speaker and the audience have arrived\ntogether at a satisfying destination.\nSo, how do you figure\nout your throughline?\nPick an idea that can be properly explored\nin the time you have to give your talk.\nThen make sure everything you include\nin your talk links back to this main idea.\nCreating a great talk that fits into a\nlimited period of time can be hard work.\nBut there’s a right way\nand a wrong way to go about it.\nThe wrong way is to include all\nthe points you think you need,\nbut cover them as briefly as possible—\nmaybe skipping out on details or examples.\nYou can create a short script this way\nwith every topic you want to cover\nincluded in summary form.\nYou may even think there’s a\nthroughline connecting it all together.\nBut throughlines that connect a great\nmany things don’t often work.\nIf you rush through many different topics\nwithout exploring them deeply,\nyour points won’t land with any force.\nIt’s a simple equation:\noverstuffed equals under-explained.\nTo say something meaningful in a talk,\nyou have to take the time\nto do at least two things.\nFirst, you have to show why\nwhat you have to say matters.\nWhat is the question\nyou're trying to answer?\nWhat's the problem you're trying to solve?\nWhat's the experience\nyou're trying to share?\nSecond, you have to flesh out\neach point you make\nwith real examples, stories, and facts.\nThis is how an idea that’s important to\nyou can be built in someone else’s mind.\nTo give a really good talk,\nyou may have to cut back on how\nmany topics you want to cover\nand instead focus on a single\nconnected thread— a throughline—\nthat you have time to present\nthoroughly and completely.\nThis is the right way to make a great\ntalk fit into a limited amount of time.\nYou may make fewer points than you\nwould without a throughline,\nbut the points you do make\nwill have more of an impact.\nLess can be more.\nChoosing a throughline\nwill help you determine\nwhich topics to include in your talk\nand which to leave out.\nIt will help you filter out anything\nthat doesn't connect to your main idea.\nIf you’re having trouble focusing\nyour throughline,\na good exercise is to try to say it\nin no more than 15 words.\nWhat is the precise idea you want\nto build inside your listeners?\nWhat do you want them\nto take away from your talk?\nHere are some questions to ask yourself\nas you’re working out your throughline:\nIs this a topic\nthat means something to me?\nDoes it inspire curiosity?\nDoes it offer the audience a new way\nof looking at something?\nIs my talk a gift?\nDoes it ask a question?\nIs the information fresh\nor unexpected in some way?\nCan I truly explain the topic\nin the time I have,\ncomplete with necessary examples?\nDo I know enough about the topic,\nor do I need to do some research?\nDoes this topic connect to my experience?\nWhat are the 15 words that capture\nmy talk?\nWould those 15 words make someone\ninterested to hear my talk?\nA speaking coach named\nAbigail Tenembaum\nrecommends testing your throughline\nout on someone.\nSaying everything you'd like\nto include in your talk out loud\nwill help you notice which bits are clear,\nwhich bits could use more explanation,\nand which bits should be cut\nin order for your central message\nto land more powerfully.\nOnce you have your throughline,\nyou’re ready to plan\nwhat you’ll attach to it.\nWhether your time limit is two minutes,\n18 minutes, or an hour,\nremember: only cover as much as you\nhave time to really explore in depth.\n",
