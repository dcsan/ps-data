Welcome to another episode of the TwiML AI podcast. I am your host, Sam Cherington. Today I'm joined by Ben Wellington. Ben is deputy head of feature forecasting at Two Sigma. Before we get going, be sure to take a moment to hit that subscribe button wherever you're listening to today's show. Ben, welcome to the podcast. Thanks. It's nice to be here. It's great to have you on the show. I'm looking forward to digging into our conversation. We're going to be chatting a little bit about how LLMs and GenAI are changing the way you approach problem solving there. To get us started, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background. Uh, sure. Yeah. Uh, my background is in natural language processing. Uh, so, you know, that's anything having to do with computers interacting with human languages. And I like to say I got into it before it was cool. Uh, back before Siri, before, you know, it just sounded neat when I read a description on NYU's website of a research area. Uh so I didn't realize that I was stepping into this large part of the future but but hence that's what I did. Yeah. Here we are on this podcast, right? I mean who would have guessed? Um so I did my PhD in machine translation and it was it was a different time back then in this space. Uh you know looking back there was this tension between empirical natural language processing, which is like if we have enough data we can solve all our problems, and then sort of the more syntactic approach, no, no, we need to understand noun phrases and verb phrases and uh and you know even so much in the '90s, right, up hired a bunch of grad students to draw uh sentence tree diagrams uh to make the Penn Tree Bank, which was like the preeminent data set. I mean if you were in natural language processing in that period, you knew Pentry Bank, right? That was, you know, and and you slept thinking of verb phrases and adjectives and, you know, you had nightmares. Um, and so it was, yeah, it was it was a cool time. And there was this tension, how much do we really need to know about language to sound like we're speaking language, right? Do we need to do we understand the depth of of syntax or can we just go the data route? And I I think looking back, the data route clearly won out. And we we we can talk about that journey today, but uh it's definitely been it's been interesting. Tell me a little bit about your journey to and at Two Sigma. Your title is deputy head of future, sorry I keep saying future forecasting. Future forecasting. What is future forecasting there? So at Two Sigma, we're an investment manager and ultimately we're trying to invest in instruments that we trade that and and to do that we want to predict the future price of things, right? So to do that we have to kind of, whether it's a company or a currency, right, we have to understand a lot of information about say a stock, let's say, you know, IBM, and uh and use all that information to make predictions about the value of that.\nUh and to do that we we think of this breaking down, we think of breaking down the world into features. Uh where a feature is just sort of a interesting observable fact of interest about something. We we we have philosophical debates about what is a feature. Uh and so the the idea is that for a company like IBM, there are thousands, tens of thousands, maybe millions of features that might tell you about it, right? It's sales numbers, the number of computers, the you know, the people who work there, where they came from, the board, the stock market prices, and for each of those, if we can quantify them, if we can measure them and record them, then we can use them to predict what happens next. And so this idea of feature forecasting is to make a lot of interesting features about the world and then use those features to forecast uh about what's going to happen in the world. So, this reminds me of the, I don't remember when we started doing this, but uh you know, the Royal Wii, I guess, but like we're going to take satellite imagery as it passes over Walmart and count the number of cars in the parking lot and use that to predict share price, that kind of thing. That would be an example of a feature, which is like the number of cars in the parking lot at any given hour would be a feature for sure, right? That that's a that's a very interesting feature you could get from a satellite image. That's a great example. And it it sounds like it's uh maybe correlated, you could say, with the way we use feature for in the context of a machine learning model, but it's not necessarily like it's meant, it's more like an abstraction, uh an abstract idea, but they end up being machine learning model features, like it's highly correlated. I mean, we think the term probably derives from our use of machine learning on all of this data, so it's not just correlated. It's probably accurate to say that's that's the connection that ultimately you can do a lot of things. I mean, I can take that satellite example you just you just said and do something very simple with it, which is to say, all right, well, I see a 30% increase in cars in the parking lot, so I'm going to predict a 30% increase in sales, you know, that's not machine learning. Um, it might be if you use machine learning to extract the car count from the to make your feature, right? But ultimately that feature is going into some linear math. It's quite simple, but it's still a feature, right? Um, and another way you would do it would be to combine that with thousands of other pieces of information into a neural network and and then it's truly a feature in the sense that that you're referring to. So, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of overlap.\nI I want to kind of understand like, you know, how you, maybe even like a day in the life of like a feature forecaster, like how do you how do you go about the role or how do you think about the you know, prototypical uh you know, workflow that you're working on. Ultimately, our goal is to find data and features and predictions in as many places as we can, right? So, what does a day in the life look like? I don't know. You're walking by a target and you see a help wanted sign in the window and and then you say, \"Oh, I didn't know they're hiring here. That they're interesting. That's growing.\" And then you say, \"Oh, well, you know, maybe that means they're doing well.\" And then you say, \"Oh, well, can I measure employee hiring across all companies that we trade?\" Well, how would I do that? Okay. And you do a bunch of sort of and then and then and then following this sort of inquisitive detective style work until you might say, okay, hey, look, companies post job postings on their websites. So I can start to collect that data and if I can analyze it, I can start to create features about open roles for every company. Uh once I do that, it's not that complicated to think about, all right, I have all this data. What are some hypotheses that might come out of hiring? You know, is there an increase in hiring seasonally since last year? Uh do we see this movement? And uh what what we tend to do is start with a hypothesis.\nWe test that hypothesis by essentially collecting data historically. So I'm not only do I need that job, this this is the hard part. Not only do I need the job postings there today, but in theory I need historical views of those job postings. And so let's pretend for a second that I have 20 years of companies job postings, which is hard to build, but let's just give me that. Then what I can do is I can go back in time and for every day I can see what the world looked like on that day. And I can use it to see what happened to that company over the next week, month, year, whatever. And so I can test my hypothesis. Hey, is it true that an increase in job postings leads to an increase in share price? And and it's just a scientific statistical test. If the answer is yes, maybe I'm going to end up using that as a trading signal eventually and build what we call a model, which is basically something that takes data in and makes predictions about future prices of the assets we trade.\nAnd that 20 year, I can't stress enough, you know, where do you find 20 years of history on a company's website? That is that is the interesting challenging part about this work is timestamps are so crucial. Um we typically in order to get 20 years of data, a lot of the time you have to say, okay, let me start recording this and I'll come back to it 20 years later, which is a very forwarding way. 20 years you'll be able to do your job, right? Right, exactly. So you know, obviously 20 years is a big, but maybe I maybe there are many things that I've been recording for five, six, seven, eight, 10 years that we're now able to do or even 15, right? Um so you have to have people used to ask me, hey, what data should you be recording? What what should we record? And and the answer was always anything that might be interesting in the future. I don't care if it's interesting now. It's like this is a time capsule. If you hit record today, this is a gift to either you in the future or another researcher at the firm who's going to suddenly have this rich history of data to then go and study because if you don't have that historical data, a lot of data just disappears like forever. There's no recording of it. Uh there's a great example which is we worked with a news uh you know, a newswire and they would send us news stories about companies and one day we get this call. Hey, uh I heard you have a recording of our news. Can we can we buy that from you? Um because a news company, they don't mind rewriting their headlines. They don't mind changing, adding little topics, editing, and so they don't actually know at noon on this day what they actually had sent. They only knew the edited version. And so we kind of had this beautiful real- time history of the world that that many people didn't start recording uh you know, in the early days of the company. People didn't really realize how important recorded history was. I've got to imagine that the hard part of that, what should we record or what should we save, is really what shouldn't we save. Yeah, that's true.\nI think I think today it's it is there is what shouldn't we record and um obviously there's you know, legal issues that you have to you have to clearance to record something and so there are things that would prevent you from recording for various reasons, but in terms of things that are open to the public and available. Um yeah, if you think it might be interesting, maybe kind of sort of like let's record it and then figure it out later. Don't worry, just make sure you have access to the rawest data possible because the more you analyze it and throw out the raw data, the the less useful it will be in the future if someone wants to do something different. You know, you talked about the walking down the street seeing target, you know, uh sign. That's that's very organic scenario, but I've got to imagine at the scale you're operating at, you're being approached constantly by companies trying to sell you data that they've already collected. Like how much of your job is trying to figure out these organic sources uh versus you know, parsing you know, trying to find the needle in the hay stack of all the crap that people are trying to sell you.\nYou know, I I would say when I started the company, it was it was mostly things we recorded, right? Because people didn't even realize that that this was a this was a product that they could sell yet, right? And so so so you know, you'd have a social media media monitoring company who's used to selling Coke mentions to Coke and Pepsi mentions to Pepsi and they say, \"Well, what company do you want to track?\" We said, \"All of them.\" And they say, \"Wait, what?\" And we're like, \"All of them.\" They're like, \"Uh, that's not one of the options.\" We're like, \"Well, then that's not helpful.\" Uh so as people started to realize, oh wait, there's value in a holistic world view of of all the companies that we're looking at at once, products started to emerge and you know, big financial companies have since then created a lot of products over time. So I think you're right, in the early days it was really about recording and and just having that asset. Today there is a lot of incoming stuff. Um people are trying to sell you on different products and um I think needle and hay stack is is a good way to think of it. I mean, some of some some of it is going to be valuable and innovative and you have to use your priors, you know, what's novel here, how is this different, what's the edge to try to decide what you want to spend your research time studying, right? I I I want to study everything, uh I just have limited resources, so I have to pick and choose and that's that's what makes a good researcher somebody who who has a nose for for where to where to where to look for the next great idea. You referenced earlier the idea that the closer you get to the raw data, the raw capture, uh the more valuable that data is. Uh but I also imagine that you know, there is a hierarchy of features and like derivative features and that kind of thing, like how do you think about uh how do you think about all that? Like are you trying to do that? Well, first of all is like is your team focused on derivative features or do you just hand data over to modeling teams and they generate whatever derivative features they want and and like how does that all come together there? Our team actually is also a modeling team. So we're we're both creating the features, but then also making predictions off them end to end. There are other teams that focus a little bit more on more differentiated techniques in machine learning that tend to take the features we create as inputs. Um but we do we do\n\n\ntend to do end-to-end work. In terms of the hierarchy, it's a great point. So when I said raw data is useful, I meant in the sense that if you have raw data, you can create any of those derived features in the future. Whereas if you deleted your raw data and you made derived features and then you had a new idea, sorry, your idea, right? A great example would be you could record, you could look on television stations, and you could record the words being said and then throw out the videos, and then one day you have technology to look at videos, but it's too late, right? Um, whereas if you recorded the actual videos, then that's waiting for you as a future creation and avenue. Um, on your hierarchy point, yes, absolutely, raw data is useful because it can create more things, but it's not useful in the sense that if you have 25 people that want to use your data, giving them a pile of raw bytes is probably not the most effective way to get them to use it effectively. Right? Uh, I talked about, I don't know, looking at television stations. Let's look at an example of, I don't know, a CEO being interviewed on CNBC, um, as an example. So, I could just say, \"All right, everybody here has access to a video that we have and be done, and everyone, or I say the feature, right? It's the ultimate mega feature.\" Yeah, it's not a good feature. Uh, and so then the question is, what are the features that you would want to create and share and pass on from that? And that's where the job gets really exciting. I mean, you asked sort of what the day in the life of our job is. I think the most exciting thing is to convert that data into hypothesis-driven ideas. Uh, examples might be the number of times they touched their nose. Is that exactly right? Are you literally capturing that? You know, it's, well, if I'm not, I can go back and add it, right? Because I have the raw data. So that, that's the idea. It's like any idea you have, you could go, you could go back. We could talk about how we would do that in a bit. But any, any interesting, how many times they're blinking, are they smiling? Right? Um, there's obviously the words being said, which have a lot of value, but if you want to get even more wild, you could look at other things. How many questions were they asked? Uh, and, and you could even take a baseline of a CEO. The last 10 times they were on, they were X. What is, you know, their, the number of times the moving average of their nose touches, touch their nose is five, like red alert, uh, and, you know, you're, I'm only half joking, right? Because it is possible that nose touching is nerves, and that when someone is more nervous, there's something else happening, and thus you could, and so if I believed in that, if I did, I could spend my time, I can make that feature, and I could go study, assuming I had history, a lot of assumptions, and I could say, all right, let's take 20 years of these interviews, let's count nose touching, and let's go study it, and any one of those things could be like a cool PhD thesis, uh, but, you know, there's a lot to do, and so we're off, we're not, we're not going to that depth at all times, but, but those are the kind of ideas that we love to chase. Uh, ultimately, want to dig into like how the way you approach the, you know, capturing these features and analyzing and modeling off of these features has evolved with GenAI, but, um, maybe before we do that, is a good time to talk about how you might go back and uh, pull out these new features. Maybe I want to say, is the person uh, talking about the future or the past in these interviews? Interesting feature, right? What percent of their conversation is forward-looking versus backwards-looking? Cool feature, right? Um, historically, I might make a dictionary of, of, you know, forward-looking words. I can find past tense words. I could count, I can make a ratio. You don't need machine learning to count previous words versus forward-looking words, right? You make a ratio.\nKind of simple, right? Um, and that's sort of, you know, the one-hot encoding NLP world of a decade ago. Um, and even then it was cool, right? Like, like that, that is a real, I actually believe that could have value. And so even though it's simple, it doesn't mean it's not, it's not helpful. Uh, now let's get to the, let's get to the nose touching. All right. Could I have done that 10 years ago? I think I could have. It would have required a lot of investment, right? It would probably be a six-month vision problem, or maybe, maybe I'm, maybe it's three months, I don't know. Um, it, that technology was there 10 years ago, uh, and if I really was like, you know, nose touching, I, this is my, like, I'm so confident that that's the best thing, then I could take all my resources and I could put it on nose touching and I can make a feature and study it. The problem with nose touching is that, like, it's a cool idea, but is it worth six months of a person's time? Maybe, maybe not, right? Um, and what's so cool about this new era of LLMs is that that six months might become six minutes, right? Uh, hey, you know, did they touch their nose how many times? You know, I, I, the profound shift in the ability to study the ideas in your head and the tradeoff, the return on your investment, the ROI of these ideas. It's like that investment has been cut by 99% for some tasks. And so all these things that were on your list, the nose touching stuff on your list that you're, yeah, one day that sounds cool. You know, you have this notebook of stuff that's just too hard. And all of a sudden, wait, wait, this isn't too hard. Wait, this isn't too hard anymore. This is great. Um, and so it's a, it's an exciting time because it, it used to be you felt prohibited by the techn, you, you would chase the things that were technologically within reach because that's a good use of your resources, right? And unless you had very high prior, you couldn't do more. But it, it was a big decision. And because it's no longer a big decision, it's awesome because it's like it, you know, it's kind of like a kid in the candy shop. You're like, I've had all this stuff and suddenly it's all in front of me. And LLMs has profoundly created this, this world where you don't need a team anymore to, to, you don't need a giant project to answer basic questions like that, which makes the ability to create these features from either your head, you know, from the moment you think of them till the time you can analyze them, it's, it's just a different world. Uh, and so in some ways, it's kind of like a renaissance of feature creation right out, out of the, out of the back of these, these LLMs. Can we go through an example in a little bit more detail and talk about some of the kind of technical bits of how you approach these problems? Look like today's, today's LLMs are multimodal. So you can give them videos and ask questions, right? So it, it's, it's, it's almost sadly, it's almost unexitingly untechnical, right? What, what can you do? I can do a for loop across a thousand videos and ask, ask how many times did the person touch their nose, and I could output it to a CSV file. I know this is the simplest thing. And then, then, then I, I have the data, and now there we go. So that's almost what's so wild about it. It's like you don't, you don't even need to know anything about LLM to imagine the ability to do this at scale in a new way. Uh, and that's kind of, that's what's really changing. Like, you know, five years ago, I'd have to tell you a diagram for you about how you do this all, but, but it, that's, that's what's so profound is almost that it's, it's actually kind of right in front of us. You know, clearly a big change is just the introduction of LLMs and your ability to query these historical data sets and create entirely new features, you know, from existing data sets. What else, you know, is evolving in the way you, the way you approach things? It's funny, 'cause in some ways everything's changing, and in some ways nothing is changing. Uh, and what do I mean by that? As I point out earlier, we might have had earlier past tense, present tense ratios, right? We had, uh, one of my favorite things, I've, you know, there was a lot of dictionary work. I've got a dictionary of uncertainty words. I've got a dictionary of positive words and negative words. Um, and, and I remember looking at a plot where, where uncertainty just spiked in the month of May off the, I was like, oh, the word May. Oh, May. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know, that tells you how to one-hot and coding world, uh, uh, can end up, uh, you know, end up in, in a funny place. Um, so I think the evolution of what's really neat is in that world, you had these sort of the word, the word, uh, you know, innovate in innovative and creative are just two words that have nothing to do with each other in the old world when, when, when I was in school, right? They're just two words floating in space. It's called one-hot encoding because it's a big vector, and every word exists as a one and a bunch of zeros, right? And you don't know anything about it. And what we've seen is this, this move to embeddings, which is really neat, where instead of words just kind of existing in isolation of each other, they exist kind of floating in space, like near words that are like them. So cat and dog are kind of similar, and, you know, creativity and innovation are kind of similar. And what that lets you do is really generalize your model because now what I learn about creativity, I, I learn a little bit about innovation, right? Those words kind of coexist in this cloud. So if I learn something about this area of the, of the space, right? If I know what's happening in one quadrant, then I kind of know what's happening in all the words in that quadrant, right? It's hard to think in 300 or 600 dimensions, so I tend to think in three, you know, I'm, I'm feeble that way, but, um, but that, that really, like, was sort of the underpinning of, of the movement where, where things started to get more powerful, where you weren't just counting, counting words anymore. And I think what people don't realize is that going back to my syntax versus, uh, empirical stuff is that, you know, LLM actually, they're starting to add reasoning to them, but certainly as of a year ago, you know, the chatbot we were all introduced to, it was just trying to imitate humans, right? It, it, it, it wasn't knowledge, it didn't say, you know, cats, the dog barks because it knows a dog barks, it said the dog barks because, you know, a logical thing after the word dog is the word barks. And it, and it, it was wild to feel like this, these things know about the, just the world when in fact they're just kind of paring humans in this, in this, in this, in this really interesting way. You know, this idea of taking advantage of embeddings and kind of the semantic relationship between words as being a big shift in the way you're able to approach problems. Are you getting that kind of for free passively because it's part of this whole LLM world? Like, it's part of the way LLMs uh, are built and operate, or are you like directly, you know, building things around embeddings? Like, I remember for a while, you know, clearly it's still, it's increasingly popular for organizations to build their own embeddings and to like create embedding spaces for rag types of applications, that kind of thing.\nUm, but I remember conversations, you know, like even five, six years ago, maybe I'm thinking of like a interview with Instacart, like they built an embedding around like groceries and stuff like that. Yeah. Right. Exactly.\nUm, everything's a vector. Everything's a vector. Just walking vectors.\nAnd so are you, are you, are there use cases in which you're doing that directly as opposed to, you know, just absolutely talk a little bit about those. Uh, I mean, ultimately, our goal is to make predictions about where, you know, say stocks are going. So, uh, if I'm looking at news stories about a company and I want to make predictions about what that means for that company, right? I guess I have to build a bridge between that news story and some algorithm that's going to make a prediction. And whereas in this one-hot world, that, that was, um, there were, there were methods, it is a much more rich world to be able to convert that story into an embedding or multiple embeddings, or, you know, there's different ways you could approach that. Once, once you're in this vector space, it becomes a much more natural connection into the machine learning world, right? You, you, if you've got, if everything's a 300-dimensional vector instead of a blob of words, uh, you know, what comes downstream is, is, is, and people can imagine is, is a, a various sophisticated learning algorithms that can try to tie the thing that you're embedding in whatever creative way you want to into a prediction about the world. So it's kind of like you, you were saying before, like, you alluded to, like, same, same, but different. It's like you are doing many of the same things, like sentiment, you referenced, uh, maybe, you know, related companies, related people, building knowledge graphs, all that kind of stuff. Um, and now as you just have a more powerful way of doing it that is, uh, semantically rich as opposed to based on word counts and that kind of thing. It's more, it's more semantically rich. And so those vectors themselves could be features, right? They're, they're, you can make features about a company, you can make features about a story, you can make, so, um, and the LLM, I mean, under the hood, it's, it's embedding things, and so if you have, if, if you have access to the internal workings, you can also pull, pull the, the embedding right out of the, right out of the process, depending on, on what the software is. Um, or you could take the output and, you know, do what you embed that, right? You, you could do so many different, there's so many ways to interact. So I think the very simple way is, hey, LLM, give me the sentiment of this thing, and it gives 1 through 10, and like that, I could do that, that's very straightforward now, that wouldn't have been straightforward, obviously, years ago, but that's the thing about financial modeling is that we, we, it is so incredibly noisy, right? In machine learning, I think people don't, don't, don't fully think about the fact that in most machine learning tasks, the an, there is an answer that you could, at given the information you have. So if I have to say, hey, is this a cat or a dog? You know that you could figure out the answer usually. Hey, you know, what should I do in this car? Should I\n\n\nShould I slow down or speed up?\nThere's usually a good answer.\nThere might be like something crazy happens.\nSo, not always, but in finance, you actually, you, you, it's not clear that no matter how much information you have that there is enough information to predict with any real certainty what's going to happen tomorrow, right?\nAnd so we're making this prediction into the future, which means that the signal-to-noise ratio, the noise is just so much bigger, right?\nAnd so if we can predict an R, if you see an R squared of like 0.05, you know something's broken because that's way too high.\nLike, you know, like there's no these things that you're trying to predict are very small signals, right?\nThe the the nose touching might be real, but it's not it's not going to be predicting most of that stock price.\nIt's going to be a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny portion.\nUm, and so yeah, that's that's one of the challenges of the financial markets.\nAnd also, and so from that perspective, the the signals that you're operating with are so noisy, the fact that the LLM, you know, the fact that uh that you know, the difference between a five and a six and a seven sentiment is kind of random doesn't really matter.\nMaybe, right?\nYeah.\nOr it matters very, very little in a way that's hard to leverage.\nYou know, it's it's hard to tell.\nAnd so are these you we talked a little bit about the hierarchical nature of these signals.\nI'm curious about how you put that all together.\nLike I'm envisioning, you know, at a certain point, you know, particularly if you've been doing this for 17 years, like you've collected a crap ton of data, like you're trying to update, uh, you know, a large portfolio of features across that raw data.\nUm, you're trying to enforce some degree of consistency across that.\nLike I start to think of like you know what platform you know the what the platform looks like and what the tooling looks like and that kind of stuff to do that at scale.\nIt's funny.\nSo, one thing about Two Sigma is that that we are a we call ourselves a platform company because ultimately, you know, it's a very tech heavy tech heavy investment company.\nUm, and we have a lot of different teams looking at a lot of different types of data, but they are they are doing that together uh in into sort of a a centralized set of portfolios.\nSome other financial companies have these competing pods that sort of fight each other, you know, to try to have the best performance, and we're not like that.\nWe're we're all centralized.\nSo, we have a shared we have a shared platform um that that kind of we all can feed on.\nAnd so, what does that look like?\nUh, we try to break up the investment process into abstractions that have, you know, good APIs, right?\nSo, I talked about this model is something that predicts something, but in in in terms of a platform, right?\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means uh I have a set of inputs, right, which are going to be timestamped information and the API.\nWell, my job is to, you know, send out a prediction for every time cycle what I think is going to happen to everything that I'm looking at, right?\nAnd I'm going to do that in a loop.\nUm, and so if someone if you provide a modeler with with access to data and this API on the output of what they can predict, then their job is to connect the raw data or the features that they've read in to to that prediction.\nAnd what happens in between those two points is is sort of the the magic of that particular model or the or the hypothesis or the machine learning or or or whatever's happening.\nUm, obviously you need a lot of storage.\nUh, you need good search and um a lot of tools to run these back tests are very complicated.\nIf you're trying to predict what would happen had I made this decision over the last 15 years on the market.\nThere's a lot of technology that goes into replaying the set of stocks and what would have you know creating a virtual world where you're back testing this new idea and see how it would have done.\nSo that's all kind of built into the platform where someone likes me, I can just call, okay, here's my forecast.\nGo tell me how I did and I can put that on the I can put that in the platform and it can come back with with measurements for me without me having to think about how or what or or or what's happening.\nUm, so those abstractions are really helpful as as because you know the process of turning raw data into a portfolio has many, many steps and you know my team's responsibility is turning raw data to features then features to just predictions uh and and after the predictions another team is thinking about how to make all those predictions, combine them and build a portfolio for our company that that that's going to maximize the returns for our investors.\nAnd so the distinction there is that a prediction that your team is making is whether well are you predicting the future of the future value of features or are you predicting the future of an equity price based on features?\nUh, it sounds like there's a line somewhere between one of those things and predicting you know the value of the portfolio given a decision to buy or not.\nSo we're predicting the future price of if we're doing equities, which is where I tend to focus, where I focus and where I where I work.\nUm, we are predicting the future price of equities that we trade based on a feature based on yeah the models based on everything you have.\nBased on everything we have, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd so our role is to build a bunch of different models.\nOne model might look at CEO interviews.\nOne might look at fundamental prices.\nOne might look at, you know, uh what an analyst is doing.\nOne might and so you end up with literally thousands of of these models all interacting and they all have their own view of the world.\nAnd the idea is, you know, to keep your signal working.\nThey're hopefully orthogonal enough to one another that when one's not working, you know, and so that's how the company works overall.\nBut the thing is once you have all these predictions, you can say all right we overall we think that this stock price is going up and this stock's price going up, but how do you turn that into a portfolio that doesn't have certain risks that you're not too exposed to a particular industry or you're not you know so you have to keep everything neutral so that if something if something happens in the market we can stay balanced and so you know that's not the part that I that's called optimization, it's basically converting uh the the predictions into a portfolio that's been optimized to be kind of balanced well.\nUm, and so that's like its own research area, own their own set of researchers, their own set of technology uh that that then decides what optimal portfolio we want to be in at that particular time.\nI think um chasing down a uh this the signal that I'm latching on to and chasing down here is you kind of anthropomorphize the idea or these models having their own point of view or something along those lines as you said like it made me think of like some kind of agentic extension of that where the models are like arguing with one another about uh you know the direction that they think something is going.\nIs that a thing that you're thinking about?\nI mean, if I wasn't, I would it would be weird, right?\nI mean, yeah, you're hitting the nail on the head.\nI mean, we have these different views of the world that have been thoughtfully created by people with hypotheses, with views, uh, encapsulating from a set of features.\nYou know, some might be very interpretable and simple, some might be more complex in in in a in a blackbox machine learning way.\nYou know, we we always have humans on the end to monitor everything, but um ultimately we have all these different models with all these different approaches and techniques.\nAnd yes, do I think a lot about what an agentic approach to that looks like?\nLike absolutely I do.\nI I'm It's terrifying and exciting all at once.\nUm, but what's your best guess today at what an agentic approach to all that looks like or means even?\nMy best guess is that you have different agents that have I mean this is sort of the point of these agents, right?\nThey have different understanding.\nThey're experts on they're experts on different things, right?\nThey're one is in depth understands currencies and one understands what the Fed is saying and one and you know I I think ultimately their ability to communicate with each other and say all right well I know that this company has you know I know that interest rates important for this company.\nLet me go ask the interest rate expert what's going to happen and then I'm going to go ask the you know the weather person what's happening tomorrow.\nSo I and that's that this world of these these these these agents making guesses about the things that they're experts on.\nYeah.\nI don't exactly know what it's going to look like, but definitely an area we're we're we're experimenting in because it it clearly look any of our roles feel like they're they're heading towards uh automation, right?\nMany, many, many and and I don't think just because it's research or or innovative it doesn't mean that that that a a good reasoning LLM can't can start to fill in some of those gaps and I I find it yeah I find it pretty fascinating but also exciting because hey can I can I have 10,000 researchers at my fingertips?\nUh that that would be pretty powerful and and in some ways it feels like that's the way we're going and and faster than I would have I would have guessed.\nUm, one one thing I'll say is that what I've learned is that innovation cycles seem to be happening pretty quickly at at an increased pace.\nYou know, it is business as usual.\nNLP has always gotten more advanced over the years, but it feels like the the cycle is speeding up and so you need to be ready with a platform that can adapt uh nimly to the latest technology.\nRight?\nSo if you're going to go spend a year training up your own thing and then you come out for air and the technology you use that you started a year ago is now obsoleted, you know, that's not going to work.\nSo you really need to be front-footed and look at what's happening in the world and and and build on top of of the ability to take in modern open source approaches or work with with vendors and tools that are that are adapting very quickly.\nAnd your platform needs to be able to to to jump on and off different things at different places to stay up with this new innovation cycle because there's no time to to stop and and and build something in this space that's going to be able to keep up with what's happening.\nAnd so that's kind of that's kind of fascinating as well.\nSo interesting.\nYeah, you mentioned open source and uh you kind of started to allude to like how you think about build versus buy.\nI'm sure it's an oversimplification to say that things are moving too fast for you to build anything.\nThat's oversimplification.\nI think I think the things that you build need to be plug-and-playable with the changing world.\nCan you give me a concrete example of um navigating?\nSo, while there's a lot of interesting things you can do with, say, fine-tuning an LLM or something like that, you you're you want to you want to be in a position so that you can swap in the next model, what wherever it comes from, however it comes from, very quickly, so that the rest of your stack is not like, oh, wait, it's a new model, it's from a new company, everything, you know, now has to be redone, right?\nSo you have to design your inputs and outputs so that you can you can wrap your your a a new model around something such that it's easily ingestable into your system as opposed to picking something and then customizing on top of that one thing.\nYeah.\nI'm hearing kind of like the minimum to build is like owning the abstraction, right?\nUh so that you can swap things out and then maybe you're selectively I mean I've got to imagine that you're you know well down the road to fine-tuning your own LMS for in areas that it makes sense.\nYes.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat which which yeah obviously that's an important aspect of it but even with fine-tuning the things that you had to fine-tune six months ago you know the next model somehow is already you know risks being better at the thing you fine-tune your six-month old model right like I mean it's moving that quickly and so it's it's kind of wild you'd think that the level of depth that a that a a generic LLM has on say financial accounting statements I mean it's incredible it's in any field We've all we've all seen that.\nBut so maybe I had to fine-tune last year's model, but suddenly this year's model seems to have all that all that ability.\nSo that doesn't mean that we're not that you're not fine tuning.\nIt's just that the assumptions that you have about what you need to do might be invalid 6 months down the line as the technology starts to speed up is is my point.\nWith that in mind, how do you think about where you make those build investments?\nLike um and I'm specifically trying to get at, you know, it would be easy to say like to try to project well, you know, the LOM's going to be able to do this for us.\nAnd in fact, it's not just easy, like it's necessary in a lot of cases to say, yeah, I'm not going to I'm going to force myself not to go down that rabbit hole because, you know, by the time we're done with X, the LLM is going to be able to do that.\nYou know, but sometimes, you know, you sit around waiting and it doesn't actually fill that gap for you.\nLike, how do you think about uh, you know, uh, riding that edge?\nI mean, it has to do with your priors on how important a particular build is, like how how fast you need to get it out and and if if you think that you're in a position where you have an edge to utilize that that novel thing you're doing and and especially in a in a in an industry like finance and quantitative finance where you're literally competing for prices like like you know it's it's someone else's machine learning is against your machine learning and and it's a zero sum game, right?\nSo, you know, time matters.\nIf you're if you're 6 months out the gate before the other group, that means that that can make a big difference because um what you find, by the way, is when you trade signals over time, they get weaker and weaker and weaker as your competition starts to come in.\nAnd so, it's called alpha kind of efficient market.\nYeah, it's an efficient market, right?\nAny any any innovation you think you have, well, now everyone has access to data X or Y.\nAnd so\n\n\n, it slowly decays away over time.\nUm, so, you know, there is a time component, and you have to, it comes back to that return on investment question and your priors as a researcher of how important that particular thing is to get now versus later.\nYou know, when I think about this again, this kind of hierarchical, you've got these base-level features, you're building higher-level features, it made me think a bit of kind of the old ideas, quote unquote old ideas around like AutoML, like a data robot thing, like I'm going to just take all these features and run some statistical programs across them to like combine them in different ways.\nLike, are you doing a lot of that kind of stuff?\nI mean, it's defin, like, it's hard not to, right?\nYou're staring at this pile of data.\nI think it would be, uh, you know, I wouldn't be doing my job if I haven't explored what happens when I use them all.\nUh, so yeah, it's, it's, it's a complicated question because the risks of PE hacking and overfitting, you know, when you start to take everything at the wall, throw it, and see what sticks, there's, it opens up new scientific rigor questions.\nAnd we live or die off of, you know, whether we overfit or not, right?\nIf, if you make that mistake and your model doesn't, doesn't, doesn't trade, that's not going to go well for a modeler.\nYou can have, you can, you know, um, so we, we have to be very careful, but if you do it in a rigorous way and careful way, then yeah, I think there's a lot of exciting work to be done in automation end to end, and it's definitely a focus area that we, that we, we think a lot about and and is growing as as technology grows.\nYeah, in a lot of ways, it touches on, uh, a question that comes up in lots of different spaces around like modular versus end to end.\nSo, for example, um, I've had this conversation with a number of guests in, you know, robotics, autonomous vehicles, where, like, there, you know, the industry has a prior of like, uh, you've got, uh, you know, a sensing system, a control system, you know, you've got these subsystems, and you want to wire them together in ways that make sense.\nUh, but then there are, you know, that's kind of one poll, and the other poll is, well, yeah, let's just take all the feed, it into a model, and you know, if we have enough data, at some point, you know, the model should be able to do it.\nLike, is that a tension that you have to?\nI mean, yeah, absolutely.\nIt reminds me, yeah, again, back to my, my days in the PhD program, where, where there was this sort of syntax versus enough data view, and there used to be this, uh, competition for who can make the best, uh, you know, machine translation system, and there were all these fancy algorithms, and one day Google entered, and they had, you know, the 5-year-old y old algorithm, but they had this massive model, like 10 times bigger, 100 times bigger than anyone ever had, and they beat everybody.\nAnd everyone was like, \"Wait, like, we have all these fancy ideas, and like, yeah, but we have a lot of data.\"\nUm, and it kind of changed, it, it changed the world.\nAnd so I think with enough data, you can start to do really interesting things.\nAnd so yes, even, even I, I described to you these abstractions.\nI'm in modeling, and my job is to turn data into forecast, and someone else does that.\nYou know, what does the world look like when you just hook raw data up to, you know, a portfolio, and you, you, you, you start to take away those abstractions, what, what new things, and there, there's definitely a tension there.\nI think that if you, if you, if you force yourself into a set of chain events, you might, you might lose a lot of the power of machine learning because at each handoff point, you, you've stripped things down into your assumption of what matters, and that algorithm might disagree, right?\nI, in fact, machine translation is a great example of that.\nIt used to be, uh, voice to text, text to text, text to voice, right?\nSo if I wanted to go from English to Spanish, it would go English, you know, I would say it, it would turn to text, then they would use a backend model, then they would generate.\nNow it's just, you know, they don't, that's not how these things work anymore.\nThey, they've hooked the language.\nThey know how to convert it from audio to audio.\nIt's not, it's not running any text in the background.\nIt's an exact example where if somebody had forced that hop, you would actually have a less good system than we have today when they said, \"Oh, look, let me remove these abstractions that humans have added and just let the system go with enough data.\"\nAnd turns out that can work incredibly well.\nSame time, I'm thinking of a conversation I had with, uh, Scott Stephenson, who, uh, founded a company called Deepgram Graham that's in like the, uh, speech to text, text to speech space, and one of the things that he observed is that, you know, while m, while skipping, yeah, like staying in the audio domain can be really powerful, sometimes jumping into the text domain is useful because as us humans, we can't look at the spectrogram and like intuit anything about it, uh, but like text is useful for debugging, like for understanding the, the system.\nAre there, uh, analogies, uh, in your space, uh, along those lines?\nYeah, I think interpretability is, is an interesting thing, and as you go more end to end, you lose more of that visibility into the world, right?\nAnd I, I get asked a lot about how comfortable, how comfortable are we with black boxes in in investing, right?\nWhen this, these are big decisions we're making.\nAnd I, what I like to say to people is, \"Well, have you ever gotten, uh, under general anesthetic?\"\nSay, \"Well, yeah.\nI mean, when I got my wisdom tooth out or something.\"\nOkay.\nDid you know that, you know, modern science doesn't actually know how that works?\nWe've just tested the inputs.\nWe've tested the outputs, and we've grown comfortable with enough data that that general anesthetic has particular properties.\nAnd we in medicine are comfortable enough to to utilize it by just having very careful measurement on on on the input and output.\nAnd so, I see, I love interpretability.\nI think I'd rather, by the way, have a medicine that people understand.\nDon't get me wrong.\nUm, I think that's a, that's, that's a more comforting thing, and and and you'd have higher priors.\nBut if you study something enough that interpretability maybe isn't as important, and maybe our ability to understand it might, you know, might not even, it might not even, if it could be explained, it might be that the thought is so complex that it would be hard to explain even in the most perfect world.\nAnd so I, I tend to prefer interpretability.\nI, I have higher prior when I understand what's happening, and it's all belts being equal, like AAM's razor, simple is better.\nUm, but that doesn't mean that we should be so naive that that that we can turn away anything that we don't understand.\nAt the risk of bouncing all over the place here, I'm, uh, remembering you mentioned open source and, um, and kind of going back to that platform conversation.\nI'm curious, like, uh, you can, you articulate, like, what you, you know, like, are you using one of everything, or are there specific, do you have strong feelings around, like, you know, 03 is, you know, the state-of-the-art for us, and we're doing everything with XYZ, or we've hard pivoted to Llama 3 and use it for everything, like, or, you know, so, you know, one of the interesting things about these models is, remember how I told you that we're terrified of temporal leak package, you know, timestamps matter.\nSo, it is kind of scary for us to use a, a, you know, off-the-shelf model that's been trained on data in 2020 to ask questions from a document in 2019, right?\nSo, if I could say, hey, here's this Enron conference call, you think it's good or bad?\nIs the word Enron going to trigger a negative reaction?\nBecause, you know, somewhere deep in the psyche of LLMs, it knows there was a big bankruptcy.\nAnd so you, you have this sort of sneaky look-ahead bias that that could kind of type in.\nSo, you know, in in the build versus buy world, there are risks to using these off-the-shelf things because you can't control the data that's going in, and and you might fool yourself.\nUm, and so that's one reason why we, we do prefer open source, more controlled experiments, because we, we know what went in, and we know that what we're seeing, we can actually, actually believe in.\nIn terms of the best model, you, by the time I answer the question, it would probably be different, right?\nUm, so I guess my quick answer is no, we're not, it's not the kind of thing where, I mean, I look, I have opinions, this is working now better than that at this task and that task, um, but nothing that it's clear that this is going to be a iterative process where different, there's going to be different advantages to different models are going to be hopping over each other, it's going to be happening rapidly, and there's not going to be a horse to bet on, you're, you're going to be well suited to have a, a diversified set of inputs to to, you know, build interesting and orthogonal outputs, and and you need to be comfortable using a wide array of technologies, not just kind of betting on a single one.\nBut can you say something to the effect of, like, given your preference towards open source and understanding, uh, the, you know, training environment, data recipe, whatever, of a model, um, you know, you've been able to shift, you know, you know, some significant percentage of your workloads to open source models, or, you know, conversely, you know, the model, yet another feature in this basket of features, and you train all of your data on all of the models.\nAnd it's just, you know, one level higher that you go to make sense of things.\nYeah.\nI mean, I kind of, if I could snap my fingers and train all my data on all my models with little, little, I think I might, I mean, it's nice to have it all there, right?\nI then I wouldn't have to run any experiments.\nSo, I love, I love that concept, and I, I think actually a colleague of mine last week was, was framing it basically as combinatorial research.\nRight.\nExactly.\nRight.\nUh, the ultimate scary place to go and not, not get buried.\nUm, and so, you know, I think there's real truth to that.\nI do, I do think that when you're making a prediction about what's going to happen, much like we have different models that combine to make Two Sigma's forecast about what's happening next, right?\nThe model looking at this data, that data, so too is there value in in having an ensemble of of LLMs that each have their own strengths and weaknesses.\nAnd it's not, we, I, I'm not always, I'm not looking at the best at things.\nI'm looking for, you know, a group of things that each have their own take that when I average out among them, I'm better off and more robust in the future than had I just picked one.\nSo, yeah, I'm not, I, I, I really am of the belief that that there are pros and cons, and and that in itself is a strength because it builds orthogonality, which when you combine orthogonal signals, you get a much smoother, you know, response than than than when you when they're correlated signals.\nAnd you kind of said something that alluded to, um, you know, just like, you know, all your data is timestamped, you know, maybe all of your models are timestamped, and you have like a, you know, a model with a 2019 perspective or a model with a 2020 perspective, uh, you know, etc.\nUm, are you, you know, and again, speaking of combinatorics, like that explodes really quickly, like another dimension yet, just yes, another dimension to add to the factorial.\nYeah, it's very, it's, it's, you're exactly right, and so, but it sounds like you are doing some of that.\nYeah, I mean, ultimately, look, we've always done that, right?\nSo if I'm training even, even a linear model, uh, there's different ways you could do it.\nIf I'm trying to predict the, the nose touching as a predictor of of of a company's, um, performance, right?\nI could, if I take my entire sample and I calculate some, some beta between the number of times they touch in the company performance, then I'm guaranteed I just overfit my data, and it will work on my, but it won't work in the future, but it'll certainly work on the history, right?\nSo what's a, what's a better way to do it?\nThe better way to do it is to kind of think about this temporally and say, okay, well, if I had the data from, from 2000, 2010, what would I have done in 2011?\nAnd then, you know, so we, those, those are some small changes you can make to to avoid.\nNo, you're still fitting because you still have to be careful.\nIt doesn't solve all your problems, but, but yeah, we've always lived in a world where, where you have to be very careful to not get future data, uh, in in your experiment.\nAnd the thing about complex machine learning is if you happen to give it a leak into the future, it will find it.\nYou know, uh, like a linear regression might not find it, but a, a neural network that sees, oh, wait a minute, I already know this, you know, it's going to pull whatever weird, uh, hole you might have accidentally given it and and pull hard and and, you know, and be successful.\nSo, I, I think time is, is, is so important.\nSo, what measures do you take to prevent that kind of data leakage?\nWe're pretty strict about timestamping our data at the company.\nAnd so, I say all data is a time series.\nPeople say, \"What are you talking about?\"\nI'm like, \"Well, every piece of data has a time stamp on it.\"\nWhat do you mean?\nYou know, I mean, yeah, tell me.\nWell, you know, the, the, and if you think about it, all data came to exist at some point.\nUh, and so you can inherently add a timestamp to almost any data.\nAnd if you do that, and if you're careful to make that data, that that time stamp, the the creation date of that data, then you can easily query, hey, I want to join my, my information, but only backwards in time.\nAnd so if you constantly are only looking backwards in time, then you, you kind of save yourself from that leakage.\nNow there are risks because vendors don't always, uh, you know, abide by the same rules.\nFor example, let's say a company wants to track the S&P 500 stocks, and and they're going to give me, you know, the website job postings of S&P 500, and they come and, oh, I've been, I have all this data on the S&P 500.\nSo they give me a 10-year dump.\nBut the problem is, if they gave me a 10-year dump of the S&P 500 today, and\n\n\nThen they gave me 10 years of history that has look-ahead bias because 10 years ago, we didn't know who the S&P 500 would be in 10 years.\nSo all I have to do is buy all those companies for all 10 years, and I will make a lot of money.\nYeah.\nBut and think that I'm a...\nOh, all I have to do every time someone hires someone, just buy stock, and I would make so much money, right?\nBut it wouldn't be real.\nIt wouldn't generalize to the future.\nNow, the vendor is not doing this because they're trying to trick you.\nThey just don't think temporally in that same way.\nUm, and so, you know, you do have to be very vigilant in the time stamps people put in and and and to make sure that that leakage doesn't come because again, in the world of modern machine learning, that leakage can be...\nIf you think that you have this model that's so performant and you're being tricked, then you know it's not going to...\nThat's not going to show up in its live trading, and you're going to notice that and eventually turn that off, but it's going to be a waste of your time.\nSo thinking about forecasting and predicting the future, what do you predict for the space, and what are you excited about, you know, coming down the road?\nI got to say, I think the your your question on the agentic stuff is is is quite exciting.\nIt's hard to for all of us in all in in many fields to wrap our head around what's going to happen in the next six months to a year to two years, sorry, five years down the road.\nUm, I'm I'm excited about the the increase in efficiency that brings and the ability to convert ideas into signals at a faster and faster pace because, you know, then you can just take your most creative people and create data out of them, you know, at such rapid speed, and that's that's that's that's really exciting and opens up so many different avenues.\nUm, and of course, it opens up challenges, right?\nAs as these tools and as the LLMs get stronger, if they're able to code as good as, you know, your your your junior uh engineers or able to do research as good as your, you know, what what does that mean for the future of of of a company like ours and who we hire and and and training and things like that?\nUm, so I think that that's the challenge, but I think that the upside outweighs some of those challenges uh in that the the opening up of of of data is just so profound and exciting that that that that keeps me excited to come to work every day.\nWell, Ben, thanks so much for taking the time to jump on and share a bit about what you're up to and what you've learned.\nYeah, I enjoyed it.\nThanks for thanks for the chat today.\nYeah, thank you.\n[Music]\n",
