  "cleanText": "This week on The Futurists, Peter Hinssen is back. We now live in a world where, I mean, you have so much techno-optimism, and I think we all share a lot of that. But at the same time, there is more confusion, there is more disinformation, there is more uncertainty than ever before.\n\n[Music]\n\nHi, I'm your host Brett King. I'm with my good pal Rob Tercek. He is, uh, in, uh, uh, the land of Los Angeles, which has been getting a lot of media attention, uh, lately. Rob, um, how is it living in a state under martial law with, uh, tanks running through the streets and Marines patrolling? That's what it appears like on TV right now. Right. I was just going to say that it's, uh, it appears like we're, we're having a kind of a, you know, state of emergency here. Uh, the truth is, in Los Angeles, there is no emergency, and this is just the fact. I live here. Um, I've been traveling around town all week, uh, for business. Everything's calm, the weather's great, people are cool, like everything's fine. There is a set of demonstrations happening downtown in a four-block radius near city hall by the federal building. And the reason for those demonstrations is that for the last couple of months, uh, the federal government has been trying to round up undocumented workers, people who are from other countries who don't have the proper documentation to be here. And while that's a proper law enforcement policy, and that's something the president made very clear when he ran for office that he was going to do, everyone predicted that if he attempted to do mass roundups, it was going to create some unrest. And in fact, here we are. Uh, Los Angeles is reputedly the home to more than a million people who are undocumented. So this is kind of ground zero for those roundups. And, um, what's interesting is that people who are here who are, uh, from other countries who are undocumented workers, they've been using social networks to communicate. And when they see unmarked vans coming, uh, into a neighborhood, they start to communicate with each other. And they kind of created an ad hoc alert system, uh, to basically run away from these roundups. Um, meanwhile, other people in California, these are not necessarily the undocumented workers or the people from other places, maybe their families, maybe their relatives or their friends and neighbors, they're starting to band together to protest against these raids. And it is quite scary. Uh, you have a bunch of unmarked vans pull up, a bunch of guys get out, they're all men. Uh, they have no uniforms. They're wearing black SWAT gear or sometimes just blue jeans and a hoodie. Uh, they have masks on, and they have no identification, and they just snatch people at random from the street, from parking lots, from shopping centers, and, um, I mean, that's quite a scary scenario. You can, and they, and they are, they're going to, uh, immigration hearings, not necessarily taken to a, they're, they're deported immediately. Sometimes they're taken to a plane and they're deported. No, no, I mean that they're going to people who are going through the legal process right now for legal immigration status, and they're taking them from the immigration courts, and, and separate issue, but yes, same problem. But, you know, but here's the problem is that, you know, the, the argument's always been, well, these people need to follow the legal process, but you've got some people in the legal process that are still being caught up in this right now. You've got citizens who've been, the people who are following the legal process is the federal government. They are making it up as they go. Trump is turning ICE, which is the Immigration Customs Enforcement Group, into his own private militia, and they're literally snatching people off the street. Needless to say, there's a lot of anxiety and fear, uh, from that. Not from the, not from the immigrants and certainly not from the demonstrations, but from the federal government's intrusion into neighborhoods and snatching people on the sidewalks. So, in a town not too far from LA, a town called Paramount, it's only, it's 16 miles away, but it's definitely not in the city of Los Angeles, there was a big showdown where people came out on the street and they started to chase away these, uh, ICE officers from the immigration authority. Um, for that reason, that's been the pretext for Donald Trump to send in the militia into, uh, into the city of Los Angeles, which has nothing to do with any of this. And so now he's deputized, uh, the, the state National Guard, the California National Guard. The president, without really proper authority, has, has deputized the National Guard. He sent these troops in to surround city hall, to surround the federal building and so on. Um, now, of course, that's a magnet for protesters. So now we do have the conflict, but it's kind of an engineered conflict. And candidly, the pictures you've seen on TV, you know, somebody called two Whimo cars and set them on fire. So that's good video for television, but it's, it's two cars. It's not like a thousand cars. The reason I'm saying that is our, our journal, our, our, um, politicians on the political right in the United States are on the news every day saying that LA is a hell hole. There's an insurrection. There's a war zone. It's civil unrest. It's worse than the Rodney King riots. All of that is untrue. I'm here and I can tell you it's a peaceful town. There's a small protest, a few thousand people max. Most of the time, fewer than that. And then the funniest irony of all is, um, there's controversy about the use of the National Guard troops. So in fact, they're not able to engage. They're just standing in a line around the federal building. Um, and we have the Los Angeles Police Department. The local law enforcement is protecting the National Guard and the local law enforcement. Crazy. They have to show that they've got muscle. So they're getting really aggressive to prove to the president so he can't claim that we're not doing anything, you know, that our city is incompetent. They're, they're coming out extra strong. They're using, uh, grenades, tear gas, and so forth. So they're actually provoking this crowd, and so you naturally things are getting tense. Now, here's where it gets worse. I, I wonder, I wonder why they're expanding this to other cities, a distraction from their previous blow up the week before, right? It's 100%, you know, cynical, but, so, look is viewed as taco, right? He can't stick to anything for more than a week, and his policies aren't working. So it's a distraction. It's working for him because his fans love this kind of conflict. I don't, I don't get the, the, I don't get the thinking behind this. So much of the US economy so fundamentally relies on this, uh, class of, uh, labor. Um, that, you know, it, it would be a unmitigated disaster if they were even partially successful at this. But I mean, the GOP's been talking about this for a while, so I guess, uh, you know, it's going to be a bit of FAFO, right? Well, you got two trends. There's an anti-immigrant group, right? But there's also this is great theater that distracts people from some of the really heinous things that the Trump administration is doing. And it, and it kind of shifts the blame to somebody else. Let's not get too political on the show, Robin. Remember, we got a global audience. Fair enough. But look, the whole point here is this is a great prelude to introduce our guest this week because what we have here are the classic elements of a disinformation campaign, politicians who are saying one thing, doing something else. The pressures of immigration, which are not going to be solved necessarily by politics alone. Uh, you can't deport 8 million people from any country. Uh, so we have all these dynamics intersecting in a most inflammatory fashion, and that creates a great deal of uncertainty, economic uncertainty, even families are uncertain about their future in the United States. And with that in mind, let's introduce our guest. So it's great to have a guest back. Peter Hinssen joined us, uh, a few months back in an earlier season of The Futurists. We're so happy to have you back. And Peter, you've written a book on this very topic. You've written a book not on immigration, not on politics, but on uncertainty. Is this, um, is this Peter, is this, uh, tied to sort of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle or, in a way? In a way, I, I, I do a lot of parallels with physics, so I wanted to put it out there. But, uh, I mean, that's, that's certainly the title, right? I mean, the title is called The Uncertainty Principle, and, and in physics, you, you can, you can measure exactly where a particle is, but then you don't actually know how fast it's going, or you can measure exactly how fast it's going, but then you have no idea where it is, and that kind of is, I think, the situation that many companies, many organizations are in right now. I mean, when they think they've figured out one thing, then they're completely unsure about something else, and, and how do you actually make strategy in a world where that uncertainty becomes the norm? That's, that's the whole idea of the book. I, I always was a bit of a fan. You know, the reason it was so easy for me to remember the Heisenberg uncertainty principle was, was because of the Star Trek, um, transporters. To get around that problem, they had Heisenberg compensators. Do you remember that? Exactly. God, you got to love the script writers of Star Trek. No, no, no. But I, I wrote, here's a little here. Yeah. I, I wrote the book because I, the first book I've ever, I ever wrote was called The New Normal, and I, I deeply regret that book. Um, because I thought it was, I, I don't know. It was, I thought it was a sexy title 15 years ago, and now I can't stand it anymore. It, it was, but now you do never normal, right? You talk about the never normal, right? Exactly. I mean, when I wrote that book, The New Normal, people said, \"Oh, what's the new new normal?\" And then I thought, \"Oh, maybe, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's not digital.\" Because I, I wrote the book digital is the new normal, and then I thought, ah, I was wrong, it's networks, and then I wrote a book called The Network Always Wins, and then after that book, people said, okay, it was the new new normal, and then I thought, you know, and then after a while, I thought, after a while, you start to end up, end up with a lot of news in your title. Exactly. Right. Yeah. And then I realized, well, you could have done the, sorry, you could have done the, uh, Ray Kurzweil approach, the newer normal. Right. The newer normal. Yeah. Well, or, or, yeah. I, I started talking about the never normal a lot in the last couple of years, and, and I think certainly after co, I mean, I was so, there's, there's this limonality, um, narrative out there, which I fundamentally think is wrong. So the, the idea of limonality is that, oh, you know, we're, we're, you know, we're on a bridge, right? And we've abandoned the old, the old's gone. I mean, we can't go back to the old, and, and we don't know what the new is going to be, and we're, we're like in between. It's like a right of passage kind of thing. And there's a lot of people who talk about limonality now these days. And I think, I don't think so. I don't think this is, oh, we just have to wait until the new arrives and then there, there we are. I think we have to get used to a world of constant change, and that uncertainty is something we're going to have to figure out as companies, how to deal with that. And that's why, you know, I talked about the never normal, but I didn't want to write a book, The Never Normal, but I wanted to write a book about how to really use that and leverage that. And that is really what The Uncertainty Principle is all about. Okay. So I'm living in a city where, like, everything we read about is not true, and the facts on the ground do seem to be changing, but we can't get the right information because what they're reporting is entirely biased. How do you deal with that? There's uncertainty and kind of like uncertainty cubed, I would say. What's your prescription? What's the solution? Well, I mean, it is fascinating in a world where we have so much access to networked information that it is still so incredibly unclear what is really going on. I mean, I, I loved your perspective. Yeah. I, I, I listened to a wonderful podcast on The Daily where the governor Newsome was talking to, you know, the New York Times and basically echoing exactly what you said, you know, that, but if you look at Fox News, that is a completely different picture, two different worlds, and this is, this is really ironic in a world with so much connectivity, but we see it all the time, right? I mean, look at the war in Ukraine, do we have any idea what is really going on? No, we, we don't, with more networks, with more pipes, with more bandwidth than ever before. We have no idea what is really going on. And I think that is one of the strangest things that I have observed. I, I'm, I've been in it for 30 years, and I, um, I, I don't know if you, so, let me a little tangent here, but I think you're going to love this. So, last night I was thinking, I, I was actually dreaming of something, and, and I found this, um, I was dreaming of this. So, this is, this is Time magazine special issue in 1995. Welcome to cyberspace. You were dreaming about that? Yeah, I was dreaming about that because this is actually a really important document because, um, I, when I graduated as a young engineer in 1993, I worked for Alcatel, and then I quit my job because of this article, right? I mean, this was the special issue 1995. Welcome to cyberspace. And I was reading this, and I thought, oh my god, the world is going to change as a result of this. I want to be part of this, right? I quit my job and I started my first startup because of this. And what was fascinating is at the end of this, you know, because this is all about the future's going to be wonderful. Digital is going to change our lives. It's going to be just utopia. Find out well. And there's this one article here by Robert Hughes called Take This Revolution. And I don't know if you remember, but Robert Hughes was the, the most, you know, acidic art critic ever, right? I mean, he was, I thought it was brilliant because he was, he could just dissect you, and I mean, I was just, I would love to read his opinions on art because I would always learn new.\n\n\nWords on how to insult people. That is just the pain, right?\nYeah, it is true. And he wrote an amazing essay there where he says, \"I'm not so sure this is going to be a world of disinformation. This is going to be a world where we're going to have isolation in a world that we're going to be completely connected, and this is we're going to amuse ourselves to death.\" And I, I was dreaming about that last night, and I was rereading it this morning, and I thought, \"Oh my god,\" you know, and I probably... he... you... you cannot find this article anymore online, which is, you know, an irony in itself. But to your point, Rob, I mean, we now live in a world where, I mean, you have so much techno-optimism, and, and I think we all share a lot of that, but at the same time, there is more confusion, there is more disinformation, there is more uncertainty than ever before. So, what is the recipe? The recipe is very simple. It's a combination of three things. It's, it's a, a, a complete renaissance, I think, of our future gazing, right? Um, it's the ability to anticipate change ahead of time. Prediction is going to be more important than ever before.\nYeah.\nNow, we all kind of, you know, dabble in that. We, we, we like to do that, but I think it's going to become a core issue for companies. And, and one of the things I did in the book is I went back to the scenario thinkers of the 1980s. Yeah, the, the, the pure wax of Shell, who did amazing things, and that kind of just faded away, and I think there's going to be a need for a renaissance in that kind of... you know...\nWell, one of the reasons it's so hard for companies to do long-range forecasting now is because of the very uncertainty that you're writing about in your book, it's a volatile world, and I don't just mean politically, it's a volatile world in every aspect, right? Weather is now volatile, you know, populations are moving, there's, there's shortages of resources. And the combination of those things makes it incredibly difficult to forecast, and, and forecast. I find it harder and harder to do that.\nYeah, that's right. No, that's right, Brett. We just had David Rose on the show, and he spoke at length about Ray Kurzweil and Kurzweil's principles of the singularity, and, and we talked about how we're now in that near the curve where the exponential change starts to go vertical, and the old institutions can't survive it. They're, they're too slow. They're too... they can't be flexible. Uh, now you, you touch on some of these topics in, in, in your book, *The Uncertainty Principle*.\nYeah. And that's, that's really the first pillar, right? So how do you, how do you get a renaissance of that future thinking going, and, and how do you, how do you make that idea of predictions, um, you know, the idea to anticipate change ahead of time, almost like an, an, a part of your mindset? The, the second thing is resilience. It's, it's the, the capacity of companies to survive and recover, you know, from, from sudden shocks. And the third is adaptability. Yeah. And how do you course correct, um, and are capable to, to adjust? And I think this is something where companies have known about this for a long time, but I think it gets more, you know, I think intense now. And I take one example, I think we have to reimagine some of our instruments, and, and you know, I take budgets as an example, right? I mean, it's, it's incredible to see that we're still holding on to these instruments that come from the last century, and I, I have no idea how many people put an insane amount of energy into building the 2025 budget last November, and then Trump introduces the tariffs, and you can just flush it down the toilet, and we're still holding on to the instruments of the last century, and we got to completely reimagine that.\nBut what does a budget forecast look like in a time that's so volatile? Like, like, is there, is there point in doing the exercise anymore?\nWell, so this is really interesting. If you look at actually dynamics on budgeting, we've known for decades budgeting just doesn't work, right? Um, it does provide a framework for efficient operation in corporations that are fairly static, but, um, you know, for example, um, you know, then the percentage of households in the West who use, who can use budgeting successfully to save money is like less than 15% of the population. It just as a tool, it just generally doesn't work for forecasting and managing future expenses and therefore savings, right? So, you know, households... let's...\nBusiness, you have to have a method of allocating, you have to allocate resources, right? You can't...\nSo, performance-based budgeting, and there's, you know, um, activity-based costing and things like that, there are newer mechanisms, particularly in the manufacturing sector, that have come in that, um, give you some element of control over these things. Um, but you know, you, you basically work off these are the base operational costs, and the other costs of the business can, uh, ebb and flow depending on performance of different product sectors, segmentation, and so forth. That's, that's the, um, you know, that's the company that's there now, but we, we have a, we have an annual budget, but that's directional, and it's really about priorities, right? It just tells us, well, if we want to do these things, we're going to have to set aside a certain amount of resource. The reality is that's, that's not a road map, even, it's a process, and every month we're revising that forecast. So I think the the ability to project out for more than a year is very, very difficult, and the circumstances, particularly with the tariffs and the changes that are happening politically right now, but you still need that kind of instrument to do that kind of forecasting and planned resources, otherwise you're just going to be on the receiving end, and you're going to be in reactive mode, and, and, and...\nAnd to put that, I mean, uh, because I, I'm an engineer by training, but I, I love physics, and I've always had a fascination for physics. If I put that into a physics analogy, because, you know, *The Uncertainty Principle* is, you know, the whole quantum thing, but I think this is the theory of relativity, right? I mean, Newtonian physics work really well for most of the things that we see in our everyday lives. But if the speed goes really, really, you know, almost to the speed of light, then all of a sudden Newtonian physics doesn't work anymore. And I think this is exactly the same thing in this, in the theory of relativity. The moment that you have that never normal, where things just happen faster than the classic ways that we run organizations break down, and we're going to have to almost completely reinvent a new kind of physics to deal with that. And I love that idea.\nThat's what I'm interested though. We have to reinvent it. Great. What do you do? What is it?\nWell, and I think, you know, the, the fascinating thing is, so my, the last book is, is I, I wrote a book called *The Phoenix and the Unicorn*, and it was about companies that can reinvent themselves. And for me, that is the most fascinating thing. I was getting really tired of the unicorn stories because every conference he went to, people said, \"Oh, look at Airbnb.\" And I thought, \"Really? How lame is that? Nobody in this room is ever going to be Airbnb, right?\" But I wanted to find companies that could reinvent themselves. And I, I really think there is a correlation between these phoenixes and companies that can thrive in the never normal. So I spent a lot of time to observe what makes them tick, what type of mechanisms do they use, and also what type of leadership did they use? And I think this is probably the biggest learning of, of my professional life. I, when I was younger, I, you know, I, I was a, a really hardcore tech geek, you know, a real engineer at core, and I whenever I would listen to things about leadership and culture and mindset, I would just... I thought, \"Oh my god, that is so lame.\" Right? The older I get, the more I realize that is probably the most important thing to get right. And I believe that the element of leadership in making sure that there is predictability and future thinking and resilience and agility is more important than ever before. I'll take you one example. Microsoft is probably, um, the most interesting phoenix in the world of technology. 50 years old, 15 years ago, basically a dead duck, and then reinvented themselves. And because of Sachin Nadella, and it's not because he was the most brilliant engineer in the world. It's because he completely changed that, you know, company into a growth mindset, and he built that, you know, servant leadership, and he built that collective entrepreneurship products, and shift entirely to the cloud. I mean, the guy made a gigantic strategic choice, and it worked, and it worked. Yeah. And then he turned his entire organization to support that.\nYeah.\nI mean, that is the most fascinating thing. Microsoft, even when they were going down, was a arrogant company. I mean, they were absolutely terrible. Impossible to deal with. Yep. Impossible to deal with. Now, this is a completely different organization. And, and I've seen this over and over again. Companies who can really... and, and yeah, Microsoft is is a wonderful example right now because I think they've reinvented themselves for the cloud. Brilliant. They've repositioned themselves for the world of AI. Last year, I think they were the absolute winners. This year, all of a sudden everything changes for them, right? Because the relationship with Open AI is heading for, you know, a nasty divorce. I mean, you see the, the disputes between Sam Altman and Sachin Nadella are, are, you know, culminating to the fact when Sam Altman showed up with Larry Ellison and Masa from SoftBank, you know, in, in the Oval Office on day three of the Trump administration saying, \"Yeah, Stargate.\" That was like, you can imagine, you know, Sachin Adela going, \"Oh, you... what are you going to do?\" Right?\nBut it's more reality TV, right? Like all these, all these stories are like beautiful conflicts that play well in the press. The housewives of artificial intelligence, right? It's the exact franchise. They're going to wake up and they'll be besties again. Hey, Peter, we have to go to a break, so if it's cool, we're going to take just a second. Folks, you're listening to *The Futurists* at Brett King and Rob Tersek. And our guest is Peter Hinssen. We'll be back in just a minute after these words.\nYou are back with *The Futurists*, myself, Brett King, and Rob Tersek. Our guest this week is Peter Hinssen. Um, he is, uh, got a new book out, *The Uncertainty Principle*. Um, we had him on the show, um, you know, a couple of seasons ago talking about his, his previous book. But really the key message here is the uncertainty of the future with all of these uncertainty coming, coming in, require, you know, better prediction skills or super forecasting skills, which is what we talk about on this show every time. So, um, so Peter, um, you know, in, in terms of, uh, dealing with uncertainty, and I know Rob wants to talk about some aspects of sort of leadership here as well, but how much of being resilient comes to your ability to predict what's going to happen in the future or forecast, and how much of it just depends on pure luck? You know, sort of being, uh, there at the, the right time or, or making a right decision at the right time, 'cause timing these decisions can some, you know, sometimes be the hardest element.\nYeah, timing is everything. And then the famous theory of optionality, you have to basically innovate when you can, not when you need, because in the never normal, you're always going to be too late. But I think that capacity of looking ahead is more important than ever before. So, you know, to make it really tangible, I mean, I've been talking about the day after tomorrow for a while. Very simple model. How much time do you spend on today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow? Today's the hundreds of emails you get, the Slack channels. I mean, you know, the overload of information drags down, you know, our productivity. Tomorrow is classically next year's budget or, you know, the forecast of next quarter, but the day after tomorrow are the things that could change the rule of the game. How much time do you spend on that? And the classic answer is 70, 20, 10.\nAnd I think if that would be true, I would be very happy. Reality is 93, 7, and zero. And you see that in the never normal, you know, with so much going on, we just get dragged down by our today, and we have to find a discipline to actually make sure that the day after tomorrow is there. So when I go to a board, I always ask them a very simple question. Are you spending at least 10% of your time on the day after tomorrow? And if not, you're not going to survive in the never normal. I mean,\nbreak that down for the people who are listening because I want to make sure they didn't miss that point. This is what we talked about in the previous podcast that you were on, but it's a really important point. So you're saying most people are preoccupied with today, and you think the optimal formula is about 70% of your time should be today, and the remainder should be about thinking about the future, and 10% of that at least should be about the long-term future.\nBut the reality, what you just said, the reality is people spend 95% of the reacting, 95% of their time reacting to the incoming stuff that's in your inbox and your Slack and other places. Um, and you're not really able to forecast or really even take any forward action. Uh, you're stuck in that reactive loop. Yeah.\nOkay.\nGo ahead. I'm sorry to b in there. I just want to make sure the people who are listening to the show get...\nNo. No. Thanks. Thanks, Rob. And, and then, and even, you know, dragged around by the of yesterday, which is typically, you know, what, what is the worst cleaning up the mess. Yeah, that's that's right. Cleaning up the mess. And I think, yeah, that the fact that you need to build an an ambidextrous organization which can do both is important, but the the the day after tomorrow is something that I have found is like a really nice...\nwould love to spend more time, but you don't. And how many times have you guys been involved in the strategic offsite of a company where you get invited, you know, typically in a wonderful location in a great resort with amazing food, you know, with amazing, you know, dinners and wines, and once a year, once a year they spend some time to think about, you...\n\n\nKnow the strategic far future.\nThat's not enough anymore.\nThat is not going to cut it anymore.\nAnd I think this is a very simple thing.\nIt's carving out the discipline because if you don't do that, you will never build that muscle to be able to think about that day after tomorrow.\nLet me respond to that just because this is a real important topic for me.\nSo, what, um, when I do those kind of strategic offsites for organizations, um, I've found that a lot of companies are hierarchical still.\nIt's a little surprising to me, but they're still very rigidly hierarchical in the sense that everybody's watching the CEO and the C team and reacting to them.\nAnd so what you get is kind of rote thinking.\nYou know, a lot of people might be present in those sessions, but they're really just watching a cue from their boss and then they're going to respond accordingly.\nSo I've, I've gotten in the habit now of asking the CEO and the rest of the suite to step out of the room, or if they really want to be in the room, okay, they can be, but they have to sit in the back of the room and not say anything.\nThey have to sit in the back so people can't see their reaction.\nThey can't read them.\nAnd then I said, \"Watch what happens.\"\nBecause your next tier in the tier below that of leaders, these folks have tremendous insights.\nThey know they're closer to the customer.\nThey know what the real problems inside the machine are.\nAnd this is going to be an opportunity for you to just listen and take in the reality of your business.\nIt always works, Peter.\nYou don't really even need much of an agenda because those people are brimming with ideas and they just want an opportunity to voice what's going on.\nSo, one of the problems I think we have is old business structures.\nWe talked about in the first half, right?\nUh, the forecasting process, the budgeting process, and I'm talking now about rigid hierarchies and so forth.\nWhat does a company look like?\nA company that's built to deal with uncertainty.\nWhat kind of organization would that be?\nYeah.\nAnd I think you touch on a really important point because one of the things that I love is, um, I, I think we have built organizations now to actually do transformations.\nThat's what we're really good at because you, you establish that, oh, there is a change and let's look at the as-is, then we figure out the 2B and then we go from here to there.\nThis is what most companies are now brilliant at roadap.\nAnd but that is, I think, not going to work anymore in a world that is constantly changing.\nAnd I, when you work with the technology vendors, I mean, the, the implementers, you know, the, the Capgeminis and the Accentures of this world, they have perfected that to, uh, a mechanism to go from as-is to 2B and everything from project management and GAN charts and everything that doesn't work anymore because we're going to have to build organizations that can adapt to a world that is never going to be normal.\nAnd that means I think fundamentally changes in mentality and culture.\nWe've talked about that in leadership.\nI think we're going to have to build that collective entrepreneurial mindset into the entire organization.\nBut it's also going to mean that we're going to have to rethink some of those structures and mechanisms.\nWe're going to have to rethink it architectures.\nRight?\nLook at the world of agentic AI right now, which is at the same time the biggest buzz I've ever seen, but also a complete rethinking of fluidity in IT architecture.\nThe old silos are going to be broken up.\nThe whole traditional package vendors are going to be scrambling to get people to still, you know, pay their subscriptions because we're going to take whatever we want and find a very fluid way to deal with that.\nFrom an architectural point of view, for me, Agentic AI is a perfect example of how to look at next generation architectures to support a never-normal environment.\nAnd I think we're going to have to do that at every level of organizations in order to thrive.\nYes.\nIn a way, each person in the company gets tasked with building their own set of agents.\nAnd we're starting to see companies do that.\nLike, um, you know, recently Shopify had issued an edict to all employees that they have to start working with, uh, an AI of their choice, chat GPT or Claude, and to start there, don't come to other people with questions, don't come to other people for approval on a plan, start with the AI.\nNext step is going to be build your own agent, right?\nStart to automate your own process.\nI'm doing this my own company.\nEach, uh, each department head has a, has a task for this year to develop a plan to automate most of their business process.\nAnd and actually what we're doing is we're changing our hiring plan accordingly because we're going to hire significantly fewer people in 2026, um, because we're going to leverage AI to do that.\nBut that, that is a great illustration of like changing the organization to adapt.\nI've been through this process recently.\nUm, you know, we've got this, uh, AI startup that we're, we're doing a funding round for, um, our seed round.\nYou know, Rob, I've talked about a bit with you.\nThis, uh, dental AI business where we use a smart toothbrush, Peter, with an intraoral camera where you can scan your teeth, you know, take a video of your teeth and we can detect cavities and tell you when you need to go to the dentist, right?\nBecause the biggest problem is that people don't go to the dentist unless they've already got a problem and then it's too late.\nBut in that process of getting ready for the pitch, the entire team was using AI every day and it really changed really significantly the volume of quality work that we were able to produce in, in a period of time for, for the investor stack.\nSo, um, you know, I, I've seen, I, I've already seen working practices changing, but you know, um, in larger, more traditional organizations, this is less rare.\nYou know, you, you tend to be a lot more agile, a smaller organization.\nSo, I, I mean, I'm sure you guys have the same thing.\nI mean, we can fantasize about this.\nYeah.\nAnd we can, you know, put stuff in a book and it looks really good on paper, but you're always hoping to find companies who really do that, right?\nThat's what I had with the Phoenix and Unicorn.\nAnd and after I wrote the book, then all of a sudden, you, you actually, it's almost like you, you start to find these phoenixes as well.\nI mean, I found more phoenixes after I wrote the book than while writing the book.\nAnd now the same thing with this uncertainty principle than never normal.\nAnd just two weeks ago, I was in Istanbul and I had the chance to do a keynote there for one of the largest retail conferences.\nAnd by chance, I was contacted by one of the largest retailers, um, in, in Turkey, but actually, you know, global footprint.\nIt's a company called LC Kiki.\nI, I, I didn't really, I knew the brand, but I didn't know it.\nThis is a $5 billion, you know, retailer, um, you know, active in, in dozens of countries.\nAnd I had a session with their top 300.\nAnd the night before I had a meeting with the CEO and the, the, the founder CEO is, I think, 60 years old.\nAnd the first time I saw him, I thought, you know, uh, this is a guy 60 years old, you know, and he said, \"I want to completely transform my organization into an AI organization,\" and he had me there, right?\nI thought, really, wow, this is the, the founder.\nIt's an amazing story, amazing story.\nHe started out as an engineer in a textile factory, grew up to run the factory, he was then able to buy the factory, he built it into one of the biggest factories of textile in Turkey.\nAnd then he said, \"That's not a good future.\"\nYou know, he sold the business and then he bought one of his customers, a retailer, and that's the company that is now.\nHe has 50,000 people, you know, running that business.\nAnd he says, \"Nope, got to change again.\nAI is going to completely change the game.\"\nAnd I did a session, you know, two hours with his top 300.\nAnd then he took over and he said, \"Did you listen to that guy?\nThat's what we're going to do.\nI want you all to completely rethink everything that you do in the age of AI.\"\nAnd I thought, wow, that's the type of companies that I think have a tremendous capacity of really getting it.\nUh, so let's talk a bit about that.\nLet's, let's expand on that topic.\nOne of the things that occurs to me is people don't know what to do.\nWhen you said it, completely rethink your business in terms of AI.\nMost people would not know what to do, right?\nThey'd be like, well, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that.\nAnd they're waiting for instruction.\nAnd candidly, the more uncertainty, the more people see a yellow light.\nThey're not ready.\nThey don't have a green light to proceed because they're not quite sure what to do.\nSo the uncertainty, because uncertainty will translate to risk, right?\nYou know.\nYeah.\nBut I mean, in terms of action in a company, it turns into paralysis where people are like unable to decide how to proceed and that creates a leadership vacuum.\nUm, and what I think we're seeing, you mentioned it with Sacha Nadella, which I think is a good illustration, but we also see this politically around the world.\nThere is a craving for, I'm going to call it kind of bully style leadership.\nI don't personally love the style.\nI do not like it at all.\nBut I'm just going to see people say, \"I'd rather have a strong man who makes decisions than a vacasillator or someone who's trying to find consensus where consensus is impossible to attain.\nI'd rather have someone making some kind of decision so we know what direction we're going, even if it's a hairbrain decision, uh, even if, and we see examples of this every single day around the world, you know, it's not just people like Putin or President Xi in China, but also Erdogan in Turkey, uh, Victor Orban in and Hungary, uh, really clearly people with autocratic tendencies and then a rising number of politicians elsewhere in the world, um, you know, here in the United States, for example, who are kind of following in that mode to the extent they can inside of their political structure.\nPeople seem to like it, right?\nAs much as some of us find that that kind of an offensive style.\nIt's anti-democratic and so on.\nThere's a large and it seems to me growing number of people who are like, \"Thank goodness, here's somebody with leadership skill who knows what to do.\nI'm going to follow his lead to what to do.\"\nYeah.\nAnd I think, yeah.\nAnd I, I remember last year, I think the word of the year last year was founder mode, right?\nI mean, that was all of a sudden that, that whole rhetoric, you know, I think it came from Y Combinator where they looked at Brian Chesnik and and what he did and how he said, \"I founded a company was great, then I hired a bunch of managers, it went completely pear-shaped and I had to take over as founder mode,\" and that was like, oh, it's like a new thing.\nNo, I mean, I, I'm in an Apple chapel, I built a shrine to Steve Jobs and he was a horrible guy, right?\nBut he was, he was probably one, one of the best leaders.\nI mean, when you look at the people who worked for him during the creation of the Macintosh, they said he was terrible.\nHe was absolutely horrible, but he made us do things that, you know, we, we knew we were doing greatness, but he was a terrible man, but a great leader.\nAnd he was reminds me of someone else was saying ultimate the ultimate founder.\nYeah.\nAnd I think what we're now seeing is I think that that new style of leadership that we're going to need for that never normal, I'm not saying you have to be a bully, but I think you have to, I think the leadership qualities are more important than ever before.\nI, I, I, I've been teaching at London Business School for 15 years.\nI, I got in there 15 years ago because there was a guy there called Robert Goofy and he was the, um, associate dean at the time and he brought me in and he was a professor of organizational behavior and I remember thinking, what does that even mean?\nRight?\nAnd he wrote a book and the book was called Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?\nAnd I've seen him do this multiple times.\nHe would walk into a boardroom and he would ask that very simple question to a, a room full of very, very distinguished people.\nHe would say, \"Why the hell would anybody in this company be led by you?\"\nAnd then you saw these people with enormous accolades looking down at their feet and thinking, \"Oh my god, I hope he doesn't pick on me.\"\nRight?\nI honestly think that leadership is more important than ever before in this never normal.\nAnd Satya Nadella has a style of leadership, but he, I think he is also a very, very ruthless leader.\nHe knows exactly what he wants.\nHe's not just a nice guy where everything flourishes.\nHe has a very clear plan and I think that capability is more important than ever before.\nOkay.\nBut a moment ago you said you don't necessarily think it needs to be a bully to be a leader in this uncertainty space.\nYou don't necessarily need to be a bully.\nBut now you're pointing out people who frankly sound like bullies.\nSo tell me what the alternative is.\nI, so that, that idea, what we talked about earlier, that collective entrepreneurship, that collective leadership, I think that is something which is crucial.\nI think it's capable of.\nSatanell is a great example.\nDoug McMill from Walmart is another good example.\nDoug has been transforming Walmart from a retailer that was going down into a really strong competitor, you know, battling it out with, with, with Amazon out there.\nAnd Doug is visionary leader.\nHe is capable of really understanding where to go because he led Walmart in China and in India.\nHe knows how retail is changing.\nBut he's not just, you know, telling people what to do.\nHe's building that collective entrepreneurship into that leadership of Walmart.\nAnd I think this is what I've seen over and over again with these companies.\nIt's not just you need a clear vision of where you're going.\nI think that northstar is more important than ever before.\nAnd and I think it's that combination which you can then build a consensus and build, you know, something in the organization that really, really is capable of of getting everybody on board.\nYou're not a leader unless you have followers.\nI think creating that followers is more important than ever before.\nLet me see if I can recap what you're saying for our audience.\nSo, uh, it's not necessarily about bullying people or browbeating them into submission.\n\n\nThat's sometimes what it looks like in politics because they're dealing with opposition parties who they're trying to delegitimize.\nBut in business, that's not necessarily going to work.\nYou have to build consensus.\nSo, the leadership qualities then are don't tell people how to do their jobs.\nHire great people.\nTell them what to do.\nGive them a direction.\nYou said a north star.\nAnd the second characteristic is you've got to have the charisma to encourage people to sell that idea to prove to them, demonstrate to them why they must achieve it.\nLet them figure out how to get it done.\nSo you tell them the what and the why and let them clear direction organizationally, but leave people to do the creative stuff.\nSo in the remaining time, what we love to try to do is forecast.\nUh, and if you don't mind, we'd love to put you on the spot and say, tell us a little bit about the future 20 years from now, 25 years out.\nWhat does this look like?\nCuz my sense right now is it's going to be more volatile.\nChange is going to be happening faster and faster.\nWe're going to have delegated more and more of our responsibility to machines, and that creates its own kind of uncertainty loop.\nWhat does the world look like for you, Peter, 20 years out?\nWell, I I I wanted to put that in the book as well.\nSo, um, I'm a big Douglas Adams fan, as you probably expect.\nUm, and, uh, one of my favorite books by Douglas Adams was Last Chance to See, and it was not a science fiction parody or whatever, but it was, um, actually a book that he wrote because he was invited by the World Wildlife Foundation to look at some species that were going extinct.\nAnd he wrote an amazing book, Last Chance to See.\nAnd you know, I I think it's one of the best books he's ever written.\nIt's a beautiful, beautiful book.\nIf you haven't read it, I I I strongly recommend it.\nBut at the end of this, you know, The Uncertainty Principle, I wanted to say still hope to see.\nI mean, I'm 55, right?\nI mean, I I don't live in a hyperbaric, you know, I don't sleep in a hyperbaric chamber.\nI I don't take all the drugs.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo I'm probably not going to be I'm not going to live to be 700 years old, right?\nSo there there is a finite element to to all of this.\nSo I wanted to, you know, basically ended my book write a chapter still hope to see.\nWhat do I still hope to see now at the age of 55?\nSo when you ask that question, yeah, it's it's it's right up there.\nAnd I think for me it's it's two things that I'm really deeply fascinated by.\nI think I there's the whole rhetoric about, you know, AI and I think we're getting to the point where it's not an if anymore, but a when type of discussion.\nI mean, the last Google IO, you had Sergey Brin saying, \"Oh, it's going to be just before 2030.\"\nAnd you said and Damis Hassabi said, \"Oh, just after 2030.\"\nI mean, for AI.\nFor AI.\nYeah.\nBut it doesn't really matter, right?\nBecause you know um the the level of sophistication of these new models means that they can beat any human in any cognitive test.\nSo why do you need AI to be the measure of disruption?\nIt's going to it's going to be disruptive far before we have AI probably.\nYeah.\nSo I don't care about that point.\nBut the idea that I will live in an environment where I am surrounded by that that is just the best thing ever.\nI mean, I really still want to live in that environment.\nThe second thing, and I think this is going to be crucial, is I I'm surrounded by people from the medical field.\nMy wife is a vet.\nI mean, my sister's a GP.\nOur daughter's a, you know, a pharmacist.\nI am surrounded by people in the world of medicine and biology.\nAnd I think personally for me that is going to be the most fascinating opportunity going forward where we're capable basically of rewriting who we are.\nAnd I I honestly I don't care that we're not going to be 100% human anymore.\nI really don't care.\nI don't I don't care about the fact that you know that's been the trajectory for a long time.\nLook at we're all wearing glasses.\nWe're all using these instruments to extend ourselves in space to talk to each other, you know.\nSo we adapted the technology pretty quickly.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nSo, yeah, I think you're right about that.\nAnd then look, that's a place for AI to help, right?\nTo design genomes to help design some future version of the food we eat, the energy that we create, and so forth.\nAll right.\nAnd for me, that is that is part of the excitement of being at this age, at this time, and seeing some of these things actually converge to the point where I think, yeah, and I I remain a pathological optimist.\nI mean, even with with all the scary stuff that could happen and and you know, we've we've read all the science fiction, we know everything that could go wrong, right?\nBut I am still the pathological optimist.\nBut it is the most interesting period of human history to be alive in the, you know, probably for the last 10,000 years, you know, like the the potential of humanity with these technologies, quantum, AI, and so forth.\nAnd as well as that, the fact that we are going to have to reinvent ourselves as a species, we're going to have to reinvent economics.\nWe're going to have to reinvent the way we think about life with longevity and work and yeah, it gets pretty crazy, but it's an exciting time to if you if you don't mind change and uncertainty, then it's a great time to be alive.\nUm, Peter, not to end the show.\nWe uh we recently someone asked me about the show and they said, \"Well, what do all these futurists have in common?\"\nAnd I said, \"They all have an optimistic outlook.\nThey all have different methodologies.\nThey all have different beliefs about what's going to occur.\nBut one thing Brett always says to me, he's like, I can't wait to see what's going to happen.\nHe says it all the time.\nIt's like a natural phrase.\nIt's an outlook that I think all futurists share.\nAnd on that note, I think we should bring the show to an end because frankly, I'm thrilled to have an optimistic view.\nFor once, we've had so many dire forecast on the show recently.\nThank you, Peter, for bringing it around to a positive view.\nPeter, where can people find out more about you on the internet?\nWhere can they learn about Peter Hinssen?\nUh my website www.perhinsson.com is the easiest way and two two S's.\nTwo S two S's.\nYeah, two S's.\nYeah.\nUh ww.perhson.com.\nThat's the easiest way.\nAnd uh thanks for having me on the show.\nI mean I think we share that same optimism and and as we say, if you don't take if you don't like change, you'll like irrelevance even less.\nI think that is the light motif.\nRight.\nGreat.\nFolks, keep an eye out for Peter's book.\nIt's The Uncertainty Principle.\nIt's one of several books he's written.\nThey're all good to read.\nThey're fun reading.\nGreat for managers in particular to check it out.\nSo, if you're listening to the show and you're managing a business and you're confronting uncertainty, look for The Uncertainty Principle by Peter Hinssen.\nWe'll be back next week with another futurist who's going to share their perspective about the future and the steps they're taking to create that and bring it to bring it to fruition.\nIn the meantime, thank you to the folks who listen.\nThanks to the folks at Provoke Media, to Elizabeth Severance, our producer, and to everyone at Provoke Media that makes our show possible.\nUm, we'll be back next week and until then, well, Brett, you know our queue.\nUntil then, we will see you in the future.\nYou\n",
