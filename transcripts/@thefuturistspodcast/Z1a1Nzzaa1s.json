is that once when people are satisfied with that, then there are no longer jobs for young people to go in who are at the peak of their creativity and to have these new ideas.\nThere's the market for their skills, if we're not careful, will allow that to dissipate.\n[Music]\nHey there, welcome back to The Futurist.\nI'm Rob Tercek, and this week I'm running the show solo as my colleague Brett is in route to Dubai, where we're planning the biggest futurist gathering of the year.\nWe're going to have a big event there in September this year, and uh, Brett has been very active in the Middle East the last couple of years, especially this year.\nUh, but we've put together a great, great network on the ground, and we'll be telling you more about that event that is scheduled for late September in Dubai.\nBut we are starting to gather futurists in person, not just on a podcast, not just online, but actually live in person.\nAnd we can't think of a better city in the world to do it in than Dubai.\nDubai is kind of building the reputation on the future.\nSo this seems like the perfect venue for it when you think about cities around the world that are future focused.\nCertainly, uh, Dubai is right on that list.\nThis week, we're bringing the story closer to home.\nI live in Los Angeles, and I've been in the media business most of my career, and I love catching up with people who are moving things around in the media business.\nThis is an industry that's going through tremendous amounts of turmoil right now.\nAnd this week my guest is Jon Snoddy.\nJon has a long track record in the media industry as a technologist who's reshaped the business several times, starting in radio, spent a considerable amount of time at the Walt Disney Company as a technologist there and also in the Imagineering Group.\nWe'll get into that, I hope.\nUm, but he's also an entrepreneur, and this is the kind of futurist we love to bring on the show because entrepreneurs are people who put their money where their mouth is or their put their effort where their ideas are.\nUh, and they do everything they can to bring those ideas they've envisioned into reality.\nUh, Jon started a company called Big Stage and uh, exited that successfully a few years back, and now he's the founder of Operative Games.\nJon, welcome to the show.\nWelcome to The Futurists.\nGreat to be here, Robert.\nNice to see you,\nJohn.\nTell us a little bit about Operative Games.\nOkay.\nUm, Operative Games is a is a company that's all about storytelling.\nUm, I I spent a long time um uh kind of justating this idea, probably 20 years of of really thinking about um how do you tell a story that has the audience inside the story, that where where the players, the audience are active participants.\nThey're the protagonist and and truly a fundamental part of uh of the the conversation.\nAnd um a couple of years ago we we kind of had gotten to the point where uh LLMs were were maturing enough that they could create create uh you know um believable dialogue.\nAnd uh it it started to look like it was possible to to do this dream of mine, which has been to create worlds in which you can jump into that world with a bunch of really interesting characters that are are are not just just chat bots, but but feel like real people, feel like they're designed by artists in the same way you design a character for a great book or film, and with all that care, with all that history, with all that backstory, so that everything the character does comes from something inside, some some point of view that they have, characters that characters that that seem to have anticipate their own futures, characters that have a past.\nUm, and stories that that kind of bring out uh who the characters are and and challenge them and allow you to play along with them and be challenged with them.\nSo you're you're talking about two concepts that often we think are separate ideas.\nOne is storytelling where you know the person with the gift of gab maybe enchants us with a story and the rest of us sit there and listen carefully and we're enchanted.\nUh, the other idea is games, which is much more experiential in the sense that I'm the protagonist and I'm in that world and I'm driving the events through my own decisions.\nUm, those are usually considered two separate domains, but it sounds like what you're doing is finding a way to bridge them.\nCan you talk a little bit about that?\nYeah.\nUm, there is a um, you know, there have been lots of great story games, and those will continue.\nThere's a funny thing about new media.\nNew media comes in and you say, oh, there's now film, and that's going to replace theater, and it didn't, and now there's there's television that's going to replace film, and it didn't.\nAnd you know this is true.\nThis is the conceit of every technology, right?\nWe like it's going to replace everything.\nIt's like, well, no, actually, there are still steam cars, steam powered cars available.\nIf you look hard enough, they're still around, you know, and we just seem to find space in our lives to accommodate new things if they're if they're compelling, if they do something for us.\nAnd and so this notion is what if the the story was the game and the game was the story and\nOkay, so you're blurring the boundary between those two domains.\nHow do you do that?\nYeah.\nI mean, it's again when you say it's important to to for this concept to be kind of embedded in the conversation, and that is that when you talk about a game, my goodness, there's there's thousands of types of games, you know, subcategories and categories and and all and and so many things that people love that they really enjoy playing, they go back to the same way that that when I was a kid, you I love TV shows or love films and things and and so uh um this new idea is is one in which, you know, people are complex, and and when in our lives, you know, our lives where it's sort of like this game we play where we're we're interacting with other people, with our bosses, with our employees, with our peers, with our families.\nAnd there's there's often competition in those things.\nThere's supporting each other in those things.\nThere's we have things we want to accomplish, things that that drive us forward, that that make us get up in the morning and do stuff.\nAnd I think we can build worlds that allow us to do those same things.\nThere there's a an amazing thing that happens.\nI happen to think of of books as one of the greatest inventions, one greatest pieces of technology ever created because by the way, they're still going strong to your earlier point, right?\nWe're still reading books.\nBut imagine the the insanity of of a the notion that a writer that maybe lived a hundred years ago that I will never meet, impossible for me to ever meet them.\nI can pick up a book that they wrote and start looking at those pages that are just paper with ink on them, and suddenly I'm feeling emotions that are exactly the same emotions I feel for my family, for for people that I really care about, that somehow that artist was able to encode kind of humanity into those words, into that book, into that piece of technology, and my brain is able to decode it and and it just fits right into my my my whole self.\nSo we know that works.\nWe know this notion of sort of portable uh storytelling or portable emotions that works really well.\nSo so what we're building is is imagine meeting a virtual character, and this is a virtual character design.\nAll of our stuff, our stories are written by real people.\nOur characters are designed by real people, and their backstories, their history, all of that's done by people.\nWe don't we don't go out and ask AI to to do the creative parts of it.\nWe ask AI to generate dialogue based on the character model that these artists create.\ndynamically or is it fixed?\nIs it scripted?\nNo, no, dynamically.\nOh, okay.\nSo, it's like an NPC character in a game that you can have a a real conversation with.\nI bristle a little bit at NPC, but sure.\nWell, I mean, look, that's the old thing.\nSure, that's true.\nBecause those were like basically robots or animatronics, right?\nThey did one thing over and over again.\nSo, yeah, one of the big advantages of LLM is that they can engage in a kind of conversation or a really convincing simulation of a conversation.\nYeah.\nSo, that that maybe Okay, maybe you don't love the word NPC, forgive me.\nThink about an improv actor.\nYou know, I spend a bunch of time in the theme park business, and and we would often use improv actors.\nPeople who are who know how to take on a role and then and then go out and act that role.\nThey become that person, but they're not saying dialogue that someone else wrote for them.\nThey're making the dialogue on the spot, but they're they're they're stay they stay in character.\nThey are that person.\nRight.\nSo, if you're going to be Snow White or Cinderella at the theme park, like you got to really be that cuz you're there's a there's a child there who you're either going to totally convince or who's going to be like, \"Mom, this sucks.\"\nLike, you got to really be that, but you got to really show up and commit to the material.\nUm, and you're you're able to replicate that today with artificial intelligence in the only way you can do that is, you know, it's not like I could go hire, you know, 100,000 actors to to, you know, to to perform this live.\nUm, so in order to do this, I need some way for for artists to to encode into these in into these p virtual personalities uh the decision-m that would keep them in character and allow them to to make decisions in a particular way.\nAnd so we're doing that, and and it's working, and and so when you talk to these characters, you're sort of in a sense talking back to the artist that created them in the same way you do with a book or a film or whatever, you know, and you they present you with challenges and and not literally saying, \"Here's a challenge.\"\nYou just discovered that, oh no, they're in trouble.\nYou know, this person that I met kind of cool, we've gotten to know each other.\nWe're kind of hanging around, and and then they they say, \"This could be a little weird, but I think somebody's following me.\nI'm not sure what I should do.\"\nAnd you decide what you do with that as the player.\nAnd and hopefully you're at a point in the relationship where you say, \"Well, I don't want to get arrested, but how can I help you?\"\nYou know, and now all of a sudden, there you are.\nYou and this character are on your way trying to figure out what's going on.\nAnd in this first story we're doing called the operative, it it's a kind of a spy story that unfolds and gets bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more and more characters uh show up in it, and and it's a giant cast, and it's big fun.\nLet me ask you a question about that.\nSo this notion of creating a kind of game world that you could explore on your own.\nUh, the game industry itself went through that with the kind of free range games.\nWhen I remember when Grand Theft Auto came out, it was kind of a breakthrough because prior to that um the sort of immersive worlds that we had before then were on rails in the sense that you could go to certain areas and explore, but only certain areas of the map, and otherwise you were kind of confined, and you could look out a window, but you couldn't go out there because that was like not really part of the game map.\nAnd then uh Grand Theft Auto came along, and we could roam the whole world.\nAnd of course now we've got games like Call of Duty where that's that's a central feature where you know you decide where to go and what to do and so forth, and to you you can do that well or you can fail doing that.\nSo it's on you, that's a that's important because it raises the stakes.\nIt raises the commitment, raises the verilitude.\nHow much free roaming is there in your story world?\nCan I go anywhere?\nCan I say anything?\nCould I get arrested?\nCould I get killed?\nuh in there'll be many, many stories that will be written using this sort of system that we're we've developed.\nUm, in the first one that we're doing, you know, when you're you're kind of inventing something new, it's important to um you know, I I've run research and development organizations for for much of my adult life, and and you learn pretty quickly invent a manageable amount of stuff.\nDon't try It's easy to get get over, you know, overwhelm the system by trying to make too many new things at once.\nYeah.\nOr the audience, right?\nAudiences can deal with one or two new things, but you can't give them all new things.\nThat's why we tell the same stories over and over because so people like it.\nYou know, we don't go into a movie theater and sit down and look at each other and say, uh, what story should we tell today?\nWhat direction should we be sitting facing?\nYes.\nYes.\nUm, so we go to we we we go to entertainers and give them some money to take us on a little kind of like a little ride, you know, take us on an emotional journey, and we feel like that's what people are coming to us for.\nNow again, there'll be all sorts of things in the future, but this first set of of games that we're doing, uh, we know how the story progresses.\nWe know the major milestones in the story, and and we know those because we've created some amazing moments for you.\nYou know that if you take the the I like to give the example of of uh Darth Vader saying to Luke Skywalker, Luke, I am your father.\nThat was like an oh my what just happened in the Star Wars world?\neverything just changed, and it was an an amazing like a roller coaster drop, you know, it was this crazy thing that those writers and producers had had secretly built for you.\nIt's like they they built this this amazing thing for you.\nAnd then the movie was about preparing you for that moment of getting you ready, getting everything set up so that that that move that that moment really landed.\nAnd we that's our job, I feel like, is we want to create some amazing things out there for you.\nAnd so we do need you to get to those things.\nWe need to make sure you have the information you need for those things to\n\n\nMake sense.\nSo this part of the story is a little bit, there's some guardrails to direct you towards key moments or key... and I think of it less guardrails and more magnets, you know, that we, you know, we want it to, you want you to make a choice, but the information we give you, if we do it right, the logical choice is one that gives you the information that you need for the rest of the story to make sense.\nYou can talk to any character you want.\nYou can say anything you want to them, but they all work for us, you know, and so they're in on it.\nAnd so you can challenge them, you can agree, disagree, you can be ordinary, you can do anything you want.\nWe contain all of that within the story, within the characters, uh, you know, design so that you never have this sense of guardrails.\nYou have a sense of choice and you have a sense of we need to move forward.\nWe got to, you know, there's a, you know, the clock's ticking.\nWe need to get going here.\nNow, uh, sometimes when we think about different media, um, we have to come up with a metaphor just to hold the concept in our brains clearly.\nAnd it's been said many times that TV is a river in the sense that it's flowing by constantly.\nAnd if you like something that happened a moment ago, you're not going to go back.\nYou can't, I mean, you can't on streaming rewind, but typically on a television's broadcast, it's going one direction, it flows past like a river.\nBut a game, a free-range game is more like a mountain in the sense that there's many paths and there's kind of a general direction up and there's a general idea that if you get to the top, you won, right?\nThat's a loose metaphor for a game.\nUm, which one would you say is a better model for what you're building?\nIs it a river or a mountain or something else?\nI think it's something else.\nI mean, it, it, it's, there, there are elements of both.\nUm, and a lot of this is still being invented as we go, but there is a notion of, of you're moving in a direction, but this thing of being able to choose, to make choices, to think about things, to figure things out.\nYou know, the, like in, in the, in this first story we're doing, um, there's a character that has a reason that he has to get rid of his smartphone.\nHe's on the run from the police and now he's cut off from the internet.\nYou know, we all have internet all the time and yet somehow this guy is cut off from that.\nWe give a story reason why that has happened and he, he really needs you now.\nAnd so you and he are kind of joined now.\nUm, you know, it's almost like a buddy movie where you two must collaborate and you have things you can do that he just cannot do now.\nAnd he has things that he knows about that you don't know yet.\nAnd so what would happen if you like walked away or said, \"Sorry, forget it.\nI'm not going to help you?\"\nLike, is that possible?\nYou can do that.\nYou paid for the game.\nYou paid for the game.\nSo, you know, at some point you might wonder why you paid for the game.\nAnd here's the thing is that that generally is the thing that I found is that generally people want to believe.\nThey want to be taken on a journey.\nThey...\nIt's not like they, you go into a movie theater and scream, \"No, I hate you.\"\nYou go to a movie theater because you want to see a movie.\nAnd that's really true.\nWe want to be enchanted and frankly, a lot of people want to spend more time in a field of enchantment than they want to spend in the real world.\nIncreasingly it seems, and so I do encourage, you know, all the people I work with to focus on people that want to be entertained.\nRight.\nAnd not if somebody really doesn't want to be there, that's fine.\nThat's their choice.\nBut we're not going to argue with you about that and spend a lot of time...\nYeah.\nWe don't have to persuade you.\nYou already bought your ticket.\nSo, hopefully you like the entertainment we prepared for you.\nWell, yeah.\nWhen we watch a movie or a TV show, um, the storyteller in that domain is typically a director, perhaps, or producer.\nWe might say the writer plays an important role in it, but eventually someone's the storyteller and they control a couple of variables.\nFor instance, they control time.\nSo in a movie, you can have, you know, time can be compressed.\nWe can jump forward in time.\nWe can have a flashback in time.\nWe can speed up scenes.\nWe can stretch scenes out very well.\nYou know, this is one of the one of the things that great storytellers in film manipulate routinely to create suspense and drive the plot forward and and heighten its stakes and so forth.\nThe other thing that the storyteller controls in that kind of environment is decisions.\nThey decide not only what the characters are going to do, but they decide what you get to see.\nThey decide what's revealed to you and when.\nAnd sometimes you see things in the Hitchcock way before the characters do.\nSo, you know something the characters on the screen don't.\nSometimes you find out after the fact and that's like a reveal or a suspenseful moment.\nI know I'm telling you stuff you already know.\nI'm sharing this for the audience to put it in perspective.\nBut it seems to me when we talk about storytelling in a world that's free range, I as the protagonist or the player, I have control over time and I have control over decisions.\nTalk about that as you think of the story structure that you're trying to build.\nThat must present an interesting design challenge.\nYeah.\nUm, you know, the director has control over the camera.\nThat's the huge one.\nThe director can, you know, slowly pan across the kitchen and you see the collection of knives as, you know, or the bad guys across from you and he slowly pulls focus and you see a gun in the middle.\nYou know, you can do all those those those visual storytelling things that we aren't going to do.\nYou know, we're not going to cut to things and and so we have to do those things in different ways.\nWe've chosen not to.\nNow, we do have in-story ways of controlling the camera.\nUm, I should also say that in this first game, it's kind of cool the way it's played.\nUm, in this particular story, these characters live in our world.\nThey might be your neighbors.\nThey live two houses down from you.\nUh, you could imagine them just out there in our world.\nThey have families.\nThey have jobs.\nThey have good days and bad days.\nThey have aspirations.\nThey have problems that they, they have things that they haven't, that they're not going to tell you about because they're embarrassed about.\nAnd as you start to get to know them and as you start to kind of unfold that, um, you, you begin to know, um, you know, things about who they are and what their goals are and and where they're, they're, um, where they're going.\nUm, in, in our, in this particular game, they have phones and you can literally pick up, you know, your phone, standard phone, nothing special about it.\nCall a phone number and talk to them on the phone.\nYou can schedule a Zoom call with them just like you and I are talking now.\nYou can text them.\nYou can send them an email.\nUm, and so in doing that, it heightens this notion that they're, they're out there.\nThey're...\nYeah.\nYou know, they just, he's calling me on his way home from work.\nAnd that's great.\nYeah.\nAnd so, um...\nSo you're manipulating our media environment to create the illusion, uh, to extend the illusion off the screen into the world around us.\nAnd we're not, but we're not building a giant game world.\nWe're building little bubbles of game world that are essentially like Zoom backgrounds.\nAnd there are moments where the character might say, \"Wow, this is, this looks weird to me.\nHang on.\nI'm going to turn the camera around.\"\nAnd and shows you what he's looking at.\nAnd and you and he talk about it.\nYou know, you talk about it together about trying to figure out, you know, there's a, there's a moment where you go to a crime scene.\nHe says, \"I'm going to send you a bunch of pictures.\"\nAnd he sends you all these pictures of it.\nAnd and you and this character are going through these pictures together, thinking, you know, is that a clue?\nDid she leave?\nI think she's trying to tell us something, but I have no idea.\nIt just looks like a deck of cards.\nAnd wow, that, whose blood is that?\nAnd and you know, and and so we're, we're, um, we're trying to be, you know, like it, it use the camera that way, but they, but it's not us using the camera, it's the character using the camera in a sense and and giving you little, little hints of...\nRight.\nRight.\nSo someone comes in and for a moment they're a little storyteller and they're going to tell you a story and you're going to listen and learn if you pay attention, you'll get some nuggets.\nOkay.\nSo that's pretty cool.\nSo this is like a game-like narrative or it's an immersive narrative that's, that you know, that that I can drive.\nBut that's a kind of a new concept, sort of a hybrid, maybe something, maybe a completely new category of content.\nYou know, one of the things that people should know about your background is that in addition to working as a technologist at a major motion picture company, you also design things like theme park rides.\nI think you, you did the Indiana Jones theme park ride, for instance, right?\nSo...\nYeah, the ride system for that.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd in your comments, I'm hearing some of that thought process, you know, where it's not just about linear entertainment.\nIt's about, well, there are people that are moving in space and we have to kind of, you know, create the entertainment around them.\nIt's not something they sit there and watch.\nIt's more like something they do.\nI suppose there's some lessons there from Imagineering and from the theme park world.\nTell me about the formative experiences in your career that are informing your decisions about what to do next in the future.\nUm, well, um, I have a journalism degree and then I studied electronics engineering and, and, uh, you mentioned, I, I worked for National Public Radio a million years ago.\nMhm.\nAnd there I, I, I just had my eyes open so wide to the notion of writing and and I know that sounds just silly and naive because I was naive at the time.\nBut for radio journalism, they do a very good job of pushing the possibilities of the medium.\nIt, it's, you know, you get to watch up close these people.\nEverything is a story.\nI mean, you're telling a story and it's a story.\nIt's a true story, something that happened, but you have to tell that in a coherent way.\nAnd to see these brilliant writers who, who they're good reporters, they're good.\nThey have good voices, a million things, but they're first and foremost, everybody there that writing was a thing.\nAnd and I really came to understand that and appreciate it.\nAnd I feel like I, I, I took, you know, suddenly an advanced degree in writing just by watching how those people would work and to listen to them every day and to and to know all the things that went into that, you know, to sit there editing with them and know how they put that story together and and so that idea that that that storytelling is it's a thing.\nYou're not just throwing out a bunch of facts.\nYou know, I could tell you, I could tell you 10 facts about my life and tomorrow you would remember maybe one of them, but I could tell you an interesting story about my life and you'd remember all of them because that story is how we kind of encode things and and it's a way that we communicate it.\nIt's this way that glues all the facts together and and so that that's just a place that I, I first learned that that that it's that storytelling is sort of everything.\nYeah.\nAnd people have no capacity to remember facts.\nWe get those wrong.\nWe're very, very poor eyewitnesses, for instance, in court.\nBut people do have an ability to remember stories.\nAnd that's why many of the main religions, the big organized religions are based on parables.\nYou know, you're teaching people stories they can remember.\nAnd of course, the principles are embodied in the narrative or the, you know, the moral, the lesson is embodied in that story, but you tend to remember the story quite well.\nAnd really that's kind of the wellspring, at least partially the wellspring for our modern media enterprises.\nUh, they're, they're touching those same archetypical stories that are deeply embedded in our consciousness and our culture and bringing them to life.\nMaybe a new guys, new garb, uh, a new configuration, maybe new characters, um, but still the same story structures that we've been trained, uh, by over generations to come to expect.\nIn some respect, that's consistent across all media.\nOf course, it varies, right?\nThe great thing about NPR is that they're artists in the sense that they think of all the audio information you can possibly capture that's going to drive that story forward.\nSo, one thing listeners will notice is that they always capture some ambient sound.\nYou know, if there's a river in the background or some construction sound, they always capture a little bit of that and you'll hear that, uh, you know, edited in in the background to give it kind of verilitude.\nUh, that's a kind of storytelling craft that that journalism, journalistic art of noticing, noticing what's around and then kind of reconstructing it, uh, in in the production process so that you can convey it to the reader, right?\nSimilar to the book you were telling me about a moment ago where a book that was written, you know, generations ago, you could read it today, but once it takes root in your mind, you can envision almost realistically those events if it's told the right way.\nUh, we even have these kinds of narratives going all the way back to, uh, Alexander the Great, you know, soldiers in his, uh, you know, kept their notebooks, uh, and those, those can kind of help us reinvision or recapitulate what happened in in those hands, uh, you know, thousands of years ago.\nUh, so there's a very powerful capacity of the human imagination.\nIf you just feed it enough cues, enough, uh, stimulus, you can kind of engage it in the process of co-creation.\nSo the stories really happen in our brain even though they're being presented to us through media.\nUm, and that's certainly true.\nI would imagine you had that same experience working on theme parks where it's like, okay, now they're going to live the experience, but they already have...\n\n\nAn idea of what the story is, cuz everybody's seen the film. Now we have to create that, recreate that experience in a way using different stimula or stimuli, uh, to, uh, to trigger that same response.\nYeah.\nAnd I guess how close can you get is the question, right? When you're doing a theme park ride, like you look at the movie, then you're like, \"Hm, okay, what can we do in the real world to simulate that or to, or to stimulate that response without, you know, exposing someone to a giant rolling boulder that could crush them or, you know, some other perilous trap?\"\nYeah. And it's not just, you're not doing a book report. It's not that you're trying to take the movie and make it 3D and do and recreate those scenes. Uh, it, it, it's funny if you, if you tell too much, I think in a theme park ride, people ride it and then they're kind of done. And what you really want is, you know, one of my favorite rides is Pirates of the Caribbean, and you know, you ride that thing and think, \"What the hell is going on here? I don't know what's going on here, but it,\" for your brain is just working, trying to put all these really interesting, yeah, you know, this is not random. There's something really here. And so you find yourself stimulated as you try to put that together. And that's exciting. And each time you go back, it's just, you see another thing and another clue, and, and, and you're putting things together. And, and, and you know, with, with Indiana Jones, you know, there was a, um, uh, there was really had to figure out what, what is that attraction? You know, what, what do you do with that? So we, we sat and, and had a little team. We watched the film several times, and then, and the thing that I kind of came away with is, is that was important is that that Indie, Indie represents us, that it's, it's sort of every man. It's just a regular guy. He doesn't have a cape. He's not a superhero. He's just a regular guy thrown into crazy circumstances that are overwhelmingly bad. And he's hanging on by his fingernails. And, and the fact that he gets through, we're amazed that he got through, but he's amazed that he got through as well. He's not like Superman that goes, \"Here I come to save the day.\" Or, \"Whoever said that.\" And, um, and so I wanted to, I wanted that, I wanted you as the, as the rider in that ride. I wanted this to be your story about you going through all these crazy things, and you get through at the end, and you can't believe you survived. And, and so everything about that ride, you know, I wanted you to believe that it's, it's really a truck, because if it, to the extent that you believe it's a truck, when it starts to tip over, that's bad. If you think of it as a roller coaster ride, it tips, and it's like, \"Yeah, all right. Roller coasters go upside down. Big deal.\" If you believe it's a truck, then it's like, \"Oh, no. Something, you know, I'm in trouble here. I, I, I need to, to rise to this occasion.\" And, and so that, that's just another type of storytelling where you're, you're, but, but again, it's trying to tell, trying to get you to tell your story in that, you know, make it your story. So it's not just you sitting there watching someone else's story. It becomes your own. And, and that's kind of what's memorable when you go build a place that make it look cool.\nJohn, we're going to go to break in a moment here, but before we go to break, one thing we like to do is ask our guests a series of short questions, short response questions, and this is going to be more about what inspired you or what got you going. The idea here is just give us the first response that comes to your mind. This is what we call the lightning round. So, are you ready for the lightning round?\nI probably not, but go ahead.\nHere we go. Uh, tell me about a prediction or a forecast that you once heard that is the most accurate forecast or prediction that you ever heard in your life. The, the thing that has come true in your opinion.\nUm,\nI remember, um, I was really interested in, in emerging computer graphics long, long, long ago, and Ed Catmull, um, did this thing of his own hand, this little kind of movie of his own hand, and it was, you know, kind of a green screen wireframe, nothing. And, and he was saying back then, when, when there was, you were typing everything in with on a keyboard, there was no graphical interface, nothing like that. And he was talking about how you're going to make films with computers.\nAnd, and that was insane. That was absurd that see it so early. Uh, I remember those days in the early 90s where it was so difficult to even get a wireframe rendered, let alone\nYeah, this was in the late 1960s.\nOh my gosh, that's really visionary. Oh, wow. Okay, so that, that was in it for Ed, it was in the 70s, but, but still, it was early, early.\nThat's a forecast that definitely came true, you know, and, and famously for those who are listening, Catmull became one of the founders of Pixar and very important, pivotal figure in the world of animation and in Walt Disney as well.\nOkay, next question. Um, what is the first, uh, the first narrative of the future that inspired you? It might be, say, science fiction on a TV show or a science fiction book that you read when you were a child, but what is the first narrative about the future that inspired you?\nUm,\n2001 Space Odyssey was, was a very interesting film for me. Um, it, uh, it predicted a, a, a normal world where people live not just on Earth, but in space, and, and, uh, you know, there was, there, there was so much of that film that was just normal life. You know, especially the first part of it, the jogging, the all, all those things. And you really had this notion of just getting up in the morning, you know, get some coffee, go out and exercise and get on about your day. And, and that to me was kind of cool, that that notion that, that, um, there are lives that are normal people, sort of like me, that can happen in extraordinarily different circumstances.\nImportant at the time, too, because in the late 60s, the typical sci-fi story would be something more like a Buck Rogers fantasy, where it was all swashbuckling, you know, kind of like a futuristic version of a pirate story, a romance, uh, yeah, so the idea of like a quotidian life, kind of boring functionaries who are just doing their job, but happens to be in space, that was a big breakthrough. And that was even before Star Wars, where, you know, George Lucas borrowed Mobius's concept of like a slightly used universe, so the spaceships had dings and nicks and stuff, they had been. Well, Warren, you know, that also was a big breakthrough for audiences, I think, because it made it feel more real, more believable. They were able to suspend disbelief because it wasn't just a shiny future, a perfect future. It was more like a used, slightly used future.\nUh, okay, great. We're going to take a little break, folks. We're talking to Jon Snoddy. This is The Futurists, and I'm Robert Tercek. We'll be back in one minute after these words.\nHey, welcome back to The Futurists. I'm Rob Tercek, and today we're recording with Jon Snoddy. Jon is a technologist in the motion picture and entertainment industry. He's been doing this for many, many years. So we were just regaling each other with stories from the past and some of the predictions from the past that actually came true.\nJohn, how do you get inspired? Tell me what information you take in. What's your methodology or process for formulating, uh, a theory about the future that you act on?\nI, I don't know that I have a formal process, but I will say that I'm, I'm interested in everything, and I, I, you know, I read, I watch videos, I challenge my friends, we share things and, you know, challenge each other. Um, I like to do, uh, you know, I've had, uh, jobs, a lot of sort of migrated toward jobs that are about, uh, about, um, being inspired and about, um, creating new things. And so I tend to surround myself by people who, who think that way, people who are open to new ideas, and, and, and again, we all challenge ourselves. It, you know, running an R&D organization is, is, is a, it's, I recommend it highly. Everyone should go do that because all it is, it's like, okay, we got to try a new thing. But you frame it as a hypothesis, right, in R&D. It's like, we're going to attempt this thing, and here are the criteria for success.\nYeah. Well, often the way I would do that with teams is, is I would start with kind of a story of, you know,\nOh, interesting. There was one that was with a thing that, that, uh, I was, I was wondering, you know, could, could I take an object and, you know, there some people have been working on gyros and, and using gyros inside of a cube to make that cube move in, in ways on a desk. That was, it seemed kind of clever. And I wondered, could I take an object and have some sort of inertial stuff inside it and throw it into the air and animate it as it's falling? And that led to a bunch of things that finally, uh, culminated in that, that, uh, Spider-Man robot at, uh, at the Disney parks in California that, that flies through the air untethered for 75 ft in the air. And, um, and so things, you know, that thing of, of just posing a notion, um, often there was a question that I posed to one team of, you know, would, would people have a serious conversation with a cartoon character? Uh, you know, just things like that all the time where you, where you get to think about something that's kind of absurd, but then you, you go after it, and, and I love that way of doing kind of applied research where you, you go, you, you start with a hypothesis and go try to make it true, and that uncovers the, the missing pieces, and those become your research topics.\nGot it. It's interesting how powerful a good question can be in that process. You know, for instance, the question why not? Usually when someone says, \"I'm trying to do something. I'm stuck.\" And, and someone says, \"Why not?\" They're being sarcastic or snide. They don't really expect a response. But in a brainstorming session, when you identify an obstacle, it's actually quite a constructive question to ask why not, because the answer to that question will enumerate all the obstacles and all the things you need to surmount, and then, like you say, those become research projects or design challenges, uh, to solve. And there's a, there's an interesting thing that,\nSorry for interrupting that. You're okay. Because that's a real driver for me that I, I constantly find myself having to tell people. Um, you know, you get into something and you go, well, you, you know, if the, if the frame rate was a little higher, or if the color depth was a little deeper, or if the field of view is w, you know, just there's always these things, and it's easy to get all wound up in, in the technology itself. And for me, I rarely have found that the technology is the problem. And so the thing I always challenge people who work with me to do is just assume the technology. Tell me, describe perfect, perfect technology. Imagine everything you're talking about working exactly the way you want it to work. Now what, what's your idea? What would you do with it? Because it's that's really the hard question is, is it worth doing? You know, what would you do with that, that, and, and if you, if you find, otherwise, people will, will kind of shoehorn their idea into what they think is possible, and then they don't really ever express the larger concept or the bigger goal, or obsess over just making something better just for its own sake, when in fact, does it need to be better? Does it, you know, what's, assume the technology, say it was perfect, now what's your idea? How does, how does that change my life? How does that make the world better?\nThat's a good, that's a good framing. Okay, so that's your process. Your process is one where you're open to lots of input, and you love to work collaboratively with people who bring an open-minded viewpoint. I think that makes good sense. Let me, let me build on that by, by introducing a new topic. Uh, this is a lively discussion topic right now, this, this week that we're recording in, in the end of June. Um, and that's namely, that's about LLMs, uh, artificial intelligence as a collaborator, artificial intelligence as a kind of collective intelligence. Now, the subject of, of large language models and generally generative AI, uh, this is a controversial topic for many, many reasons. We've covered the copyright issues several times on this show, so we don't need to delve into that. You can bring it up if you'd like, but I think candidly, our audience has heard quite a lot about that. I want to bring up a different topic that we haven't spent as much time on. I think it's quite useful to bring it up in this context with you, and it is this. Uh, storytelling in the past has been seen as a solo endeavor. There's a storyteller, there's an author, there's a writer, there's a director. Now, it's certainly true in industrial entertainment like motion pictures and theme parks. That's more of a collective enterprise, because now you have a team of people, and in some respects, you know, Walt Disney's Imagineering Team is a kind of high standard for that of, you know, how to organize collective creative process to, uh, to build an even more convincing fictional world. Um, but now we're moving into a situation where your collaborator isn't necessarily a group of like-minded humans. Instead, your collaborator is a machine intelligence. Can you talk a little bit about that, because I'd love to have a part of conversation about that idea with you.\nWell, it, it's, um,\njust the, the, the mind reels with all of the\ntoo big of a question, you can go with, with\nnarrow the question if you like. But, but I mean, you know, I, I, I do want to say that, that I'm looking forward to, to, um, us as humanity getting some resolution as to how human invention is, is rewarded in this new world.\nThat's an open topic. Sure.\nEverything is not just absorbed into the, into the giant var.\nBig tech companies kind of own all of human culture. And that's a little bit, that's a scary Orwellian concept.\nYeah. So, so there, let's just say there's some work yet to be done there in that subject, and, and let's get to it and, and figure out, uh, h how to do that. But there is something extraordinary about, you know, being able to ask my, you know, uh, ask chat GPT about drug interaction. You know, I, I, I was just prescribed a medicine, but I take\n\n\nThis other one.\nTell me about that, you know?\nAnd, and when I think about how long it would take me to read all of those, those, you know, warning labels and, and scientific papers that led, and, and so there is kind of an amazing notion of, and, and it's not interesting for you or me.\nWhat it's interesting for is the 10-year-olds that are going to grow up in this world with at their fingertips every word that's ever been written by a human.\nJohn, let me, let me zero in on that because that's actually directly where I was heading for this thing.\nUh, so, so, um, first, I, I definitely understand the point you're making, and I want to circle back to this idea of a collaborative partner in the AI that I think that's a really powerful idea for creativity as well, not just for drug discovery or, or medical research or anything.\nUm, but, but bookmark that for just one second because this notion that a rising generation is very quickly accommodating themselves to artificial intelligence.\nWe see this not just in high school but also in college.\nYou, there have been recent reports.\nNew York magazine, for instance, published an article that said basically everybody's cheating with AI right now because in college, not only are the students using LLMs to write their papers, but the professors are also using LLMs to generate the assignments.\nAnd so you sort of scratch your head and think, wait, is this really what college should be for?\nOne person's using an LLM to create a challenge for another person's LLM.\nAnd where are the humans involved?\nNow there's a prospect there that we develop a dependency on this externalized resource that we become dependent in this in this scenario.\nThis is a dark scenario.\nThis scenario, uh, AI is a crutch, and it's a, it's a crutch for our thought process.\nWe don't develop the critical thinking skills or the original thinking skills, the innovation skills.\nInstead, we rely on this machine to help us generate ideas, to help us refine the ideas, to help us formulate them and express the ideas.\nAnd there is quite a bit of concern about the age group you just mentioned, young people, because they're going to be raised where these machines are relatively sophisticated.\nThey're just going to keep getting better.\nAnd that means that dependency hook could be driven deeper and deeper.\nWhat's your reaction when you hear that?\nIs this something that sounds plausible?\nAm I, am I giving you a spooky story from the future?\nIs this, is this ridiculous?\nTell me.\nYou know, every time I go somewhere, I tend to put where I'm going into my car's GPS and just cuz I don't know.\nI like to know how long it's going to take me to get there.\nIf I have to detour, I like to have it reroute.\nIt really bugs one of my sons.\nOne of my sons just says, \"You don't need that.\nIt's, it's rotting your brain.\nYou should be thinking about where things are.\"\nAnd in truth, if you ask him how you get to someplace familiar, he can tell you exactly.\nAnd, and I have to think about it for a minute.\nAnd that's an issue.\nI mean, you know, in, in an age of, of, you know, do kids need to know multiplication tables?\nDo kids need to know?\nYeah.\nAnd that goes up and up and up and up, and, and some people scoff, and they say, \"Come on, you're repeating an argument we had about the graph calculator back in 1971.\"\nYou know, like those were forbidden when I was in high school because it was considered cheating.\nNow they include them in the curriculum.\nYeah.\nSo, you know, uh, teaching people how to use tools effectively is part of what school was for.\nThese are tools that exist.\nWe can't deny it.\nUm, but I guess the question there is, are we, are we fostering a dependency that will make it impossible for us to think independently?\nUh, likely.\nOkay, great.\nLet me flip it around.\nLet me ask another question.\nIt's slightly different.\nI knew you were probably hoping I would have a different answer.\nNo, no, it's okay.\nIt's okay.\nSo, so another way to look at this, this is related, and I'm sure you can tie all this together.\nAnother way to look at this is it's a collective mind that you're dealing with.\nWhen you talk to an LLM, it's not a singular mind, you know.\nSo, instance, let's be more specific.\nChatGpt or Claude, which is my preference for anything that's literary or creative.\nI think it, I think it just has a more literary nature to the way it writes.\nAnthropic's Claude.\nUm, my one of my partners in my business is Bay Rate, who's a great animator and storyteller, and he always says, \"When you're writing with an LLM, you're communing with the wisdom of the ancients, and you can invoke the wisdom of the agents.\"\nNow, you have to prompt well to do that.\nYou have to know how to do that.\nIf you just ask it for like advice on a story, you're going to get very average output.\nBut if you know how to construct a really good prompt, you can actually cause that AI to kind of assume a role, and it can become an oracle, uh, that channels all the, because all the knowledge is there.\nIt's just you have to invoke it in the right way.\nNow this to my mind is more like, uh, collective collaboration, you know, or collaboration with a collective mind that represents all the thinking of human culture.\nMaybe that's a little grandiose, or maybe there's something to that.\nWhat do you think when I say that?\nIs that, is that a different idea than this idea of a dependency, or they fit together?\nMaybe it is a, it's a slightly different idea, um, in that it is, it is trained on the past.\nSo, it's not trained on new ideas.\nIt's trained on old ideas.\nAnd the breakthrough ideas are, are right in there with the bad ideas.\nAnd, and, um, it's not curated.\nUh, well, and you know, you see that when you try to use it for, to, to really come up with something truly new.\nNow, what he's great at is, is format this for me so it looks like a script, and, and look at the script and tell me, give me some ideas on how to make this better, and, and those will be, you know, your structures wrong here, you got a dangling character, you brought them in, where you going with that character, you know, those things, great script supervisors, yeah, continuity.\nIt embarrasses you that in two seconds it comes up with, with a page of things that'll make it better, but when you say, give me a, a new idea, yeah, a different, found those new ideas to be profound or interesting or as good as the people that I hire to write things.\nAnd so, uh, I, I don't know if that is just that the machines aren't as good as they're going to be.\nSome, there's probably some of that there, but there's also that notion is that it's trained on the past.\nIt's necessarily looking backwards rather than looking forward.\nCertainly, and an LLM is a prediction machine, right?\nSo all, all it can really do is give us a, a probability about what the most likely next thing is.\nSo by, by definition, that's going to be the most average possible outcome.\nAnd that goes against everything we know in, in the motion picture business about telling great stories.\nThey're never about what people expect.\nYou can set those expectations up, and then you want to defy them.\nThat's what creates suspense.\nThat's what creates that aha moment.\nGreat AIs are not so great at that right now.\nYeah.\nAnd so the fear is that that we get used to good enough, you know, that those stories are these things are sort of good enough, right?\nLike the world's going to be full of AI generated slop that's incredibly predictable and kind of boring and, you know, Yeah, you're right.\nThat's a real risk.\nI think, and the risk is not just that.\nThe risk is that once when people are satisfied with that, then they're no longer jobs for young people to go in who are at the peak of their creativity and to, to, to have these new ideas.\nThere's the, the, the market for, for their skills, if we're not careful, will allow that to, to dissipate.\nAnd now, real, do you think that risk is?\nI hear that all the time on this show.\nPeople are like, \"Oh, everyone's going to be unemployed.\nAI is going to take all of our jobs.\"\nI, I think that's fundamentally incorrect.\nWhat do you think about that?\nI think that it is, I'll tell you artists that I work with are, are people who are great at using the tools, and, and I, and, and, um, and when I use Midjourney as opposed to one of our creative directors uses Midjourney, the result is dramatically different, you know, that they can do so much better, and I think that's going to be, that's, that's going to be real, and I think for sound design.\nThat's true for story design.\nThat's true for character design.\nSome people have the gift, and they know how to make these machines do magical stuff.\nAnd for punters like you and me, it's like we appreciate that, but we can't replicate that, right?\nSo, that says to me that there's still a role for a human being to direct the machine, to discern from the output what's useful, what needs to get fixed, and to redirect that machine.\nAnd that's, that's like more of a director role.\nI worry about things like, like people are worried now that, that like Spotify is getting filled up with AI generated, you know, kind of okay sounding stuff.\nAnd, you know, nothing evil about that in and of itself, except that for every one of those, it sort of pushes out and takes up space and takes up plays from people who would be a finite amount of attention.\nAnd if you fill that attention with more and more AI junk, then there's less attention and therefore less reward.\nSo, it does seem like we need to be paying attention to that.\nWe need to be thinking about that is, is making sure that we're not, that we're not accidentally allowing mediocrity to be the, the thing.\nI mean, the funny thing about the, the Spotify example is they've been doing that for a long time, way before generative AI was, was on their landscape.\nThey have all kinds of economic incentives to reduce payments to human creators, right?\nSo they're, they're doing everything they can, including AI generated, uh, music, if you will.\nBut on the other hand, I look at that because I, I have many, many friends here who are in the recording industry who complain bitterly about, uh, Spotify and, and how their livelihood's been destroyed.\nBut I look at that, I say, \"Well, wait a minute.\nYou, you seem to be operating with the assumption that the recording industry as we knew it is going to persist forever into the future.\"\nAnd I think that's a really faulty assumption.\nYeah.\nBecause recording industry as we knew it really started in the 1960s.\nPrior to that, artists didn't make a huge amount of money.\nA few people, Benny Goodman, but it was like a handful of artists, right?\nAnd then in the 60s, they figured out how to make hits, and they figured out how to renew many artists.\nAnd by the 70s, that became the greatest job in the world because one good hit could generate, you know, generational wealth for, for recording artists or for the writer.\nThat was an amazing moment.\nBut that was a moment in time, and that moment seems to have passed.\nAnd some people here in town think the same thing is pro, that same process is happening to motion pictures right now, where, you know, there was a moment where you could do a blockbuster film that would achieve billions in, in box office and other ancillary revenue streams later.\nUm, they're saying, well, that moment is faded now, and there won't be big blockbusters like that in the future.\nI, I don't know.\nThat's a forecast.\nThat's a prediction about the future.\nBut when I run these ideas past you, how do you respond, and what is your thought about that?\nIt, it's hard to predict it.\nIt is, it is, um, you know, creativity does have a way of kind of breaking through, and, and I, I predicted that I think we will have like 9-year-old superstars that are, that, that really just prodigies.\nYes.\nThat, that are really good at knowing how to use AI, knowing how to use the media, and, and I, I think that will happen.\nUm, I, you know, as, as things get concentrated, though, as, as, um, you know, you look at what's going on in the music business, that, that, you know, in pop music, it's all written by a small handful of people.\nThey're all managed by the same company.\nFive guys in Sweden write all the pop hits.\nLike, okay, that's not an AI, although it might seem like it.\nYeah.\nBut, but once you do that, you really are setting it up for AI to, to understand it so well that it's no longer random.\nIt's no longer, that's true.\nBut that's on us as human creators.\nThe more we rely on formula, the more replicable it is by a machine.\nThat is definitely true.\nAnd so we want to, you know, as a society, create these paths that allow some randomness and stuff, you know, that, that allow that.\nI, I've always tried to do that in organizations to make sure that, that everybody has a path toward, toward, you know, if you've got an idea, somebody will listen to it and make sure that that's just fundamental to the organization.\nAnd I think that that we as a society need to make sure that we're doing that.\nYeah.\nI used to work with Tony Robbins, who I admire greatly.\nHe's, uh, he's got some great insights about humanity.\nOne of them is that, um, humans have this inherent contradiction.\nUh, we crave certainty, like we really desire certainty.\nWhen times are uncertain or unstable like they are right now, people get very, very nervous and very upset.\nSo we want certainty, and we also want novelty.\nYeah.\nAnd we crave both, and we kind of vacasillate between the two, right?\nSo it's like, well, when things are too certain, that feels kind of boring and predictable, and now we want to be entertained.\nSo we watch a show that's full of dramatic stuff that we never would have expected and wouldn't experience in our normal lives, and that satisfies that itch for novelty.\nAnd so in some respects, whatever medium you're using, if you're an artist, uh, you have to pay off the desire for certainty.\nPeople want to be able to predict what's going to happen.\nThey want to have a, a fan theory about what comes next.\nAnd then again, you have to defy that.\nSometimes you have to tweak those expectations.\nI don't think the AIs have gotten to a point where they're the master of that yet.\nNow, that might come in the future, but I think at this point, you probably would agree with me.\nIf you use an LLM, they're pretty good on the predictive part, the normal part.\nYou set the, you know, kind of world, uh, the rules of the world, the characters, and\n\n\nSo on. They'll give you that situation infinitely. But what they don't get to is like the moment when the real world changes or the normal world changes and now something different has to occur. You you would need, an artist, a human artist would need to construct that moment.\nYeah.\nUm, well, Jon Snoddy, in the remaining minutes that we have, if you would please tell me what you think the world of entertainment and media is going to look like in 25 years. So, let's just project out. Put on your futurist cap and I know go out to 24 years. I thought you were going to say 25 minutes because\nthat's okay. It's an arbitrary figure. Tell me what you think the future is for media and entertainment.\nAre we going to go to movie theaters? Are we going to have one big blockbuster? Is there going to be Avengers number 47?\nI let me tell you a little story about um one of the senior executives at Disney the first time I worked there um he he said you know I was at at a level in this company where I could kind of ask for kind of crazy things. So, I said, \"I would like to bring my family. I'd like you to open Disneyland an hour early, and I'm going to bring my family over and just me and my family. We're going to walk around Disneyland and and it's going to I want all the rides running. I I just want to do that.\" He said, \"I know it's self-centered and self-indulgent, but I want to do that.\"\nSo, he did. And he said, \"We rode the first thing.\" And then he said, \"We were on Big Thunder.\" I think it was Big Thunder, he said. And, you know, we're running and then we just kind of looked at each other and said, \"This is weird. This is creepy.\nIt's like Westworld. Yeah. A depopulated theme park.\nAnd you realize that Disneyland is not the rides. It's not. It's you and those people experiencing it together.\nMhm.\nAnd if you you know, you could imagine that. Wouldn't it be I mean, especially, you know, like July 4th, I'm sure there are going to be a lot of people that are jammed into those parks thinking, wouldn't it be great if all these people weren't here? But in truth, no, it wouldn't. And that humans love to do things together. that and I think that's what is that enduring thing about theme parks is when you do it right it's about you know you could take away all the cues but in fact I don't think you want the cues to be zero because then you just sort of run through it all and you're done and you need some time to digest it and some time to hang out with your family and and it turns out that that's part you know just being around all those people is one of the things that this is all about\nand for all those fans at Disneyland and Disney World stop complaining about standing in line for an hour because that's part of the experience you're paying for and learn to relish it.\nI don't work there anymore. So there's nothing to tell you that. But but I do believe that and people I've talked with and I've done it. I've been there, ridden the rides late at night, you know, with nobody else there. So So all that is just to say people like to be with people and and I don't think AI changes that. That doesn't change who we are fundamentally. So there will be things that draw us together and allow us to go experience things with strangers and friends and stuff and celebrate things together. That's a thing that I think will you know you look back through humanity that's that's one of those enduring things. So I don't know that we'll go to movie theaters but we'll go to something and and you know I can imagine that that you know we will be able to sort of you know the you know connect into our brain waves and you know jack in some sort of a entertainment device and and that will will be a thing. I mean, all that's going to be there, but I think we still are going to like to go do things together.\nSo, in a way, that's another collectivist kind of thing. That's collectivist experience where we're all there together and the fact that there's 100, 200 people in the movie theater with you adds to the experience. The fact that there's thousands of people at the theme park kind of adds to the experience. Yeah,\nit's certainly true at a rock concert, right, which is by far the, you know, these are the highest ticket items right now, uh, for entertainment, for live entertainment, sports, uh, where, you know, you go in that room, 70,000 screaming fans and the roar really gets you going, it transports you to a different kind of world.\nMhm. Um and and the more our lives are um you know the more that our lives are regulated and predictable and safe and calm, the more we seem to crave those moments, those transportive moments that take you into the collective uh the roar of the crowd, if you will.\nYeah.\nWell, gosh, John, this has been a great pleasure. Uh let me tell our listeners can find out more about you and Operative Games. Where can they find you on the web?\nUh operativeames.ai.\nFind us there. Uh go there. that'll point you to to a bunch of other places you can get to and uh and that's probably the the easiest easiest place to find us.\nOkay, cool. Great. Well, Jon Snoddy's been our guest this week on The Futurists and thank you very kindly for joining us. I want to give a big shout out to the folks at Provoke Media that make the show possible, including our producer, Elizabeth Severance, and our engineer Kevin Hershorn, and my partner in business, uh Brett King. He's great, but he's traveling this week. We'll have him back next week for sure. And uh we're going to be doing a live event in Dubai at the end of September just around the corner. And so I certainly hope that those who are interested will see you there for the largest gathering of futurists in the world. We'll be back next week with another person who is shaping the world of their vision uh shaping the future as they envision it. And until then we will see you in the future.\n",
