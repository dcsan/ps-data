  "cleanText": "When you're evaluating these early stage AI startups that you invest in, what are you looking for in those investments? One is AI nativeness, right? Do we consider this team to be quite deep in AI or not? And then market savviness or commercial savviness, right? We really just look at investing in teams that can execute at sort of the speed of light and pivot however much they need to to find a resonant point between what their offering is in the market and then get to that great growth trajectory.\n\nThe most important thing I think for any venture firm is to orient yourself around the founder.\n\n[Music]\n\nShaun, welcome to the SuperDataScience Podcast. It is a treat to have you on the show. Where in the world are you calling in from today?\n\nYeah, Jon, thanks for having me. Calling from San Francisco. We're in our office here in South Park. Where better for an AI investment firm to be than San Francisco? Didn't expect you nowhere else.\n\nUm, so you're a founding partner of AIX Ventures, which is an AI focused early stage investment fund being led by active AI practitioners. So let's parse that for our listeners. What are the advantages of being an investment fund that is first AI focused, second early stage, and third led by active AI practitioners?\n\nYeah, it's a great, great, great question to kick this off. So I think first, being AI focused, every investor out there, our job is to find alpha, right, for our own investors, right? How do we think about out returning, you know, outperforming funds? And we just have the strong belief that we're in right in the middle of an inflection point, right? We saw transformers, ChatGPT, and machine intelligence is growing every day. We think the next, you know, dozens of hundred billion dollar, $50 billion companies are coming from AI. And so this is where we're heads down. We think this is transformative for industry, for humanity. Other investors could find alpha doing non-AI, but here we are.\n\nI think is number one. And then two, the operator. We can do that. I had early stage as number two. Early stage. Yeah. So on the early stage side, you know, look, we do two things. We think about backing entrepreneurs at the earliest stage because that's how AIX started organically, right? My co-founder Richard has been investing in the space since 2016 and Chris Manning long before that, and you know, that's just early stages meeting founders kind of where they are when they're starting to think about these ideas and then you bring that into your first fund. Now also I should say that our own investors think about early stage versus growth stage and you know, growth stage are you know, lower risk, lower returns and early also more correlated to the public market and early stage are not, right? They're less correlated to the public market and then also higher alpha, higher returns and so that's that's quite a nice product market fit for us too.\n\nPerfect. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. And I was talking to you about this briefly before we got on air, but Richard Socher has been somebody that's been an iconic person in AI in the world for me, I guess, as an AI practitioner. It's going back a decade that I roughly a decade that I've been studying and teaching from his his deep learning for NLP lectures at Stanford in Chris Manning's class, whom you also just mentioned there, who's still a Stanford professor and so you know these active AI practitioners that you have that you've co-founded AIX with, it's I mean it's an amazing set of people that I you know it's hard to imagine people that I look up to more. And so yeah, what's the advantage of working with AI practitioners as opposed to say career investors?\n\nYeah, we think you need both. The most important thing I think for any venture firm is to orient yourself around the founder. And so we think founders need, they will for a long time now be building at the intersection of AI plus a sector they want to disrupt. And so how do you support that founder? Well, we think it's hard to support on the AI side being a full-time VC, right? We think it's you're better off being out, AI is moving so fast, be out practicing at the cutting edge of AI and we mean the cutting cutting edge, right? Like the Richard Socher, Chris Manning, Anthony Goldblum cutting cutting edge. And then when we think about sort of on the sector side, we think about full-time VCs, like market focused kind of traditional VCs and you have to bring those two together and I think the way we've brought it together is what's quite unique, which is in a very engaged way, right? So Richard and Chris and Anthony are in every single one of our investment committee meetings, right? They're I mean Anthony is working in our office just a couple, you know, a couple feet from me now. So it's just this very engaged model where founders, you know, walk in and see that great, right, they have both sides of this equation and it's differentiating for them.\n\nNice. Well explained. Um, you were talking earlier about how investors, you know, you have this thesis that we're at this inflection point in AI and you're preaching to the choir a bit with me and probably our audience as well. I think we're on board in in that belief. It kind of seems obvious with how dramatically rapidly the cost of compute around kind of the same level of capability advances. Um, I was just at the time of recording the episode that I published today of this podcast, I had some stats from the Stanford State of AI report that I was talking about in the episode. And if you take something like a 60% accuracy score on MMLU, it took hundreds of billions of model parameters in something like Google's Palm just a couple of years ago to be able to get to that level of capability. And now today we have models that are 200th, like 1/200th of the size, just a few billion model parameters that are at the same capability and the cost of compute has gone down even more. So depending on exactly the kind of task it can be, you know, several hundred times cheaper to 900 times cheaper per token to be getting the same level of compute. So say you know you fix something at like GBT 3.5 level capability and you track the cost of that over the past couple of years, it's yeah, up to a 900x reduction in cost and so with those kinds of tailwinds, it kind of seems obvious that there's a lot of opportunity in AI, but there is also I think there has been overhype recently as well. Yeah. What do you think about that in terms of like Gartner hype cycle? Maybe we're now in kind of a trough of disillusionment, which I could get into more detail on this later, but it seems to me like that actually means there's a lot of opportunity for real world implementation coming up next.\n\nYeah, I think with any great technological inflection point comes a hype, I mean comes comes a hype period too, right? Um, and so, you know, right now I think you're seeing that manifest itself in a couple different ways. Like one is the efficacy of AI in consumer's lives or in the enterprise, right? And then another way is you're seeing an abundance of capital pour into the market looking to support these companies and some companies have sprung up that you know, maybe there's no need for, but there's so much capital, entrepreneurs will give it a go and you know, you're going to see softness and returns because of that and so I think it's it's both true. Um, you know, I think even though maybe broadly there's hype or we're in a hype, you know, in that trough of disillusionment, it's too general, right? I think you have to look at specific applications and ask where is that in the cycle, right? Because we see applications today regularly, founders coming in and talking to us where you know, there's quite a quite a blue ocean, right? There's like a lot of opportunity, it's not all red, not not everyone's competing. Um, you know, maybe they have an angle on it that's that's quite different. And so it it it sort of just depends, right?\n\nRight. That makes a lot of sense. When you're evaluating these early stage AI startups that you invest in, what are some of the non-obvious signs of product market fit that you look for? Or I guess even more generally, what are you looking for in those investments? How do you evaluate that the market is ripe for that particular type of AI in that particular application?\n\nYeah, you know what early stage is is really a game of people. You you you back the founder when they're just you know or founders when they're just having their you know idea, you know, maybe they have some prototype or some product, but um it's really a a people bet and you know, they will go out there with their vision to change the world and they will learn quite a lot and that will result in pivots, you know, micro and macro. And so you know, we don't we can't say like you know I don't I don't think VCs are like genius market timers, right? I think you know, they can have a sense of that, but then also recognize that the founder will do what they need to do and we we really just look at investing in teams that can execute at sort of the speed of light and and pivot however much they need to to find a resonant point between what their offering is and the market and then and then you know, get to that great growth trajectory.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense, but then it begs of me this it begs the same a similar kind of question which is how do you then identify that kind of founder or that kind of founding team? I guess um you know is there kind of I I've had guests I've had investors on in the past who have said that with AI startups they typically look for this kind of three-legged stool of um a CEO which is somebody who's great at selling the idea, um a CTO who obviously is highly technical, but then in an AI startup you also have this AI expert who you know where the CTO is maybe more concerned with platform scale, availability, reliability, those kinds of concerns. You have this third co-founder that is the AI expert at or near the cutting edge like you described Richard Socher or Chris Manning might be um with their research. Does that kind of ring true to you as well in in the teams that you're investing in?\n\nYeah, not not I would say 100%. The way we think about it, we start by looking at the team and assessing two two factors. One is AI nativeness, right? Do we consider this team to be quite deep in AI or or not? And then market savviness or commercial savviness, right? Do they have expertise in this area, do they have any right building into this market? And and that's really where we focus. And then we ask ourselves, given a team and given where we think kind of that market landscape is, where will they need to improve, right? Like you it's never perfect. You don't find teams that are always optimally AI native and optimally commercial savvy. And so if you invest in a team that's more AI native and less commercial savvy, then the question is how do you derisk the commercial savviness with the team, maybe that's advisors, you know, etc. And then you know, I think when technological inflection points like we've seen with ChatGPT happen, what what what the market, you know, what happens in the market is you have a number of consensus applications that are now possible, right? Like everyone knows that we should do like AI powered tutoring and so everybody is like, well, let's build AI powered tutoring. Um, but what you need to do there, we think is invest in extreme AI native teams that can actually bring experiences to consumers that other teams just cannot. And as the years go on and you start getting outside of this consensus dri or yeah, consensus driven investing, you go back into like the markets savvy investing where you don't need as much the AI native teams, like like still be very good, but it becomes more important to have a market insight that is non-consensus and so you know, the way we think about it, if you think about SAS investing, let's five years ago, SAS investing, you know, nobody like there wasn't a ton of differentiation on like the MCV stack, it's not like you're like, oh right, like the model is like, you know, the model technology is unique, the database is unique or like the controller is unique or the view is unique, it's all you know, and right, like, um, my SQL and it's you know, in the middle in in like in the middle, um, where it's you know, let's call it nodejs or you know, Ruby and then it's you know, React or HTML CSSJS. Um, and that's all commodity, right? It's just like, well, what's the idea, how are you going to configure and and AI will get there within the current framework of the technology. Now if we have a new um, a new architecture come out that that does uh uh replace transformers, then but game on again, right? Now a whole new set of consensus bets will be made against what that technology can can create. Um, but right now I think what we're transitioning from, you really need AI native teams in a consensus in a in a consensus world to you're going to start needing more markets savvy teams in a in a non-consensus world.\n\nRight. That sounds like a great balance. And I guess I was I was being oversimplistic. In my kind of thinking of like, Yeah, this is the this is the kind of founding team. It makes perfect sense that obviously every situation is different.\n\nYeah. And the last thing I'd add to that that question, Jon, is um this comment on like do you need the AI expert on the team, right? So you have your CEO that's like a you know market savvy and you have your CTO that's like builder and then do you need this AI expert? And you know I've seen this on lots of teams, even my last team at LILT. Um, I I think the I I think what the best way to orient a team is to have um AI engineers, folks that can build um very adeptly with the technology in production that are also savvy enough to be reading the papers and understanding how the technology is changing and be able to integrate that into the stack. I don't think you need like a PhD that can just sit there and read papers. Ideally, your folks building in production can all are also savvy enough to read papers. Um, is is kind of our take on it.

Obviously a great\nopportunity for startup founders in\nterms of the products that they can be\nbuilding and therefore also for the\ninvestors that are investing in them,\nbut even just for any of our listeners\nwho want to be making the most of\nunderstanding the great information\nthat's out there, the exponentially\nmore AI papers that are being published\nall the time, it's easier and easier to\nunderstand them and it's easier and\neasier to code them up with tools like\nat the time of recording Claude 4 has\njust come out and they've really focused\non the ability to code generate in there.\nUm yeah it's it's a really exciting time\nto be in this space indeed. So when\nyou're scaling up AIX,\nyou know you recently you just closed\nyour second fund for $22 million.\nCongratulations. And as you scale up, as\nyou invest in more companies, you\nprobably need more and more AI\npractitioners. And another name that\njust came up in from the research\ndocument that we prepared for you here\nis Peter Reveal, who has been a guest on\nthis show as well some years ago now,\nbut still one of the you know, one of\nthe most fascinating episodes that we've\nhad. Peter's an incredible person. And\nso the kinds of world, you know, that's\nanother name associated with AIX. What\nkinds of mechanisms do you have in place\nto ensure that founder quality as well\nas you know these kinds of practitioners\nlike Peter like Richard that you have\nadvising you know you said that Richard\ntoday is still in every investor\nmeeting, are you concerned about that\nscaling or does that seem straightforward\nto you? Yeah, I mean generally VC\ndoesn't scale, not AIX specifically, all\nVC, right? It's a very heavy services\nbusiness. And the reality of it is\nevery VC out there is creating a new\nportfolio of anywhere between let's call\nit 15 and 40 companies every three to\nfive years, recently it's been on the\nearlier side of that. And so how does VC\nwork, right? You're bringing on 30\ncompanies every three years, 10 a\nyear, approximately. How do you\ncontinue to service everybody as these\nportfolios grow and grow? And the answer\nfor a long time has been that, you know,\nmaybe somewhat controversial, but it's\nthe truth. VCs invest in companies 10 a\nyear and those companies usually raise\nfor 18 to 24 months and then when they\nraise capital to build for 18 to 24\nmonths and at the end of that period,\nactually, right, not even the end, 12\nmonths before they run out of capital,\nthey start raising again, right? And\nthen they go and they take more capital\nfrom other venture firms too and those\nventure firms start picking up the you\nknow the responsibility to bring these\ncompanies to the next stage. And so it's\nkind of this like you know founder\nsupport, founders go through this\njourney of multiple VCs through their\nyou know through the life cycle of their\ncompany being you know the most\nprominent people on their board. And so\nit's always kind of changing over and an\nexample of this is you know Richard\ninvested in Clement team at Hugging Face,\nyou know, when they were taking 224 at\nStanford and that was, you know, that\nwas some time ago, 2017. That's a $4.5\nbillion company now. You know, Clem is\nsurrounded by, you know, the best at\nSequoia and Lux and others. And, you\nknow, they don't, you know, Clem's not\ncalling Richard every day. He, you know,\nhas other problems. They keep in contact\nand you know Richard still advises but\nit's a much lighter lift than than\ninitially. Clen has also been on the\nshow. He was in episode 564 I just\nlooked up here as another great episode\nand I guess I should probably look up\nthe Peter episode. That was 503. Nice.\nUm yeah going back almost four years now\nto that. So listeners can check out.\nYeah, amazing people. And it's\ninteresting to me when you talk about\nClen and Richard and their kind of\ninteraction like that. Do you think that\nthis is I don't know if this is even\ngoing to be a controversial question.\nBut I suspect this kind of varies all\nthe time, but when when there's a really\nsuccessful investment that you make like\nthat, especially from such an early\nstage like Richard had with Clen and\nHugging Face, do you think you're kind\nof do you think you're more\nincentivized to kind of stay in touch\nand really be close with those really\nbig successes or does it end up being\nthe case that you end up, you know, you\nkind of end up having to spend most of\nyour time with the startups that you're\nlike, ah, it just hasn't quite quite,\nyou know, there's there's just something\nabout the product market fit or there's\nsomething we just don't have, right? Or\nhow does that maybe it's kind of a bit\nof a I I don't know if that's a\ncontroversial question, but I'd love to\nI think that I think the saying is your\nfund is made by your winners and your\nreputation is made by helping your your\nnon-winners, right? And so, you know, we\nhave responsibility to all of our\nfounders and indeed I'm working with\nfounders that you I speak to Arvin\nregularly. Arvin's killing it at\nPerplexity, right? And you know he he\ndoesn't need a ton of our help now but\nyou know we keep that relationship but\nI'm also spending a ton of time with\nfolks that you know haven't been as\nsuccessful as quickly as Arvin and but\nlike still have you know tailwinds and\nyou know they're seeing progress and\nthey're just looking to find the right\nyou know the right way to you know\nposition their company in the market.\nAnd so yeah I think both is the both's\nthe answer we have responsibilities to\nboth both from a fiduciary point of view\nand also just like a helping founders\nand a reputational point of view as\nwell.\nNice. That that sounds that was a really\ngreat answer. Um you know you you\nmanaged to make what I thought might be\ncontroversial into something that\nsounded quite ordinary. Thank you. Um\nour research dug up a kind of a kind of\nan interesting question here\nspecifically related to climate change.\nAnd so there's a bit of context here.\nSo, your newest fund it'll invest\nmillions of dollar checks each in\napplications across enterprise software,\nhealthcare, and the climate. And so, I\nwant to dig into that climate one a\nlittle bit. Um so, due to capital\nintensity, it sounds like you won't be\ninvesting in raw model builders, which\nmakes sense. I mean, we're now at a\npoint where it's at least hundreds of\nmillions of dollars to be building AI\nmodels. And so but you know, in\naddition to that, those models, not\njust at training time, but especially at\ninference time when they get used a lot,\nthese huge models, they they have they\ncan have a lot of climate impact. They\nrequire a lot of energy, a lot of water\nto cool them. Now there are kinds of\nthere are some solutions out there. We I\nknow that a lot of the hyperscalers\nGoogle, Microsoft, they try to use\nrenewable energy at best or nuclear\nwhere they can at worst to try to limit\nclimate impact. I know that there is a\nlot of innovation around water usage\nwhere the water that evaporates actually\ngets trapped in a system that allows it\nto be collected so that you're not\nusing much net new water while running\nthese kinds of these kinds of server\ncenters.\nUm but but yeah, I just I given that\nyou're specifically investing in\nclimate AI startups, I'm curious kind of\nwhat your thesis is or what your\nperspective is around how as climate\ntech and AI become increasingly\nintertwined, the kinds of applications\nor infrastructure at this intersection\nthat can both create outsized returns\nfor you and your investors while also\nreversing environmental impact. Yeah.\nYeah. It's a good question.\nUm so when we were starting our fund\ntoo, we thought deeply about climate\nand the first there's quite a lot of\nwork going on innovation in the climate\nspace. Um but what we were quite keen to\nunderstand is the intersection of\nclimate and AI, right? where were we\nthought about like novel AI AI solutions\nbeing applied to climate? Um, and our\nteam basically concluded that like there\nactually\nweren't a sufficient number to invest in\nthat area thematically at the early\nstage. Also, they tend to be a little\nbit more capital intensive because you\nknow atoms are just more expensive than\nbits. Um and so we actually have not\npursued that as a strategy in our fund\ntwo. Our fund 2 is almost squarely\nfocused on enterprise applications both\nhorizontal and vertical as well as tech\nbio the intersection of AI and bio but\nnot not quite climate just yet. I\ngotcha. I gota I gotcha. Um all right so\nlet's move on then to other aspects of\nyou know the portfolio the decisions\nthat you make. Um in a recent interview\nyou discussed two kinds of investments\nthat you make in your portfolio. One of\nthem is heatseeking and the other one\nare what you called truffle hunting\nbets. So what are these? How do they\ncomplement each other as well? Yeah,\nthese this comes from the Andre guys\nChris over there I think talks a little\nbit about this which is heat seeeking is\na company a deal a a group of founders\nthat the venture market knows a ton\nabout and is very excited about and you\nknow there's a lot of heat surrounding\nthat deal and and that means they tend\nto be a little bit more expensive too\nand then truffle hunting is is just that\ntoo, which is you're trying to find the\nfounders that you know are the ideas,\nthe the companies that folks just don't\nknow, right? Maybe it's that they're\nunaware of them, but also maybe it's\nthat they're aware of them, but they\ndon't believe that what they're saying\nis true. It's non-conensus, right? Um\nand you want to have a portfolio of\nboth, right? So, you know, heat seeeking\nwon't always be right. You know, there's\nthis adage that if you go back and you\nlook at any vintage of fund there and\nand you track that vintage to what was\nhot at that time, those are unlikely to\nbe the alpha returners, right? Those\naren't the ones that are make those\ninvesting in those trends that during\nthat vintage is not what creates like\nstrong financial returns. It's actually\nthe non- consensus bets where you can\nget in arguably cheaper and then also if\nyou're right you know it could be a\nvery very big win and so you just have\nto create portfolios of these companies\nboth heatseeking and and and on\nconsensus it's unique when you're in\nthe middle of this sort of consensus\nworld where you just have chatpt\nNovember 2022 become a thing everything\nbecomes consensus very quickly, right?\nAnd then, you know, you have to ask\nyourself, okay, you know, are we going\nto diversify with non-conensus or are we\njust leaning into this consensus world\nand taking a big bet there and and\nfolks play it either way? We have\ncompanies that are that are both.\nThis episode is sponsored by Adverity, an\nintegrated data platform for connecting,\nmanaging, and using your data at scale.\nImagine being able to ask your data a\nquestion just like you would a colleague\nand getting an answer instantly.

The latest investment that you\nmade at least according to our research\nat the time of recording and you can you\ncan correct me on this but we have it as\nwork helix not the latest but recent\nyeah recent yeah and um so work helix is\na platform to understand AI's impact in\na taskbased stepbystep manner which is\na revolutionary idea. I'm sure I'm going\nto butcher Eric's last name\nBrinson. Um, so Eric Brinson, he said\nthat this approach could help unlock a\ntrillion dollar opportunity. And of\ncourse, that's the kind of thing I\nguess that kind of confidence is what\nyou look for a lot of the time in\nfounders of AI startups. But could you\nexplain this kind of what work Helix is\ndoing differently? What this means to\nhave this taskbased step-by-step\napproach and the kinds of enterprise\ncultural shifts that would be necessary\nto unlock the value from a platform like\nthat. Yeah, sure. Um so if you think\nabout how enterprises are adopting AI\ntoday, you know, how does this happen?\nSo, um I think there's like one one of\ntwo ways they're learning about it\nthrough the media, through what\nthey're hearing companies that are that\nare providing solutions, customer\nsupport, you know, the wind surfs and\ncurses of the world engineering and then\nthey go and they, you know, do that. Um,\nthey give that a go. Um, another way is\nthe board, you know, the board of these\ncompanies is learning about AI and then\nthey're putting pressure on the suite to\num to have an AI strategy and to\nimplement AI. Um, but the real\nquestion is what's going on in inside\nthe organization, right? Every\norganization is made up of\nsuborganizations and those\nsuborganizations have jobs and those\njobs have tasks. And then the question\nis like what is the task profile or\ncharacteristic of any organization? What\nare those jobs and those tasks? What are\nthey? And if you can go in and get\naccess to the raw data in an enterprise,\nyou can surface them. And then you can\nmap tasks to you know actually genai\nsolutions and not only task but bundles\nof tasks that cross job descriptions.\nAnd so what enterprises are learning is\nthat oh you know we have much more\nmanual labor for example in manual tasks\n\n\nIn marketing than we ever thought we had. And this maps to this other AI solution very well. And so the Work Helix team can expose all of that and then partner with the enterprise to actually implement and, most importantly, measure, show that there is efficacy from this solution, right, in a proper AB test. And so that's when you're done with that, then you start over. You go and reassess the organization's changed, you want to reassess. Now, in terms of getting, there's this really interesting thing happening in the market, which is folks, investors investing in rollups, right? This idea that, you know, you should buy companies and make them, you know, older, maybe more service-oriented companies, a lot of opex, and roll them up and power them with an AI native system, reduce your opex, and you know, potentially even increase the top line through product, through productivity enhancements, and then have a more valuable business. And you'd ask yourself, well, why would you do that, right? Like, if the enterprise is adopting AI very readily, why would you focus on rollups? And the answer is, like, there's friction in the enterprise, right? It's, um, it's this is massive behavior change, selling into the enterprise AI native products. And I think that's why, if you look closely at some of these companies, you actually see professional services increase. I think we're seeing these companies, you know, they'll come up with SAS models or usage-based models, but they also have a professional services line item, and that's because of the change that is required in the enterprise. There's a lot of pushback, and you've seen on various social media recently, CEOs be quite vocal about, \"No, this is the way it's going to be.\" Some have put their foot down and just said, \"We are adopting.\" I was talking to the CEO yesterday, and I asked him, \"Are you using AI in any real way?\" And he texted me back, and he said, \"We had to mandate it.\" Like every Friday is AI day, right? We're just like, \"You have to be, you have to be using it. There's no, no, like, no objections.\" A lot of what's going on is trying to figure out how to change the behavior. And that's why folks are investing in roll-ups. You don't have to, uh, you know, when you're rolling everything up and then just, um, you know, doing a larger riff to the organization, it just arguably is easier than than that behavior change, right? Yeah, the behavioral change is tricky for sure. That's I've, uh, I've recently launched my own consultancy for, uh, bringing cutting-edge things like multi-agent systems, generative AI, exactly as you said, the kind of opportunity that Work Helix, this trillion-dollar opportunity that Work Helix's co-founder, Eric, uh, uh, brought up, where there's so many tasks in the enterprise today that can be improved or automated fully with a large language model to a high level of accuracy, especially because you can have a second LLM that is double-checking work. You can have cascading LLM systems where for tasks that are more complex or the LLM, you know, an initial cheaper LLM is unsure of, gets passed to a more expensive one. And so there's all kinds of tricks you can have in an organization. It doesn't seem like at this time technical hurdles are preventing enterprise AI adoption. There's plenty of opportunity probably in any organization to be streamlining operations with AI. It is people, people that are, yeah, that are tricky. Yeah. One of the imp, one of the impressive things about the agricultural, um, the industrial revolution is, you know, we went from a world where 95% of our workers, of our, you know, of, um, quote unquote, uh, field workers were, um, you know, heads-down work, you know, working on these farms. And then suddenly, um, you have tractors, much more autonomous systems. But the beauty of that time is that you didn't have like a mini tractor that everyone had to use, and you know, you had to like say, \"Hey, you know, worker, now you have to use this mini tractor,\" and have all that behavioral change. You just replaced a hundred overnight. And that's not what AI is, right? AI is, is looks like right now, it's more gradual. We need to go through this phase where there's a co-pilot at first, and then there's a human in the loop, and then, you know, in some areas of a job, some task, there can be full automation, but that requires a partnership between the human and the machine, and that, that's full of friction for sure. There's an interesting, uh, I was on a panel at the Open Data Science Conference in Boston last week and got asked, got asked a question from the audience about how I thought the world would change, you know, in enterprises, you know, if we're talking three years, five years from now, like a relatively short time frame, how different is life in an enterprise because of AI and all these powerful agent systems that, you know, that I know could be adopted in organizations, and they could be so transformative. And it's interesting because on that kind of timeline, you know, there are certain kinds of people who think that we'll have artificial general intelligence on that same kind of three-to-five-year timeline. Um, I suspect that we will have kind of, I guess my take on that is that in three to five years, we'll have superhuman capabilities on more and more narrowly defined tasks. I think that there will still be, because I, I, I don't think we'll kind of have the data to be training the world models yet on a kind of three-to-five-year time scale to have something that is really like replacing a human on all kinds of tasks that we do. But regardless, there's going to be really powerful systems in three to five years. Uh, and but my answer to the question about what I thought the enterprise would be like in three to five years, I was like, in a lot of ways, it's probably going to be similar. I mean, we're probably still going to be sitting on panels at data science conferences in three to five years complaining about slow paces of change and all the opportunity that there is in enterprises. I, I don't, you know, it's so interesting to see, you know, people putting up charts of, you know, this is in three to five years, we're going to have AGI is going to be transforming absolutely everything. But because of this human friction, uh, I, I, I think there's still going to be tons of opportunity on the three-to-five-year time frame. What do you think about all that? Yeah, I think there's clearly going to be a distribution. Some companies are going to be blazing a path, and some companies are not going to be like have improved that much. Um, I'm always surprised when, you know, I'm talking to enterprise leaders. I was talking one-to-one a couple weeks ago, and they were telling me that, you know, they run an organization of 5,000, and it's a fairly, um, like it's not a well-known brand. I wouldn't call it like, like I'd call it like a very middle-of-the-road brand, not a lot of people have heard of this brand, and so not the most, you know, AI native, like forward tech-leaning, um, but they said that their team of 5,000 in two to three years would be reduced to 3,000. And so I thought that was significant. So I asked, like, how could that be? And, you know, is an engineering, you know, there's a few thousand, roughly, you know, 30, 40% that are doing patches and, you know, lower-level work, um, that they feel like AI can handle sufficiently. Uh, and so it's just a matter of transitioning the team. Um, so, you know, it's going to be a spectrum. Some folks are, like I said, they're going to blaze the path, and I think we're all going to be like low, and then there's going to be folks where it's like, like you said, nothing's changed much at all. Yeah. I think that kind of incrementalism, it is, you know, that kind of number that you said, it was kind of like 5,000 down to 3,000. That was Yeah. And you know, that's a huge amount of the company. Um, and so it seems, I guess in my head, I would assume that's kind of smaller percentages for the most part, but we recently had, again, at the time of recording, uh, in recent days or about in the last week, 6,000 employees were let go from Microsoft. And reportedly, those are mostly software engineers. And it's kind of the same kind of thing you were talking about there, you know, patches. There's, there's lots of kinds of work that can now be fully automated that, you know, some kinds of software engineers were needed for up until now. Um, and so it is an interesting, what do, what do you think for our listeners out there, you know, our hands-on practitioners who, who don't want to be, you know, amongst those kind of 6,000 that are being let go, uh, you know, at any given time in the coming years? What kinds of things do you think, uh, hands-on practitioners can be doing to futureproof themselves? Yeah, I think there's a, I think there's a couple things that we think about. I think in the short term, um, being an advocate for AI is is very important, right? Um, the reality is is that machine intelligence is growing quite fast, and you know, you have this partner now. It's no longer just this passive device that, you know, will take your Excel calculations or Google Sheet calculations and and perform that for you or run your macro. It's something that can help you think, um, and and help you come up with new solutions to a particular problem. I think, I think everyone needs to be like focused for folks that want to know how to stay far ahead. Like I think that's number one. And then I think in the longer term, you know, we talk about this, um, quite a bit in AIX. I think it's going to be really important, um, for knowledge workers, should they want to like continue in in that kind of, uh, their fields and in the enterprise. I think they're going to have to gravitate towards where there are human-to-human touch points, right? So, um, the digital world is being quite transformed right now. Robotics is still pretty, pretty far away. Like we think two, three major research breakthroughs to be able to have, right, like when are humanoid robots going to pass the Turing test, right? Um, and so for a long, long time, I think you're going to need that human-to-human interaction. And so if you're, you know, outbound sales, right, um, if you're working with clients, if you're, um, directly connected to just other people, not as much internally, um, but also externally, internally, um, and at least with the higher levels of the organization, I think that's another way to think about, right, um, building, building your career. Yeah, that's something that, uh, that, that, that I come back to is, you know, your ability to influence, um, is something that, uh, that will keep you safe, uh, in this AI era. Um, going back a bit to, uh, you know, still continuing on with this kind of enterprise adoption of AI conversation, but going back to Work Helix, um, they had a press release saying that we're in the first inning, and this is, uh, you know, a baseball analogy, so there's nine innings in a baseball game for our international listeners who wish that we had more cricket analogies, perhaps. Um, so this Work Helix press release says that we're in the first inning of a decades-long AI transformation, and I absolutely agree with that. That is kind of what we're talking about already, uh, you and me, Shaun, you know, in recent minutes about how we're going to have, you know, this incremental change, you know, patches to software being something that's replaceable, and in two years, it'll be, you know, more advanced kind of software tasks, machine learning tasks that are increasingly automatable. There's something interesting here to me with enterprises where it can be really tricky to rigorously measure the impact of an AI solution that's brought in that has streamlined something. Um, I'm, I'm experiencing this right now with a client that we're, we're automating an aspect of their business with my consultancy using, uh, generative AI tooling, and we're, I've been having almost daily meetings with my co-founder to make sure that we can come up with a great metric to ensure that we're able to demonstrate the impact of this. And so what do you think are kind of the key things, uh, in terms of being able to sell an enterprise AI solution to an enterprise? What are the kinds of key things that we need to get into place, especially if it's difficult, uh, to measure AI impact? Um, you know, being able to demonstrate a return on investment is obviously that seems to me like an ideal, but sometimes that's, if you can't even, if it's even tricky to be able to have rigorous metrics that, uh, demonstrate operational efficiency improvements, it can be even harder to get an ROI, uh, figure that you believe in. Um, and so something that comes to mind for me is actually storytelling as kind of, uh, is kind of a way to get buy-in, to get influence, and get those enterprise AI solutions adopted. Yeah. Um, well, you've called it out that we are Work Helix investors. So, you know, that's the disclaimer for the audience, but you know, this is one of the best teams at doing just that. And I was talking to James, the CEO of Work Helix, the other day, and you know, he's having customers come to him and say, \"Hey, can you help us, um, come up with metrics that, you know, are, are things we should look at and things we should expect to move?\" And so the Work Helix team is not just, you know, partnering with enterprises to understand what's interesting to them, but also like what should be interesting, um, uh, as a particular metric. You know, what we, where I think it gets complicated is when you're increasing productivity, um, but it's not going to move, um, it's not going to move revenue in any substantial way. Um, and it just reduces costs, but maybe it's just less clear because the people that are becoming more productive just become a cost center in a different place. Um, what I mean by that is, you know, to, let's just take, like, let's take, like, a dentist office, you know, small dentist office. There's only two or three people in the front desk. Um, if you make them all more productive, they just go do other things. There's so much entropy in that office, you know, that, you know, and how do you measure that? And that that just becomes really complex. And then suddenly you're just a cost center because you've sold some AI in, and like, it's no, not good for retention because, you know, if, if you're, if you're going to come in and make everyone more productive, riffing is really hard. You don't, you, how are you going to get adoption from a team that knows they're going to be rifted? Um, instead, you want a team that's so understaffed, um, that they're making errors that, like, they know they could do better. Um, they have to hire.\n\n\nYou know, the hiring process is brutal. Um, just pull the JDs off the table is, I think, the fastest time to value. And for those of our listeners who don't know what a riff is, it isn't uh grabbing your guitar and jamming with your friends, which is fun. Riffs are not fun. They're a reduction in force uh in workforce size. And so uh yeah. Yeah. Uh that's kind of that term.\n\nAnother term actually that you've used a few times in this episode that yeah, I feel like probably a lot of our listeners would kind of understand just based on context or or just you know, just saying it is AI native. Uh but I'd love you to kind of define that more specifically. Um and and you actually let's just do that first. I got I got a kind of a follow-up question related to AI native, but uh do you want to just define what that means to you?\n\nYeah, there I think there's two contexts in which um we hear and use AI nativeness. One is at the product level and then another one is at the team level. So at the product level, what I think the general community means when they think about AI native is was the product built from scratch with AI front and center. Um what the converse is is if um there was some legacy product and then you tried to bake AI in, right? Being able to start from scratch. You know, the idea is that, you know, every interaction, um, every, you know, user experience is going to have AI front and center. Um, when you're bolting it on, it feels a little bit more cluji, if you will.\n\nAnd then on the Go ahead. Yeah. Oh, I was going to say that even from the perspective of this podcast, this podcast is nine years old and we release two episodes every week. Every single week of the year, so 104 episodes a year. And so it's very difficult for me to like you know get ahead a month and be able to you know completely overhaul operations or something like that. And like I would love to be starting a podcast right now so that I could be like okay our operations from scratch. We're gonna have agents everywhere, GenAI everywhere, and like there's there's so much opportunity like if we were doing it in that kind of AI native way to give kind of people uh a concrete example, everything would flow I imagine so much easier. Whereas we have, you know, you get once you have operations, there's things that work and kind of the cost, the price of like overhauling one piece when you've got to keep the bus on its wheels and going and I got to get two episodes out every week. It's hard to be like, \"Okay, we're going to like completely transform this piece.\" Uh because it could have knock-on effects that I don't anticipate and that, you know, uh hinder my ability to be getting episodes out on time. Precisely.\n\nYeah. And then at the at the team level, I think AI nativeness is more subjective. But I think the question the very high level question we ask is do we think this team will be able to unlock applications and user experiences that most other teams cannot, right? And if you can do that, that's an AI native team and it may um it does indeed depend on domain where you're innovating, but you know example of this is like you know Richard's team at u.com is like they are able to unlock experiences in um in in you that that are representative and AI native team and same with our vendor perplexity, right? Like you know very focused on the consumer side of things um able to unlock experiences that that indeed are representative and AI native to yeah yeah yeah.\n\nIt is it's kind of interesting to me how you know in my mind in in in the vector database of my brain uh udu.com and perplexity are actually quite close to each other uh in that space and Uh yeah, it's interesting to think how oh well we don't need to get into that, but uh in terms of uh in terms of opportunity that you see in in you know across verticals, you sit in a position where you see you you must get pitches in all kinds of verticals, you know, AI native applications from AI native teams. Um what what are the kinds, you know, for our listeners, for people who are thinking about building something new, uh if you're able to disclose this, what are the kinds kinds of verticals that do you think are ripe still today for disruption by uh by AI companies?\n\nYeah, I think you know the the reality is if you think about this sort of continuous curve between um this world of consensus investing and non-conensus investing, right? Um consensus being obvious applications that everyone's building towards and non-conensus being um applications that are a little less obvious, right? Um require some degree of insight. There's opportunities in both worlds, right? There was opportunities in SAS 5 years ago. You just had to have some insight into why the world could change in a formidable way and how you're going to change it. And it's still going to be true, right? Sometimes I see investors that are like, \"Oh, you know, this space is too busy. Call it engineering um you know AI native engineering applications. Cursor's there. Windsurf's there. Cognition's there. Too many are there.\" That's not true, right? Um these companies have grown bigger and bigger and bigger. And that's when they're ready to be disrupted, right? Just just like always. And so there is a founder that that is working on like a vision of the future that might have a wedge that could grow very quickly. In fact, you know, you hear that like Curser and Windsor to a degree are being disrupted by lovable. And so, you know, here's a new player that's disrupting, you know, just a couple year old incumbent. So, you know, I I wouldn't say that like even the the red ocean is, you know, everything was red ocean and SAS 5 years ago, right? Um the the VC world in the startup world and entrepreneurs continue to be innovative and think about great ideas and and great startups um that will turn into enduring companies. And so I wouldn't steer anyone away. Like if if you have a quite capable com team and you want to go into like red ocean with an interesting idea, do that. Like we're about to invest in a team today or tomorrow that's doing exactly that. If you have a team that's looking at, you know, a vertical that not a lot of folks talk about and it's this, you know, I was talking to someone today that's innovating in CPG and like a specific area in CPG transformation when it comes to product development and it's so specific and their background was so specific to that. Um, it's very compelling.\n\nYeah. Yeah. There's a there's a term that you used in there that I I don't think I've come across before. You said red ocean. What does that mean?\n\nOh, blue ocean. Red ocean. Um, red means sharks, a lot of, you know, a lot of fighting.\n\nOkay. Blue ocean just means a lot of opportunity.\n\nI see. I see. I see. Yeah, I kind of I did have that visualization. I guess that it means it's a good term because I kind of had that pop up in my head.\n\nThere's also there's an interesting Yeah. Go ahead. I was just going to say I think there's a book out there called Blue Ocean Opportunities or something like that.\n\nThere's also there's an interesting you pronounce it there's the the the word or the the acronym SAS. I always pronounce that SAS and I feel like pretty much everyone does, but that obviously SAS is already a word like sassiness and so it's interesting that and uh this might be because I'm in New York and I'm not in Silicon Valley and so I'm so out of touch with the way, but you pronounce it SAS like you're you mean software as a service every time you say SAS, right?\n\nIndeed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's I I like that. I'll like I'm probably going to adopt now. So like listeners, you heard it, you heard me say this here first. I'm now going to start pronouncing it sass. Uh to to distinguish against sass sassiness.\n\nYeah. Um and so that I guess that's pretty common pronunciation uh for you on your side.\n\nYeah. I Yeah. I mean I I hear saster quite a lot. Not sastaster. Right. Saster. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.\n\nUm, so we've gotten through a ton of the the topics that I planned for you. Um, there's a uh there's a trend that's been happening that I'd love to to talk about on air that that I don't think I've talked about on air before and kind of get your your input on. Um there's been uh a lot of instances in recent years where big tech companies like Google, Microsoft have it seems like to avoid regulatory issues uh instead of instead of acquiring startups they end up and in fact there's a I can't remember which kind of acquisition it it was uh but just this week the US justice department opened up an antitrust a new antitrust suit into Google for one of these where instead of you know the entire company being acquired they acquire a bunch of the talent including often the executive team um uh but they're they're trying it seems like they're trying to avoid these kind of antitrust issues where uh you know there there there was this problem up until a couple years ago of these big tech players getting increased increasing um increasing scrutiny for you know making more and more acquisitions making it difficult for competitors like you said uh you know these kinds of red ocean players that are trying to to disrupt bigger players, you know, instead acquiring them and so now you see this this thing happening more and more where companies yeah you know leadership joins Microsoft joins Google but the whole company isn't um and so how does that you know from your perspective is that changing you strategies that startups have. Is that something that you like as a VC or is that something that actually has a potential to to undermine investments that you make?\n\nYeah. So, there are very few, you know, let's call it, you know, maybe singledigit thousands right now of AI practitioners that are at the frontier, right? There aren't many of them. And that means that there's a talent disparity, right? there's there's massive uh scarcity um which creates a disparity like between you know different companies the halves and have nots and so when that happens what do you what do you expect to happen like the companies are going to increase salaries compensation um I was I heard the other day about like a new Google building that came up that's like very very fancy that's just like focused on AI and it's colorcoded and you know it's just like it's next level. Um, and I think you're just seeing you're seeing compensation skyrocket. I was talking to a a Frontier engineer the other day who said that, you know, they just joined um one of the hyperscalers and, you know, money is no longer an issue. Um, you know, they don't really think about the price of things anymore, right? It's it's so competitive. And so when you live in that when you're operating in that kind of environment, you'll do anything you can to, you know, to buy up talent, right? To to differentiate your business because what you do now, it all compounds. What you're able to accomplish this week and then next week and the following week is compounding. And if you lose your edge in three to five years, you're going to see it in the market. Um, and so, you know, what does that mean? So that means that I I'll tell you I think there are pros and cons right as a as a venture firm. I think the pro is you can talk to have a conversation with founders founders that have raised capital that have enough capital um to get through 24 months and they're they're operating at a healthy pace. But you can say like you need to recognize that you have a very large opportunity cost here, right? Like you could be at a big company which you know they don't want to be at because they're starting a company. they want to start their thing, but you could be at a big company making a ton of cash right now, right? And instead, you've decided to go the startup route. You need to go go, right? Like, make sure you're blazing here because the opportunity cost is so large. Now, the counter to that is like sometimes they might just be like, \"Hey, I'm going to go and and get bought and and go work at those large companies.\" And so, um, you know, in that case, you know, you may you may lose a founder to um or a team to one of these companies. But on the other hand, it provides downside protection, right? If you're an investor and you're investing in AI native teams, um you can be sure that you're going to get your money back or or some large fraction on the dollar um by, you know, through the acquisition. We had one team that went from fully operating to acquired by Google in like three days. Like it was so fast. Um and we were able to get, you know, all of our, you know, maybe even make a little money on that. Nice.\n\nThat's a great uh perspective. Uh it is it is pretty interesting uh to think about you know these kinds of you know you talked about the singledigit thousand kind of AI experts at the frontier. I I I don't I don't know if you'd know the answer to this question. Um, but I I'd love to hear uh your two cents if if you do have some thoughts here for our listeners out there who are thinking, I'd love to be amongst those few thousand people. What are the kinds of things that you can do to get there? What do you need to learn or what organization do you need to be a part of to get there?\n\nYeah, I think um I think there's different paths for people depending on where they currently are in their career, right? So um if your you know at um you know if your background is an engineer that's building um and you have an inclination for math and um you know and some research you might think about right like could you get into how do you work your way into fair right um you know at at Facebook or into deep mind or um you And then if you're just starting off your academic career or you know studying CS um at the undergraduate level the master's level you might consider a PhD in AI like that's that that you know is a is a fairly um strong path especially from universities like you know call it CMU or Berkeley or Stanford or NYU or MIT Toronto um you know there are you know bleeding edge AI you know I heard the other day that Rice actually university in in Texas um has like a 100 GPU cluster for their students. So, you know, even um some of the non-obvious schools are uh taking um AI quite seriously. And so that's that's a path for a student. Actually, I I saw on social media just yesterday at the time of recording a funny uh a post. I won't be\n\n\nAble to find it in time for it to be of interest to listeners, but I'll try to maybe find it for the show notes and put it in there.\nThere was uh Rice University, they have a new undergraduate AI course, and their branding for it was like one of the only programs preparing you for AI in the real world in the world.\nAnd uh the person who shared it on LinkedIn was like, this is shameful to, you know, to think to say something like that, that like one of a few degree programs in AI.\nUm, they are they are popping up all over the place.\nBut yeah, those kinds of the kinds of institutions that you mentioned there doing PhDs in AI, you know, to obviously be at the cutting edge.\nYou know, you're not talking about an undergrad in AI.\nUh it's a PhD in AI from one of these top organizations.\nUm but yeah, I also love how you have the, you know, the kind of alternative route there.\nYou know, you could obviously you can learn anything at any age.\nAnd so if you already are highly technical, you like doing research, like you said, you're highly numerate, you like doing math, uh then you know you can be you can yeah be be you know see what's in the uh in the job descriptions for a deep mind AI engineer and start pursuing that.\nIf you found that your bedtime reading turns out to be linear algebra, you should try it out.\nExactly.\nYou know, I once had uh I once interviewed uh someone for you know, I I I've never been in a situation where I'm I'm hiring people of that kind of expertise.\nI've I've certainly never been I'd love to be in a position that I was hiring from the singledigit thousand kind of AI experts in the world.\nUm, but I I did once have an interview I interviewed someone where uh I was I was told uh by the person that introduced me that they do read linear algebra in bed and I was really excited to meet them, but it was a really disappointing interview.\nUh they weren't that strong.\nUh so I don't know.\nAnyway, um uh I've I've got one last kind of uh question for you before I get into my final uh as I mentioned to you as before we started recording that I always ask for a book recommendation and I also always ask our guests how people should be following them.\nBut my kind of my last deep question before we get there, we've so far in this episode, we've been leveraging your knowledge, but I haven't talked much about your particular background, uh, which is the way that we do things on this show.\nMost podcasts, they kind of like have people just talk about their career and how they got to where they are, but I kind of want to get to like what are you doing now and what's really exciting, which is obviously where we focused on the episode, but sometimes at the end, I want to go back a little, and I'm going to do that now with one last question.\nU, one kind of deep question.\nSo you have a multi-disiplinary background spanning engineering, business, and sustainability.\nHow do you leverage that background to help founders that you back integrate customer empathy and long-term impact considerations into AI products?\nUm, it seems like that's something that's important to you, you know, and because otherwise, you know, you might just end up founders might just end up prioritizing technical performance above all else.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nWell, maybe this uh two birds with one stone, we'll see.\nBut, you know, there's this book called Range, right?\nAnd it I mean I think it broadly argues that if you um see problems in a lot of different spaces then you can bring um you know a particular like a more a broader skill set to founders when you're looking at their problems whether it be product market fit or hiring or any numerous things they're looking at.\nUm and just be more resourceful.\nAnd so, you know, especially coming through my career um from CS to E to business to, you know, even within CS and E from being an individual contributor to being a manager to working more on the marketing side to, you know, all these different things.\nI think I've just seen a lot, right?\nAnd and now the beauty of AIX is I'm seeing way more even every day um because I get to talk to so many different founders and pick their brains and get to know them pretty well and support our portfolio and see how they're doing.\nAnd so, you know, I like to think that every day I get better and I I I improve my own skill set and can be even more valuable to founders.\nSo that's that's a little bit about how I how I think about it broadly.\nNice.\nAnd yeah, you got the book recommendation in there as well.\nNice.\nUh, was that the book that you wanted to recommend or do you want do you want kind of uh Yeah, I was thinking about I was thinking about um uh thinking about a a book that I've read a long time ago and continue to read that I quite like.\nThe Art of Happiness by Daly Lama.\nI think is a is quite a good book to just kind of level set and and um continue to be appreciative every day of, you know, the the time that we're living in and and kind of the the people and the innovation we're surrounded by is staggering.\nUm what an amazing time.\nAnd then um yeah, books like books like range um uh there's a new book called AI Valley that came out um talking about Silicon Valley in this time and um those are those are all good readings.\nNice.\nGreat recommendations there.\nI haven't read that particular book by the Daly Lama, but I read his uh I think it's called An Open Heart.\nYeah.\nUm some years ago.\nThat was a good one.\nAnd I got to say, you do seem like an unusually happy person.\nSo uh it's probably just that one book.\nI have I have a four-year-old that, you know, is getting to the point where he knows better than I, so I'm always very humble.\nNice.\nUm, all right, Shaun, this has been an amazing episode.\nI've learned so much from you.\nI'm sure a lot of our audience has as well.\nWhat's the best way for them to follow you after this episode and get more of your thoughts?\nYeah.\nUm, I'm on LinkedIn.\nYou can find me pretty easy.\nI'm at Twitter.\nUm, Shaun X Shaun Johnson.\nMy email is just saxentures.com.\nS. just first letter my name s as as in Shaun aixentures.com.\nNice.\nThank you so much again, Shaun, for taking the time and uh yeah, maybe we'll catch up again with you in a few years and see if we can complain again about how enterprise AI adoption is going too slowly at that time.\nThanks so much, Jon.\nWhat an honor to have Shaun Johnson in today's episode.\nIn it, the iconic AI investor covered how AIX Ventures' unique model combines AI practitioners like Richard Socher and Chris Manning with traditional VCs to evaluate both technical depth and market savvy in founding teams.\nHe said the most effective enterprise AI adoption strategy is to target open job requisitions.\nInstead of augmenting current workers, AI can fill positions companies are already trying to hire for.\nHe opined that only singledigit thousands of AI experts operate at the true frontier, creating massive talent scarcity and opportunity costs that drive both high compensation and talent acquisitions.\nHe talked about how both consensus applications in competitive spaces and non-conensus bets in overlooked markets can both succeed.\nExecution speed and the ability to pivot matter more than finding a perfectly empty market.\nHe also talked about how this trend, how major tech companies are increasingly doing talent acquisitions rather than full company acquisitions to avoid regular regulatory scrutiny while also still securing scarce AI expertise.\nAnd finally, Shaun talked about how knowledge workers should focus on humanto human touch points and building influence to remain valuable as AI transforms digital work.\nAs always, you can get all the show notes, including the transcript for this episode, the video recording, any materials mentioned on the show, the URLs for Shaun's social media
