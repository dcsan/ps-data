more time explaining this to kind\nof machine like people that are looking\nfor machine learning jobs or data\nscience jobs, which isn't necessarily, um,\nyou know, you advise a broader group\nof people.\nUm, and so when I'm talking\nabout machine learning, I often say\nthings like, you know, maybe you should\nhave like one machine vision project,\none NLP project.\nToday in the LLM era,\nyou might actually have a bunch of NLP\nprojects because it's become so\nubiquitous.\nUm, but historically, you\nknow, I'd give those kinds of examples.\nOh, and one on tabular data would also\nbe a great idea.\nAnd so do you have\nsomething like that where you would\ntypically say, you know, I recommend\nthat people applying for an entry level\nentry-level data job should do x number\nof projects and they should be in kind\nof like x categories?\nI think there's a\ncouple different ways to approach it.\nUm,\nI think the biggest thing for me is when\npeople are choosing projects is to do\nsomething that they're actually\ninterested in because a lot of times\nyou're building projects, you're going\nto hit roadblocks.\nYou're doing it on\nyour own time on weekends, late at\nnights, right?\nAnd so I think a lot of\nprojects get started and then kind of\ndie because people lack the motivation\nto finish them.\nUm, and so I think\nchoosing a project based off of like a\njob you're really excited about, uh, or\na hobby you really enjoy.\nSo for\nexample, if you're trying to land a job,\nlet's say, uh, at Meta or something, like I would try to\ncreate a project that they would be\ninterested in and they would care about.\nI think that's like the most important\nthing.\nUm, but um, if like and even if\nyou just built like one really killer\nproject for Meta, I think that would be\nenough.\nUm, but the way I kind of set it\nup in my accelerator boot camp is like,\nokay, more projects doesn't equal bad as\nlong as you're not spending a ton of\ntime, right?\nBecause that's the other\nthing that people trap that people fall\ninto is like, oh, like once I get like\nfive, you know, I have a SQL project and\nI have like an ETL project and then I\nhave like a a dashboard project, then\nI'll start applying for jobs.\nAnd I\nthink that's a that's a trap.\nSo, uh my\nadvice is like progress over perfection.\nLike just focus on getting like steps in\nthe right direction and not being a\nperfectionist.\nBut like if you can have\na project in like multiple different\nindustries covering multiple different\ntools, maybe one data viz, if I had like\nif I had to answer this with like a lot\nmore succinctly than I have already, I\nwould say like one SQL project, one data\nviz uh project, like that that alone is\na good good place to start.\nBut the more\nthe marrier a lot of the time.\nNice.\nPerfect.\nThat's exactly the kind of\nguidance I was looking for.\nThat's kind\nof it's a bit trickier for me thinking\nabout, you know, uh yeah, these kinds of\nroles like a data analyst role.\nThat's\nperfect.\nSQL project, a data viz\nproject.\nThat makes perfect sense.\nThat's really cool.\nRelated to what you\nwere saying about people picking\nprojects that they're excited about.\nYou've emphasized in the past um in\ncontent that you've created that if\nyou're a data professional, you should\ntry to live your life a little data\ndriven.\nAnd so this kind of this is\nrelated to projects potentially in terms\nof your portfolio, but also maybe even\njust kind of more generally maybe even\nto see like if you're thinking about\ntransitioning from the the lab or\nwhatever you're doing right now into a\nData Career and you actually haven't\nspent that much time digging into data.\nYou could find something in your own\nlife that so you for example, you've\ntalked about analyzing your hikes in\nPowerBI, tracking your dog's steps with\na Fitbit.\nAnd so these kinds of ideas,\nthey could tie into somebody's portfolio\nproject directly.\nYou could create a SQL\ndatabase of your hikes or something.\nUm,\nand do a data viz of your hikes.\nAny of\nthose kinds of things.\nThat actually\nsounds like a pretty cool.\nYou could\nhave some good visualizations of GPS\ndata or something in in like a geo some\nkind of geom mapping uh framework in R\nor Python.\nYou probably don't have\npeople learning R these days.\nI'm\nthinking about me getting started in\ndata 20 years ago.\nUm, and\nuh, so yeah, so I think that's kind of\nan interesting idea there.\nDo you have\nany other You're nodding your head a lot\nand you've now done a big inhale, so I'm\nsure you have things to say.\nWell, well,\nit's actually funny because yeah, I'm\nall about personal projects.\nLike I\nthink if you can make, like I said, I\nthink the biggest thing when creating a\nproject is actually finishing it.\nAnd so\nyou have to be motivated.\nAnd I think if\nyou can like do something around your\nlife, you're going to be more more\nmotivated to finish it.\nWhen I first\nbuilt my boot camp in 2021, I actually\nbuilt it um all around uh another I\nguess acronym PPP uh personal uh\nPortfolio Projects.\nAnd I was like every\neverything I taught was tied back to\ndoing a project in your life.\nSo like\nfor instance when we looked when we\nlearned dashboarding uh I taught uh\nGoogle Looker Studio because it was free\nand I liked it.\nBut um anyways, and we\nwould we would create a dashboard of our\nscreen time, like how much time we we\nspent on our phones and like the\ndifferent apps and stuff.\nAnd uh then\nwhen I when I taught Python, I\nintroduced um the Spotify API and we\nanalyzed like what music we listened to.\nUm and it was super fun.\nBut the problem\nwith personal projects a lot of the time\nis the data collection can be really\nhard.\nUh it's a lot harder to especially\nApple doesn't want you to know how much\ntime you really spend on your phone.\nSo\nthey don't let you export it.\nSo you\nhave to like manually do it.\nSo uh\npersonal projects can be like really\nmeaningful and really cool on a resume,\nbut they can also be more time inensive.\nSo it's a trade-off there, right?\nBecause like hitting download on a CSV\nand throwing it in Tableau, that takes a\nlot less time than like manually doing\nall this effort.\nSo I'm a huge fan of of\npersonal projects.\nUh you just have to\nbe careful that like they don't take up\nyour entire life.\nUm, and then one\nrelated note I'll say on that is like if\nyou're in a role right now that has like\nnothing to do with data, like just\ntrying to start to think like a data\nprofessional, even if you're not even\ndoing any analysis, I think can be\nreally cool.\nUm, in one of my last\nepisodes of the Data Career podcast, uh,\nit was with uh, uh, one of my students,\nher name was Jen Hawkins, and she was a\ndelivery driver.\nUm, and uh, like a\ndelivery driver has to be like one of\nthe least data analysty roles you could\nhave, right?\nYou're not a computer, but\nshe was like when she had to like get\ninto a gatecoded community or like a\ngate uh, coded apartment building, she\nwould have to send text messages to the\nthe recipients and she was thinking, I'm\ngoing to AB test my copy and see like if\nthat like lets me get a higher success\nof getting in or gets gets me in faster.\nThere was no analysis real analysis like\nlike statistically of this data.\nBut\nthat alone I think makes a great bullet\npoint.\nAnd she was so good at this that\nlike people when they look at her\nLinkedIn it looks like she was you know\na data analyst in this role.\nShe said\nlike AB testing uh marketing messages.\nThat was basically her bullet point for\nthis role.\nShe was texting people to\ndeliver packages.\nBut like if you can\nhave just like an analytical mindset I\nthink one that's going to make your job\nmore enjoyable now.\nBut but two, uh it's\ngoing to make great bullets for your\nresume and give you experience, you\nknow.\n",
