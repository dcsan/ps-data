  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nSo now I have a better understanding of what the workflows are like for somebody who is trying to work with marketing data, trying to take get actionable insights from marketing data, whether they are a hands-on, you know, data practitioner or whether they're a business user.\nUm with the data conversations product that Adverity has now released with this generative experience, how does that change everything for a user?\nHow like previously, you know, you previously Adverity was has already been making life easier by handling the interaction between all these different kinds of databases, data transformations, outputs, as well as like you mentioned recently a few moments ago on the podcast, you know, keeping up with all the changes that data providers like Google and Facebook marketing data providers make, so that there was clearly already this kind of value to Adverity.\nFor what is the added value and what is the change in the experience like with data conversations?\nYeah, I think um so the most clear or the the the the most standout uh difference is that rather than you know looking for the correct dashboard or correct, you know, set of data that you want to look at, you can formulate a natural query and we we going to figure this out for you.\nUm rather than you know looking for um a specific data set on on your own or like really asking a different team to get you to the data that you need in order to answer your business type question.\nI think that's kind of the first and and most basic need that we address with uh data conversations is accessing data and putting it to good use because like like I said, the the tabular response can be immediately actioned upon by either um continue to use it in say for example a Google sheet or materializing this in a in a snowflake table um or bigquery table for that matter.\nSo you can you can immediately uh work with the data set uh once you're you know satisfied with the result.\nBut on top of that, there's also um business analytics questions that you can ask about the data set and we try to do the best in order to get to a solid uh response.\nSo you can ask for the best performing campaigns and the system will figure out how to how to connect the dots and create a a useful response for that matter.\nUm so all of um and all the the marketing type specialized or subject matter expertise that we have built is also built into the system.\nSo um that's that's helping you to get to to the response a lot faster.\nAnd I think the second huge benefit is you get a system that you can actually explore uh deeper.\nI mean there there's been basic you know um features for that and or basically are in in many BI tools that you can drill down into the data set and you know get get um more detailed data.\nIf you want to branch out in into other data sets and understand for example why a trend is happening this way, you can do this with the conversation.\nYou cannot do this with an explore function in say Looker or or at Adverity for that matter.\nVery nice.\nAll right, so basically you get more depth of response, you can explore data more deeply, and it's easier, particularly I I mean I guess for any kind of user, it doesn't even I was going to say particularly for a business user, but it's easier for anyone to be composing their questions in natural language relative to, you know, is a SQL query or something like that.\nYeah, absolutely.\nAnd rather and again going back to the enterprise capabilities, I think was very critical as well is to give it a tool uh that they can still manage own and audit um rather than having you know a wild mix of SAS tools tools connected together um that don't necessarily um give you the the type the level of governance that you need in order to comply with a lot of regulations that we face today.\nSo yeah, that's another aspect of of this.\nNice.\nAll right.\nSo for people who are our uh you know you know our core audience, people out there who are uh who are data analysts, data scientists, should do you think that they should be worried about tools like this encroaching on their roles or does it actually do do automated conversations like this around data actually free up data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers to be tackling more interesting problems?\nI'm assuming it's the latter.\nI'd be surprised if he answered any other way.\nNo, absolutely.\nI I'm totally in this uh I have the same understanding.\nSo uh this is this is going to allow a lot of um analysts also data engineers to focus on more strategic stuff um topics that uh you know are important for the business and focus on what what kind of value you can deliver for your company rather than you know playing having to not playing but the technology allows you to to do less busy work if you will.\nYeah.\nYou're not just getting messages like Slack messages, emails from, you know, finance, HR, marketing asking you for, oh, can you just do this data pull for me real quick?\nExactly.\nAnd you're like, well, there goes my day.\nYeah, sure.\nUh, let's do this.\nAnd rather than that, you can point uh your colleagues also to this solution that helps you, you know, focus on the on the real stuff.\nI think uh something that that certainly will matter in this role moving forward is uh there's a lot about um how you govern those tools and make sure that the the responses are are correct and and right so having tools to monitor and and supervise uh what's going on in your business and uh that's uh critical um but yeah I don't think that you know any jobs are at risk on the contrary I think the the profiles will change and uh there's there's uh I I don't see a major, you know, issue.\nYou have to obviously go with the with the trend in a way, but that has always been the case.\n",
