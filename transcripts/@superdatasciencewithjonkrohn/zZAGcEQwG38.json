  "cleanText": "This is episode number 896 on AI not taking your job anytime soon.\n\nWelcome back to the SuperDataScience Podcast.\nI'm your host, John Cone.\nToday's topic is whether AI is actually taking jobs.\nAnd spoiler alert, the data suggest it's not happening yet despite all the anxiety out there.\nOn this podcast, I'm often covering the latest, most exciting AI advances.\nThere's often a dark flip side to that in many of our minds.\nHowever, maybe you've tried Chad GPT or Claude and thought, \"Wow, this thing can do a lot of what I do at work.\"\nWell, you're not alone.\nEarlier this year, global Google searches for AI unemployment hit an all-time high.\nIn tech hubs like London and San Francisco, how long do you reckon I have left in your job has become standard water cooler conversation.\nWith AI models now capable of writing detailed reports, creating videos on demand, and tackling increasingly complex tasks with fewer hallucinations, it's natural to wonder if we're all about to become surplus to requirements.\nBut here's the thing.\nWhen you actually dig into the data, the AI jobs apocalypse that everyone's worried about, it's nowhere to be found.\nLet me walk you through some of these data first.\nThere's a recent paper by Carl Benedict Frey and Pedro Lanos Paredes.\nI've got that for you in the show notes.\nThey're both from the University of Oxford and it's been making the rounds in recent weeks.\nCarl and Pedro suggest there's a link between automation and declining demand for translators.\nSounds scary for translators, right?\nBut here's where it gets interesting.\nOfficial American data show that employment in interpretation, translation, and related fields is actually up 7% year-over-year.\nThat's not a decline, that's growth.\nThen there's the CLA example that's been cited everywhere.\nThe fintech company made headlines boasting about using AI to automate customer service, but guess what?\nThey're now doing a complete about face.\nSebastian Samatkovski, uh, Siamatkovski, hopefully I'm not butchering that.\nUh Clara's CEO recently stated that there will always be a human if you want.\nSo much for the complete automation of customer service.\nSeparately, some folks have been trying to find evidence of AI job displacement in macroeconomic data.\nOne metric that's gotten attention is the unemployment ratio between recent college graduates and the overall American average.\nYoung graduates are currently more likely than the average worker to be jobless.\nAnd the theory goes like this.\nThese young graduates typically do entry-level knowledge work like paralegal tasks, making PowerPoint slides at management consultancies.\nExactly the kind of work that generative AI excels at.\nSo maybe AI has eliminated these jobs.\nWell, when you actually examine the data carefully, the narrative falls apart as well.\nThe relative unemployment rate for young graduates started rising back in 2009.\nThat's 15 years before Chad GBT burst onto the screen.\nAnd the actual unemployment rate, it's around 6%, which is still quite low by historical standards.\nAnd what if data that directly address whether AI is hitting white collar workers, the folks everyone assumes are most vulnerable, were talking about people in back office support, financial operations, sales, and similar types of roles.\nIf AI were decimating these roles, we'd see it in the employment statistics, right?\nWell, we don't.\nOver the past year, the share of employment in white collar work has actually risen slightly.\nLet me repeat that.\nIt's gone up, not down.\nAmerican unemployment overall remains low at 4.2% and wage growth is still reasonably strong.\nIt's really hard to square strong wage growth with the idea that AI is causing labor demand to plummet.\nAnd this isn't just an American phenomenon.\nEarnings growth across much of the rich world, Britain, the Euro area, Japan, remains robust.\nIn 2024, the employment rate for OECD countries, those are developed countries, hit an all-time high.\nThat's the share of working age people who actually have jobs reaching unprecedented levels at the exact moment when AI capabilities are exploding.\nSo, what is going on here?\nThere are two competing explanations and both are probably true to some extent.\nFirst, despite all the breathless announcements about companies revolutionizing their operations with AI, actual adoption for serious production work remains surprisingly low.\nAn official measure suggests that less than 10% of American companies are using AI to produce goods and services.\nThink about that.\nWe're in the midst of what they call an AI revolution, and 90% of companies aren't even using it for real work yet.\nThat's a big opportunity for all you listeners out there uh who are practicing and deploying AI in the real world.\nLots more companies that still need your help uh ahead than behind.\nAll right, so that's the first uh explanation for why um uh AI is not taking jobs.\nThe second explanation is that when companies do adopt AI, they're typically not firing people.\nInstead, AI is helping workers do their jobs faster and better.\nIt's augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing humans entirely.\nThis makes a lot of sense.\nUh most jobs involve a complex mix of tasks, many of which were require human judgment, creativity, emotional intelligence, or physical presence that AI can't replicate.\nNow, I want to be clear.\nI'm not saying AI will never impact employment.\nTechnology has always changed the nature of work, and AI will be no different.\nBut the data suggests we're not facing an imminent jobs crisis.\nInstead, we're in a phase where AI is creating opportunities for those who learn to work with it effectively.\nHere's my take.\nRather than panicking about AI taking your job, focus on learning how to use these tools to enhance your capabilities.\nThe most valuable workers in the coming years won't be those who compete against AI, but those who collaborate with it.\nExperiment daily with the latest LLMs.\nMy favorite for general work today is Anthropics Claude Opus 4.\nthough I reach for OpenAI's deep research for my most complex and important problems.\nUh you can listen to episode 870 of this podcast for more detail on OpenAI's deep research.\nUm yeah, so experiment daily with the latest LLMs like those so that you understand what AI can and can't do well and then figure out how to integrate it into your workflow.\nThe bottom line is this.\nDespite all the anxiety, the data show that AI isn't causing mass unemployment.\nEmployment is high.\nWages are growing and companies are still hiring.\nYes, the nature of work will evolve, but that's been true throughout history.\nThe key is to evolve with it.\nSo, take a deep breath and smell the opportunity.\nStart thinking about how you can use AI to become even better at what you do.\nThese are exciting times, and with the right mindset, you can thrive in the age of AI rather than just survive it.\nAll right, that's it for today's episode.\nI'm John Cone, and you've been listening to the SuperDataScience
