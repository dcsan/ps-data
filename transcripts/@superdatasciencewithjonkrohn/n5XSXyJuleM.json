  "cleanText": "This is episode number 92, our in case you missed it in June episode. Welcome back to The SuperDataScience Podcast. I am your host, JonKrohnLearns. This is an in case you missed it episode that highlights the best parts of conversations we had on the show over the past month. In episode 897, I speak to Diane Hare, who is founder and CEO at the strategy consulting firm Bislove. Diane's business helps companies drive sustainable digital transformation, including transformation via AI. And she's got five key tips for us to do just that. In this clip, she shares them with us. You know, we've kind of we framed the common problems that we have in organizations um around adoption of AI or any other, you know, new technology. We've talked about, you know, you've talked about particular solutions including case studies of situations where you have made a you've been really successful making a big impact with AI and you know, you've provided some here and there, you know, takeaways that any listener can can have. I was wondering if you have a particular set of tips, a particular list of tips that would be helpful for our listeners to be able to to to be able to come away from this podcast episode and more effectively enable change in their organization, to more effectively be able to, you know, not get stuck on the what and uh and and and be able to yeah, accelerate change uh and success in their organization. Yeah. So, I have five. Perfect. Um, first one is top down, bottoms up, which means if you're going to push change through your organization, you have to not only get your senior leaders aligned, you need to enable those at the front lines. And your job is often to be the bridge between the two. So, I say top down, bottoms up from an enterprise lens. Um, the other thing is bold claims and proof points. When you're cutting through the noise and you're a storyteller and you say big claims, you have to back them up with data and proof points because not everyone is going to come with you, believe you, understand you. So, you need to make sure you're expressing yourself so all different populations can believe and understand you. Um, the other one is what I said. You have real two, you have two levers to pull when you're trying to drive change. We're into number two now. Three. Oh, we're into number three. So, first one, top down, bottoms up. Yeah. Yeah. Bold claims and proof points is number two. Gotcha. Yep. Um, the next one is you have two levers to pull when you're trying to drive change. You can either inspire or incentivize. Often companies double down on incentivize and they forget the inspire. So focus on storytelling to tell the broader impact, right? To describe the ROI in a way that's inspirational, right? So I guess like so if you're being incentivized, there's something like you know there's some end ofear bonus that you're chasing, right? And so, you know, you're you're you're not necessarily like inherently motivated by some challenge or opportunity. You're being extr extrinsically like yeah, incentivized to to go in some direction. But if you're inspired, then you know, you kind of naturally are like, \"Wow, this is a huge opportunity. This is the moment of my career.\" Yeah. And you're not even worried about some specific bonus because you know that if you succeed at this, you're going to be recognized. Uh you know there's there's going to be a big impact in the firm and you know it's a great opportunity for you. Yeah. The impact you have is bigger than you. That's when you are inspired, you're serving someone else. You're serving a bigger cause and it taps into the discretionary effort, the nights, the weekends, the long hours, not because you have to, because you want to. And then um the next one is number four. Number four, focus on the 18%. Focus on the early adopters, not the naysayers. And then the last one is um it's easy and simple, but it's they call you a leader because you have the courage to go first. When you're in change programs, you are usually the outlier. You are the p the person pushing against compliancy. um you know the way we've always done business, you're crazy, we can't change. And so they call you a leader because you go first. You you are going to have to put yourself into a vulnerable, courageous space. And just know that going into it. Nice. Uh I I didn't write those down. Can you recap the five for us quickly? Sure. First one, top down, bottoms up. Yeah. Yeah. Second, bold claims and proof points. Yeah. Yeah. Uh third, two levers, inspire or incentivize. Fourth, focus on early adopters. You're 18%. Then the fifth one is they call you a leader because you go first. So have the courage to to go first. I definitely went away inspired by Dian's approach. So I guess she got me at.3. The next guest is someone who specializes in advising folks who'd like to advance their career in data or even land their first data role. In episode 893, Avery Smith explains what kind of projects should go into a portfolio to increase your chances of getting a job. Do you have specific guidance for listeners on how many projects they should have or whether they should have projects in kind of different modalities? So I spend a bit more time explaining this to kind of machine like people that are looking for machine learning jobs or data science jobs which isn't necessarily um you know you you advise a broader group of people. Um and so when I'm talking about machine learning I often say things like you know maybe you should have like one machine vision project one NLP project. Today in the LLM era you might actually have a bunch of NLP projects because it's become so ubiquitous. U but historically you know I'd give those kinds of examples. Oh, and one on tabular data would also be a great idea. And so, do you have something like that where you would typically say, you know, I recommend that people applying for an entry-le entry- level data job should do X number of projects and they should be in kind of like X categories. I think there's a couple different ways to approach it. Um, I think the biggest thing for me is when people are choosing projects is to do something that they're actually interested in because a lot of times you're building projects, you're going to hit roadblocks. You're doing it on your own time on weekends, late at nights, right? And so I think a lot of projects get started and then kind of die because people lack the motivation to finish them. Um, and so I think choosing a project based off of like a job you're really excited about uh or a hobby you really enjoy. So for example, if you're trying to land a job, let's say uh at at Facebook or something at Meta, like I would try to create a project that they would be interested in and they would care about. I think that's like the most important thing. Um, but um, if like and even if you just built like one really killer project for meta, I think that would be enough. Um, but the way I kind of set it up in my accelerator boot camp is like, okay, more projects doesn't equal bad as long as you're not spending a ton of time, right? Because that's the other thing that people trap that people fall into is like, oh, like once I get like five, you know, I have a SQL project and I have like an ETL project and then I have like a a dashboard project, then I'll start applying for jobs. And I think that's a that's a trap. So, uh my advice is like progress over perfection. Like just focus on getting like steps in the right direction and not being a perfectionist. But like if you can have a project in like multiple different industries covering multiple different tools, maybe one data viz, if I had like if I had to answer this with like a lot more succinctly than I have already, I would say like one SQL project, one data viz uh project, like that that alone is a good good place to start. But the more the marrier a lot of the time. Nice. Perfect. That's exactly the kind of guidance I was looking for. That's kind of it's a bit trickier for me thinking about you know uh yeah these kinds of roles like a data analyst role. That's perfect. SQL project a data viz project. That makes perfect sense. That's really cool. Related to what you were saying about people picking projects that they're excited about. You've emphasized in the past um in content that you've created that if you're a data professional, you should try to live your life a little data driven. And so this kind of this is related to projects potentially in terms of your portfolio, but also maybe even just kind of more generally maybe even to see like if you're thinking about transitioning from the the lab or whatever you're doing right now into a data career and you actually haven't spent that much time digging into data, you could find something in your own life that so you for example, you've talked about analyzing your hikes in PowerBI, tracking your dog's steps with a Fitbit. And so these kinds of ideas, they could tie into somebody's portfolio project directly. You could create a SQL database of your hikes or something. Um, and do a data viz of your hikes. Any of those kinds of things. That actually sounds like a pretty cool. You could have some good visualizations of GPS data or something in in like a in a geo some kind of geom mapping uh framework in R or Python. You probably don't have people learning R these days. I'm thinking about me getting started in data 20 years ago. Um, and uh, so yeah, so I think that that's kind of an interesting idea there. Do you have any other You're nodding your head a lot and you've now done a big inhale, so I'm sure you have things to say. Well, well, it's actually funny because yeah, I'm all about personal projects. Like I think if you can make, like I said, I think the biggest thing when creating a project is actually finishing it and you have to be motivated. And I think if you can like do something around your life, you're going to be more more motivated to finish it. When I first built my boot camp in 2021, I actually built it um all around uh another I guess acronym PPP uh personal uh portfolio projects. And I was like every everything I taught was tied back to doing a project in your life. So like for instance when we looked when we learned dashboarding uh I taught uh Google Looker Studio because it was free and I liked it. But um anyways, and we would we would create a dashboard of our screen time, like how much time we we spent on our phones and like the different apps and stuff. And uh then when I when I taught Python, I introduced um the Spotify API and we analyzed like what music we listened to. Um, and it was super fun, but the problem with personal projects a lot of the time is the data collection can be really hard. Uh it's a lot harder to especially Apple doesn't want you to know how much time you really spend on your phone. So they don't let you export it. So you have to like manually do it. So uh personal projects can be like really meaningful and really cool on a resume, but they can also be more time inensive. So it's a trade-off there, right? Because like hitting download on a CSV and throwing it in Tableau, that takes a lot less time than like manually doing all this effort. So I'm a huge fan of of personal projects. Uh you just have to be careful that like they don't take up your entire life. Um, and then one related note I'll say on that is like if you're in a role right now that has like nothing to do with data, like just trying to start to think like a data professional, even if you're not even doing any analysis, I think can be really cool. Um, in one of my last episodes of the data career podcast, uh, it was with uh, uh, one of my students, her name was Jen Hawkins, and she was a delivery driver. Um, and uh, like a delivery driver has to be like one of the least data analysty roles you could have, right? You're not a computer, but she was like when she had to like get into a gatecoded community or like a gate uh coded apartment building, she would have to send text messages to the the recipients and she was thinking, I'm going to AB test my copy and see like if that like lets me get a higher success of getting in or gets gets me in faster. There was no analysis real analysis like like statistically of this data. But that alone I think makes a great bullet point. And she was so good at this that like people when they look at her LinkedIn it looks like she was you know a data analyst in this role. She said like AB testing uh marketing messages. That was basically her bullet point for this role. She was texting people to deliver packages. But like if you can have just like an analytical mindset I think one that's going to make your job more enjoyable now. But but two uh it's going to make great bullets for your resume and give you experience. You know, from creating solid portfolios, we move to career success stories. In episode 899, I chat to Kirill Eremenko, whom many listeners will know as the founder and the original host of this podcast. In addition to founding this podcast, he's also the founder of the namesake of this podcast, the educational platform SuperDataScience.com. In episode 899, Kirill returned to his podcast to bring us lessons from SuperDataScience.com students who went on to have fantastic careers. In this clip, he details his third example, a Los Angeles-based senior developer. Number three, Claraara. She's a senior developer living in LA and um uh in her mid-40s aiming for um roles in the 200,000 plus salary range. So this uh person she has been in uh working already for um two decades or more uh in in this space and has tons of experience. in fact um has done all sorts of roles in uh software engineering uh developing apps, developing um programs, developing um different things for different companies. most recently for the past I think it was five year oh sorry three or five years I don't remember let's say three years uh she has been creating software using Python interestingly software that processes data lots of excel lots of CSV files using Python in the medical space in fact a lot of our me a lot of our members I don't know the exact percentage but a lot of our members I speak with uh work in the medical space supporting uh companies whether it's hospitals or um pharmaceuticals or other medical space related like medical equipment companies, procurement companies or supply chain companies and so\n\nOn. Anyway, so she's been creating all this uh software using Python, specifically pandas and uh other tools to process uh lots of data. So lots of Python experience uh and recently has done four of our machine learning courses: Machine Learning A to Z, Machine Learning Level One, Machine Learning Level Two, Machine Learning Level Three. And she wants to get into the space of machine learning and AI. Why? The reason is because Claraara is um in her mid-40s. She can she predicts that she'll be in the workforce for at least another 15 years and she can see that the current role that she's doing is uh while um, you know, pays well and she's very good at it, is not it might not be as relevant in the future. It's not a role that um, as we discussed with Claraara, is like it's not a role that's a self-fulfilling prophecy. She's not learning new skills in the role that will uh open up more doors for her in the future that will um, you know, keep her growing with the growing trends in technology. She's very selective about applications. In fact, she um left her job a few months ago to focus specifically on studying and preparing for the new role. She's not in a rush. She wants to take things um slowly and uh basically goes mostly through her network, not applying to thousands of jobs through LinkedIn and and so on. Mostly goes through her networks, very selective. Um, and uh, yeah, so that's that's her goal to get into this space. And the interesting thing, the pain point that Claraara has is she's finding there are thousands, literally thousands of job applicants per job. And even at her level of experience, expertise and um, you know, background and all these projects that she's done, she's finding it difficult to uh break in and to land the job that she's looking for.\n\nOh yeah, interesting story. Um, why do you think that is? Why do you think she's having trouble?\n\nThat's a good question. I think it's um probably related to this phenomena where there's lots of jobs but there's also lots of applicants and it's really hard to stand out. I think it's been the same since for the past 10 years when there's lots of people applying um through the direct means of like uh just submitting your resume and all of them get pre-screened uh with AI tools and um, it just like if the if the hiring manager had a conversation with Claraara directly like magically, then they would realize she's amazing and they would hire her in a in a heartbeat. Uh, but because it's really hard to get in front of people this direct way, I think that's the problem. And I think Claraara has got the the right idea of going through connections and going through networking um to get in in front of the people quicker. What do you think?\n\nNetworking ideally in person is I think easily the best way to get your professional opportunities. Not everyone can do that. You know, not everyone is, you know, you might have a family situation or just where you are geographically. If you want to get a job, you know, in data science or AI, you know, maybe there aren't, you know, in-person things you can be doing. Remote's really the only option. And there are probably then in that kind of scenario still things like SuperDataScience.com, you know, these kinds of platforms where you can get involved, you can do um collaborative projects together, get to know people. I mean, that kind of gives you that kind of collegial feeling like you you know, you'll you'll remember you know the projects you've worked on, the people you've been with, their expertises and you know, that's something like, you know, working with someone in an office and understanding what they can do and maybe they'll open a door for you some years from now and if you you know, so the more you do that, the more that you're uh working with people online if you have to, but ideally you are meeting, you know, you you meeting people in person. There's something about, you know, like a lot of uh a lot of like in in the US, there's something called Meetup.com and with Meetup.com, you can in you know, any major city in the US or Canada, you can find meetups for whatever you're interested in. It's not specific to tech. Um, I'm sure there's like, you know, microwave uh chefs, microwave reprogramming chefs meetup. Um, there's all kinds of specific things out there. But, you know, in data science in particular, you know, there's there's lots of different of these kinds of meetups and you go and you could be at any stage. You know, you could be just getting started. You could be thinking about it. You know, maybe you're like a medical doctor and you're you're tired of just, you know, dealing with one human at a time and you have a vision for some kind of like medical AI system that you want to build um to like scale up your impact. And so you can start going to these meetups and and meeting people and decide, okay, well, maybe like how, you know, how can I take further steps into this um, you know, should I be joining a platform like SuperDataScience.com or like do a master's in person at a local university. Um, so you could be you know, at that very early stage where you're just exploring if a career in data science or AI is something you're interested in all the way through to being a, you know, a big expert. Uh, you know, you might participate in giving the talks if you're an expert. Often these meetups have that, you know, it could be based around one or two speakers um talking about real-world projects or some open-source library they're developing. But around these, you know, you you learn stuff from the speakers, but around these, you also have lots of social interaction. You know, there's there's drinks at a lot of these. Pizza is often the like food that they order. Um, and you know, sometimes it's sponsored by some local data science or AI company or maybe there's like some small fee like five bucks or 10 bucks that you p you pitch in to be able to, you know, buy the pizza and the beer or whatever. Um, and yeah, it's in those it's in those social interactions that you yeah, you meet people and some people just, you know, you click with them and you chat with them more. You see them there a few times and uh, yeah, you might find your next job, you might find your romantic partner, you might find your best friend. Uh, you never know. Uh, you know, in a way that I think, you know, those kinds of things, those kinds of connections, they don't, uh, it's it's it's a little bit harder to make them online, but it can happen. I have personally had a lot of good experiences with Meetup.com. It's actually been critical to advancing my career. And what's great about these events is that they can happen anywhere in the world. So, look out for a meetup that's relevant to you uh if you're looking to advance your career or even just uh meet some like-minded people.\n\nMy final clip is taken from episode 895. In it, I speak to Shaun Johnson, co-founder and general partner at AIX Ventures in San Francisco. As an investor in early-stage startups, Sean gave me some great insights into what he's looking for and how he evaluates the market.\n\nWhen you're evaluating these early-stage AI startups that you invest in, what are some of the non-obvious signs of product market fit that you look for? Or I guess even more generally, what are you looking for in those investments? How do you evaluate that the market is ripe for that particular type of AI in that particular application?\n\nYeah. You know what early stage is um is really a game of people. You you you back the founder um when they're just you know or founders when they're just having their you know idea, you know, maybe they have some prototype or some product, but um, it's really a a people bet and you know, they will go out there with their vision to change the world and they will learn quite a lot and that will result in pivots, uh, you know, micro and macro um, and so, you know, we don't we can't say like, you know, I don't I don't think VCs are like genius market timers, right? I think you know, they can have a sense of that, but then also recognize that the founder will do what they need to do and we we really just look at investing in um teams that can execute at sort of the speed of light and and pivot however much they need to to find a resonant point um between what their offering is and the market and then and then you know, get to that um great growth trajectory.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. But then it begs of me this, it begs the same a similar kind of question, which is how do you then identify that kind of founder or that kind of founding team? I guess um, you know, is there kind of I I've had guests, I've had investors on in the past who have said that with AI startups, they typically look for this kind of three-legged stool of um a CEO, which is somebody who's great at selling the idea, um a CTO, who obviously is highly technical. But then in an AI startup, you also have this uh AI expert who, you know, where the CTO is maybe more concerned with platform scalability, reliability, those kinds of concerns, you have this third co-founder, uh, that is the AI expert at at or near the cutting edge, like you described Richard Socher or Chris Manning might be um with their research. Does that kind of ring true to you as well in in the teams that you're investing in?\n\nYeah, not not I would say um 100%. The way we think about it, we start by looking at the team and assessing two two factors. One is AI nativeness, right? Do we consider this team to be um quite deep in AI or or or not? Um, and then market savviness or commercial savviness, right? Do they have expertise in this area? Do they have any right building into this market? Um, and and that's really where we focus. And then we ask ourselves um, given a team and given where we think kind of that market landscape is um, where will they need to improve, right? Like you, it's never perfect. You don't find teams that are always optimally AI native and optimally commercial savvy. And so if you invest in a team that's more AI native and less commercial savvy, then the question is how do you derisk the commercial savviness with the team? Maybe that's advisors, you know, etc. And then, you know, I think when techn technological inflection points like we've seen with ChatGPT happen, what what the market, you know, what happens in the market is you have a number of consensus applications that are now possible, right? Like everyone knows that um we should do like AI-powered tutoring and so everybody is like, well, let's build AI-powered tutoring. Um, but what you need to do there, we think, is invest in extreme AI native teams that can actually bring experiences to consumers that other teams just cannot. And as um the the years go on and you start getting outside of this consensus dri or yeah, consensus-driven investing, you go back into like the markets savvy investing where you don't need as much the AI native teams, like like still be very good, but it becomes more important to have a market insight that is non-consensus. And so, you know, the way we think about it, if you think about SAS investing, let's say five years ago, SAS investing, you know, nobody like there wasn't a ton of differentiation on like the MCV stack. It's not like you're like, oh right, like the model is like, you know, the model technology is unique, the database is unique, or like the controller is unique, or the view is unique. It's all, you know, and right, like um MySQL and it's, you know, in the middle, in in like in the middle, um, where it's, you know, let's call it Node.js or, you know, Ruby, and then it's, you know, React or HTML, CSS, JS. Um, and that's all commodity, right? It's just like, well, what's the idea? How are you going to configure? And and AI will get there within the current framework of the technology. Now, if we have a new um, a new architecture come out that that does uh uh replace transformers, then but game on again, right? Now a whole new set of consensus bets will be made against what that technology can can create. Um, but right now, I think what we're transitioning from, you really need AI native teams in a consensus in a in a consensus world to you're going to start needing more markets savvy teams in a in a non-consensus world.\n\nRight. That sounds like a great balance. And I guess I was I was being oversimplistic.\n\nYeah. In my kind of thinking of like, yeah, this is the this is the kind of founding team. It makes perfect sense that obviously every situation is different.\n\nYeah. And the last thing I'd add to that that question, John, is um this comment on like, do you need the AI expert on the team, right? So you have your CEO that's like a, you know, market savvy and you have your CTO that's like a builder, and then do you need this AI expert? And you know, I've seen this on lots of teams, even my last team at at LILT. Um, I I think the I I think what the best way to orient uh a team is to have um AI engineers, folks that can build um very adeptly with the technology in production that are also savvy enough to be reading the papers and understanding how the technology is changing and be able to integrate that into the stack. I don't think you need like a PhD that can just sit there and read papers. Ideally, your folks building in production can all are also savvy enough to read papers. Um, is is kind of our take on it.\n\nGood news, too, because AI PhDs are expensive.\n\nAll right, that's it for today's in case you missed it episode. To be sure not to miss any of our exciting upcoming episodes, subscribe to this podcast if you aren't already. But most importantly, I hope you'll just keep on listening. Until next time, keep on rocking it out there and I'm looking forward to enjoying another round of The SuperDataScience Podcast with you very soon.\n\n[Music]",
