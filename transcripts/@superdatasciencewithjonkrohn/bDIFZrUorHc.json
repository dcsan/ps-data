  "cleanText": "This is episode number 94 on how AI is disrupting the entire Advertising Industry.\n\nWelcome back to the SuperDataScience podcast.\nI'm your host, John Cone.\nA few weeks ago in episode 896, I made the case that AI probably isn't going to take your job anytime soon.\nAI is however being quite disruptive as more and more tasks are automated.\nAnd there are examples of industries being so disrupted by AI that some folks within the industry need to take note because if they don't adapt, their role, maybe even their whole company could be at risk.\nTo be specific, today's episode is how AI is disrupting the Advertising Industry.\nIn May, the advertising world wrapped up its annual awards festival in Khan in France.\nAnd while the champagne was flowing and trophies were being handed out for campaigns promoting everything from beer to, I'm not making this up, the New Zealand Herpes Foundation, there is an undercurrent of disruption that's got everyone talking.\nThe industry that prides itself on human creativity is finding itself squarely in the crosshairs of AI.\nBehind the hubhub is Mark Zuckerberg recently promising that brands will soon be able to simply tell Meta what they want to achieve with an ad campaign and how they're willing to pay, how much they're willing to pay, and AI will handle the rest.\nSam Alman from OpenAI went even further, claiming that 95% of what marketers currently use agencies and creative professionals for will soon be handled by AI almost instantly and at virtually no cost.\nThese are bold claims, but when you look at the data, they might not be that far off.\nLet me share some numbers that really put this in perspective.\nGlobal ad spending is growing at about 6% annually and is expected to maintain that pace for the next 3 years.\nBut that growth is becoming highly concentrated.\nThe four largest sellers of ads, Google, Meta, Amazon, and ByteDance, accounted for more than half the global market last year.\nJust four companies or tech companies accounting for half of the global ad market last year.\nThat's up from just a third 5 years earlier.\nSo also growing quickly.\nIndeed, eight of the 10 largest ad sellers in the world are now tech firms.\nAt Khan, these digital giants literally set up a tense city along the beach, establishing their dominance in the physical world, just as they have done online.\nSo how exactly is AI strengthening these companies grip on the Advertising Industry?\nIt's happening in three main ways.\nLet's go over them.\nFirst, machine learning is dramatically improving ad targeting.\nMeta's AI powered Advantage Plus system, which I've got more info on in the show notes, claims to increase brands return on ad spending by 22%.\nAnd Google's Performance Max product, also in the show notes, repeatedly reportedly raises sales by over 10%.\nAnd Google's experimenting with ads in its AI powered search mode, which could be even more effective because AI queries are two to three times longer than regular searches.\nMeaning Google ends up knowing not just what you're looking for, but why you're looking for it.\nOkay, so that's the first reason.\nThe the first reason why and how AI is strengthening tech giants grip on the Advertising Industry.\nThe second one is that AI is revolutionizing how we measure ad effectiveness.\nThere's a startup called Olympic, for example, that's using contact tracing algorithms originally developed during COVID to track whether people who see ads actually end up buying the products.\nAs an example, Olympic an analyzed billions of rows of data and found that Delta Airlines sponsorship of medal ceremonies at last year's Olympics delivered a better return on investment than any of their other promotions.\nThat level of granular analysis just wasn't possible before.\nThird reason why the tech companies are strengthening their grip on the ad industry.\nAnd this is where it gets especially scary for creative professionals is that tech firms now believe they can create the ads automatically themselves.\nTikTok just unveiled AI powered tools that generate video commercials from text or photos.\nMeta recently launched features for automatically personalizing ad copy for different audiences in 10 languages.\nAnd as a concrete example, a betting company called Koshi recently aired a cinematic TV ad made with Google's AI tools.\nThe Koshi Spot was created in just 48 hours for $2,000 by a director who joked that he got to stay in his underwear for the entire shoot.\nAd executives, of course, are pushing back, arguing that AI models designed to produce the most likely answer aren't suited to creating campaigns that truly stand out.\nThey have a point.\nIn a world where every company can create passible ads with AI, commissioning content that breaks through the noise might become even more valuable.\nSome agencies, some ad agencies are already adapting by switching from hourly billing to flat fees to protect their revenue as AI reduces the hours needed to create campaigns.\nAlas, investors, at least at this time, aren't convinced by the ad industry's arguments.\nFour of the five big ad agency holding companies have seen their share prices drop since the beginning of last year.\nIn response to these market moves, WPP, one of the big agency holding companies, is looking for a new CEO.\nOmnicom and Interpublic, two of the others, are planning to merge.\nOnly Publix has avoided the stock slump largely by convincing the market that ah guess what?\nThey've invested enough in AI to be protected.\nRelatedly, as consumers increasingly turn from Google searches to AI chat bots for recommendations, advertisers need to figure out how to ensure their brands are recommended by the likes of ChatGpt, Gemini, and other AI assistants.\nSome companies are already creating promotional material aimed not at humans, but at the large language models the LLM's crawling the web for information.\nA startup called Evertune for example analyzes brands standing with chat bots by posing tens of thousands of queries.\nThey found that when asked to recommend bed sheets for example different AI models have surprisingly different perspectives.\nMeta's bots like a brand called Milani while Casper is popular with models with most models except Gemini.\nThe variations appear to come down to training data.\nWhile Google and OpenAI license content from Reddit, Meta's LLMs lean heavily on its own social media platforms.\nThis means influencing LLMs requires influencing their sources.\nIt involves building a loyal online following and ironically brings back the importance of old school public relations.\nBut there are other tricks too.\nAI models may struggle to read infographics, so these should be converted to text.\nAnd AI models love detailed product descriptions that would put most humans to sleep.\nA lengthy passage about a breakfast cereals ingredients might never be read by human eyes, but could convince an AI to recommend it.\nLooking ahead, a lot of talk about AI agents this year.\nAs AI agents are deployed to make buying decisions on our behalf, advertisers will need to figure out how to influence our digital servants.\nGoogle recently unveiled a shopping agent that alerts users when prices fall below certain levels.\nAnd these kinds of agents may soon have discretion to make more and more complex purchasing decisions.\nWe're heading toward a future where AI creates ads, targets those ads, and then a blend of humans and agents acting on behalf of humans make buying decisions based on those ads.\nThe Advertising Industry has weathered technological disruption before when dollars flowed from traditional media like newspapers and TV to digital platforms.\nBut this AI revolution feels different because it's automating the creative process itself, something the industry long considered uniquely human.\nThe rosÃ© will surely keep flowing at advertising awards ceremonies and con for years to come.\nBut increasing disruption by AI is also a certainty.\nAnd so the Advertising Industry is in for a wild ride.\nAnd even if you're not in advertising or content creation, what aspects of your role or your business are automatable?\nWhat parts of your industry and role are most ripe for AI disruption?\nPerhaps this is a great opportunity to kick off a conversation with your favorite LLM Claude or Chat GBT to get a handle on the change that's coming and how you can make the most of it.\nAll right, that's it for today's episode.\nI'm John Cron and you've been listening to the SuperDataScience podcast.\nIf you enjoyed today's episode or know someone who might consider sharing this episode with them, leave a review of the show on your favorite podcasting platform.\nTag me in a LinkedIn post with your thoughts and obviously subscribe to the show if you aren't already.\nThe most important thing though is I just hope you'll keep on listening.\nUntil next time, keep on rocking it out there and I'm looking forward to enjoying another round of the SuperDataScience podcast with you very soon.\n",
