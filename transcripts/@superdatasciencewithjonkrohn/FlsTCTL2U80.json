  "cleanText": "This is episode number 900 with 95-year-old Annie.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome back to the SuperDataScience podcast. For episode number 900, today we're doing something special. Like in episode number 800, my grandmother Annie, now one year older than last year, a spritly 95 years old, is my guest on the show. During the episode, Annie details challenges she's encountering at 95 and how she's overcoming them with key takeaways that are relatable to listeners of any age. All right, let's jump right into our conversation. So, welcome Annie. You're my grandmother or as I say in Ukrainian, my baba.\n Yeah.\nUh so, it's episode 900 that we're recording today.\n That's great.\n Yeah. You were in episode 800. You were the star of the show uh 100 episodes ago.\n Mhm.\nAnd on that one, we talked about what uh life was like before electricity and running water.\n I learned a lot about that.\n But then we actually we had you back not long after that in episode 816 because we had after episode 800, lots of people asked me on they said that they'd love the episode. And then people also asked if I could uh if we could do an episode where I tried to explain what I do for work. For work.\n Yeah. So people can go back and listen to that.\n Yeah. 800 and 816 if they want to. But today for episode 900, uh I've got a few different topics. One of them I was thinking about how amazing it is. You just celebrated your 95th birthday.\n That's right.\n Mhm. You had lots of visitors and phone calls. Very popular birthday cards.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n And um yeah, you're still living on your own in 95, which not a lot of people are doing.\n No, I know. And you're still very funny.\nI am. I am.\n Yes, you are very sharp.\n And so, yeah, one of the things I was thinking about that we haven't talked about before, you know, in episode 800, we talked about what it was like living before electricity and running water. And something else that you experienced when you were much younger was between 1949 and 1952. So about 75 years ago, your husband, my grandfather, he built the house that you're still living in.\n He's in it.\n Yeah. Exactly.\nAnd it's great.\n It is great. And so what was that like? I mean, how did somebody, you know, today probably not many people, maybe I have some listeners out there. There's so many of them. Maybe some of them have like built a house or something, but most people, you know, you think, okay, you call like an architect and then you call a construction company and people come and and build it for you. So, do you remember what was it like for him? Like, how did he get started?\n Well, he had help. Oh, he had help.\n He did had help.\nLike especially putting cement, right, foundation and well, he did the woodwork, the frames, but then putting the brick. He he had someone putting the brick in the house.\n Oh, okay. Okay.\nYeah.\n So, he did the wood frame.\n Yeah.\nWow. I mean, that's still pretty amazing cuz you think\n And he did the floor.\n He did the floor.\n Yeah. The wood floor and the woodwork around the doors, frames, and he did that.\n And the electrical work.\n He did some he did some of it.\n Yeah. He was a he he But there was so much to do. He had to help hell.\n Mhm.\n Yeah.\n What about plumbing?\nPlumbing too. He needed help.\nHe wasn't much of a plumber. He was more electrician.\n I gotcha. Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Um that's still amazing. So he basically did as much as he could and then as he could. Yeah.\n Yeah. And I mean that's still like to think 75 years ago to put down all this flooring\n Yeah.\n and all the woodwork and the house. It feels pretty sturdy when you walk around.\nOh, no. He made a really good, you know, job on it. He he worked what he did. He did slow but right, you know, like even he built a kitchen cupboard.\n Oh, yeah.\nYeah.\n Yeah.\n Yeah. I mean, that's what he was like. He liked to say, \"Measure twice, cut once.\"\n Well, that Yeah, that was him.\n That was his saying.\n Yeah.\nYeah. That's right. He always did a great job with everything. It was It was fun making like we would work on little crafts like I had a few years when I was in high school that I liked building. They had these like rocket sets.\n Oh yeah.\n And some of the rocket sets were very simple. They were for beginners, but I remember working on ones that were more advanced like one that looked like um this famous um American um plane called an SR71 Blackbird. and I still have it because it's a beautiful it's like a piece of art that he helped me build.\n I never put like a rocket in it and fired it because it looks too pretty.\nUm\nyeah. And so did a lot of people, you know, 75 years ago were other people also was it more common for people to be building their own house or was he kind of unusual even back then?\n He was unusual. You know, all these people they had contract all your neighbors the next door was contractor and he they were builders for other people.\n Yeah. Yeah.\nAnd too they were he he was a older guy.\nWell, at that time I I was so young yet, you know, he was probably 50 or 40. To me, he was old.\n Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, did most of the stuff Did he learn this? Because he was also at work. He worked in a machine shop, so he was very comfortable.\n Yeah.\n Yeah. It's pretty wild to think he gave us So you live in Niagara Falls and Niagara Falls is famous for having big waterfalls.\n Yeah.\nWhich they can use for power generation, hydroelectric power.\n Yeah. And he also build a clock in in Queenston big parts and\nWell, your mommy would know even better because they usually t together, you know.\n Yeah. Well, I've got I've got some pictures up here and I'll put them in the show notes. So, it's a big floral clock. It's gigantic. I mean it's like 30 40 ft wide. I'm not sure exactly.\nYeah, it's a it's a wide and pe people when you go on Sundays or holidays people all surrounding you know taking pictures. It's so beautiful.\n It is beautiful.\n Yeah.\n But that's I mean that's got to be some of the least complex things that he did because I remember he would give us tours of the hydroelectric plant underneath the waterfall.\n Oh yeah. And you know he was responsible by the end of his career he was the foreman for the machine shop.\nYes he was.\n And so he was responsible for building these gigantic turbines I guess you would call them.\nYeah that's what they called them.\n And so they're like you know they're also like 30 feet wide but they have to be exactly like precise down to tiny tiny tiny fractions of a hair thin.\n A hair thin.\n Yeah.\nExactly. He had those measurements to cost him a fortune because you know\n Yeah. They'd have to make special tools just to measure. Yeah. And he he would make sure that it was the right size and this because he was a foreman, so he had to do it right.\n Yep. Yep. Yep.\n Yeah.\n So yeah, I guess that's what g gave him the skills to be to to to be good to be building his own home, too.\n Yeah.\n Um well, very nice. And so, well, he's not with us anymore, but you do have you have some you have a different you have someone else around these days. So, I used So, I have a dog now who's uh 8 years old.\n Eight years old. Yeah.\n And since he's been about seven, he's been living mostly with you.\n Yeah. I I think even more than a year.\n It's true. It's almost two years now. It is. But he's getting close to 9 years old. So, nine years old. Yeah. But I just love him. He makes me happy. He he he kind of looks at me, you know, he's just like a little boy.\n Yeah. A little person.\n A little person. And so yeah, it's nice how much he makes you laugh. And\n he does.\n Was when you cuz you had dogs growing up. Were they Were they different because they lived outside mostly? They weren't. They were farmer's dog, you know, like getting the cows and horses and uh they were they were big dogs. They weren't that they weren't cozy. They they slept outside or in the barn with the other animals. And yeah, it's hard to imagine my dog doing that.\nOpra doing that. No, he's he just But he's tiny.\n He's 12 pounds and he just likes snuggling up. That's his I think that's his main job.\n Yeah, that's his main job is snuggling and looking at me, you know, are you okay?\n Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. He likes to he likes to take care of people.\nuh lately. So, in the past few months, you've had some trouble with headaches and dizziness because up until a few months ago, you could also drive all the time.\n Yeah, I drove and now I'm scared to drive because just in case of something happened. Yeah.\n Yeah. I I drove and went to church by myself and did shopping by myself and went to visit doctors. But now I do get little help.\nYeah. Exactly.\n My daughter, my baby daughter, she's helping.\n Yeah, my mother.\n Yeah, your mother is right.\n And um Yeah. So, you're getting a little help, but still you're able to do I still do things on my own.\n If you're on your own in the house for because she goes she she lives in Wateroo, so she has to go home to see her house. So, then I stay by myself.\n Yeah. Yeah. And uh something that's been important through this is so hopefully the headaches and dizziness maybe it'll even go away so much that you will be comfortable driving again someday.\n I hope so.\n Um and a and a big thing that's helped has been physical therapy.\n Yes, I I am. I could my dizziness is gone.\nSometimes comes back and my knees they were so bad now. Now I'm in pain but not in that sharp pain.\nYeah. I mean, so this is like it's an interesting thing because you started going to the physical therapy because the headaches, the dizziness, it was so bad.\n Bad. Yeah.\n But that's actually it started that's that part which is why you started going there in the first place. It started to get better enough that now as of your most recent session, they started working on your knees which have been causing you problems for decades.\n Yes.\nAnd you said that I mean right before we started recording you said how you know you're walking around today and it's much better than it has been in years.\nYes. It's I mean there's a pain but not that sharp pain. It's it's amazing. I you know I could walk I could you know go but but be before the therapy it it it was I couldn't I could hardly walk.\nWell now it's it's so great. It It's really and and he says he's going to do more.\n Yeah. It could get even better.\nGoing to get better. So you're going to be doing cartwheels.\n Yeah.\nAnd Yeah. So I guess kind of a lesson here is that, you know, for a while, you know, I think you were probably, you know, when when that those bad headaches, you know, paralyzingly bad.\nYou felt so you just had to lay there. You could hardly see and and you couldn't sleep. couldn't sleep. Uh and so initially I think a lot of people kind of have this instinct to see like what happens to have it go away on its own and maybe you just kind of get used to that kind of thing. Um so I think an important lesson here is that there's you know for a lot of problems that people have you know it could be there's help.\n There's help. Exactly.\n Yeah. So people should go for for physotherapy and\n Yeah. like I did. And first I I thought, \"Oh, they're not because I went to another person and they were working, but they weren't doing nothing for me.\"\nYeah. I mean, that's the thing is that maybe, you know, you have to go to the right one.\n Exactly. And you don't, you probably don't know. You've got to try a few, you know, it depends depending on what somebody's being affected by. It could be a different kind of doctor or therapist. And the first person you go to, maybe they just don't have exactly the specialization you need, but after trying a few different places.\n Yeah. So this Yeah. Well, that's a third place because the other one second one they very even even worse.\n So you So that's good. You know, that shows like the importance of persevering there where you go to one, it's not that good. You go to a second one, it's worse.\n Even worse.\nSo here you pay money and and you're and what did you get for it?\n Yeah, he talks and then goes away, you know, and and but once I saw this third one, I knew I'm going to get help somehow, I had that feeling and sure enough, I'm getting what I wished for.\n Perfect.\n Yeah.\nPerfect. And uh yeah, so hopefully I mean maybe we'll end up having an episode in between as well, but hopefully you'll be back for episode 1000 and we'll hear about how you're driving around.\n Yeah. Would that be great?\n That'd be great. And doing cartwheels.\n Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah.\n Perfect. Well, thank you for taking the time again to speak to my audience.\n I thank you for having me.
