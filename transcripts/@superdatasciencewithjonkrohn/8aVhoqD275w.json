developing, um, programs, developing, um, different things for different companies.\nMost recently, for the past, I think it was five year, oh, sorry, three or five years, I don't remember, let's say three years, uh, she has been creating software using Python.\nInterestingly, software that processes data, lots of excel, lots of CSV files using Python in the medical space.\nIn fact, a lot of our, me, a lot of our members, I don't know the exact percentage, but a lot of our members I speak with, uh, work in the medical space supporting, uh, companies, whether it's hospitals or, um, pharmaceuticals or other medical, medical space related, like medical equipment companies, procurement companies, or supply chain companies and so on.\nAnyway, so she's been creating all this, uh, software using Python, specifically pandas and, uh, other tools to process, uh, lots of data.\nSo lots of Python experience, uh, and recently has done four of our machine learning courses: Machine learning A to Z, machine learning level one, machine learning level two, machine learning level three.\nAnd she wants to get into the space of machine learning and AI.\nWhy?\nThe reason is because Claraara is, um, in her mid-40s.\nShe can, she predicts that she'll be in the workforce for at least another 15 years.\nAnd she can see that the current role that she's doing is, uh, while, um, you know, pays well and she's very good at it, it's not, it might not be as relevant in the future, it's not a role that, um, as we discussed with Claraara, is like, it's not a role that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nShe's not learning new skills in the role that will, uh, open up more doors for her in the future, that will, um, you know, keep her growing with the growing trends in technology.\nShe's very selective about applications.\nIn fact, she, um, left her job a few months ago to focus specifically on studying and preparing for the new role.\nShe's not in a rush.\nShe wants to take things, um, slowly and, uh, basically goes mostly through her network, not applying to thousands of jobs through LinkedIn and and so on, mostly goes through her networks, very selective.\nUm, and, uh, yeah, so that's, that's her goal to get into this space.\nAnd the interesting thing, the pain point that Claraara has is she's finding there are thousands, literally thousands of job applicants per job.\nAnd even at her level of experience, expertise, and, um, you know, background and all these projects that she's done, she's finding it difficult to, uh, break in and to land the job that she's looking for.\nOh yeah, interesting story.\nUm, why do you think that is?\nWhy do you think she's having trouble?\nThat's a good question.\nI think it's, um, probably related to this phenomena where there's lots of jobs, but there's also lots of applicants, and it's really hard to stand out.\nI think it's been the same since for the past 10 years when there's lots of people applying, um, through the direct means of like, uh, just submitting your resume and all of them get pre-screened, uh, with AI tools, and, um, it just like, if the, if the hiring manager had a conversation with Claraara directly, like magically, then they would realize she's amazing and they would hire her in a, in a heartbeat, uh, but because it's really hard to get in front of people this direct way.\nI think that's the problem, and I think Claraara has got the the right idea of going through connections and going through networking, um, to get in in front of the people quicker.\nWhat do you think?\nNetworking ideally in person is, I think, easily the best way to get your professional opportunities.\nNot everyone can do that.\nYou know, not everyone is, you know, you might have a family situation or just where you are geographically.\nIf you want to get a job, you know, in data science or AI, you know, maybe there aren't, you know, in-person things you can be doing.\nRemote's really the only option.\nAnd there are probably then in that kind of scenario still things like superdatascience.com, you know, these kinds of platforms where you can get involved, you can do, um, collaborative projects together, get to know people.\nI mean, that kind of gives you that kind of collegial feeling, like you, you know, you'll, you'll remember, you know, the projects you've worked on, the people you've been with, their expertises, and you know, that's something like, you know, working with someone in an office and understanding what they can do, and maybe they'll open a door for you some years from now, and if you, you know, so the more you do that, the more that you're, uh, working with people online if you have to, but ideally you are meeting, you know, you, you meeting people in person, there's something about, you know, like a lot of, uh, a lot of, like, in in the US, there's something called meetup.com, and with meetup.com, you can in, you know, any major city in the US or Canada, you can find meetups for whatever you're interested in.\nIt's not specific to tech, um, I'm sure there's like, you know, microwave, uh, chefs, microwave reprogramming chefs meetup, um, there's all kinds of specific things out there.\nBut, you know, in data science in particular, you know, there's, there's lots of different of these kinds of meetups.\nAnd you go and you could be at any stage.\nYou know, you could be just getting started.\nYou could be thinking about it.\nYou know, maybe you're like a medical doctor and you're, you're tired of just, you know, dealing with one human at a time and you have a vision for some kind of like medical AI system that you want to build, um, to like scale up your impact.\nAnd so you can start going to these meetups and and meeting people and decide, okay, well, maybe like how, you know, how can I take further steps into this, um, you know, should I be joining a platform like SuperDataScience or like do a master's in person at a local university, um, so you could be, you know, at that very early stage where you're just exploring if a career in data science or AI is something you're interested in all the way through to being a, you know, a big expert, uh, you know, you might participate in giving the talks if you're an expert.\nOften these meetups have that, you know, it could be based around one or two speakers, um, talking about real world projects or some open source library they're developing.\nBut around these, you know, so you, you learn stuff from the speakers, but around these you also have lots of social interaction.\nYou know, there's, there's drinks at a lot of these.\nPizza is often the like food that they order.\nUm, and you know, sometimes it's sponsored by some local data science or AI company, or maybe there's like some small fee, like five bucks or 10 bucks that you p, you pitch in to be able to, you know, buy the pizza and the beer or whatever.\nUm, and yeah, it's in those.\nIt's in those social interactions that you, yeah, you meet people and some people just, you know, you click with them and you chat with them more.\nYou see them there a few times and, uh, yeah, you might find your next job, you might find your romantic partner, you might find your best friend.\nUh, you never know.\nUh, you know, in a way that I think, you know, those kinds of things, those kinds of connections, they don't, uh, it's, it's, it's a little bit harder to make them online, but it can happen.\n",
