  "cleanText": "[Music]\nStory number two is Ben.\nThey're mid-career, switching from a career in process engineering to AI, data science, and machine learning.\nThat's their goal.\nThey're in their early 30s.\nThe interesting thing about Ben is I had a conversation with Ben in August 2024, which makes it, what is that, like five months plus another five months, like 10 months ago.\nAt that time, Ben told me that they're learning a lot about AI, machine learning, and data science, specifically data science and machine learning.\nThat's their goal of their career, and that in five months from August 2024, they were going to be, quote unquote, job ready.\nThey were aiming to be job ready to apply for jobs in that space.\nFive months is a decent amount of time, especially for somebody in process engineering who's also been studying machine learning and data science for the past couple of, maybe like a year or so.\nInterestingly, when we caught up just recently, Ben's comment was, \"Back then in August, I thought I'd be job ready in five months, but the field evolved faster than I could keep up.\"\nAt the moment, Ben feels scattered as job requirements keep shifting.\nHe's looking through these different jobs all the time, and they're different to what they were five months ago.\nHe doesn't, he's learning one thing, but then by the time he's finished with that course or that series of courses, job requirements have now changed again, and he feels like he's always playing catch-up.\nPlus, on top of that, he's got a full-time job.\nHe's got personal family commitments.\nSo he can't just focus eight hours a day on preparing for these things.\nAlso, he's got the comfort of the income coming from that job.\nHe just wants to change because that's no longer his interest.\nHe's interested in other things that he wants to be following his passion.\nThat's the kind of fearful state we find a lot of people are in these days, with AI evolving and machine learning, this whole field evolving so fast that they can't keep up and just can't get a toehold on this whole job application process because things are changing so quickly.\nNice.\nSo what's the outcome?\nI guess we have different, like, what is the...\nYeah, so these are just like, yeah, they're like, so each of the stories, so I'm piecing this together just like our listeners as we go.\nYeah.\nSo each of these five stories just kind of gives us a different glimpse of different kinds of situations that people can be experiencing.\nNice.\nExactly.\nI think a lot of people would be experiencing a similar kind of feeling.\nI've heard this from several people.\nThis is an actual story, not just like an aggregated story.\nThere's an actual story of an actual person, but I've heard the same story from other people as well, where it's evolving so rapidly.\nThink about like even LLMs, right?\nLike LangChain, LangGraph were like all, everybody was talking about a year ago.\nWhere are they now?\nThey're no longer as popular as the hottest thing right now.\nWhat about prompt engineering?\nEverybody was talking about prompt engineering like one and a half years ago.\nThat was the hottest new thing.\nNow people are talking about MCPA, agentic AI, and things like that.\nWhat's going to be happening a year from now?\nWe can't predict with certainty at all.\nI would say you can predict some things.\nThere are some things that are fundamental.\nYes, there are exciting new trends, like absolutely MCPA, Crew AI, those are like exciting trends, but simultaneously there are undercurrents that you can see long term and be like, \"Okay, that is a safe thing to be learning.\nThis is going to be valuable to me for a long time.\"\nFor example, all of those things that we were just talking about happen in Python.\nSo, you know, learning Python is a great skill.\nThen, if you want to go even deeper, you can say, \"Okay, well, you know, learning data structures and algorithms is going to be useful because, you know, learning how to make, you know, learn understanding the computer science that this Python code is written to be able to do gives you lots of options.\"\nEven if we somehow move on from Python, we're not going to move on from Python in the next couple years.\nNo, probably.\nBut, you know, maybe five years, 10 years, everyone's using Rust or something.\nIn that scenario, it'll still serve you well to understand data structures and algorithms.\nThere's always these trends, these mega trends, in the same way that, you know, with prompt engineering, that always seemed like an obvious thing that was going to go away quickly because all of the frontier labs developing the cutting-edge LLMs, they are creating huge data sets and fine-tuning LLMs to be better and better at taking whatever prompt goes in and predicting what output someone was looking for.\nSo it becomes less about being like a specialist and, \"Oh, how do I hack this LLM to do what I want?\"\nEvery six months that goes by, the leading-edge LLMs are going to just be way better at just anticipating your needs.\nSo yeah, these kinds of long-term trends, like, you know, you can bet that microchips are going to have, you know, are going to be cheaper and cheaper per unit of compute.\nThat's the ultimate mega trend that is making all of this magic happen.\nSo, like those kinds of things, you can look for those kinds of big, long-term trends and feel confident about some things.\nI agree with your point that there's definitely always hot new things, but that creates anxiety for sure, but simultaneously you can find some peace, you can find some stillness in these long-term things like SQL.\nThat's been around for decades, and it's not going away.\n",
