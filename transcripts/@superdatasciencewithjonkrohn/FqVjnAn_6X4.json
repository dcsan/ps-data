  "cleanText": "[Music]\nNumber five, Evan.\nUh, he's an experienced engineer upskilling in ML uh deployment.\nSo uh for full disclosure, Evan um has uh decided to move on from SuperDataScience and we from the membership and this was part of his exit interview and really you know.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo like thank you for the transparency.\nUh you know like I I want to be honest you know it's it's it's a learning platform.\nIt it works for some people.\nIt doesn't work for some people.\nEvan got was here for a year.\nHe got everything he wanted to get out of it and moved on.\nThat must I mean you can't It would be kind of wild to expect that like people are members for life in a something like that.\nYou know, you I I understand that you know you want different perspectives.\nYou like you know you kind of Yeah, I I totally understand that.\nUh but anyway, so we had a great catch up.\nI messaged Evan.\nI said, \"Hey, you you've been one of our, you know, like most vocal and uh members.\nI'd love to uh talk to you and understand, you know, what what your goals are and things like that.\nAnd uh basically Evan is very experienced.\nUm he's uh he's based uh on an island in Europe.\nI think that's uh that's ambiguous enough not to give away the exact location of of the person uh based on an island in Europe but he does um have a um company consulting company and he works with uh US clients um on uh machine learning AI software development so he comes from a software development background but he has upskilled a lot so in the past year he's attended uh several of our collaborative workshops I think he attended two collaborative workshops where uh he worked in teams uh of people to build machine learning and AI and deploy them like models and u projects and so on deploy them.\nUh he's also attended a lot of our labs, a lot of our courses, a lot of our mentorship sessions.\nHe's like he's one of those people that um we have like mentorship sessions where you select a career path and you then get assigned to a specific mentorship group based on your career path and you're like the the um the advanced beginner level advanced or expert level mentorship group.\nHe actually asked me to put him into all three mentorship groups just so he could uh interact with all three different uh of our mentors.\nAnyway, that was a funny uh thing about him.\nSo basically the interesting thing uh in his or the pain point that he's facing is that increasingly he is finding that companies where he's working on LLMs or that he's applying for jobs to work on LLMs and agent they are looking for specifically um cloud skills production ready skills and deployment skills.\nSo he sees that an AI engineer needs to increasingly know how to deploy production ready systems into cloud-based environments.\nWhat are your thoughts on that?\nDo you think that's a compulsory skill for an engineer these days?\nI don't know about compulsory, but one thing I will say for sure is that there's there's huge demand.\nI've said this on the show many times before for any kind of like software engineering skills, you know, if you have if you if you learn those alongside data science, AI skills, you you broaden by so much this the scope of possible jobs that you could get.\nYou know, if you can be if you could be straddling the engineering team and the data science team and figuring out how to make uh you know, the AI models work for the particular circumstances that of some production use case uh in some cost effective per performant way for the users like that is that is valuable.\nYeah, for sure.\nIt's but interestingly like I am hearing more and more it was it's been super surprising to me.\nI'm hearing more and more from our members.\nWe want to uh like we're learning production uh ready skills.\nWe're learning deployments because that's why for example our collaborative projects are so popular because the final step in the collaborative project the final phase which takes like a whole week is the deployment part and more and more members and you know I was speaking with funny enough your friend Ed Donner about this uh yesterday we were exchanging emails and he said um as well like he he thinks and like I agree with him that in my view and he says that the science of AI like is is um supposed to be the important thing like understanding your data, experimenting with your uh embedding model, validating the relevance of your context and things like that.\nBut alas, people like um people studying and learning this space more and more especially at that more advanced level are looking to deployment skills.\nIn fact, Ed told me he ran a survey um literally last morning to his current students and what what's the topic they would like to hear more on.\nAnd sure enough, production deployment is in the top spot.\nSo it's kind of like this like in my mind this because AI engineer is such a like vague term vague role at the moment still shaping up like in my mind from these conversations shaping up in a way that for an like an AI engineer yes there's that uh abstract level of AI engineer we talked about earlier where you can just use the tools and not really uh get deeper but as you get deeper there are two main areas that you should understand.\nWell, the first one is the science of AI and that's you know what we talked about like your um embedding model your um experimenting with your data understanding what model to use and you know even to the point of Laura and things like that like you can go very deep into that AI part but also there's the second part which is the production ready system deployment and cloud and um you know that's understanding CI/CD continuous uh improvement continuous deployment ment um pipelines that's understanding how cloud works how what kind of tools in the cloud you're going to use understanding whether it's right to use model context protocol like MCP or not understanding uh how to build lambda functions on AWS to uh put your Python code into them how to use step functions how to make all of that work together and tie into a system that is um working that can be updated that can be used uh by companies and so on that's like whole separate area um of an AI engineer like like we're talking about like an ideal AI engineer would know both of those things really well and be able to build a great model so that it's efficient and it delivers the business outcome that needs to deliver and be able to deploy it monitor it set up it set it up so that it's it's running in a cost-effective way there's security um uh properly uh properly um set up that you know it's secure and things like that So, I think those two areas, if anybody's looking to like build a long-term career in AI engineering and really go deep, I would really focus on developing skills in both areas.\n",
