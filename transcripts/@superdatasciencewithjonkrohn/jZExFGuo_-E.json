  "cleanText": "There are, you know, certain spaces where you can find solid long-term ground that don't involve, like, you know, staying up to date on the latest things with LLMs. It might be an overestimate to say like 3% of people understand like LLMs. There's always going to be room for that bridge. People connecting like the technical insights and takeaways to the non-technical audience. Everybody was talking about prompt engineering like one and a half years ago. That was the hottest new thing. Now people are talking about MCP, a Gentic AI and things like that. Like what's going to be happening a year from now, we can't predict with certainty at all.\n\n[Music]\n\nWhoa. Special guest today on the podcast, Kirill Eremenko. Welcome back to your podcast. How's it going?\n\nThanks, John. Super excited to be back here. Everything's going well and uh you know here morning in Australia. How about you? How are you going? Yeah, it's afternoon here in New York. The sun is uh yeah, a perfect spot to give me really shadowy lighting in this recording for people watching the YouTube version. But um yeah, great light in the apartment and for our for our most of our listeners who are the audio listeners, it doesn't impact them. We've got great audio, great mics, both of us, which is nice. Um, so Kirill, I understand you have something special for the audience today.\n\nWell, as always, always have something special um for our audience. Uh yeah, today we've got five stories of uh five people from the SuperDataScience Community from the membership that uh whom I've I interviewed recently in the past couple weeks and u yeah we'll just go through what they're going through because like learning machine learning, AI, data science can be a uh daunting task, can be an exciting task, but also can be a lonely task and so for those of you out there that feel that you're going through certain challenges or uh having certain wins. Uh there'll be something, hopefully something that you can relate to.\n\nThat loneliness is great for us at the podcast here, right? Because people feel so lonely. They have no choice but to find a data science podcast to listen to and feel a little bit less lonely. It's funny, but it's it's interesting. um like it can it can be bizarre, but indeed one of the things that we hear on and on again in the community because we have this intros page when once you become a member, you type in your intro and you say like where you from, why you join, you know, what your hobbies are and so on and one of the most common things that why people join, I would say like maybe 40% of the time I hear or I read this comment that they want to feel part of a community of learners. Like they're learning these um courses and tools and doing these projects, but around them there's nobody like that. Like at their work, there's nobody else who's learning. They can't feel they can connect with people. And it's actually a real um a real challenge for people to find connection in this space.\n\nIt's great. It, you know, I make the joke, but uh the platform is great. I'm sure the podcast and the platform are great for people feeling like they're in community. And by the way, when I say, you know, when you say the SuperDataScience platform, we mean superdatascience.com.\n\nYeah.\n\nThe website. Yeah. Which might be obvious, but just to absolutely make that crystal clear.\n\nUm, yeah. And so, Kurill, yeah, tell us about these five. I guess you can start with the first one.\n\nOkay. First one. So, all of these names are changed for privacy purposes. Um, and our first person is Alex. uh he's um early in his career and he's in his uh late 20s and just recently had a huge win which is very exciting. He landed um a job as an AI engineer um and we that's what our catchup was about. We spoke about it. Uh basically this how his interview went. He applied to many jobs. Um he got, you know, like a lot of them he got rejected or didn't get any hear anything back. uh one of them he uh heard back, they uh said they were interested to talk to him more, invited him for an interview and at uh it was originally as far as I remember it was originally like a a screening interview, they said we'll we'll be back in touch, he didn't have high hopes for that because that's what usually happens, but they invited him for a technical interview and uh basically what he did to prepare for the technical interview, uh he said um so in the membership platform for those who don't know, we have lots of courses and he went through our uh LLM, large language models A to Z course again just in case to fresh uh refresh some concepts and on the interview they asked him specific questions about their data in the company and how he would create an LLM that let me find the quote here um how would you create an LLM that can access our data and just answer questions based on that data and from there he basically just went to into brainstorming mode and um gave them ideas of how he would fine-tune existing models, apply rag um and other, you know, feature engineering and other things that would be relevant in that case. And another thing that really helped him to stand out was that he did a a few, no, I think he did one collaborative project in the platform. That's where we get like members to work together on projects and um you know, that experience of going through a real world project helped them like be able to brainstorm on the interview and they were really impressed.\n\nCool. That's great. Congrats to quote unquote Alex.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Uh did you did you anonymize any other demographic data? Like have you switched genders on people or?\n\nUh yeah, in some cases. Yeah, that's right. Anonymized.\n\nYeah. As much as I could, you know, to keep people's privacy. Uh even though Alex in this case actually gave us full permission to disclose his story if uh you know, you can actually um read about it on uh the SuperDataScience website. Nonetheless, uh the other thing I wanted to point out was that interestingly he added that after asking about large language models, guess what they asked him? They asked him about fundamentals of machine learning. How are you going to build a regression? How you going to for like predicting price? How you going to build a classification uh for predicting um you know problems relating to client data? They they didn't spend too much time on it, but um apparently they wanted to know that he knows the fundamentals. What do you think about that? I mean, you can't you can't really do the job without, you know, you can't be senior in the job. Like, let's say, you know, I'm sure there's kind of like an entry level AI engineer role where you really are just using APIs, calling LLMs, but to get I I I think in a lot of senior roles, if you're going to be making a big impact in your organization, you need to understand simpler machine learning models. ideally, you know, not even just the fundamentals of machine learning, but also the the foundational principles that underly it like linear algebra and partial derivative calculus because you can do there's all kinds of magical things you can do if you understand that stuff. You know, you can cut through the abstractions and come up with really performant solutions that otherwise wouldn't be possible. But um I mean it's an endless a career in data science is an endless opportunity to be learning more and more and more. And so you also you should never let all the possibilities of the things you could be learning prevent you from getting going getting some job applications off the ground. Um you should go for it.\n\nYeah, for sure. For sure. But in this current um like where we are in terms of AI, you know, like if it feels to me like AI engineering, LLM engineering, etc., all those roles, they're um kind of like going through that same arch that data science was going through like 10 years ago. Uh so it's very blurry at the moment like what does AI engineer mean to you?\n\nYeah, it's an interesting thing because theoretically up until two years ago if you said you were an AI engineer that probably meant that you were like an AI researcher. So, you know, you know, maybe at a frontier lab like Meta, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and you're you're engineering, you know, you're figuring out how to get transformers to work together more quickly across a bunch of GPUs, how to uh automatically clean up data in some way that it improves the outputs of a trained large language model. like that's what I would have up until recently, up until a couple years ago thought an AI engineer was, but now it seems to mostly mean somebody who is using existing LLMs and calling APIs. And so there's still there's still thoughtfulness that needs to go into making sure that data are clean and consistent and you have guard rails up. Um, but it's you're you're working at a at a at a more abstract level. um at least in like kind of the the simplest way of thinking about the job. So do you reckon you could get that job done without any knowledge whatsoever of fundamentals of machine learning or even the underlying um deep learning tensor what's it called? Um\n\nyeah TensorFlow PyTorch\n\nyeah TensorFlow PyTorch but even even transformer architectures.\n\nOh yeah. Oh yeah. I mean you could definitely, you know, for that, you know, like I'm saying, you know, you could you could get Yeah. Yeah, there's lots of LLM jobs out there where you basically need to, you know, you need to understand how to be evaluating data that are going in as inputs and outputs. You know, you need to be able to do some exploratory data analysis in Python, those kinds of data science skills. But you wouldn't necessarily need to understand how stochastic gradient descent works or reinforcement learning works, you know, just because those kinds of approaches were used to train the LLM that you're using. M it's probably more exper more important to just have lots of experience with prompting LLMs and seeing what they can do understanding, you know, experimenting with okay if I use a three billion parameter LLM how does that perform relative to using you know the latest and greatest Claude 4 from Anthropic um what can I you know there might be fine-tuning involved so um you know understanding the the approaches that exist out there for uh for fine-tuning so things like Laura, low-rank adaptation, being aware of those kinds of things to be able to take a three billion parameter open-source llama model from Meta and then be able to fine-tune it to some specific task. You might actually be able to with a three billion parameter model running on your own infrastructure or running through some cloud provider like hugging face or pietorrch lightning, you can have this very small LLM running on some small on some very specific task or some uh small number of very specific tasks and because you fine-tuned it fine-tuned it to those tasks it can outperform the latest and greatest like claw for and so th those are the kinds of things you know that kind of like empirical experience with playing around with LLMs um is probably more important. You know, like you don't really need to understand how Laura works to use Laura.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm and by the way, that Laura, it's L O R A if you're\n\nThat's right.\n\nGoogling that.\n\nI'll try to remember to put low rank adaptation.\n\nLow rank adaptation. I'll try to remember to put a link in the show notes to our episode on Laura which is uh back in episode 674. I I kind of give an introduction to fine-tuning.\n\nYeah, I remember that one. That was that was a great introduction.\n\nYeah. Interesting. Like the the analogy that comes to my mind is like I love cooking and for me it's like let's say for cooking you're using a blender, right? Or other tools like an oven and things like that. You don't need to know how an oven works in in in the back end or a microwave or uh that's lazy cooking or a blender. You don't need to be able to pull apart a blender and put it back together, but you can use it, you know. So, same thing here with um like AI is is going towards that direction where uh these um tools are actually just tools. you can can get away and and in fact you don't as you said you don't have to go into the depths of understanding these tools to be able to use them and I'm just wondering like what percentage of jobs uh are going to be for AI engineers who know how to use these tools versus uh the percentage of jobs that where you actually need to understand the underlying uh technology and be able to tinker with it like what what should people be focused on learning? I know it depends on their interest, but in terms of like um supply or demand for jobs, I wonder how it's going to play out in the coming months and years.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Adverity, an integrated data platform for connecting, managing, and using your data at scale.

You know, you don't I love that analogy that you just gave with the blenders and microwaves and stuff, you know, you you can more and more rely on the abstractions.\n\nUm, but I still think you can you can probably get ultimately like as you progress further in your career, I think you can get uh higher paying roles. I mean, it depends on exactly which way you go because you could kind of say, okay, you know what I'm going to do? I'm kind of riffing here, by the way, Carol. This is like just my thoughts, but I'm kind of like thinking if you if you uh you know, if you want to focus on commercial impact, you could actually say, you know what, I actually I'm going to use training like there is available in superdatience.com and use that to become proficient at building LLMs. And I'm going to figure out how to make those uh look nice in like a grado app or something, you know, some kind of user interface. you can quickly put together so that you can uh you know have a click and point interface for people to be using your AI models in the background or you know some kind of AI solution that you come up with through using LL\n\n\nMs, and you might not, you know, yeah, understand how gradient descent works or, uh, you know, fundamentals of machine learning, but you're able to put together powerful commercial applications. You could do that on a small team or on a big team or just on your own, and you could potentially be enormously successful, like in, in today as well as more and more the further we go into the future, the more you will be able to have agents, teams of agents working on different tasks for you. And, you know, you could build a big business. You could be a solo entrepreneur and have like hundreds of agents working on different tasks for different clients, and that'll get better and better. And, you know, so you could potentially have a lot of success, um, that way using just the abstractions. But where I was originally going before I thought of that second idea is that you similarly, you know, you could, as you advance in your career, you could say, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to peel back layers of the onion more and more. I'm going to understand what's going on under these abstractions more and more and kind of just chip away over years, over decades, you become more and more expert at understanding machine learning fundamentals and mathematics and physics and, uh, engineering, uh, maybe electronics. Like, there's all kinds of related fields that you could dig more and more into. And as you dig more and more, um, you know, your value to your clients, your users, your employer, um, I think, I think does increase, and I think that that will continue to be the case in the future. Even though those kinds of things, like, you know, doing mathematics, being able to solve data science problems, computer science problems, even though that's something that LLMs will be able to do more and more and more, I think there will still be, and maybe I'm just a dinosaur with like outdated ideas, but I think if you understand that stuff, one, it's interesting. And so it's kind of interesting, like, you know, if you're, you know, if, if you are, yeah. Because it's kind of an interesting thing here because it's like, if you're a chef who's able to understand how a microwave works and make a better microwave that somehow, you know, you can put like a raw, raw pizza ingredients in there and it turns into like this. It seems like it's like this great pizza oven cooked pizza in just like 10 seconds. Like it's, you know, that kind of magic would only be possible if you learned like the nuclear physics of how the microwave works, you know, it's like there's, there's, there's magic and possibility if you, if you do dig deep. But, um, yeah, so I think either way, you know, you can follow your passions. Like if your passions are deep in the nitty-gritty of what's underlying machine learning models, I think you can have a huge amount of success there the more and more you learn. But equally, if you're more interested in applications and just making a big impact and you want to stay with abstractions, you can also have a lot of success that way too. Yeah. Yeah. It feels like that, um, uh, very like transitionary period or like that intermediate period. Like I love your example about the chef who knows how to make a new microwave, but I don't think there's a single chef like that on the planet. Yeah. But for AI, it's the case. I mean, who knows? Yeah. I mean, there probably isn't, but, uh, it's kind of like that's, you know, if you're, if you're the, you know, to, to give an example, uh, we recently, at the time of you and me recording this episode, I'm not sure the episode will be out or not yet, but, uh, I recently recorded a Long Tuesday episode with Sean Johnson, who is a a renowned AI investor in San Francisco, and we were talking in that episode about how there's only a few thousand people in the world that are at the cutting edge of AI, and, you know, those people are, are typically more interested, and so this is, I'm talking about, like, these are like the AI researchers that up until a couple years ago you might have called AI engineers, and those people, like, they are like the people who they're like the chefs who know how to, uh, take apart a microwave, and they don't necessarily, you know, they can be in a big organization, and they don't necessarily need to worry about the downstream commercial impact. They just need to worry about making a better microwave. Yeah. And by focusing on their piece, I mean, they can, they can be making a seven-figure base, um, income. Uh, and yeah, it's like there's, so there's, you know, that, that is making an impact. Um, yeah, whereas, yeah, it's kind of interesting. I guess like a chef, maybe the incentives aren't aligned as much for them to be learning nuclear physics. I think we got, we got to also think about the quantity of jobs, you know, like, uh, there, like, there's, um, definitely space for people making better microwaves in AI, uh, but what is, what is currently and what is going to be the majority of demand from employers around the kind of people they employ, and it is, in my view, it's really, it's really hard to tell at this stage, but from anecdotal evidence, like Alex's story, I can see that even though this abstraction layer is is gaining popularity, employers still want to hedge their bets and or like want to vet their candidates, candidates by requiring that you know the fundamentals of machine learning. Like they don't, they don't want to, they're not ready yet fully for candidates that are just operating on the abstraction layer, um, without an understanding the under underlying fundamentals, and I think part of that, I'm thinking about this from the perspective of a hiring manager for a role like that, if you, if you were to hire somebody who just, you know, had spent just a couple months learning about LLMs, prompts, inputs, outputs, and didn't have a an understanding of anything beneath it. The, the, the barriers to entry there are relatively low. Like you're able to kind of quickly get up to that point. And so, yeah, I think it's, yeah, it's like hedging their bets, like you said, and also like just trying to make sure that they're hiring somebody that's like, you know, kind of more well-rounded, has been invested in this space for a while, that are really committed to a career in this, in this area. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's, that's a good summary. Should we move on to number two? Yeah. I thought this might be like a five-minute Friday episode. Same. But this conversation is just too interesting. I'm, I'm like enjoying this. All right. Uh, this story number two is Ben. Uh, they're mid, mid-career, um, switching from a career in process engineer to, uh, data science, machine learning. That's their goal. Um, they're in their early 30s. And the interesting thing about Ben is I had a conversation with Ben in August 2024, which makes it what is that, like, five months plus another five months, like 10 months ago. And, uh, at that time, Ben, uh, was interesting. Ben told me that they're learning, uh, a lot, uh, about AI, machine learning, data science, specifically, um, data science and machine learning. That's, that's their goal of their career. And that in, uh, in five months from, from August 2024, they were going to be, um, quote unquote, uh, oh, not, not quote unquote yet, like, basically, they were going to be job ready. They were aiming to be job ready to apply, uh, for jobs in that space. You know, five months is a decent amount of time, especially for somebody in process engineering who's also been studying machine learning, data science for past couple of, um, maybe like a year or so. Um, interestingly, so when we caught up just recently, um, Ben's comment was, um, back then in August, I thought I'd be job ready in five months, but the field evolved faster than I could keep up. And at the moment, Ben, uh, feels scattered as job requirements keep shifting. He's looking through these, uh, different jobs all the time, and you know, like, they're different to what they were five months ago. Um, he doesn't, he's learning one thing, but then by the time he's finished with that course or that, uh, series of courses, job requirements have now changed again, and he feels like he's always playing catchup. Plus, on top of that, he's got a full-time job. He's got, uh, personal family commitments. So he can't just like focus eight hours a day on, uh, preparing for these things. So, um, and also, you know, like, he's got the comfort of the in income coming from that job. He just wants to change because that's no longer his interest. He's interested in other things that, like, he wants to be following his passion. Uh, but yeah, that's the kind of, uh, fearful state we find a lot of people are in these days with AI evolving and machine learning, this whole field evolving so fast that they can't keep up and just like can't get a tow hold on on this whole, uh, job application process because things are changing so quickly. Nice. And so what's the kind of, is there like an outcome that we're, so I guess we have different, like, what is the, uh, yeah, so these are just like, yeah, they're like, so each of the stories, so I'm piecing this together just like our listeners as we go. Yeah. So each of these five stories just kind of gives us a different glimpse of different kinds of situations that people can be experiencing. Nice. Exactly. And I think a lot of people would be experiencing a similar kind of feeling. We, we, I've heard this from several people. This is, this is an actual story, not just like a, a aggregated story. It's an actual story of an actual person, but I've heard the same story from other people as well, where it's evolving so rapidly. Like, think about, like, even, uh, LLMs, right? Like Langchain, Lang Graph were like all, all everybody was talking about, like, a year ago. Like, where are they now? Like, they're no longer as popular as, um, the hottest thing right now. Or what about, like, um, uh, what are they called? Like, prompt engineering. Everybody was talking about prompt engineering like one and a half years ago. That was the hottest new thing. Now people are talking about MCP, Agentic AI and things like that. Like, what's going to be happening a year from now, we can't predict with certainty at all. I would, I would say you can predict some things, like, there's, you know, some, some things are like fundamental, like, yes, there are like exciting new trends, like absolutely, MCP right now, Crew AI, those are like exciting trends, but simultaneously, there are undercurrents that you can see long term and be like, okay, that is a safe, that is a safe thing to be learning. This is going to be valuable to me for a long time. For example, all of those things that we were just talking about happen in Python. And so, you know, learning Python is a great skill. And so, and then that also means, you know, if you want to go like even, even deeper, you can say, okay, well, you know, learning data structures and algorithms is going to be useful because, you know, learning how to make, you know, learn understanding the computer science that this Python code is written to be able to do gives you lots of option. You know, there's just so, even if we somehow move on from Python, you know, that's not, we're not going to move on from Python in the next couple years. No, probably. But, you know, maybe five years, 10 years, everyone's using Rust or something. And in that scenario, it'll still serve you well to understand data structures and algorithms. There's always like kind of like slower, there's like these trends, these like mega trends in the same way that, you know, with prompt engineering, that was kind of like, to me, that always seemed like an obvious thing that was going to go away quickly because all of the frontier labs developing the cutting edge LLMs, they are creating huge data sets and fine-tuning LLMs to be better and better at taking whatever prompt goes in and predicting what output someone was looking for. So it becomes less about being like a specialist and, oh, how do I like hack this LLM to do what I want, and, you know, every six months that goes by, the leading edge LLMs are going to just be like way better at just anticipating your needs. Um, so yeah, so these, these kinds of like long-term trends, like, you know, you can bet that microchips are going to have, you know, are going to be cheaper and cheaper per unit of compute. You know, that that's gonna, that's like this, that's that's the ultimate like mega trend that is like making all of this magic happen. And so, like, those kinds of things, like, you can look for those kinds of big, long-term trends and and feel confident about about some, some things. Uh, so yeah, I agree with your point that there's like definitely always hot new things, but, um, and and and that creates anxiety for sure, but simultaneously, you can find some peace, you can find some stillness in these like long-term things like SQL, you know, that's like, that's been around for decades and it's not going away. That's a good point. Yeah, I like that. It probably adds calmness if you, um, separate your learning into, I guess it's like exploitation and exploration, right? Like, you, you exploit the existing, as you said, mega trends, like 60% of your learning, and then 40% of the learning, you focus on new hot things, at least you'll have that 60% of grounded calmness and slow, steady progress. Yeah, I like that idea. Pretty cool. And what you said about the chips, cost of chips going down reminded me of a, um, a comment by Sam Altman recently. He said, Sam Altman, um, that cost of intelligence is going to converge to the cost of energy over time, and, uh, yeah, that's kind of, I don't know why I thought of that, but relates to that.

Visit ww.dell.com/supdatience to learn more. That's dell.com/supdatience. Yeah. And related to that, so the Anthropic CEO, Dario Amadei, a few months ago wrote a blog. You got to have him on the podcast, man. Like, oh yeah, I'd love to. That'll be perfect guest. Yeah, I mean, Sam Oldman, Dario, if you're listening. Bill Gates, the Kardashians, let's get them all on. Got it. Um, Ed Biden. Ed Biden. Joe Biden's retired now. Should get that guy on. Yeah. So, you're saying CEO of Antropic? Yeah. So, Dario Amadei, he a few months ago had a really popular blog post, and one of the things that sat, it's related\n\n\nExactly to this, you know,\ncost of intelligence going down so much\nthat he was describing a situation where\nin the not too distant future, you have a\ndata center with a million\nuh agents, like a million, like the\nequivalent of a million human brains, and\nthose human brains are Nobel prize\nwinners,\nand you have like these million\nNobel prizewinning intelligence students'\nbrains just in one data center\nworking\naway, you know, they don't need to\nsleep, they don't need to take care of\ntheir kids.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThey're just\nlike, you know, and that, you know,\nthat's coming. That's going to change\nthe world. And um,\nand related to the energy comment that\nSam Altman made there, what I think is\nreally interesting is\num, AI, this abundant intelligence is\nplaying a role in helping us uh get more\nenergy, clean energy, including things\nlike helping us contain the plasma\nin a\nnuclear fusion reactor, which if we can\ncrack that, then all of a sudden you\nhave basically unbounded energy and\nunbounded intelligence because so that's\na, that's a pretty wild world that we\ncould be going into.\nYeah.\nIncredible.\nUh, you said Dario, right? Is the CEO of\nAnthropic.\nIndeed.\nHe strikes me as a\nbit of a futurist, like uh, his comment\nthat by the end of 2025, all code, all\ncode, or 90% of the code will be written\nby uh LLMs, you know, to me feels a bit\nfarfetched. It kind of reminds me of Ray\nKurtzwell in his predictions, but Ray\nKurtzwell's predictions mostly come\ntrue. So we'll yet to see.\nAnd and\na big part of the way that Ray does that\nis from that big mega trend that I was\ntalking about of microchip cost, or sorry,\nlike uh, compute cost, like basically, you\ncan kind of like model, it's been, you\nknow, consistent over decades what\ncompute costs over time, and you can\nextrapolate that forward\nto get the big,\nyou know, 5-year, 10-year, even kind of 15,\n20-year predictions that Kurtzwell has\nbeen making have been, you know, based on\nthat hardware basis.\nTo say that, if\nthat's true, you know, I don't know that\nquote from Dario Amade about um us\nhaving all code be generated by the end\nof 2025. I mean, that's not true. I\nguess a key, a key thing to remember is\nthat when Dario or Sam Altman are\ntalking, they're also pitching.\nYes.\nYes.\nI heard that podcast with you with\num, the guy from LinkedIn, I forgot his\nname. He, he mentioned\nJohn Rose.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nNo, no, not John Rose. The, the\nuh, the influencer.\nYeah.\nNope.\nNope.\nThe,\nthe, I think\nuh, I forgot.\nUm, very big\nfollowing, and he said he, you guys were\ntalking about the CEO of NVIDIA talking\nabout, like, uh, the importance of\nmicrochips, and he mentioned that he's,\nyou know, you got to remember that he's\npitching his company whenever he makes\none of these kind of claims.\nOh, yeah.\nJensen Huang.\nYeah.\nThere's another guest\nthat we should just, let's phone him.\nOh,\nyeah.\nWhy not?\nWhy not?\nYeah.\nUm, anyway,\nwhat do you think of this advice that I\ngave to Ben in his situation?\nUh, well,\nhe was actually, he was debating that he\nwanted to get into data science, but he\nalso sees, like, AI as the, you know, the\nfuture, and he was thinking, I'll go into\ndata science from process engineering,\nwhich he's currently in. I will learn um,\neverything about data science, then I'll\nmove to AI. And I told him that uh, he\nshould aim straight for AI. If, if AI is\nhis end goal, there's no need to go\nthrough the path of becoming a data\nscientist first and then going into AI.\nUm, like, right, maybe that was the case 2\nyears ago when AI was very, you know, deep\nlearning, everything, you have to know\nthose things, but now there's a straight\npath to AI. What do you think? Would you\nrecommend that for people as well?\n100%.\nSomething that I've talked about on the\nshow, maybe even with you, I can't\nremember, but\nit's, this feels like a conversation\nwe've had on air before, so you can, let's\nsee, but we kind of, I, I think you can\nkind of think of an AI engineer, an LLM\nengineer as being a specialized kind of\ndata scientist,\nwhere, you know, 15 years ago when data\nscience was a brand new term and people\nwere starting to do it, there was this\nkind of, it, it, you know, it hadn't evolved,\nwe didn't have all the kinds of\ndifferent tools, all the different kinds\nof specializations, and so you kind of, as\na data scientist, there's like this joke\nthat it's, you know, what's a data scient,\na data scientist is someone who's not\ngood at statistics or programming,\nuh, you know, it's like, you're, you're able\nto, you're able to do a little bit of a\nbunch of different things, like you were\nable to\nunderstand enough about\nstatistics at that time, um, maybe machine\nlearning, data and analytics, a bit of SQL,\nmaybe R at that time, some Python,\nand uh, to do some visualizations,\npresentation skills, getting um, you know,\ngetting buy-in from management, and so\nthere was a lot of, like, you know,\noriginally, it was kind of this ex idea\nthat, like, to be a data scientist, you\nmight need a PhD, uh, you know, 15 years\nago,\nbut now, you know, but now it's, it's\nevolved, you know, there's been, it's\nactually, it's related to the same\nidea, you know, people talk about how AI\ncould take everyone's job, and and maybe\nthere is some timeline where that kind\nof happens, but the thing that has\nhappened historically with all other\nautomations is that more roles are\ncreated, and that's like, that's exa, LLM\nengineer could not be more of an\nembodiment of that truth,\nwhich is that because AI is so capable\nnow, all of a sudden, you need all these\nhumans to be able to glue together all\nof those intelligent machines\nin order\nto do something that's useful, in order\nto create a product that provides a\nsolution that's commercially valuable,\nand so, yeah, AI has created all of these\nadditional kinds of data science\nspecializations, so now you have, you know,\nyour, your data engineer, your ML engineer,\nyour uh, LLM engineer,\nyour data analyst,\nmissed your database specialist,\nprompt\nengineer.\nYeah, maybe\nlast year.\nUm,\nexactly.\nUm,\nso, yeah,\ninteresting.\nYeah,\non that topic of creating new jobs, I\nlove what the CEO of Dell said on your\none of your previous podcasts that never\nthought of this, that a lot of, or the, a\nlot of new jobs will be created in\nconstruction, building those uh, data\ncenters and uh, infrastructure for data\ncenters, and that's going to last like a\ndecade, if not decades.\nUm, that, that's\nhuge, you know, that's technology\nimpacting the non-tech sector in terms\nof number of jobs. That's, that's\nincredible, and I love that. That creates\nopportunities for people who are not\neven in the tech space.\nYeah, exactly.\nThat is, that is, that's a huge guest that\nwe had recently, the CTO and chief AI\nofficer of Dell, which has hundreds of\nthousands of employees,\nJohn Rose, and I\nthink maybe when you were the, the other\nepisode we were talking about,\nuh, I\nthink that might have been Greg\nMichaelelsson from Zerve that was\ntalking about.\nNo.\nUh, I, I can find the\nperson.\nUm, but what I was going to say\nis uh, such a good episode with uh, the\nCTO of Dell. Incredible episode. Loved\nit. Like, so is so well spoken and also\nso many great ideas, especially anybody\nlike looking for commercial uh,\ncommercial applications of AI and how it\napplies to business and industry. Uh, I, I\nI'm recommending that episode to people\naround.\nNice.\nYeah.\nSuper popular.\nAll\nright.\nAre we on to number four now or\nwhat?\nYes.\nYes.\nAlmost.\nUm, I'm just\nfinding this uh, guest's name for.\nYeah,\nthere we go.\nAndre Burkoff is who?\nAndre\nBurkoff.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo that's\ngoing back a little bit.\nUh, yeah.\nAndre\nBurkoff.\nHe's, it's completely insane.\nHe\nhas his LinkedIn AI newsletter.\nIt, at\nthe time of recording, it was like\n980,000 subscribers or something.\nLike,\nhe's like super close to having a\nmillion\nsubscribers to his AI newsletter\non LinkedIn.\nEpisode 867, I believe.\nYeah, 867.\nI think people like him\nbecause he's just raw, you know, like, no,\nno filters, just says his opinion.\nDoesn't matter if it's going to offend\npeople, not offend people. I've seen\nsome of his comments on, they removed my\npost from this post because they didn't\nlike what I said. Haha, here's a\nscreenshot of how it looked, you know,\nlike, it's people, I know in this day and\nage when there's so much, like, uh,\nfakeness and not in non-genuine,\nnon-genuine people or non-genuine\npresentation of themselves, like, I think\npeople value that rawness, whether you\nlike it or not, you know, that's a\nseparate question, just, but having access\nto somebody's raw personalities,\ncharacter, I think it's nice.\nWe're super,\nsuper lucky to have him on the show.\nHe\nnever does, like, videos, podcasts, he, he\nwrites books, which are extremely popular\nand free.\nUh, are they free?\nYou can,\nI\nthink you, like, you pay online for free,\nor you pay, you pay to, you have to pay to\nget the physical version, obviously.\nYeah.\nBut then you get the one online\nfor free, and you pay if you, if you,\nhowever much you valued it for or\nsomething.\nI was very impressed by that.\nSo, yeah.\nSo he's famous for the 100-page\nmachine learning book.\nUm, but then he\nwas on the show talking about his\n100-page LLM book.\nAnd so we, we'd reached\nout to him.\nI'd been reaching out to him\nthrough various means over several years,\nand he never responded.\nAnd then when he\nfinished the 100-page LLM book, he\nreached out back out to us, and he was\nlike, \"Can we still do this?\"\nAnd so\nit's really cool to have somebody like\nAndre on the show who so rarely does\nthose kinds of appearances, and he does\nthem so rarely that he hears something\nhilarious.\nSo he never hears recordings of his\nvoice, and so\nhe's, he's from Ukraine, and\nso he has this, like, like Slavic, strong\nSlavic accent.\nIt's not, it's not, it's\nnot that strong.\nYeah.\nBut he, he thinks\nthat he sounds like, because he's been\nliving in Montreal for, like, decades.\nYeah.\nAnd so he thinks that he has, like,\nthis, the kind of, like, uh, North American\nkind of sounding English accent.\nAnd so\nhe was like, what the hell?\nPutting this\ninto the recording, he's like, \"Who is\nthis guy?\"\nThat's funny.\nOh, yes.\nYes.\nUm, good times.\nI, I think, um, it's, it's\nimportant to hear yourself on, on radio,\non, on air sometimes to understand a\nbit or something.\nYou sound the same.\nAh, nice.\nNice.\nAll right, let's move on\nto number three.\nOkay.\nUh,\nwait.\nFour.\nSurely four.\nI wish.\nAre you kidding me?\nWe're on\nnumber three.\nNumber three.\nThat's\nright.\nThis is Five Minute Friday going\nfor 37 minutes.\nMaybe we'll have to\nconvert this to a Tuesday episode.\nMaybe\nyou're, you're, you're the host.\nIt's your\ncall.\nI'm just having a fun time.\nIt's\nthat's the benefit of retiring from the\npodcast.\nI don't have to make these decisions.\nAll right.\nNumber three, Claraara.\nShe's\na senior developer living in LA, and um,\nuh, in her mid-40s\naiming for\num, roles in the $200,000 plus salary\nrange.\nSo this uh, person, she has been in\nuh, working already for um, two decades or\nmore uh, in in this space and has tons of\nexperience.\nIn fact, um, has done all\nsorts of roles in uh, software\nengineering, uh, developing apps,\ndeveloping um, programs, developing um,\ndifferent\nthings for different companies.\nMost\nrecently, for the past, I think it was\nfive year, oh, sorry, three or five years, I\ndon't remember, let's say three years, uh,\nshe has been creating software using\nPython, interestingly, software that\nprocesses data, lots of excel, lots of CSV\nfiles using Python in the medical space.\nIn fact, a lot of our, me, a lot of our\nmembers, I don't know the exact\npercentage, but a lot of our members I\nspeak with uh, work in the medical space,\nsupporting uh, companies, whether it's\nhospitals or um, pharmaceuticals or other\nmedical, medical space related, like\nmedical equipment companies, procurement\ncompanies or supply chain companies, and\nso on.\nAnyway, so she's been creating\nall this uh, software using Python,\nspecifically pandas and uh, other tools\nto process uh, lots of data.\nSo lots of\nPython experience uh, and recently has\ndone four of our machine learning\ncourses: machine learning A to Z,\nmachine learning level one, machine\nlearning level two, machine learning\nlevel three, and she wants to get into\nthe space of machine learning and AI.\nWhy?\nThe reason is because Claraara is\num, in her mid-40s.\nShe can uh, she\npredicts that she'll be in the workforce\nfor at least another 15 years.\nAnd she\ncan see that the current role that she's\ndoing is uh, while um, you know, pays well\nand she's very good at it, is not, it\nmight not be as relevant in the future.\nIt's not a role that um, as we discussed\nwith Claraara, it's like, it's not a role\nthat's a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nShe's\nnot learning new skills in the role that\nwill uh, open up more doors for her in\nthe future that will um, you know, keep\nher growing with the growing trends in\ntechnology.\nShe's very selective about\napplications.\nIn fact, she um, left her\njob a few months ago to focus\nspecifically on studying and preparing\nfor the new role.\nShe's not in a rush.\nShe wants to take things um, slowly and\nuh, basically goes mostly through her\nnetwork, not applying to thousands of\njobs through LinkedIn and and so on.\nMostly goes through her networks, very\nselective.\nUm, and uh, yeah, so that's\nthat's her goal to get into this space.\nAnd the interesting thing, the pain\npoint that Claraara has is she's finding\nthere are thousands, literally thousands\nof job applicants per job, and even at\nher level of experience, expertise, and\num, you know, background and all these\nprojects that she's done, she's finding\nit difficult to uh, break in and to land\nthe job that she's looking for.\nOh, yeah,\ninteresting story.\nUm, why do you think\nthat is?\nWhy do you think she's having\ntrouble?\nThat's a good question.\nI think\nit's um,\nprobably related to this\nphenomena where there's lots of jobs, but\nthere's also lots of applicants, and it's\nreally hard to stand out.\nI think it's\nbeen the same since for the past 10\nyears when there's lots of people\napplying um, through the direct means of\nlike uh, just submitting your resume, and\nall of them get pre-screened uh, with AI\ntools, and um, it just, like, if the, if the\nhiring manager had a conversation with\nClaraara directly, like, magically, then\nthey would realize she's amazing, and\nthey would hire her in a, in a heartbeat,\nuh, but because it's really hard to get\nin front of people this direct way, I\nthink that's the problem.\nAnd I think\nClaraara has got the the right idea of\ngoing through connections and going\nthrough networking\num, to get in in front of the people\nquicker.\nWhat do you think?\nNetworking\n\n\nIdeally, in person is, I think, easily the best way to get your professional opportunities. Not everyone can do that. You know, not everyone is, you know, you might have a family situation or just where you are geographically. If you want to get a job, you know, in data science or AI, you know, maybe there aren't in-person things you can be doing. Remote's really the only option. And there are probably then in that kind of scenario still things like superdatascience.com, you know, these kinds of platforms where you can get involved, you can do collaborative projects together, get to know people. I mean, that kind of gives you that kind of collegial feeling like you, you know, you'll remember, you know, the projects you've worked on, the people you've been with, their expertises, and you know, that's something like, you know, working with someone in an office and understanding what they can do, and maybe they'll open a door for you some years from now. And if you, you know, so the more you do that, the more that you're working with people online if you have to, but ideally you are meeting, you know, you're meeting people in person. There's something about, you know, like a lot of, uh, a lot of, like, in the US, there's something called meetup.com, and with meetup.com, you can, in, you know, any major city in the US or Canada, you can find meetups for whatever you're interested in. It's not specific to tech.\nUm, I'm sure there's like, you know, microwave, uh, chefs, microwave reprogramming chefs meetup. Um, there's all kinds of specific things out there, but you know, in data science in particular, you know, there's lots of different of these kinds of meetups, and you go, and you could be at any stage. You know, you could be just getting started. You could be thinking about it. You know, maybe you're like a medical doctor, and you're tired of just, you know, dealing with one human at a time, and you have a vision for some kind of like medical AI system that you want to build, um, to like scale up your impact. And so you can start going to these meetups and meeting people and decide, okay, well, maybe like how, you know, how can I take further steps into this? Um, you know, should I be joining a platform like superdatascience.com or like do a master's in person at a local university?\nUm, so you could be, you know, at that very early stage where you're just exploring if a career in data science or AI is something you're interested in, all the way through to being a, you know, a big expert. Uh, you know, you might participate in giving the talks if you're an expert. Often these meetups have that, you know, it could be based around one or two speakers, um, talking about real-world projects or some open-source library they're developing. But around these, you know, so you learn stuff from the speakers, but around these, you also have lots of social interaction. You know, there's drinks at a lot of these. Pizza is often the food that they order. Um, and you know, sometimes it's sponsored by some local data science or AI company, or maybe there's like some small fee, like five bucks or 10 bucks, that you pitch in to be able to, you know, buy the pizza and the beer or whatever. Um, and yeah, it's in those, it's in those social interactions that you, yeah, you meet people, and some people just, you know, you click with them, and you chat with them more, you see them there a few times, and, uh, yeah, you might find your next job, you might find your romantic partner, you might find your best friend.\nUh, you never know. Uh, you know, in a way that I think, you know, those kinds of things, those kinds of connections, they don't, uh, it's a little bit harder to make them online, but it can happen. You and me, we're gonna meet soon in person for the first time, but we've known each other for over five years. I feel like I know you. You know, you're one of my closest friends, but I know I've actually only talked to you through pixels.\nYeah. Well, thank God it happened before all the deep fakes, so we know we're real.\nYeah. Yeah. Interesting. You mentioned, um, the medical field, like doctors looking to apply, uh, LLMs, AI to scale their impact. I could probably name right now off the top of my head, I could, well, I had to look it up, but at least five people in the SuperDataScience Community, we've had five people who, in their intros, have posted, \"Oh, I am a doctor or I'm a nurse, and there's this point in the nursing, uh, in the hospital databases, there's this problem we're constantly facing, it, I'm, you know, eager to solve it, I'm on a mission, uh, we're going to use AI to solve it, that's why I'm learning AI.\" Like, there's so many opportunities in the medical space to apply AI, uh, for whether it's scaling impact to patients, um, improving existing systems processes, improving administration of hospitals and things like that. It's incredible. I never thought, I'm always surprised at how many people, um, are finding like active pain points all the time in the medical field. It's, it's by far the the highest, um, the most popular, almost commented on, to that, to the point that we even had a quote-unquote meetup, a virtual meetup inside SuperDataScience. It was actually more of like a mentorship session where we hired, um, an expert in, um, the medical field in, uh, I think it was bioinformatics, and she ran a workshop, uh, for people, and then they could ask questions and, uh, all discuss these kind of things because that's how many, how much demand we had for that space.\nYeah. I mean, you can, you can, I, I think, you know, people in the medical field, they're, you know, they often, they want to be making a big positive impact in the world. They're typically very intelligent people, hardworking people. And so there's a lot of overlap in that Venn diagram with the kind of people who want to be interested in data science and AI. But you can come from any field. I don't know if you've come across this woman, this woman, I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly, Adriana Saledo. She is in Bavaria in Germany, and she's been working as a flight attendant for seven years, and she's actively, her full-time job as flight attendant, and she has been studying. She's been listening to the SuperDataScience Podcast for a couple years, and she is, she's learning data science skills, and recently she started posting about, you know, she started posting little projects she's been doing, um, she's been doing things. She actually recently completed Ed Donner's LLM engineering course, which, uh, the SuperDataScience team was involved in creating, and, uh, yeah, I mean, it's a, yeah, so it's, it's really interesting.\nShould, I mean, there's so many possible topics for podcast episodes, but she's someone that I'm like, it'd be interesting to get her on the show.\nYeah, she's, she's been a member of, uh, SuperDataScience, uh, for over a year now.\nYeah. Oh, she's a member of the platform, too.\nYeah. Yeah. I didn't even know that.\nYeah. Passionate AI enthusiast.\nVery cool. There you go.\nYeah. Okay. Awesome. Okay. So, oh, um, one piece of advice I gave Claraara, let me know what you think about this, is to, like, Claraara's like, \"All right, I'm a software engineer, senior developer, um, going to learn all these skills about AI, machine learning to, um, then apply for these jobs.\" And the advice I gave was work backwards. Like, go and talk to some recruiters in LA and ask them what are employers looking for in an AI engineering, um, role? What, what are their main requirements? What, what boxes do I need to check for you to be able to get me a job? Um, and then learn those things. And you kind of, uh, hit two birds with one stone there. You, you narrow down your, um, learning scope, uh, and you can focus more deeply on those things, and also you get, um, con, like, speaking of in-person networking, you get in front of these recruiters who then now know that you already have a great background, you just need to touch up on a few things, it'll take you a couple of months, and then you can reach back out to them and say, \"I'm ready,\" and it's in the recruiter's best interest to place the best candidates because they get paid a commission for that. So, like, it's a win-win. You, you don't have to go looking for jobs, and then these recruiters can, as long as they're like, they have trust in you that you have, uh, checked those boxes, they can go and help you get those jobs. So, you know, like, it, it kind of seems obvious, but sometimes we don't stop to think. We just learn everything under the sun or whatever the hottest thing is we think that, um, is going to help us. But really, working backwards, especially in your area. You know, what, what companies might be looking for in LA could be different, what they're looking for in Montreal, or could be different to what they're looking for in Berlin. Maybe because of the industry that's dominating that space, or maybe because of the, uh, cultural aspects, or what, what, um, you know, the where technology is heading or trends, local trends. Um, I think, I think there is, um, a lot of benefit to working backwards that way.\n100%. There's really interesting, I mean, you can kind of get, uh, there's lots of different websites that kind of give breakdowns of, like, what skills in an area, like, I know LinkedIn has done surveys, and I've even, I've talked about those on air recently. Uh, I don't know how quickly I'd be able to find, Oh, yeah. Uh, episode 856, I talked about how AI engineer is the fastest-growing job of 2024.\nAnd it was everything in that episode is from, uh, LinkedIn surveys done all across the world. And it's, you know, there's, uh, there's definitely, there's interesting trends, like AI researcher is a particularly popular role in San Francisco, where there's, you know, lots of frontier labs, whereas something like AI consultant is very popular in New York, where there's fewer places that are working at the cutting edge of developing LLMs and more places that are working with clients to make a big impact, um, with those models. And so you're exactly right. There's definitely regional variation, and then also, of course, uh, there's variation by industry, you know, there's like, if you want to be working in the healthcare sector or the finance sector, you know, there's different tools. Maybe if you're working in finance, you need to figure out some way of doing all this stuff on a Windows computer.\nAnd Australia, it's probably like, um, more, uh, heavy, uh, industry-focused, like mining and things like that, and agriculture, right, right.\nIt really depends. Um, a cool website that one of our members recommended. Thank you, Ricky Singh, for recommending this to me recently, is called hiring.cafe.\nUm, recommend checking it out. I was surprised at, uh, the, it's like an aggregator of jobs. You can filter by location, job titles, and things like that. Um, um, and yeah, it's kind of very raw type of, um, layout, user interface. It's not one of those fancy websites, like, I don't know, Indeed or Seek. Uh, it's very accessible. Um, and they do a fantastic job at aggregating all the jobs. So anybody looking for roles or even just to get information on roles in your local area or wherever like that, uh, the skills are required, I recommend checking out hiring.cafe.\nCool. Thanks for that tip.\nOkay, moving on. Number four. Uh, story number four is David, an experienced professional, um, who's, uh, been in the data science space, and they're planning on staying in the data science, uh, space. Uh, they're in their mid-40s. They have a background in gaming, analytics, and consulting, and, um, they're now staying sharp in data science. They're not planning to transition to AI, and specifically, like, this story because not everybody is going to become an AI engineer, or it does, it just shows that you don't have to become, uh, an AI engineer. The reason I asked David, like, why don't you want to become an AI engineer? It's, you know, the hot thing right now. Everybody seems to want to get into AI, and David explained that, first of all, he's not, uh, that, uh, technical with, uh, you know, or not just not interesting getting that technical, that's not, uh, his passion. He sees at the same time, he doesn't see the role of a data scientist getting, uh, replaced by AI because he sees huge value in being the customer-facing data science person, basically helping translate insights into business outcomes. Uh, he's interested in using AI, but he's not interested in building AI and, you know, fine-tuning and, uh, agentic and LLMs and things like that. Um, yeah, so what do you think of that? Like, what's, is there value in people, uh, staying focused on data science and using AI to their advantage, but not, um, really diving into AI engineering and those other roles that we talked about earlier?\nFor sure. I mean, I think that kind of ties into this idea that I was talking about earlier, where there's, like, you know, there's these long-term mega trends that, um, you know, that you can find relatively solid ground on. So, you know, one of those big mega trends is that AI models are going to become better and better and better at, uh, being able to help us out on data analytics, data visualization. Like, there's very little reason today why you should be typing out every character in the code that you write. And so, you should definitely be leveraging these tools wherever you can. Um, and then, and then, yeah, the other mega trend is that, or, or the other, like, thing to think about with respect to mega trends is that, is that there are, you know, certain spaces where you can, um, where you can find solid long-term ground that don't involve, like, you know, staying up to date on the latest things with LLMs. You know, you can, you can become expert at other aspects of data science. Um, you know, you don't need to be, yeah, you don't need to, you don't need to be like, \"Wow, everyone now is, is learning how to call LLMs and stitch them together.\" Uh, yeah, there's a lot of demand for that, but there will continue to be a lot of demand for data visualization and being able to write performant SQL queries.\nUm, being able to tell a compelling data story from the results that you have. And so, you know, you can, you can focus on those, those kinds of approaches. You could, you could become expert in Bayesian statistics, which has a lot of applications, uh, and doesn't, you know, that isn't anything to do, really, with AI or LLM, and you could be making huge impacts, you know, you could become a huge expert in Bayesian statistics and, uh, use LLMs to make you, to help you learn that stuff and, and make it easy to do the work.\nUh, but yeah, does that kind of, does that answer?\n\n\nYour question?\nYeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. And, um, you, there's always going to be room for that bridge, people connecting like the technical, uh, insights and takeaways to the non-technical audience, like, 'cause you got, you got to drive, at the end of the day, you got to drive business outcomes. And there's going to be a lot of people, like, sometimes I get caught up because I'm listening to this podcast, I'm speaking with our members, I'm like, working on, like, learning things in, in, uh, AI, I'm teaching things, and I get caught up, and I think that everybody around me knows AI. I feel like, okay, everybody's on this, but realistically, it's probably like a small percentage of people in the whole world. Maybe, like, it might be an over, over estimate to say, like, 3% of people in the on the whole planet understand, like, LLMs and, um, understand even, like, uh, what a, what a regression is and how classification works and things like that.\nIt's way less than 3%.\nYeah, I know. But it feels like that. It feels, you know, it feels to me like probably 30% of people, like, but it, I have, like, consciously tell myself it's probably less than three, you know. So, you, we get car, like, I personally get carried away, and I, I think, but then I get woken up from this dream state when I speak to someone, just, you know, of my friends, like, at a, at a cocktail party or something, and we start talking. I'm like, and they're like, \"Oh, what, what do you mean?\" And then I have to, like, bring myself back to, \"Oh, actually, you know, I'm talking to a lawyer who, uh, at this stage, is not yet using agentic AI and things like that.\" So there's always going to be room for people who translate from this, you know, small percentage of experts, uh, and from this world of tech to the non-tech people, insights, how things work, how things should work, um, explore their pain points, problems, and things like that. So that's definitely an area of data science that, um, if it interests you, if you're, if you feel excited about talking to people and helping people, um, then that's, that's a great, uh, area to follow, and you definitely don't need to go super technical if you're in that space.\nA couple of other things that David also said was that interesting tip. Um, he's in his mid-40s, and he, um, has experienced, uh, age bias in recruiting, and what he does is he actively limits what's visible on his LinkedIn to avoid age bias. For example, he's removed his dates of graduation. Uh, he's removed, I don't remember what else, like, his birthday and things like that, so people and algorithms cannot, um, bias against him in terms of age.\nHe said he's 40.\nMid-40s.\nMid-40s.\nYeah. Interesting, huh?\nSo that's a tip for, unfortunately, you know, it's sad, but it probably does happen. So, you know, if you want to protect yourself, especially in, uh, against age bias, whether you're young or old, like, whatever you, you feel, um, is maybe affecting you, that's one thing to go about it. And then once you get into the interview, it doesn't really matter, like, what age you are. It's, it's all about the skills and about the, the value you can bring to the business.\nYeah. You know, there's, I think, in data science, there really are people who, you know, if they're making a transition from some other career, they really are willing to take some big pay cut, you know, to get some experience. But, um, it is interesting how I've, I've encountered several times in my career where, you know, someone else kind of, maybe like, you know, uh, uh, someone in finance, uh, for example, is coming to mind for me right now. Someone that I worked with in finance, like, she was in the finance department, and, you know, I was talking about negotiating offers, and I said, you know, this person would be coming over from, you know, this different career where they were being paid a lot more, but they're willing to take a pay cut to work with us because they love the work that we're doing. They know they, they want to have these skills, and they're kind of like, that's, they, they were skeptical that that's even a thing. They were like, \"No, like, it won't, it won't work. They won't stay. Uh, everybody want, everybody wants more money.\" This is a finance person.\nUh, so yeah, it's just kind of interesting, like, you definitely can, because I think that age bias, I think, fundamentally, it isn't like, you know, somebody in their mid-40s, you're not like, \"Oh, they, you know, they're too old to learn.\"\nIt's never too old to learn, like, I think we have somebody in their 80s or something, like, in the 70s learning in SuperDataScience. No, no problem at all.\nThat is cool. No, for sure. But I think, I think you get this expectation, some people in an organization, not me, and probably not you, but some people get this thing in their head that, you know, people are always, always looking to be making more, to be more senior, and so, you know, it, uh, it's, it's, yeah, I think that's, that's the thing is that, like, it, it's the thing about age is that it becomes associated with some, some expectation of some level of compensation, which, for some roles that this person might be applying for that you're describing, mhm, you know, they might be applying for roles that are like, yeah, that, and so, so the hiring manager sees it, and it's like, \"This person, they've been working way too long. Their salary expectations are going to be too high. I'm not even going to talk to them.\"\nYeah. Yeah. That, uh, that's unfortunate. It happens. And there's a, there's a tip how you can protect yourself. So, uh, finishing up about David, um, I forgot to mention that he's looking at a salary, uh, between, uh, 200 and $250,000 roles. And, um, you also based in, based in, I think, mid, mid US, somewhere in the mid, midwest, it's called. Um, an interesting trend that he's observed is this back-to-office trend. It's getting more and more traction. Um, and he sees it to his advantage because he is willing to go back to the office, and that, uh, to him means that there's less going to be less competition for roles that he's, um, uh, in his area from, you know, people from all over the world. Um, and he also recommends to look at places, uh, where companies are, because of this back-to-office trend, where places where companies are, uh, opening up offices. For example, he mentioned IBM struck a big deal, a multi-billion dollar deal with a hospital somewhere in Ohio. Um, and he predicts that there will be growth in terms of AI jobs in that space. And, um, there isn't that much, um, there is talent, but, like, there is more going to be more opportunities there, uh, than there is, uh, supply of talent.\nYeah.\nYeah. It makes a huge amount of sense. Um, great strategy, and yeah, I mean, there's, if you want a fully remote job today, that is, it is increasingly competitive. Like, why, why is that happening? Why is this back-to-office trend happening? So I have this hypothesis that when you are an executive or a manager, you feel powerful when you can come in, you know, you come in, imagine you're at, like, you know, you're at, you're in New York, you're an executive at Goldman Sachs, you want to come in at 8:30, and all of your hundreds of underlings have already been slaving away since 7:30, you know, and you want to, like, and, and you want to be able to, when you have guests from, you know, the, so your friend from the sovereign wealth fund is visiting New York, you want to be able to take that friend to the office and be able to show them all of your minions, you know, to be a, but whereas, like, when you're like, \"Oh, you know, we have a large workforce, everyone's online,\" you know, it's just, it's so much harder to feel the power of that you have. So, I think that's because it's the more senior you are. I read the stat years ago. I'm sure it's still the same. I read the stat, like, 2022, that the more senior you are, the more likely you are to think that people should be back in the office. And this is my, and that's when I originally hatched this hypothesis. Um, but there is also, um, I also recently read that kind of younger people, like, you know, uh, recent grads, they're also, uh, increasingly happy to return to office because they get to, you learn so much more. I think that's those are the people that miss out the most, I think, are if you're, if you're starting off, noon, a career, um, and you're stuck on Zoom meetings, like, you don't, you don't develop the same kind of rapport as you do in hallways, around the coffee machine, uh, going out for drinks after work, if that kind of stuff is happening all the time, um, I don't know, you just, you learn a lot more about your industry, and I, I think, for sure, um, speaking of, uh, junior roles, I think it's becoming more and more, they're becoming more and more at risk with AI, like, um, agentic AI automating, like, let's say, junior lawyer tasks, you know, the whole research of case law and stuff like, or accountant tasks. Uh, I heard of this phenomena, like, this theory, like, 10 years ago, but now with this kind of AI, it's becoming even more prominent that AI is going to automate the junior tasks first, and what's going to happen next, junior people are not going to have an opportunity to train and grow into senior people. And so we're going to have this, like, whole layer slice of the workforce cut out in certain roles that are easily automated with agentic AI. And then, uh, we will face the consequences of that, like, 10 years down the line, where we will have no more, no mid-level people or senior people that would have come from those junior people.\nAll kinds of things changing, changing quickly.\nYeah.\nChanging quick. You got to, got to keep up, but also, like, focus on those fundamental, what do they, mega trends, as you mentioned, so you don't, to, to keep your sanity, you must keep listening to the podcast.\nThat's a mega trend.\nThe podcast is a mega trend. All right, number five, Evan, uh, he's an experienced engineer upskilling in ML, uh, deployment. So, uh, for full disclosure, Evan, um, has, uh, decided to move on from SuperDataScience and we, from the membership, and this was part of his exit interview, and really, you know, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, thank you for the transparency. Uh, you know, like, I, I want to be honest, you know, it's, it's, it's a learning platform. It, it works for some people. It doesn't work for some people. Evan got, was here for a year. He got everything he wanted to get out of it and moved on.\nThat must, I mean, you can't, it would be kind of wild to expect that, like, people are members for life in a something like that. You know, you, I, I understand that, you know, you want different perspectives. You like, you know, you kind of, Yeah, I, I totally understand that. Uh, but anyway, so we had a great catch up. I messaged Evan. I said, \"Hey, you, you've been one of our, you know, like, most vocal and, uh, members. I'd love to, uh, talk to you and understand, you know, what, what your goals are and things like that.\" And basically, Evan is very experienced. Um, he's, uh, he's based, uh, on an island in Europe. I think that's, uh, that's ambiguous enough not to give away the exact location of, of the person, uh, based on an island in Europe, but he does, um, have a, um, company, consulting company, and he works with, uh, US clients, um, on, uh, machine learning, AI, software development. So he comes from a software development background, but he has upskilled a lot. So in the past year, he's attended, uh, several of our collaborative workshops. I think he attended two collaborative workshops where, uh, he worked in teams, uh, of people to build machine learning and AI and deploy them, like, models and, u, projects and so on, deploy them. Uh, he's also attended a lot of our labs, a lot of our courses, a lot of our mentorship sessions. He's like, he's one of those people that, um, we have, like, mentorship sessions where you select a career path, and you then get assigned to a specific mentorship group based on your career path, and you're like, the, the, um, the advanced, beginner level, advanced, or expert level mentorship group. He actually asked me to put him into all three mentorship groups just so he could, uh, interact with all three different, uh, of our mentors. Anyway, that was a funny, uh, thing about him. So basically, the interesting thing, uh, in his, or the pain point that he's facing is that increasingly, he is finding that companies where he's working on LLMs or that he's applying for jobs to work on LLMs and Agentic, they are looking for specifically, um, cloud skills, production-ready skills, and deployment skills. So he sees that an AI engineer needs to increasingly know how to deploy production-ready systems into cloud-based environments. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think that's a compulsory skill for an engineer these days?\nI don't know about compulsory, but one thing I will say for sure is that there's, there's huge demand. I've said this on the show many times before for any kind of, like, software engineering skills, you know, if you have, if you, if you learn those alongside data science, AI skills, you, you broaden by so much this, the scope of possible jobs that you could get. You know, if you can be, if you could be straddling the engineering team and the data science team and figuring out how to make, uh, you know, the AI models work for the particular circumstances that of some production use case, uh, in some cost-effective, per, performant way for the users, like, that is, that is valuable.\nYeah, for sure. It's, but interestingly, like, I am hearing more and more, it was, it's been super surprising to me. I'm hearing more and more from our members. We want to, uh, think we're learning production, uh, ready skills. We're learning deployment skills. That's why, for example, our collaborative projects are so popular, because the final step in the collaborative project, the final phase, which takes, like, a whole week, is the deployment part, and more and more members, and you know, I was speaking with, funny enough, your friend Ed Donner about this, uh, yesterday, we were exchanging emails, and he said, um, as well, like, he, he thinks, and like, I agree with him that, in my view, and he says that the science of AI, like, is, is, um, supposed to be the important thing, like, understanding your data, experimenting with your, uh, embedding model, validating the relevance of your context, and things like that. But alas, people, like, um, people studying and learning this space more and more, especially at that more advanced level, are looking to deployment skills. In fact, Ed told me he ran a survey, um, literally last morning to his current students, and what, what's a topic they would like to hear more on. And sure enough, production deployment is in the top spot. So it's kind of,\n\n\nLike this.\nIn my mind, this is because an AI engineer is such a vague term, a vague role at the moment, still shaping up. Like, in my mind, from these conversations, shaping up in a way that, for an AI engineer, yes, there's that abstract level of AI engineer we talked about earlier, where you can just use the tools and not really get deeper. But as you get deeper, there are two main areas that you should understand well. The first one is the science of AI, and that's, you know, what we talked about, like your embedding model, your experimenting with your data, understanding what model to use, and you know, even to the point of Laura and things like that. Like, you can go very deep into that AI part. But also, there's a second part, which is the production-ready system deployment and cloud, and you know, that's understanding CI/CD, continuous improvement, continuous deployment, pipelines, that's understanding how cloud works, how what kind of tools in the cloud you're going to use, understanding whether it's right to use model context protocol, like MCP, or not, understanding how to build lambda functions on AWS to put your Python code into them, how to use step functions, how to make all of that work together and tie into a system that is working, that can be updated, that can be used by companies and so on. And that's like a whole separate area of an AI engineer. Like, like we're talking about, like an ideal AI engineer would know both of those things really well and be able to build a great model so that it's efficient and it delivers the business outcome that needs to deliver and be able to deploy it, monitor it, set up, set it up so that it's running in a cost-effective way, there's security properly, properly set up, that you know, it's secure and things like that. So I think those two areas, if anybody's looking to like build a long-term career in AI engineering, really go deep, I would really focus on developing skills in both areas.\nAnd am I correct in understanding that you actually have in superdatascience.com, you have a boot camp for these kinds of skills coming up?\nYes. Yes. Uh, now, now is the time to plug our boot camp. So, basically, because of these things that we're observing and all this demand, um, we have launched, we've just literally launched a boot camp. So applications are open. You can go to superdatascience.com/bootcamp and um, apply there. So it's uh, it's an 8-week intensive program where you get to work with uh, experts in the field that are actually doing this, uh, these things. So people who are in AI, you know, scientists and is good at that first area. That's the first like three or four weeks uh, of uh, the boot camp, understanding that and going deep into that. And then there's also that the last four weeks is the deployment part. You know, we work with AWS, uh, understanding all those things like lambda functions and how to structure your deployment, how to do the CI/CD, um, and everything else like security and things like that. So you work with an expert in that space. You're in a cohort. They're very small cohorts between uh, it's going to be between five and 10, maybe maximum 12 people per cohort. There's going to be a capstone project at the end. Uh, there's projects along the way. They are requirements though, to in order to join, you have to have a certain minimal level of skills. So I just want to be upfront with everybody. You have to have Python foundational skills. Like we, we want to make sure that we can move fast in this boot camp. So uh, you have to know how to work with classes and methods, uh, how to manipulate data in Python, things like pandas and numpy. You do need to have basic cloud skills. So unfortunately, we won't be teaching basics of AWS. You need to know uh, you know, foundational understanding of how cloud works and introductory experience of AWS.\nBut if people need those skills, they can go to cloudwolf.com, isn't that right?\nLet's not overwhelm people. Yes, you can learn AWS at cloudwolf.com.\nUm, and also in superdatascience.com, we teach uh, like some introductory level of, so CloudWolf is more focused on certifications, for SuperDataScience, you can get like basic machine learning in the cloud, like things like Sagemaker and Bedrock.\nUm, also another requirement is you need to be able to commit 8 to 12 hours per week. That's the bare minimum. Uh, so there will be like three or four hours uh, in-person sessions, and then you have to still do like homework assignments and um, yeah, that's that's pretty much it. It's always obviously advantageous if you've played around with LLM APIs and some aentic workflows, uh, RAG and stuff like that, but that's not really required. So those initial things I mentioned are absolute requirements.\nWe're very excited about it. Our first cohort is launching uh, soon. We're aiming to launch it in June, and then from there, we'll be launching the next one's probably going to be uh, September, October. So, if you're interested, apply. There's a waiting list. You need to put down a $100 deposit. And uh, we interview every single person who applies for the boot camp to make sure it's the right fit because if it's not a right fit, um, then, you know, like we, we want to make sure everybody, we help people and we deliver value. Like we, we don't want to um, waste your time or money or our time for that matter or space in the boot camp. As I mentioned, they're limited. So, if it's not the right fit, uh, whoever's interviewing you, me or Adlan, um, or maybe someone else, we'll, we'll let you know right away that's not a right fit. And this is the things that you can brush up on in order for it to be a right fit. Anyway, would love to see people in there if you think this is the right thing for your career.\nVery cool, Carol. I would love to take a course like that myself.\nMe too.\nYeah.\nI'd never get past the interview though. You guys would be like, \"This guy is a liability.\"\nYeah.\nOverqualified.\nWell, this has been awesome, Carol. I mean, uh, we, we seriously at the beginning of So, like, for full transparency to you listeners who are still listening to this episode all this time later,\nYeah.\nWe set out like we were in the middle of Carol and I had like a business meeting.\nYeah.\nJust to talk about like the podcast business and he was like, \"Can we record a quick five-minute Friday episode? I've got these five people I want to talk about.\" And now we've been recording for almost an hour and a half.\nAnd so this is\nYeah, it's going to be a Tuesday episode.\nUh, and we're probably gonna have to have our business meeting next week.\nUm, but it was fun. It was good fun. And I, it was I, I really enjoyed this. I hope listeners enjoyed it too. I felt very, I felt very relaxed like with you, like, you know, I know you so well.\nI really enjoyed getting questions from you. Like it was, it was, I feel like this was like a next-level kind of back and forth conversation.\nYeah. Yeah.\nUm, yeah.\nIt's the kind of thing, you know, I've never really listened to the All-In podcast very much, but I imagine it's something like that where you have, you know, there's four hosts on that show and it's always the same people.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd uh, so you get like all that rapport, which I think you and I have. So hopefully people enjoyed this episode. Hopefully.\nUm, Kirill, I mean, and that means now this is a Tuesday episode, I have to ask you the usual ending questions. Uh, it's, you know, it, it, it's probably been, it's been a while since you've been on the show.\nYeah.\nUh, it's been well since January. Your last episode was 853. You and were on the show. Uh, do you have another book recommendation since then by chance?\nYeah. Um, uh, can I do, can I do two, two books I'm listening to?\nUh, well, I guess you are one of the owners of the show. So, I got that.\nOkay. All right. Thanks. So, um, in terms of fantasy, I'm loving Joe Abercrombie right now. This is the trilogy called The Blade Itself. Uh, the first law and the first book is called The Belade Itself. I'm about to finish the third book, the reading. You got to listen to it on Audible, though, because it's read by uh, Ke, I forgot, Stephen Pacy, I think. And it's incredible. It's, it's kind of like Lord of the Rings, but much uh, funnier and it's kind of like Game of Thrones. They're like that. Much funnier and bloodier than Game of Thrones. If you can't get more bloodier than Game of Thrones. A really funny, uh, really funny uh, book. Really fun book. Um, so that's fantasy. And in terms of a self-improvement, listeners who've heard me on the podcast before will know that I'm um, quite excited about growing myself as like my character, my personality, and discovering my psychology and things like that. The most recent um, thing that I've listened to in that space was a an amazing podcast on the Tim Ferriss show, episode 798 with Terren Reel, who's one of the best relationship psychiatrists or psychologists in the world. And I've relistened to that episode twice now. Um, why I mention it as a book recommendation because it's, it uh, shares five chapters of his book uh, called Fierce Intimacy. I haven't read the book yet. I have just uh, purchased it like two days ago on Audible and I'm going to listen to it, but listening to that episode 798 on the Tim Ferris show um, really has helped me uncover certain things. And it's, it's about, he talks about that in relationships you're always in one of three states, which is uh, harmony, disharmony and repair. And it's all about how you manage repair and what are those uh, childhood or like uh, inner child reactions that we have. There's five of them and he covers all five and how we go through them and how to notice that and not let yourself fall into those patterns to not ruin your relationship because in that repair time, that's when you can actually grow or you can destroy a relationship. So uh, again, the book's called Fierce Intimacy but Terrence Real. I've only heard five chapters out of it, but so far it's been really transformational for me. I've enjoyed it a lot. I'm really looking forward to reading the full book.\nNice, Carol. Thank you for those, and then for following, you obviously people can go to superdatascience.com, join the platform. I know that that's the number one place\nYep.\nto reach out to you.\nYep.\nWe have a free trial. You can check it out and reach out to me while you're on the free trial.\nNo problem.\nNice. I love that. They probably get extra attention because you're trying to convert them.\nOh, I wish. Yeah, I wish we get, we have quite a lot of people joining. I think like, yeah, thousands of people joining every day. But of course, I, I reply as much as I can.\nAmazing. All right, fantastic, Kirill. Thank you so much for being on this uh, FiveMinute Friday episode.\nThanks a lot, John.\nYeah, we'll catch up with you again soon.\nSee you, mate.\nSuch a fun episode in it. Kirill covered how combining LLM knowledge with machine learning fundamentals can be key to landing an AI engineer role, how our field is evolving faster than individual learning pace. But you can find peace by focusing on long-term mega trends like Python and SQL rather than chasing every new framework. How staying in data science as a business-basing translator of insights can remain invaluable. Not everyone needs to become an AI engineer. And we talked about how age bias is real, but you can remove your graduation dates from LinkedIn uh, to offiscate your age a bit, how back to office trends create regional opportunities and how in-person networking remains the most effective job search strategy.\nAll right, as always, you can get all the show notes, including the transcript for this episode, the video recording, any materials mentioned on the show, the URLs for Kirill's social media profiles, as well as my own social media profiles at superdatascience.com/899.\nThanks to everyone on the SuperDataScience Podcast team, Kirill himself, uh, who's the founder of the show, our podcast manager Sonia Bryovich, our media editor Mario Pombo, Nathan Daly and Natalie Jysky on partnerships, our researcher Serge Miss, and our writer Dr. Zara Career.
