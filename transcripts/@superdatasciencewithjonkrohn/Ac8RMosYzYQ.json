  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nWhen you're evaluating these early stage AI startups that you invest in, what are some of the non-obvious signs of product market fit that you look for? Or I guess even more generally, what are you looking for in those investments? How do you evaluate that the market is ripe for that particular type of AI in that particular application?\n\nYeah, you know what, early stage is um is really a game of people. You back the founder um when they're just you know or founders when they're just having their you know idea, you know maybe they have some prototype or some product, but um it's really a people bet and you know they will go out there with their vision to change the world and they will learn quite a lot and that will result in pivots uh you know micro and macro um and so you know we don't we can't say like you know I don't I don't think VCs are like genius market timers, right? I think you know they can have a sense of that, but then also recognize that the founder will do what they need to do and we we really just look at investing in um teams that can execute at sort of the speed of light and and pivot however much they need to to find a resonant point um between what their offering is and the market and then and then you know get to that um great growth trajectory.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. But then it begs of me this it begs the same a similar kind of question which is how do you then identify that kind of founder or that kind of founding team I guess um you know is there kind of I I've had guests I've had investors on in the past who have said that with AI startups they typically look for this kind of three-legged stool of um a CEO which is somebody who's great at selling the idea um a CTO who obviously is highly technical. But then in an AI startup, you also have this uh AI expert who you know where the CTO is maybe more concerned with platform scalability, reliability, those kinds of concerns, you have this third co-founder uh that is the AI expert at at or near the cutting edge like you described Richard Socher or Chris Manning might be um with their research. Does does that kind of ring true to you as well in in the teams that you're investing in?\n\nYeah, not not I would say um 100%. The way we think about it, we start by looking at the team and assessing two two factors. One is AI nativeness, right? Do we consider this team to be um quite deep in AI or or or not? Um and then market savviness or commercial savviness, right? Do they have expertise in this area? Do they have any right building into this market? Um and and that's really where we focus. And then we ask ourselves um given a team and given where we think kind of that market landscape is um where will they need to improve, right? Like it's never perfect. You don't find teams that are always optimally AI native and optimally commercial savvy. And so if you invest in a team that's more AI native and less commercial savvy then the question is how do you derisk the commercial savviness with the team, maybe that's advisors you know etc. And then you know I think when technological inflection points like we've seen with ChachiPT happen what what what the market you know what happens in the market is you have a number of consensus applications that are now possible, right? Like everyone knows that um we should do like AI powered tutoring and so everybody is like well let's build AI powered tutoring um but what you need to do there we think is invest in extreme AI native teams that can actually bring experiences to consumers that other teams just cannot. And as um the the years go on and you start getting outside of this consensus driven or yeah consensus driven investing, you go back into like the markets savvy investing where you don't need as much the AI native teams like like still be very good, but it becomes more important to have a market insight that is non-conensus and so you know the way we think about it if you think about SAS investing let's 5 years ago SAS investing you know nobody like there wasn't a ton of differentiation on like the MCV stack it's not like you're like oh right like the model is like you know the model technology is unique the database is unique or like the controller is unique or the view is unique it's all you know and right like um my SQL and it's you know in the middle in in like in the middle um where it's you know let's call it noodejs or you know Ruby and then it's you know React or HTML CSSJS um and that's all commodity, right? It's just like well what's the idea how are you going to configure and and AI will get there within the current framework of the technology now if we have a new um a new architecture come out that that does uh uh replace transformers then but game on again, right? Now a whole new set of consensus bets will be made against what that technology can can create. Um, but right now I think what we're transitioning from you really need AI native teams in a consensus in a in a consensus world to you're going to start needing more markets savvy teams in a in a non-consensus world.\n\nRight. That sounds like a great balance. And I guess I was I was being oversimplistic. Yeah. In my kind of thinking of like Yeah, this is the this is the kind of founding team. It makes perfect sense that obviously every situation is different.\n\nYeah. And the last thing I'd add to that that question, John, is um this comment on like do you need the AI expert on the team, right? So you have your CEO that's like a you know market savvy and you have your CTO that's like builder and then do you need this AI expert? And you know I've seen this on lots of teams even my last team at at LILT. Um, I I think the I I think what the best way to orient uh a team is to have um AI engineers, folks that can build um very adeptly with the technology in production that are also savvy enough to be reading the papers and understanding how the technology is changing and be able to integrate that into the stack. I don't think you need like a PhD that can just sit there and read papers. Ideally, your folks building in production can all are also savvy enough to read papers. Um is is kind of our take on it. Good news, too, because AIP PhDs are expensive.\n",
