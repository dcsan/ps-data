  "cleanText": "All right, we got Ben here. And this is the real deal, Ben. This is Ben, the business partner. If you listen to every single episode of this podcast, you hear me two hours a week. I probably talk to Ben 20 hours a week. Yeah, pretty much. I feel like you have a 100 times more great stuff that never makes it anywhere. It just goes into our text thread and dies immediately. We got to bring it out.\n\nBen, I was counting before we started this episode. So together, we've been working together for 5 years now. We've created nine different things. I don't know if you've seen this. We've created nine different projects that have made more than a million dollars each. So the very first thing we did together is the All Access Pass, which was a pretty batshit crazy idea where I was like, \"What if listeners of the pod could actually see what I'm doing every day to build a business?\" And I basically was like, \"For 3 months, I'm I'm 90 days. I'm gonna send an email every day just showing you what I worked on each of those days while I try to do X thing. Whatever the thing I was gonna try to do was like one of them was like start an ecom ecom brand, one of them was raise a fund, one of them was start a course, whatever. And so that one did over a million dollars. The craziest part about that one is you were basically like, \"Hey dude, I just met you or we barely worked together. Want to do a 90-day sprint where we just figure out what we're going to do and then tell everyone in the world what we're doing.\" But we've never we basically never worked together before then.\n\nWe've never worked together. Also, we have like the what's the opposite of a romantic comedy first meeting? You know, like in a romantic comedy, they're like walking down the street, then they like bump into each other, and then the papers fall on the ground, then they scoop them up, they look, they make eye contact, and they're whatever. They're like, it's a thing. Ours was completely different. You I think you you were just a listener to the podcast. And I was testing out an idea that was like these um CEO mastermind groups. So I basically I said, \"Hey, I need five or six people who have a business that does over a million dollars a year. Come join this group.\" Which basically became Hampton, by the way. Like Sam Sam ended up turning that into a real business called Hampton. I did one group and you were in it. And the funny thing was you had a business that was doing over a million dollars a year. And Ben, how many how many customers did you have in that business? One. One customer. Ben had a business with a single customer that paid him a million dollars a year. Can you say it's over now. You could say who it is. Yeah, it was Annheiser Bush at the time. Budweiser. So, so Ben is basically like, \"Yeah, my customer is Budweiser. There are no other customers. They pay me a million dollars a year to do this like very simple thing where you were like, I don't know, you were like building their SMS list for them or something like that, but you seemed bored out of your mind.\" And also like you seemed bored out of your mind and I was trying to do new things and I was like, \"Hey, I like this guy. He's got a good vibe. You want to try some stuff with me?\" Is that is that the summary of uh of how it went down for you? Pretty much. I mean, the only other thing is like peak co I specifically remember like it was those masterminds and watching the Jordan doc and those were the highlights of the month basically.\n\nWhy did you say yes? Cuz you had a business that was doing a million dollars a year. I was not offering you more money than that. Why did you say yes to the to the offer by the way? I think there's something you have good instincts and I think there's I've never asked you this but why did you even say yes to begin with? I mean, at the time I felt like I'd tried everything to figure out how to grow that business and I just had zero answers. I'd been like, you know, it's it had been a year and it was like, I've tried literally everything I can think of. Not one thing is working. Like, this is kind of going nowhere. I'm running I'm hitting the wall every time. That was one. And then two, you know, I thought you had a ton of juice. You I feel like I text you this all the time, which is TMJ. I just feel like you have too much juice, which I felt then, I feel now, which is like, you know, this guy's a beast. This guy is like, you know, the next Joe Rogan. Uh, is it TMJ like the thing where your jaw hurts? It's like when you're too much juice to me. Yeah, that's what I have. I I got I got a bad case of TMJ. Too much juice. So, you know, I just had belief in you and I was like, I'm going to take a bet. And also, I had felt like I just ran against the, you know, I' hit the wall a 100 times in a row trying to grow that thing and it had gone nowhere.\n\nWell, I do appreciate that you you do have a [ __ ] ton of belief in me, which is cool. We actually have this phrase we call what what do we call it like your first believer which is basically everybody I know who's successful in life at some point had somebody who irrationally believed in them right Bill Simmons calls it the irrational confidence guy I think there's that for the entre for entrepreneurs too which is before you've proven anything before you've actually done it and honestly when you still kind of suck somebody is just like no I believe I'm in blank check belief in you like for me that was this guy Michael Burch initially when I was 23 24 years old and he kind of like recruited me for a job I wasn't really qualified for and then he gave me he named me CEO. He gave me his job as CEO. I was the youngest person in the company and that was irrational. Like there was really no proof, no logic, no nothing. But like I will never forget that. And then we've actually taken that where if we believe in somebody, we don't believe it in private. We go tell them. We're like, and me and you will text them and be like, \"Dude, like there's this guy Billy Oppenheimer who I think who I think we both are big believers in.\" And we'll just text Billy and be like, \"I'm buying all the Billy Oppenheimer stock on the market right now.\" Like, I'm cornering the Billy Oppenheimer, you know, market right now. I'm trying to build a huge position here because I am a believer in you and your talents. Um, have you seen that? And who else are we kind of first believers in? Do you know? Yeah, I think George Max says that you were one of the big one of the first believers in telling him he should stop doing an agency. He should just go all in on betting on himself. Uh Ean, your old intern. Yeah, I was a first believer in him for sure. Yeah, he was like probably 18 years old who started working with him. Uh but I think everybody needs that. And if and whoever was that for you, you should send him a note today and just be like, \"By the way, thank you for that. That was huge for me.\" And you did. You had no reason to believe me, but you did. Uh but I think I think more people need to do that. It's like an angel investor, but before money, you need at least belief that you can do something, right? like it's actually more important as a starting ingredient than uh than cash initially. And I think people more people need to have that like belief angel investor. You need you need someone to give you minutes in the game. You know, I just want to get two give me two minutes. Don't leave me on the bench. A coach that puts you on the floor.\n\nDude, you were just uh speaking of basketball, you were just at this fantasy camp thing. Can you explain what this was? Like two week two weeks ago, Ben goes, \"Hey, I'm going to be offline for a week. I'm going to the Duke basketball fantasy camp, coach, like the K Academy. Can you explain what this is because I think this is kind of amazing. Yeah. So, two weeks ago, I basically decided to go to K Academy, which is Coach K. Obviously, you know who he is. Shaan, famous Duke coach. Every year, he hosts a basketball camp for people that are 35 and older. Spoiler alert, I just turned 35 like 6 months ago. So, the first time I could go, I immediately decided to go. I took my dad with me. Uh, so it's me and my dad. We haven't hung out for five days in a row in years without kids. So we go to we go to North Carolina and it's unbelievable. It's basically rich dude fantasy camp. It's like summer camp for for rich dudes, right? Yeah. It's basically rich dudes that want to go back to high school where they were on the basketball team and they're competing like their lives depend on it and every other hour someone's ter that's an amazing pitch cuz I would I would happily pay 10 grand for that right now. If you could take me back to when I was on my high school basketball team that's like the happiest days of my life. Yeah, that's what I thought. And then immediately when I got there in the first game I got way less minutes than I thought and my dad was like cussing under his breath that I should have got more minutes. I was like I don't know. I don't know that I actually want to go back to high school again where I literally had the same exact experience. But so we so we get there and it's 150 people and everyone there like one for me actually. Wait do the math on that. 150 people. What is the price of this thing? It's $13,000. All right. So it's a two mill $2 million kind of fiveday camp basically for them revenue-wise. Yeah. $2 million. But I think everyone there like basically becomes a part of their fund and helps support Duke athletics. Uh so it's great for that. It's like great top of funnel for key people for becoming a booster or an alumni a sort of like a supporter of the program. Yeah. But what I wanted to do when I went there, I was like, \"Yeah, I love basketball. It's going to be awesome, but I just want to meet every single person that's here.\" Cuz if you if you're spending 13 grand to hoop for 5 days, you're probably rich and interesting or just rich maybe and not that interesting. That's also a possibility.\n\nHey, I got a quick break because I want to tell you something cool. So, our sponsor for this episode is HubSpot, but instead of the ad telling you about HubSpot, they just want to do something that's useful for you. So, they did some research and they found that a bunch of people in our community uh have side hustles. They start a business on the side, they get it going, and then it becomes their main hustle over time. And so, instead of just telling you about the features of HubSpot, they wanted to give you something that will be useful for your side hustle. And so, they've put together a database of AI prompts. So things that you could put into chat GBT or your favorite AI tool that will help you with your side hustle. So check it out. It's going to save you a bunch of time. I think it's a um prompt database that you should be using to uh make your side hustle more successful. And you could use this as your little personal little cheat sheet, your tool set to be a better operator with your side hustle. So you could either scan this QR code that's on the screen or get the link in the description to get the AI prompt database. All right, back to the show.\n\nWe should explain this like you do this type of thing. This is actually a little bit of your job and uh because people probably don't know what do you I always say we're business partners. What does that actually mean? What do you actually do? I would I describe you know the way I tell people which you probably tell people differently is like three things I say you know basically just try to make try to make whatever try to make the main mission happen and the main mission changes very often which is everything from make great content to make money to just have fun and then I add the last part which is like well also not working that hard you know like I think I work hard but I think in general like want to have a good time and want to also be there for my friends and family. And I I'd say the fifth part is I probably spend 20% of my time playing basketball. So I added that in last year, which is, you know, I want to play I want to spend 20% of my time playing basketball. Um, so I spend a lot of time just trying to find interesting things that we can attack that may support the main mission. So whether that be buying a company, an investment, uh, some interesting content ideas, meeting people. So So here here are some examples. Um, one of them was let's raise a fund, right? This was back in 2021, maybe 2020. We decided, hey, we want to raise a fund to invest in startups. We have all this deal flow. Let's do this. And so, that became the main mission for like a 3-month period. And we raised, I think, something like 20 million bucks to invest into startups. Okay, great. Then we did um grow my ecom store. I think at the time you joined maybe my ecom brand was doing 5 million a year in revenue and then now it does 25 million or 30 million in revenue. Um and so for for 12 months like that was the mission. And so the funny thing is we'll just like pick a main mission roughly every I would say 3 to 6 months we pick a main mission. The longest we've done is probably a year or two. Um and we just do whatever it takes to figure that out. So, for example, when we were doing the ecom thing, neither you nor I knew anything about e-commerce. And one of the things Ben does that's brilliant is he's basically very very good at getting insights from the audience. And so what you did was you created this group called Club LTV. And Club LTV was basically you put out a call. You go, if you own an e-commerce brand that does more than 5 million\n\n\nIn revenue, right?\nWe were at 5 million.\nYou were like, if it has more than 5 million in revenue, come hang out in this thing.\nI'm not selling you anything.\nIt's free to join, but you got to be legit and you got to be the owner and you have to do over 5 million revenue, and we're just going to hang out every other Friday.\nUm, I'm going to host it.\nIt's like speed dating.\nYou're going to meet a bunch of other ecom founders.\nWe're going to share what's working in our businesses.\nAnd then every week, one guy's going to stand up and say like, \"Oh, here's what I'm doing with TikTok. Here's what I'm doing with email marketing.\"\nAnd you're going to learn something that's going to instantly make if you just implemented it, it'll make you more money.\nThat was the the general idea.\nAnd you got like, I don't know, 150 ecom business owners in there in like, you know, the first month, and then suddenly we were just getting, we whatever problem we had, somebody in that group had already had that problem and could answer it, and so it just accelerated our business learning so fast from doing that.\nAnd that's kind of where I figured out this model of like, I create the content, I attract interesting people, but I'm kind of an introvert.\nI just like being alone, like I like doing stuff like this podcast, just me and my bedroom.\nLike, I don't really like going out and doing meetups or hangouts or doing calls.\nBen loves that.\nAnd so Ben would go meet people, talk to them, see what they're up to, find a way to help them, introduce them to people, make connections, be useful to them.\nAnd in doing so, they would, you know, every one out of every 20 of those people would do something that's useful to us.\nMaybe we invest in their company, maybe they teach us something, whatever it is.\nThat's an example of how it's worked in the past.\nYeah.\nAnd I think the two things I think about a lot are like, you know, I want to be useful.\nLike, you know, a lot of this is I don't want to take from people.\nIt's like, hey, I want to help you.\nUh, and like when and if we ever need anything, I know they'll take my call, but it's not really about that.\nJust like, hey, I I talked to a lot of people.\nI might know something that you might want to know.\nI might know someone you should know.\nUh, and then two, I think like I think this is a Warren Buffett thing, which is like you can't connect the dots looking forward.\nSteve Jobs.\nSteve Jobs.\nAll right.\nA lot of this is you, you know, a lot of it is creating serendipity and luck and, you know, I just never know what's going to connect.\nYou know, something that someone might have said a year ago might randomly hit that I never thought of for the past year.\nWell, we should explain uh because people don't know how we do this.\nSo, first explain who this guy uh I think his name is Nick Dio or Nick Dio.\nExplain who that guy is and then how he kind of inspired us to do to do stuff on our side.\nYeah.\nSo, Nick Dio, let's just call him Nick Dio.\nI like that better than Dio.\nBut essentially, he's Gary Vee's relationship guy, I think is the way I would say it.\nSo Gary Vee obviously has tons of access, owns a huge agency, but he can only be so many places at once.\nSo he's basically built this guy Nick, and what he does is he manages all of Gary's core relationships.\nSo from what I've heard, he basically will host a dinner every night.\nAnyone that wants to meet Gary, he connects them.\nHe's the main guy that's the face of Gary.\nHe's front forward.\nHe collects everything.\nHe helps people.\nAnd sometimes, and I think a lot of times, Gary's not even there.\nSo, it'll be like Gary really likes this person or these people or he wants to get to know certain people.\nNick will go and host an event or take them on a trip or hang out with them almost like on behalf of Gary, right?\nLike Gary's not even there some percentage of the time.\nI think I think a large percentage of the time.\nI think like 99% of the time Gary's not there.\nI think it's literally, but the guy knows.\nHe's just like, \"Yeah, Gary thinks what you're doing is dope.\nWe just want to get to know you.\nIf we can ever be helpful, let let us know.\nI heard this and this was like in sports, there was this thing that came out several years ago that was like LeBron James spends a million dollars a year on his body, like on just treatments, you know, trainers, food, all of it.\nLike a million dollars a year just fine-tuning his body.\nAnd other athletes heard that and they were like, \"Shit, dude.\nI'm not doing it.\nLike I just got to go to the gym or like I just use the team's guy.\nI I don't do that.\"\nBut it makes total sense.\nIt's like if you're a athlete, your body is your business.\nLike it makes sense to spend money maintaining and improving your body.\nSo LeBron did that and I've always had this question which is like what's my version of spending a million dollars a year on on my body, right?\nAnd so when I heard that Gary Vee has this guy Nick, I was like, oh that makes perfect sense.\nGary is like building a magnet to attract people who like what he's all about, right?\nThat's his content that he's putting out there.\nBut he can't and maybe he doesn't even want to just constantly be meeting people that he's attracting cuz it's too much there.\nThe audience is too big.\nSo, of course, it sounds crazy to be like he hired a guy that just hangs out with people in his in his orbit.\nAnd I was like, yeah, that sounds a little weird, but actually that's obvious and logical and we should totally do that.\nAnd I didn't hire you in that way.\nThat's not what but you do you would do end up doing that because you're extroverted.\nYou actually like you get a lot of energy from texting people, talking to people like like today, how many people or like in the last 24 hour 24 hours, how many people have you texted?\nI mean, you know, probably like 70.\nUh it's a it's a ton.\nLike if I look on my phone right now, how many people do I actually text on a day-to-day basis?\nThere's my wife.\nThere's uh the lady who we're getting our mortgage loan from.\nMy dad for Father's Day.\nThere's like seven people max that like I'm talking to in a given day.\nAnd even that I'm pretty bad at replying.\nWhereas you just love doing it.\nYou do it all the time.\nUm in fact, you had this like little phrase.\nYou're like I was like, you know, what's the secret?\nYou're like, I reply, bro.\nMost people just don't reply.\nI reply, Ben.\nHe replies.\nThat's what he does.\nAnd you also check in with people and see like what they're up to and what how it's going.\nYou congratulate people all the time on what they do.\nYou have these like little things that just kind of keep people uh in our orbit.\nSo that's one thing is is learning from that.\nThe other is we took luck and we actually made it like a business metric that you measure.\nCould you explain the the luck system and how we do that?\nYeah.\nSo the core idea I think was basically okay if we're going to spend a ton of time creating luck that's going to you know surface in a ton of ways.\nMaybe it's going to surface in content.\nMaybe it's going to surface in an investment.\nMaybe it's going to surface in a future business.\nYou got to track it.\nYou know, I I it's really easy basically to say, \"Oh, I'm every day I'm gaining weight, but I never get on the scale cuz I just don't want to look at it.\"\nAnd then I just gain 10 pounds.\nLike, it happens so fast.\nBut if I'm on the scale every day, I never gain any weight.\nAnd what I mean by that is I basically decided, okay, I want to track what I'm actually doing.\nAnd what I mean, I want to track what I'm actually doing.\nSo every day I want to say, okay, here's like the five or six things I did today that I think will create some luck.\nAnd then I want to actually see, did anything ever hit in any way?\nUm, looking back.\nSo an example might be, okay, if I pull up my spreadsheet, uh, I found this tweet that then became a great piece of content for MFM.\nSo, you know, another example might be, okay, we ended up getting into this deal that was because I chased this guy pretty aggressively to get into this round and then we wired him.\nSo like you know an example would be um you know one thing you're great about is you're like happy for other people.\nI think a lot of people in the entrepreneurial game get bitter as other people become successful.\nYou see that oh they hit this revenue and your actual reaction is either like you know we're we're way less or um or um or you know whatever that's not going to last.\nI think there's a lot of that bitterness people don't really say out loud, but in general, I think that's a a pretty common reaction for people.\nWhereas, I've I've been around you a bunch.\nYou actually have the opposite.\nIf something awesome happens for people, you you literally are like, \"Oh, that's awesome.\nCongrats.\"\nAnd so, you'll do something like somebody hits a milestone and you'll send them a cake with like the number on it.\nAnd um and so you do these like random things that seem to be like, I don't know, unproductive in nature.\nLike you took 15 minutes to like design a cake to send this guy, but then that guy calls you thanking you and then you catch up with him and he tells you about this thing that he's doing and you realize like, oh, for our basketball event, I didn't realize this guy actually knows the owner of that team.\nWe could ask him for an intro and like you create luck through just a bunch of these different activities that you're doing.\nOther simple examples would be like you are pretty willing to just refer people like uh you find out that somebody's looking for X, you'll take an hour and go actually like hunt down a referral for them and go find them the the agency they're looking for, the person they're looking for and like make the connection.\nYou'll do it same day for that person.\nIt doesn't seem in the moment like there's anything to gain in that for us, but it builds so much goodwill that of course like there's business karma.\nIt comes back around.\nAnd so what we did was we looked at all right in the last two years what are all the best things that have happened and then if you kind of trace the the 23 and me the ancestry.com like what led to that.\nSo we have this one business that's just going gang busters right now.\nIt's uh we haven't announced it yet, but like you know it's we just crossed 10 million in in in ARR profitably bootstrapped in like less than you know 18 months and that business is amazing.\nBut if we look at well where did how did we get the key customers for that?\nWhere did we get the intro for that?\nWhere did we hire that key talent for that?\nEach one of those came from basically Ben doing random.\nSo we decided the Peter Ducker mantra, what gets measured gets managed.\nLet's actually treat luck like something you can actually manage.\nCould you measure it?\nIf you could measure it, would you would that encourage you to do more of it?\nIf you did more of it, would more good things happen?\nAnd the answer so far for us has been yes.\nEven though this is kind of a nerdy thing, this is like when when Sam talks about how him and Sarah do offsites and have like OKRs for their relationship, and you're like, \"Ah, dude, you're kind of killing the romance here.\"\nIt's like most people treat luck the same way where it's like, \"Dude, just let it happen.\"\nAnd um we actually treat like creating luck as a skill.\nLike luck is a thing you can actually influence, how much of it you're going to have in your life.\nAnd um and then we we kind of celebrate you doing things that generate more and more luck for us.\nI also think it makes you just think about the things I'm learning or seeing cuz it's like, oh, if I write it down, if I just keep it in my head, one, you never hear it.\nIt never goes anywhere.\nIt's pretty easy for me to forget.\nBut if I write it down, it's like, \"Oh, that actually was interesting,\" or \"This story someone told me would actually make sense to tell on the podcast, or we should follow up on that.\"\nSo, I think that helps a ton, too.\nIt also changes your decision-m like sometimes you'll be like, \"Ah, should I go do this?\"\nLike, you you went and flew out and hung with uh Jesse Sler for like a couple of days.\nThere was really no like, we weren't trying to do a deal with him.\nWe weren't trying to sell him on anything.\nThere's no there's no agenda.\nHe's awesome.\nWe thought he was awesome.\nHe was like, \"Hey, you should come hang.\"\nAnd you were like, you know, people just say that as like a figure of speech, like, oh yeah, if you're ever in town, hit me up.\nWhereas we were like, well, I think doing that will generate some good good things, good that increases our luck quotient if you do that versus if you just sit at home for the next two days.\nSo Ben books a flight, goes hangs out with them for 2 days.\nSure enough, while you're there, the conversation leads to different like, you know, different good things, different either learnings, insights, opportunities, whatever it may be.\nAnd I don't think we would maybe have the the green light to to shoot our shot as we do now.\nNow that we actually like made it one of our like kind of goals is to create more luck.\nAnd and actually our goal for the year is Ben's got to create a hundred lucky breaks.\nAnd so he keeps track of the hundred lucky things that go our way.\nAnd in order to do that, you got to do like 500 or 700 just interesting things that might generate those hundred lucky breaks.\nYeah.\nYeah, I will say Jesse\n\n\nis a proud member of the TMJ crew. Too much juice.\n\nSo, if you're in if you got too much juice, you know, you get a roundtrip flight from me immediately if you're in that class. Yeah. Actually, that's kind of a good a good thing that another good framework you have is this like explain your uh your barbell thing because I like this this I think more people should should do this. Yeah. The way I operate is basically two things. Either I'm constantly te I mean, you know, my phone is just constantly texting people with things I see. So, it's either, okay, we're constantly talking via text or I'm texting, but in a very lightweight way, right? Like, it's very light communication. You're not sitting on a 40-minute Zoom call with them. Yeah. And I do say I do go by the I reply thing. Although since I told you that and since I think you said on the podcast, every time I don't reply, I feel very guilty cuz you know sometimes I just sometimes I forget or sometimes it's just hard when you you know when you have a lot of texts and then uh and then you know and then the barbell is just go spend more time in person with people. So I haven't done it as much as I want to but I I think longer hangs I think this is also a David Sandra idea which is you do longer hangs. I I think Kugan was the one who told John Kugan from uh technology brother TBPN he was the one who told us this idea or he said it out loud at least to me and it was like the middle zone is death. It's death by a thousand Zoom calls. So like a 40-minute Zoom call or 45minut Zoom call is basically the worst of both worlds. It's like kind of takes a lot of energy to do it but you don't really build that much of a bond or relationship in it. You don't even get into much depth. you would rather be like just quick funny memes and texts or sending tweets to people just to kind of like it's very lightweight takes you 10 seconds or go hang out with them for you know 5 hours just go fly to them and hang out with them for 5 hours or go drive up there and go go go grab lunch go for a walk and then you know have a coffee and like if you do that you actually get like way more of a of a connection and a bond and more insight more it's a different type of hang and it's actually it sounds like it's you know, um it's the equivalent of 10 Zoom calls, but no, it's like the equivalent of like 200 Zoom calls when you do it, right? And so you want to spend your time on either end of the the barbell, the lightweight side or like go really in depth. There's a good example of this, by the way. Chris Saka used to do this. I don't know if you know this story, but he he was an angel investor and he moved out of San Francisco, which at the time made no sense. It's like all the angel investors in San Francisco. That's where all the startups were. But he goes, \"You know what? If if I'm in San Francisco, I'm just constantly playing defense. I'm just taking all these random coffee meetings and kind of feels very surface level. It's just does it's not differentiated. So he moves to Truckucky which is near Lake Tahoe. He buys a cabin and he buy he gets a second cabin like a guest house right next to his cabin. And what he did was he would if he found somebody who was interesting he would like make a bigger effort. He would invite them to come to stay for a weekend in his cabin and let's hang out. And founders are like oh that's cool. I'll go to Lake Tahoe. That like that sounds like fun. And then he would spend like 48 hours with this person. They're in the hot tub together. They're skiing together. They're talking. They're drinking. They're eating. They're they're cleaning up. They're doing all this different stuff. And by the end of that, like they actually feel like like good friends, not like you would get at a coffee meeting. Plus, he would really understand their business. And this is how he got into the Uber deal and how he got into the Instagram deal was he invited the founder of Uber and the founder of Instagram to come hang out for the weekend. And it was in that weekend where they kind of like solidified the bond. He understood the business in depth. He knew really how good this founder was and what they were really made of which you couldn't get in a 20 30 minute coffee meeting and he knew to to back up the truck and invest. And I think it's also cool to just go hang out with people and see how they live. I think we've talked about this a lot. It's like you know you go see how someone like Monish Pra lives when we go to his house and hang out with them and you can taste their lifestyles and decide whether or not it's actually interesting. Right. By the way, I'm looking at the luck sheet right now. This is a great example. Your mission was to grow MFM at one point. So, you were spending a couple of months trying to grow My First Million and you were like, \"Dude, you guys don't bring enough guests on. The guest episodes do well.\" You um but you and Sam are pretty lazy. You don't like to reach out to guests and so you're just like, you know, it doesn't really happen. So, you went back, you looked at the archive, and you're like, \"All right, u let me find somebody who was awesome on the pod before. Bring them back.\" And so, you found that Jesse was on a year or two ago. You tried to get him on. He didn't reply. He didn't reply again. And then you saw that he had like I don't know his uh his calendar or his book was coming out and you basically bought a hundred of them proactively and you were like hey I think your calendar is awesome. I bought a hundred of these and I'm going to give them away on my first million you know just keep doing what you're you know keep doing what you're doing. This is great. And he replies to that cuz he's like oh dude somebody just came and bought a hundred of my product cuz they think it's awesome. Like thank you you know I appreciate that and and by the way yeah like I'm happy to come on again. and then he comes on the podcast and it reignited maybe a relationship that was kind of dormant. And you've done that a bunch where you'll like somebody comes out with a product, you buy it, you hype it up, you celebrate it, and then that makes them feel good and that leads to like good things. But all this stuff is like pretty unpredictable when you're doing it, but it works out. Yeah. I I think like you know it is important to say none of this is transactional. You know, I kind of do this again. Goal is to be useful. I want to help people. Again, I think we all win together. Like this is not a zero sum game. uh you know we help people, they help us, etc. It's how it goes. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And also, you know, for every one thing I'm saying that led to this, there's 11 other things that didn't lead to anything and we're totally fine with it. It was just fun to do. It was nice to do so. So, we did it. You know, that's all there was no expectation of something happening except for you just know like, hey, if I do a bunch of great stuff with great people, like good things are going to come out of that. Um, so that's the that's the luck thing. You sent this doc with other stuff on it. I want to let's talk about some of these other things. All right. I know normally basically you always do business ideas, but I feel like you and I talk business non-stop. It's just constantly business ideas. So, I made a list of things that I wish existed. Basically, stuff I want to be customer number one of uh that I want to talk to you about and show you and see what you think. So, things that things that don't exist today, but you kind of wish you low-key wish existed. Yeah. And you know, I'm an early adopter. So, someone someone makes these, I'm going to buy them. Ben tries weird stuff. He'll be like, \"Oh, I'm eating this peanut butter that's made out of caramel only.\" And I'm like, \"What?\" And he'll buy any product that's like weird, but there's a chance it's amazing. Most likely sucks, but there's a chance it's amazing. So, I'm guessing these ideas are going to be like that. Probably weird, probably suck, but there's a chance it would be amazing. Am I right on that? Yeah. And one out of 10 hits. and you know, hey, I'm glad I tried 10 random peanut butter protein things, you know. All right, so this is Ben's random wish list. Let's go. So, I've got I've got three ideas. I've got 10 ideas, but the first one I'll give you is courtside seats. So, whenever you obviously you know what courtside seats are, whenever you're watching an NBA game, they always show, you know, at the Knicks games, they show Timothy Shalomé every time going nuts with Kylie Jenner. But I just think there's way more to do around courtside seats. Let me give you three. I have three courtside seat spin-off ideas. So, one, okay, I want to make a YouTube channel where basically all you do is buy courtside seats and you interview someone courtside every game. Goal is figure out what do they do, how much money do they make, how do they make their money, uh, and all you do, all you have to do is buy a courtside seat and you immediately can get someone every single game. What do you think? Okay, so the upside is you get to be courtside. So, worst case scenario, your YouTube channel fails, but you got to go sit courtside at a bunch of games. It does use that that thing that seems to work which is on Tik Tok. People go and like stop like a rich person in their car. They're like, \"Hey, just nice car, man. I just want to ask, you know, what do you do?\" And then they say something and it creates like, you know, this one minute thing that tends to tends to go viral or people like that stuff. So, you're basically piggybacking off of that. But the investment here is pretty substantial, right? Like, how much is how much are courtside seats anyways? Like, how much would this even cost to do 40? There's 40 what? 40 court uh 40 home games a year. So, what are you spending to do this? It probably depends where you're doing it. I think if you're doing it in Orlando, you're probably spending 100 grand. If you're doing it in New York, you're probably spending 400 grand, 500 grand, which you could probably go get like a FanDuel or SeatGeek or somebody up front to uh to sponsor you for this and be like, \"Hey, look, I'm going to, you know, this is the this is a concept.\" I bet you could pitch them enough to be like, \"This is going to be kind of like a a show where you're the main sponsor, and I think this will do really well.\" I I kind of think you could get it paid for for you don't need the you don't need all of them paid for but like enough to do four or five and then once you get some views then you could kind of go from there. It's not a bad idea. And then the the tangent I have on it is like why are there not courtside seats at the Apple demo day YC demo day open AI like why is Timothy Shalamé not sitting courtside there? like they should definitely have Timothy Shalamé or whoever sitting. There needs to be seats, right? Like, you know, like pretty much any event. It is kind of interesting to know who's who's up front, who's there, who came. Uh I I'm kind of interested in that. You know, what I want is not the interview though. I just want to know literally like this is my version of LinkedIn. Like whenever I'm watching a Warriors game, I'll basically pause the screen and I'll try to see like do I recognize anybody or who are these people that are sitting there? because it's kind of like my first million. Like all those people have some interesting success story, right? You don't get to be courtside without an interesting success story. And I want to know who those people are. Like I were to pay I'd be I'd gladly pay 20 bucks a month if somebody was just photographing who's courtzside at the games and then just telling me what those people who those people are and what they do. Like it's my version of like paparazzi or TMZ that I actually give a [ __ ] about. It's like this weird mix of like business and basketball. very niche, but I would do it. Yeah. The other day it was like a highlight of my week. I was watching the Thunder Pacers game and I saw a guy that we know on Twitter sitting courtside fist pumping Mike Beckham from Simple Modern. I was like, damn, that's cool. I saw that. Yeah, I saw that. That's cool. All right, what's your next halfbaked idea? All right, so the next one I call lunch bounty before we got to buy lunchbounty.com. So the idea is basically this. You've seen things like um you've seen these social networks where basically you can buy all your tokens are available and to claim them you get $100,000, right? That was BitClout, right? Yeah. And then we've heard these stories of people where they spend, you know, $30,000, $100,000 to go get lunch with someone like I believe Warren Buffett or Warren Buffett or I've heard stories where people used to pay $35,000 to get dinner with Peter Teal and it changed their entire life. But there's no real marketplace to find those opportunities. Like maybe you'll occasionally find them on eBay or their Twitter. I want to create a marketplace that's basically like, okay, if there's $100,000 sitting here and Bill Aman, all you have to do is hit yes and then your lunch is, you know, Ben is willing to pay $100,000 to get lunch with you. Just to have a marketplace where it's just lunch, a one-hour lunch and someone can basically preemptively bid on how much they're willing to pay for lunch with X.\nI like this. This is actually when you first said it, I\n\n\nI didn't know where you were going with this, but this is actually kind of an interesting, simple idea.\nBy the way, I think the right, uh, the right lens for this is, uh, these are non-serious business ideas.\nLike, we have a bunch of serious, more boring business ideas, but these are just like fun ideas.\nUm, and the key to this one, by the way, is charity.\nLike, he is like everything is a charity.\nYeah, exactly.\nSo you need basically...\nAnd are you saying do it permissionlessly?\nSo, like, are you saying you'll go, you'll just put up Bill Aman lunch, New York, you get it to $50,000 or somebody who wants to go have lunch with Bill Aman, and then you basically are telling Bill Aman, \"Hey, by the way, we're auctioning this off.\nIt's at 50,000.\nThe proceeds will go to your favorite charity.\nWould you be, are you willing to honor it?\nAre you willing to do it?\nThe guy doesn't get charged anything if you don't do it.\"\nAnd you're basically going to like publicly pressure them to do this to get it off the ground.\nYeah, exactly.\nThat's the exact idea.\nYou know, it's sort of a gray area, but how mad are they really going to be?\nYou're raising a bunch of money for their, you know, charity of choice.\nUm, I think you could do this.\nI think you get away with this.\nI know Andrew Wilson did this not, not long ago.\nI think he did like a $20,000 lunch or something like that.\nWe know that Monish Pay paid $650,000 to go to lunch with Warren Buffett.\nIf you just think about, like, if you had, let's just pretend you had two of these a week, right?\nMaybe you have it as like a successful person and then maybe a either an actor, celebrity, musician, or like an athlete, something like that.\nBut even two a week, and let's say the average one of these would go for what?\nLike, you think 25k?\n10 to 50?\nYeah.\n$25,000.\nGood ballpark.\nSo you're going to raise basically $2.5 million for charity if you could even just do two of these every week.\nYeah, I think it's, I actually think it's a good idea.\nIt is a crazy idea, but I think it's a good idea.\nYeah, exactly.\nI think if you're trying to do like fun, slow impact, this is kind of an interesting idea.\nAnd by the way, you would end up meeting all these people because you created this like, whatever this thing is, the, the, the lunch program.\nYeah, exactly.\nIf that's my idea.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWhat else you got?\nWell, do this one.\nEveryone needs their Birkin bag.\nI'm surprised you even know what a Birkin bag is.\nWhat, what are you, what are you thinking here?\nI don't know much about Birkin bags other than it sounds cool, and I think it's really expensive.\nSo for me, what that was is, uh, one of my buddies started this company called StockX, and he called me, I don't know, a year ago, and he was like, \"Dude, I'm starting a new company.\nWe make these awesome collectibles.\nUh, and what we do is we basically, the website is, I think, ghostrite.com.\nAnd what we do is we basically make, um, figurines of fame.\nWe do licensing deals, and we make figurines of famous people.\nVery similar to this thing called Coach KWS.\nSo, and by figurines, are these like small figurines?\nAre they big?\nWhat are, what are like the plastic?\nI think he makes both, but for this specific one, he calls me out of the blue.\n6 months.\nThey're, I think they're glass, plastic, a mix of everything.\nBut six months ago, he calls me out of the blue.\nHe goes, \"Dude, I know you're a huge Phoenix Suns fan.\nI've got something just for you.\"\nI was like, \"What is it?\"\nYou're like, \"You're calling the right guy.\"\nUh, and he goes, \"You know, we're make, we're doing a special run of 6-foot tall figurines.\"\nI like, \"All right, I have no idea where I'd put a 6-foot figurine.\"\nUh, that's, I think, made out of glass.\nIt's like a nutcracker that you put at the door, right?\nIt's like, it's like I have no clue, but hey, you got the word Phoenix Suns, and like, honestly, you might have sold me already.\nAnd he goes, um, so it's, we're doing a special run.\nIt's only, only a certain number of NBA players, and we're making a Devin Booker.\nSo a 6-foot tall Devin Booker figurine, and, uh, you know, it's like, all right, how much?\nLike, you, I guess I've been looking for my Birkin bag, so how much?\nAnd, uh, you know, he goes, uh, $10,000, which, you know, I, I don't think I've spent $10,000 on myself, really, on anything.\nUh, you know, outside of like, you know, investing in Bitcoin, I can't think of the last time I've spent $10,000 on something.\nAnd, uh, I didn't even think about it.\nI said yes immediately.\nAnd then later I told my wife, and I was like, and by the way, this is like a one-of-one, or there's like gonna be thousands of these.\nIt's a one-of-one.\nSo, I'm the only guy with the Devon Booker, and, uh, you know, I don't know what I'm going to do with, I mean, it's...\nSo, I'm the only guy with the Devon Booker, and I was like, \"Okay, it's going to be cool, 'cause maybe one day he's going to call me.\nHe's going to be like, 'Dude, I respect that you own the other one-of-one.'\"\nLike, that's cool.\nDeon Booker's going to call you.\nThat's the dream.\nThe dream is that Deon Booker is going to call, FaceTime me one day and be pretty fired up.\n\"Hey man, I heard you bought that six-foot figurine of me.\"\nYeah, exactly.\nDo you want to be friends?\nThat's what you thought was going to happen?\nI mean, that's a terrible dream now that I say it, but that's what I was hoping for, right?\nThere's a small part of you.\nAnd then, uh, I told my wife, I was like, \"Yeah, um, so I got this thing coming in 6 months.\nI don't know when it's coming, but like, it's from a buddy.\"\nBut, you know, here's the good news.\nHere's, here's the good news.\nIt's a six-foot tall figurine, and the even better news is that it was a gift.\nBut the, you know, unfortunately, like, I left out the fact that it was a $10,000 gift.\nUh, it was a gift.\nSo, you know, that's kind of led me to my new take, which is that like, you know, everyone needs their Birkin bag.\nSo, you know, the idea is basically like, empower everyone to make that crazy purchase.\nIt makes absolutely no sense.\nUh, and just, you know, just call it a gift.\nYou know, tell your wife it's a gift.\nTell your wife it's a gift.\nIt's a gift that I bought for myself.\nYou know, you, um, I think you might be on to something, right?\nSo, collectibles is now a bigger, bigger space, right?\nOne of the investments we missed on, which I think still kind of eats at us a little bit, is Whatnot.\nWe had the ability to invest in Whatnot pretty early on.\nWe tried to, the guy was like, \"Ah, I don't know.\nThere's not enough room in the round.\"\nAnd we didn't really push it.\nWe're like, \"Okay, well, we hope, you know, let's, we want to.\"\nAnd then we, we didn't really follow up.\nIt's now, how much is Whatnot worth now?\nI think at the time Whatnot was like valued at 50 or $60 million.\nFive bill, I think it's $5 billion now.\nFive billion.\nAnd I think they just said that they, they've done 5 billion in sales on their thing.\nIf you don't know what not is, it's basically you open an app.\nIt's a live video of someone basically opening up like a pack of Pokemon cards or NBA trading cards, and they're, you basically, you buy it.\nSo you push a button, you Apple Pay, you can buy the pack, and he'll be like, \"Oh, Sean.\nAll right, Sean, you bought the pack.\nAll right, man.\nGood luck.\"\nIt opens up the pack in front of you, shows you what it is, and then it mails you the cards after the fact.\nSo you kind of like, you just shop live, and then they open the pack.\nYou see it's like a lottery thing.\nYou see if you win or not, and then they mail you the thing after the fact.\nIt's kind of like a crazy idea.\nBut it's all collect, and they've sold $5 billion in the last, I don't know, yet, 12 months or something like that of collectibles.\nSo like, people are getting their Birkin bags.\nFor some people, it's Pokemon cards.\nFor some people, it's NBA trading cards.\nFor some pe, for you, it's your statue of, of, uh, Deon Booker.\nFor, you know, for your wife, it might be an actual Birkin bag.\nI think the question is, who doesn't have their Birkin yet?\nSo like, basically, what niche doesn't...\nAnd we have a buddy that is going pretty hard at tech collectibles.\nSo he's trying to buy like the original Macintosh or like, you know, a piece of the first SpaceX Falcon stuff that there's not really a market for now.\nIt just feels like random memorabilia.\nBut I think over time, tech has become so much more important in culture, right?\nLike, growing up, tech was this side thing, but now it's like, you got movies, you know, like The Social Network, and everybody knows who these CEOs are.\nYou know who Zuckerberg is.\nYou know who Elon is.\nThey're like the most followed people on the planet in some cases.\nI think that tech collectibles is going to be a big thing.\nAnd our friend who's doing this, I'm, I'm sort of jealous that they're doing this because I think this is a smart idea.\nYeah, I think that's a great idea.\nBut I am curious.\nWhat's your Birkin bag?\nLike, what, what have you bought?\nYou're like, \"Dude, that's insane.\"\nUm,\nwhat is the definition here?\nSo, it's got to be something that's totally irrational, right?\nLike, it's not about the utility of the product.\nLike, I bought a piano, but like, I bought a piano, I play the piano, it's an instrument.\nLike, yeah, I could have bought a cheaper one, but I bought a more expensive one.\nI, I think that doesn't count.\nI think it's also got to be kind of like status or collection driven.\nAnd I don't know if I'm a collector.\nI'm not a car guy.\nUm, not a watch guy.\nYou did buy a Crypto Punk like, you know, 3 years ago.\nI did.\nI did, but I didn't buy it.\nI mean, we bought, we bought that just as like a marketing gag for, uh, for Milk Road.\nWe didn't really...\nIt's not like I actually was like, \"Oh my god, I love the art.\"\nYeah.\nIt's never been a thing for me.\nYeah.\nYou know what I would do?\nI would do, um, if musicians did their version of Birkens.\nSo, like, if a musician was like, \"Hey, we have like a kind of like a one-of-one collectible, maybe it's a recording, or it's a freestyle, or it's like a, a variation of the song, and they're only going to, you know, they sell one of them, and you get to collect it as a piece of art that's music.\nI would be pretty into that.\nI think that's pretty cool.\nMaybe MFM needs to come up with its own Birkin bag that we can, uh, offer the biggest MFM fans.\nIt'll be a six-foot statue of you, dude.\nUh, all right.\nWhat else you got?\nYou got any other good ones?\nWhat's your best one?\nWhat's your, what's your best idea?\nOkay, I think my best idea, I've got a bunch of good ones, but I'll give you a great one.\nSo, I think, you know, I've been thinking a lot about when you're post-economic, which I am not, but I hope to be at some point in the future.\nThe define post-economic, what does that mean?\nPeople don't know that.\nYou know, basically, if you've made over $10 million and you don't have to work, uh, what are you going to spend your time doing?\nLike, I, I would say post-economic is when you no longer make decisions based on money.\nThat's both spending decisions, like you decide what you want.\nThe price doesn't really matter, right?\nAnd this happens first at, like, you buy guac at Chipotle, you don't care that it's two bucks.\nThen you buy, you can go to any restaurant, buy anything.\nYou go to any store, buy anything.\nAnd it just levels up from there.\nYou travel first class, you don't even think about it.\nYou travel private, you don't even think about it, right?\nLike, spending is one side, and then the other side is earning.\nMeaning you decide what to do with your time, not based on how much money it's going to make you.\nThat's to me, that's post-economic.\nYeah.\nSo like, once you're there, you could, you basically, you have all these nice things, and you just quickly get used to them, right?\nIt's like, you move into a nicer house, after a week, you totally, for, you just don't even, you know, for lack of a better word, you don't even care, right?\nIt's like, yeah, I'm used to it.\nGet a nicer car.\nSo, I've been thinking about, like, what are actual experiences that change, like, you, that people want, and I think when you're there, one, you want to feel, you want to feel pain again, like, you kind of want to go back to where you were when you were starting something, but when everything was hard, and you want to feel pain.\nSo my big idea is Survivor.\nSo we all, you know, obviously, you know what Survivor is, basically, a month-long TV show where you go in the middle of nowhere, and you have to compete, but imagine a world where we basically created in the island where you have to pay a h 100 grand to go compete in a real-life Survivor.\nSo you get dropped in the middle of nowhere for a whole month.\nYou pay 100 grand to be there, and the winner, you know, the winner wins money, but the whole idea is basically an actual Survivor that you pay to be there.\nAll your friends and family can watch.\nIt's live streamed.\nUh, and it's purely\n\n\nFor when those people are post-economic, and you know they're sick and tired of flying all over the world. They're sick and tired of just staying at random hotels. Like, you know, it's just not that interesting. Like, go back to square one and go beyond Survivor.\n\nYou know, I think when you first said it, I was like, this sounds kind of dumb, but actually, you know, we have so many friends that basically sell their company and immediately start training for Iron Mans, right, or triathlons. And actually, if you want to get in great shape, like or like an ultra race, right, where where you're going to run a 100 miles or 50 miles or something like that. And you know, like marathoners and ultra racers, like they're in good shape in one dimension, but it's not actually like good for your body. Like they end up just kind of shin splints and just sort of destroying their body a little bit. They don't get in like very good aesthetic shape to do it, right? You don't like put on muscle. You kind of like skinny yourself out. But they do it because they want to do something hard. And you're right, you kind of feel alive, and you feel tough, and you got a story to tell, and you challenge yourself, and like you do this like voluntary hardship. Cold plunge, same thing. Voluntary hardship that you get to show. And so I actually think that you're probably right that there's a number of people who would sign up for like a combination of it's a digital detox, right? Because you're not going to have your phone, internet, you're going to be totally disconnected. It's hard, and so you're going to get that like hardship experience without having to like train to run a long race. And um, I think it's like transformative right of passage type of thing, which it seems like people need more and more now that like the whole world is so easy. You push a button and someone will like literally deliver a platter of nachos to your door from Door Dash, right? Like the life has never been easier in one sense, which creates a craving for hard. But if hard is not natural, then you have to sort of create an artificial hard. And I think that's what this is. It's an artificial hard. And I think that's why people like this David Gogggins, Jaco Willink, like I think that's why people gravitate towards that type of stuff because there's some itch they're trying to scratch. And it seems like you're saying here's a version of that. Pay 50 or 100 grand, and you're going to go for what did you say? 30 days. Yeah, 30 days. That's all it takes. 30 days. And you have to survive just with your own bare necessities on an island. Yeah. You know, this works.\n\nYou take it to other franchises, too, right? It's like Love Island. It's like don't go unmatched. Don't use matchmaking. So, this is actually just like branded as part of the game, as part of the show is what you're saying. I'm just saying you take all these all these popular reality TV shows, and people just go pay to have their own versions of them. Uh, cuz it's better than Dude, Love is Blind. I swear I can't believe there's not just like a Love is Blind tour going around city to city where people who are single and see Love is Blind are like, all right, I want to do it. I want to go on the pods. I want to meet somebody that way, and I'll spend, you know, basically three or four days doing this, and then come out, and then I date that person. You trim the like marriage part cuz that's the drama for TV that doesn't make any sense, like, oh, we propose and we have to get married in 20 days. Like, you could take that part out, but just the like the pods experience, if I was single, I would want to do that. And that's kind of an insane thing. I can't believe that's not on tour. I mean, I for real life Survivor, I'd pay 100 grand right now to go there. And, you know, basically like if it was just like, you don't have to pay 100 grand. I could just drop you off somewhere, dude, and I'll pick you for 30 days. Yeah. I I think that I think like reality TV uh done well for people that want to pay for that is a great idea.\n\nYeah. It creates the desire and the curiosity of like, could I do it and how would I do it, right? Like, and so if you just made that accessible to people. Yeah, for sure. For sure people would want to do that. And and by the way, is this like are you saying this is a business or what are you what are you saying here? I'm saying it's a fun fun, maybe it's a business, you know, maybe it could be like the new tough mutter. It's like, you know, back in the day when tough mutter was pretty big. Uh, maybe it could be the new tough mutter. It's just a five 10 day experience, you know. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think you got to bring the price down. I mean 100,000 is really it's it's very high. I think you really I think if you did this for $10,000 um this might work. Not to not to cheapen your idea, but I feel like you could get some scale with this thing cuz what does it cost you to run it? It's like you just need like a medic, and then there could be like 20 people doing this together. They could live as a tribe. In fact, it's probably better as a tribe and not you on your own, right? Yeah. It's probably way better like your five friends as a tribe in their Are you doing the whole thing? Are you voting people off or No, it's just 30 days of survival. No, you're you're voting people off. I think you got Oh, it's the whole thing. Okay, gotcha. I think it's the whole thing.\n\nAll right. Um, you got some more on here. So, let's do um cool carpal tunnel brand. Oh, I know what this is. Yeah, Ben, put your hands up right now if you're on YouTube. So, Ben right now I've never seen Ben's right hand because every time I get on a call with Ben, he's wearing this Michael Jackson glove. This absolute OJ strangler glove on his right hand at all times. And it's because you had like a carpal tunnel issue, and so he just wears that all day. Honestly, I don't even know if I have carpal tunnel anymore. I'm just used to wearing the glove and I like to fit. So I'm like, &quot;Oh, you know, people make cool batty gloves for baseball. It's just my thing now.&quot; You know, now we just need cool ba cool gloves for working. Like where's the cool carpal tunnel brand?\n\nSo, okay. So So I guess I could explain this. You started having pain, you Googled how to fix it, and then this came up. I mean, I think it's like one of those WebMD things, though, where it's like, oh, one day I was like, oh, my hand feels kind of weird when I'm typing. Maybe I've got bad form. And then you just go down this whole thing, and you start watching YouTube videos about, oh, maybe I have carpal tunnel. And then I went to Amazon, and I probably bought spent $500 on 50 pairs of these gloves that I now wear every day. We were talking about um Touchland the other day with Harley from Shopify. And the thing about Touchland is they took a very boring, sterile category, hand sanitizer, literally sterile. And the founder rebranded it, remade it into something that was kind of sexy, kind of cool, smelled good. And then they started collabing and made made the designs look good. They started branding uh collaborating with Disney and others and licensing the IP. And I think about like actually all um kind of like braces, like you know, basically like you're talking about your wrist brace, your wrist glove. I have like a knee thing. There's like arm sleeves. There's like you know a lot of people wear these cuz they have pain, and they're they have planter fascitis. They have knee pain. They have elbow pain. They have wrist pain. They have frozen shoulder. Whatever it is. And actually all of those are very ugly and very sterile looking similar to hand sanitizer. And you're you're probably right. Somebody could just make a cooler brand in that space. Charge more for it. But like if you want to It's It is fashion. It doesn't have to be ugly. It is a thing you're wearing. Why not make it look better and see what what comes out of that? Yeah. I think it's a no I think it's a no-brainer. Again, I kind of want to hide this glove when I wear it, but you know, hey, I think it's a no-brainer. Yeah. But although I don't know what glove would look cool on you, like what would I do to that glove to make it not look like you're wearing the Michael Jackson glove? I I don't really know. If it was a different color, would that really change anything? It's It's hard to say. I think it needs Johnny IV. Like, you know, if we had if we had $5 billion, we could get Johnny IV on it.\n\nUm, all right. What else should we talk about? I've got one more that I think we should hit, which is, see, at the top of this episode, we were talking about how I went to The K Academy. Uh, you know, basically went and spent a week at Duke basketball, competed really hard. Uh, and coach, you know, the cool thing about it is Coach K was there the whole time. He's sitting there. He doesn't talk much. Uh he doesn't talk much, but he does give like two or three speeches. And you know, he said one thing in his speech that I wrote down that I thought was really good. Or he said two things. One of them is part of the halfbake idea. The other one was just interesting. He said, you know, at Duke, we pursue moments, which I wrote down because I think it's really, you know, basically he's like everything's a moment. I want to hold these moments that are awesome. So, you know, one I kind of took that and said, &quot;All right, I want to pursue moments. I think that's cool.&quot; What does that mean? That sounds cool. What what do you really mean by like what's an what's an example of that? What what do you mean by pursue moments? I think it's basically just like be present and like you're looking for like very enjoy very specific things and remember those things. Uh but also I was just like that sounds cool. It's like a cool thing to tell my mom that I pursue moments. I think that like I think about like whether it's with my kids or it's like you know yeah you're going to do a business for five years that's a long time and like if you just if I probably just told myself that like all right I'm just trying to pursue this moment what's the moment I'm trying to pursue or like if I'm in the moment really pursue it really go really go for it lean into it I think I kind of like that all right I mean I buy that go ahead and then the second part was like you know he was talking about how uh he worked with Kobe and you know he he was basically telling the story about how he he made Kobe cry before they played in like this USA gold medal game I think in 2008 when they beat Spain. Um and he was talking about how he motivated him. So I went around and like you know at this K Academy everyone there is like an ex Duke player. So like there's 50 ex Duke guys just kind of walking around that you can talk to. So I went and asked like five of them like you know what what was Coach K so good at? Like what what was he A++ at? And everyone just says motivation. And I know you're like a motivation guy. I know you're a Tony Robbins disciple. Um, and you know, everyone talks about how he just made these incredible custom videos. So, I'd be like, &quot;All right, if we're before this game, he's going to bring me in and he's going to have this custom thing that he built just for me just to focus on, you know, my hustle or my intensity.&quot; Uh so I kind of had this idea which is like uh Coach K in a box which is with AI could you essentially make something that does custom motivational videos based on all these inputs that exactly you need today. So it's like okay if I wore this device and it knew everything about me. I just want a custom motivational video right now for this workout I'm about to do or for this sales call I'm about to take. Um so that's the idea like Coach K in a box. And I know you have a bunch of thoughts. Let me hear him. Well, when I was at Duke, my roommate Trevor was trying to walk onto the basketball team, and he ended up being the last guy cut. So, he didn't end up getting on the team, but he was a manager for the team for few years. So, he would tell me all the time about Coach K, like uh yeah, what is he doing all that? And I had the same question like you, right? Like this guy's the I think he's the all-time winningest college basketball coach. He was the men's he's the Olympic basketball coach for for a long time. So, okay, he's a goat. Okay. So, you know, I think you asked the right question like what makes this guy so great because I want to learn from that. I want to learn from the goats. And um Trevor told me he's like, &quot;Dude, he would do this stuff in the locker room.&quot; So, what he would do is I thought when a coach gives a motivational talk, it's they walk in, they say, &quot;All right, everybody listen up.&quot; Like, we got a big game. We want to, you know, get out there, give it your all. Are you going to give it your all? Yeah. No, let me hear you say it. Yeah. I thought that's what it is. No, no, no, no. Here's how it worked. He was like, &quot;Before Coach K enters the room, they dim the lights. They would turn on the the big screen that they had in their locker room, and it would be a edited video, like kind of like what a 16-year-old kid on TikTok would make, and it's basically a spliced video that was like, let's say it was them playing the last time they played this team, but then Interplart. It'd be like the speech at Braveheart, the war scene spliced in with the game and you're like, &quot;\n\n\nAll right, it's kind of cheesy. But they're like, \"No, no, trust me.\" In the moment, the [ __ ] hit hard. It's like the music, the splicing, the speech, the footage of you, and then at the end, literally, Coach K came out face painted like Braveheart, rolled a ball onto the ground, and Coach K is old, like he was like in his 70s. He had like double hip replacement and he would dive on the ball and like basically like like you know like the ultimate sign of hustle in basketball is diving for a loose ball and he would he would run into the locker room face paned dive onto the ball screaming and be like and be like let's [ __ ] go kill these guys right now and people would be like whoa like it was total shock value for the team and he would really light into them and get get into them on that. And so he would do the motivational up videos. And then last time we did or two years ago when we did our our basketball camp that me and you do, we call it hoop group, but we basically take 25 or 30 of the most like ambitious founders we know. Like there's like I don't know half the people there are billionaires, but they love to b they love to play basketball. And we went to go visit Duke campus and we played in Duke Stadium, Cameron Endor Stadium. And when we were there, we were asking one of the the ex players who's now a coach. We were like, can you tell us a great Coach K story? And he did. He goes, \"I was on the team. I was a captain and I had a bad game and after that bad game, the next day at practice, I thought maybe Coach K would kind of like rip into me a little bit or tell me I needed to play better.\" That's kind of what I expected. And you know, if you do what people expect, you don't really get much of a response, right? They're ready for it. It's like somebody who's they they're tensed up. You can't you can't really like, you know, push them over. They're ready for it. And so he he he's like he doesn't say anything during the practice to me. Doesn't talk to me. And we're practicing. I'm kind of like, \"Huh?\" He didn't didn't say anything. And then he calls me over to this room and they have this film room where they normally like um review game footage and he's like, \"That room has like six TV screens or eight TV screens in the room.\" And I walk in and it's my face is on every single one of the screens and it's just me and him in there. And it's it was basically a slideshow of his facial expressions from the last game and it was just his face kind of whining. I didn't get a call being being I missed that shot. Kind of being bummed about it. I got taken out of the game. I had bad body language there. Then in the second half started I was having a bad game. So I was just kind of you know I was checked out when we were doing the team huddle and then again I fouled this guy and I disagree with the call and I'm pouting. I'm doing this with my hands being like a come on man. and they froze it on that screen and he goes, \"Coach K,\" looked at me and he goes, \"If I ever see the palms of your hands again, you will never play for this team again.\"\nHe's like, \"I don't ever He goes, you're a captain. You're a man. You're a leader. Leaders don't look like this. They don't beg and whine and pout for something, you know, like you need to carry yourself like a leader.\" He goes, \"I don't care what you do. I don't care if the ball goes in or not, but you will not act like this again.\" And he goes, \"Dude, that burned into my skull.\" Like, he's like, \"I just I would never do that again.\" And I thought that was an incredible story. I was like, \"Dude, this is a whenever I talk to people about like, oh, what's it like to work with Elon or Steve Jobs?\" I'm looking for a story like this. What do they actually do that's different than something I would never do that I would never think to do, but it makes sense when they do it that like, \"Holy [ __ ] yeah, that would actually like shift the way that somebody operates and somebody works.\" I couldn't believe that story. Do you remember that one? Yeah, that's insane. And that's a like that's what I want. I'm like, okay, he's a good motivator, but like tell me the stories that he like I want to like I'm like, oh, we should just go write a book where you go get 25 Coach K stories that are just about how he motivates cuz it's insane. Yeah, exactly. And also just kind of makes you think like damn, I wouldn't even think to do that. Like I'm how you know there's no rule against something like that, but like what a it just feels against the norms. But I guess like as you build up your own credibility, it's almost like lean into that power and basically use your credibility. Like he could kind of say anything. He could do anything kind of crazy uh and get away with it cuz he's Coach K. I guess there's a method to the madness. I wonder like I wonder if he was doing that stuff early on and I wonder if he got more bold about it as he went along. But I'm with you, dude. If I had a Coach K in my life, I'd be good. I don't know if I could do the motivational speech cuz like I think part of it is you need like the B-roll needs to be me like playing like the B-roll of me just like typing emails like you know like writing a document like I don't I don't think there's any you you could play Fort Miner on that track. It's not going to do anything for me.\nIt might it might I don't know. Yeah. And also there was this one story like you know a few years ago the Heat had that miraculous run of the finals and I specifically remember this moment where this guy bam out of bio is like up there at the end talk you know they're like interviewing him because he's the Eastern Conference Finals MVP and he's just he gets on the mic and he goes dude you Donis Hasslam had this insane video for us that changed how we approached game seven when they beat the Celtics and I've spent the past two years like trying to figure out what that video was. So, at this camp, the last thing about The K Academy is I I went up to Justice Winslow who played for the Heat. I was like, \"Dude, what did the Heat do to motivate? Like, what was in that video?\" He's like, \"I wasn't on the team then, but I could text some guys.\" He's like, \"But I'll tell you now, it is exactly like the thing you heard from Coach K. It is going to be something so custom. It's going to be Braveheart. It's going to be Fort Miner. It's going to be like they're pulling out all the stops and uh, you know, it's like in that setting.\" And ever since then, I'm like, dude, I just want to like next hoop group, I just want to experience that for like 10 minutes. That's my only ask, you know?\nOh, that's too good. Um, I love that story. Yeah, I really love that story. That's like that's in my like hall of fame hall of fame of like uh you know, motivational stories. Um, what else you got? Do you want to do anything else or we're going to wrap up? Let's see. I think uh I think we should wrap on one final thing which is you know earlier you were talking about Club LTV which was awesome you know I think we had 150 200 people in it back in the day meeting I think once every other week to talk business meet each other you know I think we should bring that thing back in some way what do you think\nwhat would we do so we don't I don't think we need to do the ecom version of it anymore I so here's my here's my thesis\nthesis is a very fancy word for what I'm about to say. So, let me let me bring that expectation down. In uh My First Million has roughly a million people who listen to it. Maybe not all regularly, but that's like kind of our reach. Uh is a million people who are all entrepreneurally. They're all what I call like entrepreneurs with a sense of humor as who I think we attract. People who are entrepreneurial with and they have a sense of humor. And so, um my my thinking is I'm never going to meet all those people. Honestly, I don't really want to meet a million people. That's not really my goal. However, the top 1% of our audience is f is like a fascinating group of people, right? They're very interesting. They, you know, it's going to be like people who are like CEOs of public companies. It's some dude in, you know, Witchita who's got a $40 million like chemicals plant that he runs. There's a guy who's got this like tutoring business side hustle thing that's whatever. There's a bunch of interesting people in that top 1%. I think what would be dope is if we did Club LTV again, which was like your thing, you would curate. It was a curated group. I think that's key because you want everybody else in there to be somebody you're happy to have met, right? Like that's the goal. Um, take the top 1% of MFM listeners and then basically do like what, like a happy hour, kind of like a speed dating thing. That's that's kind of the way we did it before, which was like you meet once a month roughly and Ben kind of puts people in groups and then you go you talk with a specific prompt and then he switches he shuffles the groups and so you meet in an hour you're going to meet a bunch of cool people and you're going to learn one or two things and I think that would be awesome. We should bring that back. Yeah, we should do that. By the way, people don't know Club LTV stands in in ecom LTV means lifetime value. It's like the key metric there. So, we made it Club LTV, which is basically the the name, the gimmick of the thing. But the the funny thing was Ben would always do these like he would pursue those moments. He would make these little things that would make it fun. So, like you would send everybody like custom Zoom backgrounds or like the start of every Club LTV because it was we called it a club. It was like a nightclub. He would have like like DJ Khaled would record a cameo and you would play it for the whole group at the beginning. It was awesome. It was a lot of fun. I think you should keep doing those things because that I I still remember that and I think we had I think we had the right vibe. I think we had Red I think we had Method Man and Red Man too. I think every time there was like some washed up rapper who would hype the [ __ ] out of us for like the first 30 seconds uh of the of the thing. Ben's just burning like $500 cameos to make that happen. Yeah. I mean to me it's like you know it's like when you meet someone that also likes MFM even for me and you too. It's like, \"Oh, I I like this guy or I like this woman. I like this girl.\" I mean, actually, you mean you like that person. Uh, no, I know what you mean. It it we're not for everybody. So, if you like it, the odds of you getting along with somebody else who really likes the podcast are pretty high. So, it's kind of like one of those things where if two people were wearing the hat, you would do the nod and be like, \"Okay, we I'm sure we would have a pretty fun hangout if we hung out.\" And that's kind of the idea here. Yeah. And it's not Hampton. It's not a group. It's just like very lightweight. meet some other cool people. Uh, you know, get to know the other people in the It's free, by the way. It's not like a paid thing. Um, so what do you want? How do you want people to like apply? Because you're going to curate the group. So, what do you want people to do to How should people do it? Let's see. Should we put a link in the Just put a link in the description? Let's put a link in the description. All right. If you want to do it, if you think you you're in that top 1% of interesting, fun MFM listeners, uh, put yourself down there and tell us tell us who you are and then Ben will kind of curate a good group every uh, every month for us.\nAll right. And if you want to follow me on Twitter, Ben Levy. I don't tweet much, but uh you know, I will DM you. Why would someone follow you? When was your last tweet, dude? It was like in 2018.\nIt's been a long time. It's been a long time. So, that's uh that's Ben. Thanks for coming on, dude. Uh I'm going to talk to you probably right after this because that's what we do. I call you after every podcast. So, I'll see you in a second. All right. Thanks, guys.\n",
