  "cleanText": "This is serious podcasting over here.\nShaan, the last time I did this, actually, I literally pulled up the date of it. It was in 2020. I think you were in like a wife beater and then you went to the bathroom and I heard you flush the toilet.\nI'm serious, dude.\nThat's how far we've come here. Hey, we haven't come that far. Still these things that that still might be might happen today.\nI have a Shopify crazy business story for you guys. Go to your internet browser real quick and go to touchland.com. Harley Finkelstein, you might know Touchland. Oh, yeah. Of course. I, in fact, I've given out them as like at events, but their headline doesn't make sense. It's sensory essentials that bring delight to everyday moments of care. I is that it's hand sanitizer perfume. It's hand sanitizer.\nSo, here, check this out. This story is pretty crazy. This person starts out, she's distributing like hand sanitizer in Africa where, you know, like sanitation is super important. People get really sick cuz it's, you know, they don't have clean water to be doing blah blah blah. And she she gets this idea like what if I made hand sanitizer sexy cuz at the time Purell, it was all like Purell.\nExactly. And if you if you think about Purell, Sam, what does it what does it smell like? Alcohol. It's like something you get at the hospital or a teacher from a teacher. Exactly. Horrible smell. It smells like tequila. Uh, the form factor is not like nothing you nothing to brag about, nothing to show off. It was a very pure utility product. And what she did was she just reimagined it basically as a luxury product. So she took hand sanitizer. She's like, I'm going to make it smell good. I'm going to make it look good. I don't know if you've seen the like the cases of it. It's basically like clear. It's beautiful. It's like this like sort of um, like almost Johnny Ive designed like case. Exactly. Exactly. It's if if Apple decided to like go into the hand sanitizer market and she also did collaborations, right? Like Hello Kitty, Disney. I mean, this is like a whole different level of of of of vision around hand sanitizer. So, she she comes up with this idea. She goes on Kickstarter and she raises like $67,000. She's like, \"Okay, great. $67,000. I could do a first run.\" First year, I think she does like a million dollars in sales. COVID happens and obviously people care about hand sanitizer way more during COVID. Business just explodes. Recently, this is now 2025. It was just acquired for $880 million. This hand sanitizer company. And I love this story because it says it was going to do it's this year it's going to do 130 million in revenue and $55 million in IBIDA. Wow. Exactly. And incredible. And they're on Shopify. There you go. There's your plug. Well, thank you. Thank you for plugging, dude. Isn't this a crazy story? And how cool is this? Basically, this this concept of like how do you take an ugly thing or like just a commodity utility utilitarian product, but then apply like high fashion to it, apply luxury to it, and create your own category. You know, it it sells for more. It's it's the only hand sanitizer people gift to each other. Like you were saying, you gift it. My wife saw it and she's like, \"Oh, I just got that as a gift for like our kids' teacher on their last day of school.\" You would never like gift Purell to somebody unless you're trying to tell them something. I have a, you know, one of the cool, so we have a few million stores on Shopify. We're about 12% of all like US e-commerce right now. One of the things that I'm seeing a lot of right now are these what I think would be considered to be fairly, you know, this is going to sound porative, but it's not like boring products becoming very sexy. And then I don't know if you guys saw this, but like literally a week ago, Dyson came out with this thing called the pencil vac. Have you guys seen this? Anyways, like so like Dyson, like the the guy, the man, the founder, he actually did like this press conference. It's on YouTube now. I just checked. He's amazing. Have you guys, isn't it like a seven minute demo and he just came and dropped the mic on epic. I think it's even laughing. It's like 5 minutes, but exactly, but but there's like millions of views on this demo for a [ __ ] vacuum cleaner. And actually what I thought about like one, he he's been Dyson's not a new company. They've been around for a very long time. But like this idea that he took something fairly boring, made it way better, and now he's able to actually leverage modern media like YouTube to actually tell a story. I bet a bunch of people like are actually going to buy their first Dyson product because of this video than ever did before. Have you guys ever read about him? Shaan, have you read about James Dyson? Dude, you and David Sandra won't stop talking about James Dyson. Dude, like I I started reading his book. He's just like the man, but he's basically It sounds ridiculous. He's Steve Jobs of vacuums. He was Steve Jobs before Steve Jobs, but he was like he's like this type of person where he's like the inside wiring needs to be beautiful. He's like that type of guy. But he took I I'm really interested in this idea of people who take non-serious things very serious. So vacuum, hand dryers, whatever. And I think it's so freaking cool. And he is like that type of guy where he was like building the first prototype for like two or three years to the point where he was uh I think he went bankrupt, but he still kind of kept at it. Amazing. But you you can sort of look across a bunch of different like I'm having my coffee now. Like my Ember mug, right? Like this idea of adding a small heater to a mug I think is like seems kind of boring. Ember is a great Shopify store. So I've been following them since pretty much day one. I mean that's a huge company now both in wholesale but also consumer. That's one of those ideas that I thought that was just go ahead and log in and just start reading out all the numbers for these. I'm not going to do anything like that. But what I I will say there's you know actually let me let me show you. I'm going to give me one second. You guys know my best friend David Seagull. Well, I think you've had him on the show. Founder of David's Tea. He's made, you know, took his company public, made hundred millions of dollars. Him and I have this like uh tea business on the side we started during the pandemic called Firebelly Tea. Anyways, like we tinker like you guys do on weekends. We have this idea. It's literally I'm showing you a prototype right here. You can kind of see it. It is literally like our way. We we think that Duraf Flame needs to be disrupted. That's a great idea. So, like we literally last time you were on the podcast. So we we had this idea in 2020 and actually so now Dave and I have we have a working prototype. It's actually you can read it. It's literally made from Canadian soft wood. It's 100% kil and dried. We have branding. It's called flint which we think is a cool name for it. But you look across all these different categories of things that most of us as consumers take for granted and there's always this like 10x version of it. I like my wife's really into she's going to hate me saying this. She's really into karaoke. Have you ever gone and tried to buy a karaoke machine? There are companies that rent them to you because they're so big and clunky. Like someone should go and like disrupt the karaoke machine business. Like that to me is is such a brilliant idea. Or you know, uh tools like you move into a new house and you kind of need like you know random tools. Most of these tool companies you buy like at you know Home Depot, they're clunk they don't look good. There's actually a couple like beautifully designed almost almost like the Touchland version of tools selling on Shopify. People misunderstand TAM to their detriment. Total addressable market. Everyone kind of looks at TAM as being this thing which is like what is the ex like there's there's a pie and I'm going to take a bigger piece of the pie. It's a stat it's a static number.\nYeah. It's it's very much like zero sum and funny enough you know Sequoia has said this publicly so I think I can say it now but like the reason Sequoia did invest in Shopify 15, 16 years ago was they looked at the TAM of retail SMBs on the planet and they effectively forecasted if Shopify would have a meaningful percentage of that market how big of a company we could be. what they missed was that that we're actually growing the pie itself, right? This like this positive sum that someone who's starting, you know, I I don't know the person um behind Touchland, uh Shaan, but but presumably like this person didn't necessarily like she wasn't in or he wasn't in this industry previously. Maybe he wasn't even an entrepreneur. But is that the story you told yourself when you were doing it? Because when you're doing it, I mean, you guys, no, you can't. That's the you almost cannot do it. You actually have to almost imagine like, you know, let's just use Flynn for a sec. By the way, this is not for sale yet. like this is just a prototype so you can go buy it but let's just like you what you would do for flint is you'd say okay what is the what are the products in the market the biggest one is Duraflame how much does duraf flame sell a year what's the answer of that you know I think it's something I think it's like we last time we chat was like half a billion dollars and it's like home depot Lowe's these sort of home hardware stores but then one of the things Dave and I were thinking about is like why are these not sold in convenience stores right like why do I have to go to Home Depot for it why if I'm picking up like my weekend beer at a bodega or 7-Eleven, I should also pick up my my Flint as well. So, what you you have to almost do as an entrepreneur is you really have to kind of like broaden out the horizon of like what is the potential. Cat Cole and I were just speaking last week, Cat Cole, who's a CEO of AG1. They're doing $600 million a year with AG1 with one single skew. There is no way. Chris, who's the founder of AG1, there's no way that Chris thought about that. Like, you know, like basically they didn't just grow their their piece of the pie. that could grew the pie in like infinitely. And I think that's those are the best entrepreneurs for me.\nAll right. So, I've built a few companies that have made a few million dollars a year and I've built two companies that have made tens of millions of dollars a year. And so, I have a little bit of experience launching, building, creating new things. And I actually don't come up with a lot of original ideas. Instead, what I'm really, really good at, what my skill set is, is researching different ideas, different gaps in the market, and reverse engineering companies. And I didn't invent this, by the way. We had this guy, Brad Jacobs. We talked about him on the podcast. He started like four or five different publicly traded companies worth tens of billions of dollars each. He actually is the one who I learned how to do this from. And so with the team at HubSpot, we put together all of my research tactics, frameworks, techniques on spotting different opportunities in the market, reverse engineering companies, and figuring out exactly where opportunities are versus just coming up with a random silly idea and throwing it against the wall and hoping that it sticks. And so if you want to see my framework, you can check it out. The link is below in the YouTube description.\n[Music]\nShaan, did you ever meet Eric Ryan? I think he spoke at the HustleCon that you spoke at. I didn't meet him, but I um No, you never invited me to speak at Hustle Con. I was just an attendee, but I did attend the one invited to speak at Hustle Con just to say the thing. Yeah. And we've actually decided to create our own called uh Super Hustle Con people who actually hustle harder than Hustle instead of just the opposite.\nExactly.\nUm but yeah, I remember him speaking and he was brilliant. So he for people who don't know Eric Ryan, he did what? Method soap. So you basically went into a boring soap category and made it sexy and made it like kept ingredients you understand on the back of the bottle. That was like a the big trend. But the bottle was like pretty. The bottle was pretty and the and the photography was pretty. Like they would do like a photo shoot instead of it being like you know those like pharmaceutical commercials where they show a cartoon germ and he's getting sprayed. It was like two really hot people who are like kind of like dating but they haven't really defined their relationship yet but they're cleaning up their house together. And like that's what the that was the the photography on the website. did that too, right? Moyes did it with with Native and sold for $100 million to to Proctor Gamble. Yes. Eric actually did it with Olly vitamins. He also did it with Welly Band-Aids and he has a new thing that he's doing it with, but I don't know what the new thing is. I I have like like you look at just shop, you look at Ritual, which is vitamins or Seed, which is probiotics. There's a company that I think is really cool. They're called Prose, P R O S E. They do personalized shampoo based on hair type. They're doing about 100 million. This is public information. They put it out there. $100 million in annual revenue. 80% of his recurring uh customers. So, you basically like send them a follicle of hair. They analyze and they send you a shampoo specific for what you need. I think like that personalization stuff for shampoo even obviously like I don't know if you guys take supplements. I take like eight a day. I wish you know I can basically just take one pill that has exactly what I need specifically for me. Do those eight a day actually do anything?\nIt's a little bit of of, you know, correlation versus causation\n\n\nMy lipids are getting better, and I think there's definitely some correlation to it. Although, as part of my taking all these supplements, I'm also working out more, and I'm eating much better, and I'm drinking far less, you know, red wine with on weekends. And so, uh, I can't necessarily draw a direct, you know, causality to it. But certainly, I do think that, and honestly, it's not that big of an inconvenience. If it helps me by 5% or 10%, I'll do it. Um, I'm also, I do every year for my birthday, I do something called Prenuvo. Do you guys know Prenuvo? Yeah. Yeah. I love Prenuvo. I've been doing it since I was, uh, for the last six years. Every, my birthday's in November. Every year, I go to New York. Make for a pretty bad birthday one year. Uh, you got to be careful. I mean, that's the issue with that. The issue with that is obviously false positives, which I have just decided, I think entrepreneurs and founders tend to be on this side of the equation, which is I prefer a false positive than a false negative, right? Have you, maybe you could answer this. You're actually the only person I've asked this publicly, uh, but I've never got a good answer. How can you be a billionaire today and be unhealthy? Like, how can you be a fat billionaire today? I would, I would, I would get rid of the billion. I think, um, if you are, if, forget the billionaire thing for a second, because I don't think that you don't need to be a billionaire to do that. Do you know any fat billionaires? I do, but I don't want to say anyone's name right now. You, you probably know them also. Um, but I, I, I maybe, maybe they have the thyroid issue. I do believe that if you have the means and you can have, you know, uh, if you can have like house, you know, housekeepers, for example, or you can have a chef at home, it's like if you have a chef at home, no one's going to their chef and saying, \"Make me super unhealthy food.\" Usually, if you hire a chef, you say, \"I want to eat really well. Here's what I really like.\" Um, so there's almost no excuse. Same with a personal trainer. It is very difficult to go to the gym. It is much easier to go to, you know, the gym if you have a trainer waiting for you that you're paying for or someone showing up at your house. So, I do think that is easier for you to be in better shape if you have means. See, this is why I'm an outlier. I defy all the rules. I have because you're rich. I have a personal trainer who comes to my house. I'll find a way. The, the, the will finds a way, and if I [ __ ] I want to door dash something, I'll door, I'll find a way. So if you, if you didn't have the trainer come to the house, you'd be in way, I, I suspect you'd be way worse off, and also you have gotten way healthier over the last hand. Yeah, you know, when I had my first child, Bailey is now my, my daughter's eight, when I had her first child, so Dave Seagull, again, bring it up again, like Dave's a couple years older than me. He had kids before I did. He basically said to me when I was having Bailey, he's like, \"Look, if you can afford to have a nanny,\" uh, he actually described, articulated as he said, \"It's going to be a marriage saver.\" And I didn't really understand what it meant. And what he meant was like, just everything, everything is easier. As a new parent at home, I was, you know, Shopify was already publicly traded. I work 70 hours a week. He's like, \"Just if you can afford a nanny, you should do this.\" And I didn't really know what he meant by the whole, \"It's a marriage saver.\" In hindsight, I now do, because like some of the stresses that I think some people have, you just, they don't go away. They're just less, you lessen them when you have certain like, like luxuries in your life. Um, and I, I don't, I do, I mean, I grew up without money, so I didn't grow up in that in that world. I don't take that for granted, but I do see how it gets these, the things, these things get easier. I heard an interesting story, uh, about actually last week. I was with a person, I'm not going to name, but he's, uh, like a, he's a billionaire, and he's an, he's a big-time investor. And he was telling stories about how he, uh, we were talking about Shopify. I was actually talking about how I met with, met with you, and, uh, I was like, \"Man, Harley's so charismatic.\" Like, it totally got me bought into Shopify even more. And, um, he was saying, um, he's like, \"Yeah, man. I've met with Harley a bunch of times. I know him well. I've met with Toby a bunch of times.\" He goes, \"And I've actually met with, um, Stripe a bunch of times, the, the Collison brothers, and they're an amazing company.\" And he was like, \"I think they're roughly worth the same right now, but he was like, I think Shopify is going to be worth 10 times more than Stripe.\" And I, I was like, \"Why?\" And he said, \"Whenever I'm with the Collison brothers, we talk all about like interesting philosophical things and like what their, like, hobbies are and things like that. And whenever I'm with Toby, the only thing he ever talks to me about is Shopify. That's all he ever wants to talk about. He won't, he will only talk about Shopify. And because of that, I think that obsession, even when your company is worth $150 billion or whatever it is, that still comes into play. It's not just market factors or the market forces is this is the beauty of this founder-led thing. I mean, I, you know, I think the Collison brothers obviously are this great example of of founder as well. are obviously private, so you don't know the exact valuation of it. But I do think that this, this era of founder companies, people that just really give a [ __ ] There's no way to replicate that or to emulate the give a [ __ ]. And, and I don't want to like, I, I actually wanted to spend some of the time episode where I was like, actually Harley, like, I, I know you a bit now, but like Toby is like, he's still mysterious to me because I've never met him, but he seems like a, like, I think he has this one quote where he goes, \"My wife says I'm an immigrant to the human condition.\"\nYeah, that sounds, that, that seems super. I mean, and, and to his credit, because he is so self-aware, and he truly, like, he's incredibly self-aware. He knows what he's really good at. I mean, that's, if you think about Shopify, I think I said this at Sam when we were meeting, but like, you think of the phases of companies, like at the beginning of the first phase of a company, everyone needs to be a Swiss Army knife, like everyone do everything, and then the second phase, it's like more like what I call like triple threat phase, where like, is there like a, can you put a threshold under that, like a number of people or something? Um, yeah, I would say like, for us, it was like zero to, I don't know, Dunbar's number, you know, that concept, Dunbar's number, 150 or 150, yeah, 150 or something like that, which is like, comes from tribal times, where that's how many people any human can remember at any one given time. So I would say like zero to like 150 or so, it's like that, you know, Swiss Army knife. In those days at Shopify, I did BD, I did sales support, um, partnership, I built the app store and partnerships program. I was also the, the lawyer. I mean, I was a general counsel. I, I wasn't really a good lawyer. I'd only practiced for a few months, but better call Saul. Yeah, I, I didn't, I didn't have a C, we didn't have a CFO at the time or anything like that. So, it's like Swiss Army knife time. And then I think eventually, you can almost market for us around like the series A or series B, where now like we're more people, people can sort of slot into the right roles. Meaning like you don't do one thing, but you do a couple things really quite, quite well. Um, that was sort of, I was chief operating officer, and so I looked after a couple big organizations. We built a sales organization. We began to think about different areas of product post pandemic. So like 2021, 22, a couple things had to change for us. One is we were, we were over, we were bloated. We had like 14,000 people that didn't work. We brought it down to what we are now, which is around 8,000 people, and we, we quite like our size right now. We had a couple businesses that were not the right business for us to be in. One of them was shipping and fulfillment. We ended up selling at the Flexport. So we began to think about like side quests and main quests. Like what are our side quests? Let's get rid of them. Let's focus on the main quest. But the third thing that happened sort of in this new phase of Shopify, this new shape of Shopify is, um, these like spiky objects. And what that really meant was we, we basically brought in a new, new team, new leadership team. Um, and part of that process was Toby and I sort of thinking about like, what are the things that we think we, we truly should be spending our time on, meaning the highest value for Shopify. And that meant that like, we kind of rearranged the company, not necessarily around these like traditional roles of like, you do this, and but rather like based on our strengths. And as part of that, you know, Toby's not on the earnings calls anymore because it just, I, I got that, I can do that. I think I can do that at a, at a, at a really great level. I think I can eventually be world class through those earnings calls. I'm going to focus on that, and Toby is going to run product for Shopify. That has been ultimately one of the greatest transitions. I think this is my 16th year at Shopify. It's Toby's 20th, and we've been public now for about a decade. But you can't get there right away. You have to almost go through these phases in order to to figure out what your spiky object is. That's pretty cool. It also, it's pretty rare. I think if you look at how many CEOs are the best storyteller in their company, it's actually not most, but they don't want to give that up. And so I think even in there, you didn't even mention it, but there's a sort of almost like a very telling thing that he had. No, didn't have the ego to say, \"No, I need to be the front man also. I need to be the lead singer even though I'm actually the best drummer.\" So Toby refers to me as the lead singer of the band. Like I think a lot of companies throw around this idea of mission. Shopify's mission is very simple. Like, increase the amount of entrepreneurs on the planet. That's it. And we increase it by by adding more entrepreneurs to Shopify who otherwise were aspiring previously. Dude, how do you hire people if that's your mission? That's a hard thing to like, like all your employees would be [ __ ] quitting. Well, actually the best part is we end up hiring mostly entrepreneurs, people that have had some that entrepreneurship in some way has deeply affected their life. For me, my, my, my grandparents are Holocaust survivors. They, after the Holocaust, they went to Hungary, uh, in the 50s. Hungary got really bad. Hungarian revolution happened. Canada led in 40,000 Hungarian immigrants in 1956. My grandfather came here with my father and his siblings. They came to Canada. My, my grandfather ended up selling eggs at a farmers market, uh, his whole life. That, that egg stall, it's called Lapien, still stands today. It's like 5 km from where I'm standing right now. So entrepreneurship for me is deeply personal because it allowed my family to survive and also create the life that that that allows me to be here. My version of that is when I, I, I moved, I grew up in South Florida. I moved to Montreal to go to McGill when I was 17 in 2001, and my dad was no longer in our lives. I had to support myself and my, my mom and my sisters, and so I started a t-shirt company. That t-shirt company would eventually become an online t-shirt company, and I would become one of the first merchants to use Shopify. That's kind of how I got here. But, and Toby comes in a very different way. He's a an immigrant. He lives in Germany. Meets someone, uh, a wonderful woman who becomes his wife named Fiona. He moves to Canada. Can't get a job as a new immigrant. Wants to start a snowboard shop and finds it incredibly difficult to do so. Writes a piece of code to sell these snowboards, which would then become Shopify. You know, our, our buddy George Mack has this great phrase where he says, uh, \"People only remember you're weird,\" meaning any behavior that's standard that you do might be very useful, but it's not very memorable. Yeah. Uh, and so, you know, Sam was asking about Toby just now, and you know, I think like he said, he's a bit of a mysterious character. He's not somebody who's out there doing a bunch of podcasts and and public things. I'm curious what's, what are some stories of his weird, like, you know, what's a behavior or a thing that he does that's non-standard? There are a couple things that I think define, you know, his, his leadership really well at Shopify. One fundamentally is that he spends a lot of his time using like all the newest tech constantly. He's constantly reading the newest white paper on a new, a new LLM that just came out, like this. I, and I don't think that's uncommon. I think you'd see that with Patrick or Zuck, but there is a category of these like super technical founders that did not exist historically, at least if they did, they weren't running hundred billion dollar or trillion dollar companies. Toby's in this group of people that are super technical that know more about the, the code base than anyone else in the planet. The other thing that I think is, is, um, important is one of the things he does every year is basically, you know, during Christmas break, he spends his time running effectively the priorities for the company, and January 1st every single year, I don't know for the last decade or so, the whole company gets an email, and it's incredibly specific, uh, direction of like, what are we going to build this year? And it's not based on necessarily like, you know, survey\n\n\nIt's based on his deep intuition of how the product needs to evolve, and in some cases, you know, it's... It's, um, you know, Shopify runs some of the largest flash sales on the planet, like for Supreme or Taylor Swift or these, these massive, you know, crazy throughput, 30,000 transactions a minute type stuff. So sometimes it's like, you know, we have to be able to like, to, to have this type of throughput, and other times it's, \"Look, the future of retail is not going to be just online; it's going to be everywhere,\" and Shop has to make it super easy to sell across every surface area. I announced two weeks ago, uh, we're doing with Roblox inside of, like, basically the Roblox universe, that now we're embedding commerce in into there as well. Toby didn't say, \"Go do, like, Roblox.\" What he did say was, \"Make sure that everywhere where consumers are spending their time, there is a way for our existing merchants to easily turn on that channel.\" And it turns out, like, in something like Roblox, I forget what the DAUs are, but like, it's, it's ridiculous. I think, um, there's like 700 million monthly users in the metaverse. I think the largest chunk of those are on, uh, are in Roblox. It's like a hundred billion dollar industry today. It's going to be like 930 billion in 10 by 2030, I think. So we're like effect. So that's the type of stuff that he does is that he, he doesn't necessarily, like, I know some CEOs will go and talk to customers. He does that also, but ultimately what he's, I think, incredibly good at is the intuition on that.\n\nThe second thing is, I think he spots talent really well. Um, he finds these people across Shopify that are unobvious people, and he gives them the room to do their very, very best work, and that ability to completely ignore an org chart and rather focus on impact and like, \"Hey, that person, I saw, like, you know, he's in GitHub, he's looking at their commit, and he's like, 'I like the way they wrote that. I'm actually going to elevate that person and let them do something, you know, something much bigger, much more creative.'\" And, and then probably the last one I would say that we're kind of talking about it earlier is that I think what he's done for, for me, is he sees a better version of me than even I see from me. I see a pretty good version for me. I've always been someone who's somewhat, you know, fairly confident in my ability to get better at stuff, but he basically always shows me that there is a new gear for me. And he's like, \"You don't even know that that gear exists yet, but like, you think you're in the fourth gear, there's a fifth gear.\" And he's like, and, and his expectation of me, and, and frankly, I think the entire team, is that we requalify for our job every year. And it's one thing to expect that your team is going to re-qualify. Frankly, he, he also believes he has to re-qualify every year. And the pressure that he, that, you know, like, he doesn't put more pressure on anyone else than he puts on himself. Um, that I think is an amazing thing.\n\nDoes someone like him evolve into this like Jedi master type of guy, or when you had 20 people or 10 people or whatever it was, was it clear that this guy's special? You know, I think a lot of people end up starting companies and working like, you know, spending their lives working with people that they probably would have been friends with in high school. Toby and I are totally different. I'm very, I'm like, power extroverted. I love being around people. So, remember, I came to Shopify as a merchant first. I moved to Ottawa in 2005 to go to law school, not to become a lawyer. A mentor of my t-shirt, my t-shirt business that I had in college at Miguel here in Montreal had gone, became, you know, a pretty good t-shirt business. I was able to pay for my tuition and my rent and help my mom and my two sisters were going to private school that I was helping to pay for, that I, that I was paying for. I was paying my mother's rent at that point. A mentor of mine convinced me to go to law school, not to become a lawyer, but he thought of, he looked at law school as being, um, like finishing school for entrepreneurship, and he was, he was a lawyer. He was teaching law at the University of Ottawa. He said, \"Come to Ottawa, go to law school here. You're never going to practice law, but we, I think it's going to make you a much better entrepreneur. You'll learn, you know, how to critical reason, how to write better, how to think better, how to articulate yourself better.\" So, I moved to Ottawa, have no friends, never even been to Ottawa before. It's the capital of Canada. Never been there before. Get there and I'm like, \"Where are the entrepreneurs? Those are my homies. Those are the people I always hang out with.\" And I met Toby through that. And at the time, he was just transitioning from snowboards to software. And this is before I ended becoming an early merchant. Even in 2005, he was thinking about what the future of the internet might look like.\n\nSo, do, do you remember, can you give us a bunch of those quotes? Yeah, I remember him, I remember him saying, like, for example, one of the things that, that, like, payments should have been into, should have been built into browsers. I'm like, \"What?\" He's like, \"Yes, like, the people that made browsers completely [ __ ] this up. Payments should, should be natively integrated, not through a third party, but natively built in to browser. That makes total sense. Identity should be built into browser entirely.\" So he was thinking about all the deficiencies of the modern web and then trying to effectively adjust Shopify's product to make those things much easier. The other thing I think that, that he had done that I thought was incredibly inspiring as someone that, you know, praised at the altar of entrepreneurship was at that point, there were a couple companies doing e-commerce. There was a company called Magento, which ended up getting acquired by Adobe. There was a company called Demandware that ended up getting acquired by Salesforce. There was a company called ATG that ended up getting acquired by Oracle. And there was a company called Hybris that ended, ended up getting acquired by SAP, and those were sort of the players there. There was some other ones too, like Yahoo Stores, but like, no one was really doing ma, like, major GMBB or volume on those. And I remember him sort of thinking that, to telling me that the problem with all of these companies is that they're built for existing entrepreneurs, that there's never been anything built for aspiring entrepreneurs. Meaning, if you have an idea in the shower in the morning, you can then go to your desk and and get, get it going right away. And what if we were able to give the smallest of entrepreneurs, of companies, of ideas, the same tools that traditionally only the biggest companies could have? What would happen then? Well, the end result is that you, like, we now have, there's now been a trillion dollars transacted on, over a trillion dollars transacted on Shopify. And yes, we have some very large stores, but the majority of those, of that GMV is the longtail small businesses and those homegrown success stories, companies like Fashion Nova or Gym Shark or all these companies that started at their mom's kitchen table that grew super, super large. So those are a couple of the things in the early days that completely changed my perspective on one, how to think about building. But remember also, like, my own experience was sitting in in law school, hitting the launch button on my online store, my t-shirt shop, and all of a sudden I was getting sales from like Ireland, and I'm like, \"For $29 a month.\" I think it was $24 a month at the time. Like, that was a dramatic, um, uh, insight for me that, okay, if you, if you, if you couple ambition and incredible product technology, you can actually change the entire, like, trajectory of entrepreneurship on the planet at a huge scale.\n\nWhere has he been wrong? Where's the weakness? Where's the the human side of this? So he's amazing. Are you guys familiar with the anagram? Yeah. Okay. So the anagram is sort of, there's a lot of these personality things. The anagram is the only one, frankly, that I think is worth any, worth any, any, any review. But, um, so he is an eight. The challenger, characterized by a strong desire for control, independence, and justice. They're assertive, decisive, and driven by a need to protect themselves and others. They're often natural leaders, confident, and willing to take charge. Now go to three. The achiever. Self assured. Uh, what is it? Self assured, attractive. There you go. Charming. Ambitious, competent, energetic. At their best, they are a role model who inspires others. But they have, you know, basic fears of being worthless, basic desire to feel good value. That hits, man. That hits. So, first of all, for any, anyone listening, like, if you are working in a team with a bunch of different personalities, it's a really effective thing to do to actually figure out what they are in the anagram. I, we've, we've looked at, I mean, I've, I've looked at every one of them. We've had coaches on staff at Shopify for over a decade. This is the one that I think is the most valuable. So, knowing that Toby being a challenger, me being an achiever, he is really tough. I mean, when I bring him an idea, he will beat the [ __ ] out of it to a level that I have, that I have not even considered yet. So, it is not easy to work for him, but it is incredibly meaningful because what you end up with is outside personal growth. He won't say 20 words when two will do. He'll say two. And if, if the two are correct, and even though they may not be the most polite way to say it, he doesn't care. He is, he is seeking the best result. Like that, that is why he should be, you know, I will work at the company as long as he'll have me and as long as he's there because I believe he is the, the, he is the CEO that Shopify requires. No one will care more about that, um, but that doesn't make it easy, right? And like, I know other companies, I talked to my peers, other companies, they're like, \"Yeah, you know, like, there is, um, not a softness, but there is a collegiality to their culture that doesn't happen at Shopify.\" It's not, it's not that we're not collegial, it's just like, that's not what we're trying to achieve.\n\nDid you guys, uh, ever have acquisition offers? You talked about how Magento sold and these other guys sold. Was there ever a moment everybody sold where, uh, you guys had an offer or a discussion that you had to take seriously, and you had a fork in the road moment? You obviously ended up independent, but was that always, was that the only way this could have gone? If you look at the history of IPOs, particularly in tech, you will notice that Shopify, from a market cap perspective, went public at a much earlier stage than most companies did. What I will tell you is, we first of all, did not return phone calls from corp dev teams early on, specifically because we didn't want to get into that headsp space, that line of thinking. That wasn't what we were interested in. We wanted to build a 100-year independent company, and we knew that those phone calls may result in us having meetings and talking about it and thinking about it, and like, we just didn't want that in our minds. It just, that feels like a real distraction. In fact, you guys know this too, because you both invest in a lot of companies. Once you take that phone call from a corp dev person at a big company, you, you begin to inadvertently or advertently start a process in your mind of, of begin to think about, \"What if? What if this number is right? What if the terms are good? What if they have a, you know, what if there's a space for me at this company where I can, you know, the pitch that a lot of these companies make, these big, you know, M&A conglomerates, they make is like, 'Well, you can do what you're doing at your current company, but you can do it here with more scale.'\" So ultimately, we didn't want to necessarily have that even in our mind. So we didn't return those phone calls first thing. Second thing is, we went public at a very early stage because one, we thought it would be the best way for us to be independent longer term, and two, we felt the company was ready for it, like the product was ready, the business ready, the team was ready. That's not really the case anymore. I mean, other than two companies I'm very close with. One is Claio. You know, Andrew, who's founder of Clavio, went public, um, last year, and then Fiji, who was at the time CEO of Instacart, who's on our board, went public as well. So you've had a couple IPOs though, but generally companies are, and, and in the case of, you know, most of these companies, they're much larger. They're in the tens of billions of dollars of market cap before they actually go public. So our, we just didn't want to get acquired, and we wanted to be independent.\n\nBut were there ever times where you were like, \"I would like to, I would like to take this deal. This would be nice?\" No, there, um, uh, truly there was not. We, we did, we did a very small secondary on, I think it was the series B, which allowed me basically to buy a house, a down payment on a house. And what's your philosophy? Are you, are you like a de-risker over time, or are you like, \"[ __ ] it, all the eggs in this basket?\" Like, what's your philosophy around that? 'Cause it's, it's tricky, right? Even if you believe money, money is so, money is a, so, you know, I mentioned my dad wasn't around, um, when I went, got to college, my, my dad, you know, he was, I love my dad, he's a great guy, but my dad really never made it as an entrepreneur, um, and growing up, um, money felt emotional to me, that some weeks we had, and some weeks we didn't. We never, we never, you know, we always had food on the table, for example, but there were times where I, I remember as a kid, often my mom would come sit down and say, \"Hey, like, we're gonna have to, you know, tighten our belts this, this, this month.\" That, that tightening of the belt happened a lot, um, during my childhood. And so when we went public, yeah, for the first time, I had real money. I was able to, um, I, you know, I was on a, a 10B51, which is in Canada, we call an ASTP, an automatic share distribution plan. So I was able to take a lot, but I mean, I don't think there's any better investment for me and my family than than Shopify. Um, but I've taken money off the table so that I feel like my family is secure, my children are secure. We, we're never going to have to tighten our belts, and that, that's\n\n\nNot a flex that truly makes me feel I'm able to do better work because I know that I have a nest egg that is protected.\n\nWhat was the hardest moment at Shopify?\nWas there, what was rock bottom?\nWhat was the low?\n\nUm, co was really, really hard.\nUm, maybe not for the reasons that, you know, you guys... I mean, you remember Shopify went from something like, um, I don't know, maybe pre-COVID, we were a $30 billion company.\nWe, like, overnight... I have your revenue.\nI think, I think in 2019, you were at 1.6 billion, and then 2020, you're about three billion.\nThat's a big jump, and it was a big jump in, in everything.\nLike, what happened during the pandemic was... I mean, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail was sitting at around 15% in the US.\nSo, 15% of all retail was online, and then effectively, you had this pull forward during the pandemic where, like, we jumped very quickly to 20-some percent.\n\nShaan, to answer your question, what was the hardest time in Shopify?\nYou know, we almost didn't make it.\nWe grew from 1.5 to 100 million.\nCan I, can I finish my [ __ ] story, guys?\nOkay, so, uh, so there, there was, there, there was this manic, like, period inside of Shopify.\nLike, all of a sudden, all these... this pull forward, for example, like, everyone all of a sudden needed to go online.\nAll these laggards that were just physical retailers eventually came online, and I think at that point, it was like, just get [ __ ] done.\nAnd then 2022 happened, and like, the market started going the other way, and like, we kind of found ourselves with a much larger team.\nWe found ourselves with a lot of side quests.\nShopify also, for the first time ever, I think, we, we were not profitable.\nSo, I think that sort of post-COVID hangover was, was really tough for us, and that's kind of where, like, I think, you know, you asked me about these different phases, that's where I think that sort of the next phase came into play, which is, okay, like, do we... we need to figure out, like, what, what do we care about?\nUm, what is the right team size?\nWhat are our focus areas?\nDo we have the right people leading the company?\nAnd that was sort of this, like, we recalibrated everything.\nUm, that was really hard.\nI wasn't sure I... I knew Shopify would make it.\nUm, I wasn't sure if I was going to make...\n\nWas there ever a time where you thought that Shopify wasn't going to make it?\nPre-IPO, for sure.\nI mean, post-IPO things, you know, we, we went public at a time where we sort of knew what the next 10 years would look like.\nWe were profitable.\nWe were making money.\nWe were, you know, we were subscribing to this whole, like, you know, you know, grow, grow topline and also grow bottom line.\nUm, but pre-pandemic, there was... sorry, pre-pre-IPO there, I mean, that, that was hard, right?\nLike, I mean, we were bootstrapped for a while.\nThere were times where we didn't know if we can cover payroll.\nUm, but, you know, I think you have to be a little bit, you know, crazy naive.\n\nShaan and I, uh, you know, my last company, we were going to do about 20 or 17 million the year we sold, but I sold early in the year.\nShaan has a business that is in, like, uh, you know, he's got his hands at a bunch of things that are, that, that are potentially in the, in the similar range.\nI don't want to speak for him, but I don't think either of us have experienced this, like, $50 million range where I'm like, \"Oh, then I could just, like, manage, like, three amazing people who do most of the work.\"\nI'm in the phase now with my business where I'm like, everything is [ __ ] hard.\nLike, if someone, if someone quits, I gotta go do the work.\nAnd so what I want to know is, like, does it get... Does it go away?\nDoes it get more fun?\nNo.\nNo, it doesn't.\nBut actually, like, I don't think any of this gets easier.\nYou just have different problems.\nIt's, it's like the... but it's like the magic number.\nWe all have this magic number early on as entrepreneurs.\nEspecially if you grew up the way that I know, you know, Shaan, Sam, and and I grew up the way that we... like, we all had this number in our mind, like, when I get that, I can think of... I can basically extrapolate my passive income from it, and that's going to pay all my expenses, and I can do... and then you hit the number, you're like, it's like there, it's [ __ ].\nIt's complete [ __ ].\nThere is no magic number, just like there is no stage of a company whereby you are cruising.\nIt's just different problems, right?\nSo, the problems that I have with, with, at, at, like, at 7,000 people and hundred billion market cap are very different than what I had with, like, 70 people.\n\nWhi- whi- which problems do you enjoy more?\nThis is my favorite stage of Shopify because as going back to the whole spiky object, the thing that I think I can add, the way I can add the most value out of Shopify is through storytelling.\nAnd I believe now the microphone that I have because of Shopify's size allows me to do it at this crazy scale.\nAnd I think for that, it means that, like, my life's work gets to be more amplified today than it did 10 years ago.\n\nI remember you be... you've always been lyrical and good at talking.\nYou are now much better.\nUh, you always... you're always good.\nNow you are, like, really great.\nDo you have, like, a... do you have, like, a writer?\nLike, is there someone who's going to watch this and be like, this bit hit?\nNo, you, you guys asked me for notes.\nYou guys asked me for notes this morning.\nI had to, like, literally sit down and write you notes myself.\nNo.\nYeah.\nI don't even think... I don't even know what I wrote to you.\nBet.\n\nI DM'd him this morning, and I was just like, \"Hey, uh, saw that, you know, whatever.\"\nExcited for the pod today.\nAnd I was like, you know, the best episodes tend to be where the guests come in with, you know, these three or four bullet points.\nI gave him some guidelines.\nI was like, you know, I was like, no.\nI said, uh, I noticed you hadn't filled out the prep doc.\nWe, we usually send a guest, like, a prep dock, and they fill it out, and then it gives us kind of like a, you know, some options of where you can go in the conversation.\nAnd he goes, \"Prep dock?\nDude, let's just hang.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Oh yeah.\nOh, I got to be... I got to be cool.\nOkay, my bad.\"\nUh, yeah.\nSo, so I mean, I have... I have a team of people that help me with things like when I'm preparing for...\nBut no, this, this is me.\nThere's no notes.\nThere's...\n\nNo, but you should... like, I actually heard a couple of stories recently that have really inspired me.\nOkay, I'm going to give you a little, like, a framework that I think most people underestimate.\nOkay, so there's a story in sports that LeBron James spends a million dollars a year on his body.\nThe numbers is actually kind of irrelevant, but the idea is directionally correct.\nLeBron James spends a lot of money on his body, and he has certain, uh, you know, treatments and coaches and, like, protocols that he follows that the average athlete is not following.\nIn fact, we went to an NBA team and I said, \"How many of you guys have chefs?\"\nAnd, uh, less than half of that team in the NBA raised their hand.\nI was like, \"This is insane.\"\nUm, I... I couldn't believe the owner would even allow that.\nBut, like, for LeBron, every meal is dialed.\nEvery, you know, every hour of the day is either recovery, it's, it's building, or it's, uh, you know, it's playing.\nAnd so LeBron does that in his field.\nI then talk to somebody who knows Peter Thiel very well.\nAnd I go, you know, it's weird because Peter, he's not like a smooth talker, right?\nHe's actually, like, stutters a bunch.\nHe stumbles.\nBut when Peter Thiel goes on tour, and he does it like every, you know, 7 to 10 years, he's got this message, and boom, he'll get, like, a ton of PR.\nHis message is very effective.\nSo, he's not very efficient with his words, but he's very effective.\nAnd you know, if you remember, he did one where it was, uh, universities are a bubble.\nYeah, right.\nHe went on a whole tour of that, and then he launched the Thiel Fellowship underneath it, and he did one which was, \"Competition is for losers,\" and he has these, like, slogans, almost like marketing slogans, \"Competition for losers.\"\nThen he launched Zero to One, his book that was all about how to build a monopoly, and he did one with when Trump first ran, he was like, you know, and for founders, went they had... we wanted flying cars, but all we got was 140 characters.\nNow, Peter did not write that line.\nIn fact, what my friend told me is that Peter actually kind of, like, has a guy who follows him around that's listening to all of Peter's thoughts and then sort of workshopping his bits, like a comedian would, like a polit... like a politician speech writers would.\nAnd they actually, like, craft the message, and they write it out, and they basically get him prepped for media.\nHe's not showing up and just winging it, and because maybe he's not that great at winging it.\nUh, David Rubenstein does the same thing that, you know, I know David actually has a even a larger team because he does the show and he does the TV show and he obviously with Carlo and stuff.\nSo, I don't necessarily have a writer per se.\nI do have people that kind of remind me of, like, hey, like, remember that, like, this is kind of the direction.\nI'll give you best example: earnings calls.\nI meet with my... my Jeff Hoffmeister, amazing, our amazing CFO.\nCome out with Jeff and our IR team, and I'm like, \"All right, what are the three or four things that, like, that we want to... we want to say,\" and then I basically take it and and I, I, you know, hardly arise it.\nI make it sound like me.\"\nSo, could you give an example?\nSo, an example is, like, u... we want to get... we want to be on Roblox or something.\nSo, on the Roblox thing, it's really about the fact that Shopify is no longer just an e-commerce company.\nWe're the commerce everywhere company.\nOkay.\nRight.\nAnd that's what's important.\nSo, I'm using Roblox as effectively a proxy for explaining that you may not necessarily, you know, want to sell in Roblox if you're selling hand sanitizer, but if you... if you're selling another product and your audience spends time in Roblox or or in some sort of in in the metaverse, you may want to access it by being on Shopify.\nYou are default selling everywhere.\nRight.\nRight.\nThe story isn't we're on Roblox.\nThe story is we're now the e-commerce... we're now the commerce everywhere.\nWe're also on Pinterest and Instagram.\nWe... there's... there's literally a Spotify... a Shopify for Spotify channel where you can actually, if you... if you a large... if you're Beyonce and you have an artist profile like the size of Beyonce, you can sell Sacred, which is her cosmetic line on Shopify inside of her artist pro, and rumors are you're going to be on on chat.\nThat's rumors.\nYeah, we're not going to go there today, but, but exactly.\nWe want to be wherever you, you, you effectively have consumers.\nSo, earnings was three weeks ago, and I... I love earnings.\nI... I go... I do my earnings call.\nI then do my analyst calls, and then I do my media tour.\nIn this case, I did... I did TBTN, uh, which, which I think those guys are killing it.\nI did CNBC.\nI did some Bloomberg stuff.\nI noticed that there were a bunch of other, uh, companies that because I listen to earnings calls a couple days before and a couple days after just to kind of hear the tonality of the reporters and the journalists, but also of of the executives, and Sebastian from... I think is it Clara or something?\nHe basically came out... I think it was Sebastian, um, and he said, \"Hey, I'm... I...\" after his earnings call, the whole thing was done by AI that actually... was it wasn't even him.\nIt was basically an AI emulating his voice, and that's who did his earnings call, and it it made a splash.\nThere were a couple articles about it.\"\nAnd so I listened to it.\nI was like, \"Yeah, like, that's like a, a five out of 10.\"\nAnd maybe you can say it's a six or seven out of 10 because he saved a lot of time, and so it was effective.\nBut there was zero, in my view, there was zero personality to it.\nAnd then I watch a bunch of other kind of quote-unquote professional executives that were that did their earnings calls, like the PNG guys, for example, or the folks over at Best Buy, and I listen to their earnings calls, and I'm like, yeah, they... they sound like they're reading a script.\nIf you go back... you don't have to do this, but if you go back and listen to Shopify's earnings calls, you'll hear things like, \"Okay, I know what I just said, and I know you think that's surprising.\nI'm going to repeat it again because it's really important,\" and I'll use voice inflection, and I'll use repetition, and it doesn't... and and what I've... and what I hear back from it's... it's like theater.\nWhat I hear back from both analysts and investors is that they find our earnings calls to be so much more interesting because what they actually hear is our personality.\nThey hear the passion in my voice for... we give a [ __ ] about this stuff, too.\nAnd and I... so I... I think that there is, um, there's probably a right balance where you have people around you that are giving you sort of the macro things, but like, if I start talking like Peter Thiel, I'm... it's not authentic, and therefore I don't think it'll be as effective.\nAnd so I think there's a balance that I'm trying to find.\nAnd and so I... I, you know, I've been... I've done 40 earnings calls.\nNow, the balance I have is, tell me what are the most important things that we need to hit, and then let me kind of find my own way of of negotiating it into the call.\nRight.\nI like that you like study the game film of the other earnings calls.\nThat, that was what I was looking for, that like kind of that extra that you go to that others... others.\nThere are people that... I mean, Benny Off is fantastic at it.\nDo you... uh... so Toby came out with this, like, memo that was like, uh, \"Hey, it is a baseline expectation.\"\nHe didn't come out...\n\n\nWith it. It was leaked. But yes, yeah, it was leaked. I always assumed those are like intentionally leaked. I, I would have intentionally leaked that if I was him. I think in hindsight some of these things when they do get leaked, you're like, you know, for better, for worse kind of thing. But yes, but the point is in it he was basically like, \"Yo, AI is a expectation based on expectation. You got to learn these tools. The way to the way to get good at them is to use them a bunch and you got to start solving problems using this.\" Um, was the general ethos. I'm curious you personally, Harley, day-to-day, what's your AI usage? Are you like, you know, a lot, a little, just ChatGBT, other tools? Like, what are you actually personally just using either professionally or personally in your personal life?\n\nTwo things. One is, I mean, I use ChatGBT. I really like the fact that now it's, um, like I like the history side of it. So, for example, like back to sort of longevity, every time I get a blood test, I upload it to ChatGBT in a folder called longevity and health, and so now I can ask questions. Although I do find if I say like, \"I had a blood test last week, I uploaded a new one, I said compare this to my last one,\" and it compared it to one from three, like, like a long time ago, and I was able to spot it. So, it's not 100%, but I like using that quite a bit too. Um, I, I gave a keynote at summit last week. I literally fed my entire keynote script into ChatDBT and I said, \"Hey, and what parts of these do you think are confusing, if any? Like, where am I, where am I losing the thread here?\" So I think that I use ChatGBT and particularly 03, um, the 03 model on a daily basis, sort of like, you know, on my, like I have two screens here, so based on my screen next to me, I always have that open. I really like Claude for other projects. So for investing, for example, um, you know, Lind, my wife and I do a little bit of investing. We own some apartment buildings, so I have a file for real estate, which is every time I get an update from the property management company, I feed it in. I find Claude is much better for analyzing existing documents. I find that ChatGBT is much better for sort of reaching out into the public sphere, like the web, and bringing things in together. Those are the two I, I use the most. Um, and then back to sort of the earnings calls. One of the things we did was we basically made all of Shopify legible and we built like about a dozen MCPs inside of Shopify. So, usually in preparation for an earnings call, I will go to, let's say I want to talk about like Shopify Capital. I'll go, um, let's say I want to talk about like we, we launched it in in the UK. So, let's say I want to go, I want to talk about that in the earnings call. I'll go to the capital leader and say, \"Hey, give me a couple of the highlights for UK. It's a new one for us. I want to talk about how it's going.\" This time I just went to the vault and literally went into like cap the capital program because everything is legible. I was able to pull most of the data on my own.\n\nThe personal jury is still out whether or not I'm miss because when I talk to the leader of capital, I get some of the nuances and I'm like, \"Oh, you just said this sort of thing,\" and like, I actually, I'm going to take that and run with that even though it wasn't, you didn't intentionally mean to leak it to me or tell it to me. Um, whereas using basically like the Shopify vault, which is where we I'm able to access all this data through the MCPs, I, I find that I'm basically getting a lot of headline stuff. But I, I do want to make one point. One of the things that that got missed on Toby's, on Toby's memo now or the email now is that there was a term he used that I'm surprised more people haven't picked up on, which is like AI, like, like being reflexive. And part of what he's trying to get the company to do is to be reflexive about the usage of AI, so that rather than sort of make it a sort of, \"I'm, I have a project and now like I'm, I'm working on my own, oh, you know what, I should also use AI and see what I can get from ChatGBT or Claude or Anthropic or something like that,\" or, um, complexity, the this idea of making it reflexively part of our day-to-day work is really what he was trying to do. And in fact, so much so that he created this like this new friction, which is before you can go and hire someone on your team, you first sub have to substantiate to Shopify, to the hiring manager, to the talent team why AI cannot do it better. And one of the things we're noticing there is by actually creating this like friction of saying like, \"Before you go and hire, you must first do it,\" what ends up happening is people by the end of substantiating why they need to hire someone that AI can't do, realize that they actually should have AI can do a bunch of that as well. That is very different than what you're hearing, I think, in most companies, which is, \"Let's just use AI as part of our, you know, if I have to design something in Figma or in Canva, I'm going to use AI to help with that.\" This idea of it being reflexive is sort of what we're trying to do.\n\nI like that a lot. That's cool. That's a, that's a great little nuance, um, and and sort of tactic. You know, I like these sort of either incentives or systems where you do one thing, but it has all these downstream impacts. Like right now people are talking about the US, like, \"Oh, the deficit's so crazy.\" And Buffett has always said this thing. He's like, \"Oh, simple. I could solve the deficit in 2 minutes. Here you go. If we run a deficit over 3%, nobody gets to keep their job in Congress.\" That's right. Watch. Watch what happens. I mean, that is you get to do that at at companies. I mean, back to like the phase of the company at at the phase of size and and scale of our company, we get to do stuff at at this crazy scale. So simply by adding, you know, a simple friction on hiring that says, \"First substantiate it,\" you actually see incredible results. Then you can evaluate. You can literally say like, \"Okay, well, how has hiring changed since that that that email was leaked? How has hiring changed since we added that friction thing?\" It's very difficult to actually see the efficacy of all these things when you're 10 people.\n\nWell, you look really healthy and you have a lot of energy. I'm curious. You said you got curious and kind of interested in biohacking, longevity. You're on a kick right now. What's got your interest? What have you, what are you doing that's maybe, uh, uh, you feel is is either interesting or working for you or you're enjoying it? Just give us kind of like a quick health dump.\n\nSo, I sort of divide into two buckets, which is like, \"I'm going to die of one of two ways. I'm going to either die because of cancer or I'm going to die because of heart attack.\" And so, the cancer thing, um, it's not easy, but Prenova does a lot of that heavy lifting for me, or at least I'm 41 now, so I'm now getting to the point where I'm taking a lot more seriously. So, once a year, and there's Prenova is not the only one. Um, I like it a lot. I like it so much that I actually invested in the company. My wife and I invested in the company a couple of years ago. Um, I think the way they do it, I think the way the technology is moving, the fact that here's a very simple thing. A lot of people don't like going into these full body body MRIs because they get claustrophobic.\n\nSo a small, you know, um, I guess part of the product of Prenova is you put on these glasses that have these mirrors and the mirrors go backwards into a screen and I watch like the most, you know, funloving light show that I can find. For me, that's Seinfeld. So, I am also some not claustrophobic, but I don't, I don't, I don't want to stay in something like that for a long time. Dude, when I went in, I watched Top Gun. I was like, \"Oh, what's a movie I should have watched, but I never did.\" I just watched Top Top. So, I did the, I'm like, \"I, I do not want to be stressed out. I don't want to be scared.\" I watch the Zodiac Killer documentary on Netflix. It was great. You, I mean, that speaks volumes about your both your personalities. Um, I watched like Seinfeld and so, so I, so that sort of takes you on the cancer side on the cardiovascular stuff. I'm, I'm, I just did clearly, a clearly scan, which basically looks at blockages. So what I'm trying to do, what I did initially was I just got a baseline of like, \"Where am I at right now?\" The reason I like Prenova each year is because I basically can look over time how things are changing. If I have like a benign cyst on my on my liver, is it growing year-over-year now? At least I can monitor that stuff too. So I to me those are the two main buckets. Um, and then I just try to do these like, um, these massojis is like one thing every year that scares the [ __ ] out of me. And the thing I really like right now is called 29029.\n\nAnd Jesse Jessler's thing, Jesse's uh, he's done an amazing job. Him and Mark, who's his partner, co-founder, they've created this incredible thing that effectively allows you to climb Everest, but you can do it from like Colorado. In my case, I do it in Quebec. I do it in Mont Tremblant. You can do it in Vermont. But they created this incredible thing that allows you not to have to travel to Everest on Mount Everest. And you actually can do it. And so I've been doing this. This was my second year doing it. And I and I like doing it not just because of the like high five. It's cool to to to climb to emulate climbing Everest, but I like the idea of getting really scared that I'm going to fail at it and therefore I train much harder. And so my workouts actually are much better because I'm so scared of failing at this 29 29 thing. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nDude, how, how many, uh, last question, how many, um, how many companies in the world are bigger than Shopify? You guys are worth, uh, it looks like 153 today or so or whatever, 130. You've been as high as 134 rounded down by 20 billion. Just want to casual, casual.\n\nWhat's crazy is like, you're worth, you're worth 134.56 billion. Like change that 56 to like a 55 and like that's like life-changing. You know what I mean? It's kind of crazy for sure. No, it's, it's wild. I let me, let me, let me one more call out for if you are listening to this and you are a company that actually like, you know, you understand your business well, you see growth, growth potential, like this idea of of avoiding the public markets w is is insanely silly to me. It's been an incredible 40, 40 quarters in now. It's been like an incredible journey for us. It makes us a better company. It allows I think the people that use Shopify find more confident. I mean, now we have companies like Hunter Douglas and Mattel and Birkenstocks using Shopify. Like I think you, I think one of the things they love about it as a product is that like being publicly traded provides some sense of stability.\n\nWell, what I was going to say was I, I looked it up on Chat GPT. So, uh, there are probably 120 companies in the world bigger than you, which means of all the companies that have ever been started, uh, of all the companies that are out there right now and probably in the history, given that like today's companies are bigger than everyone else, you are in like the top 150. It's pretty astounding. And I think that like if there was a ratio of like somehow most relatable or like for some reason when I talk to you, I'm like, \"He's just one of, he's like one of us almost.\"\n\nAs we're friends. [ __ ] He's not one of us. Damn it. And then I like see this and then I see the stats and I'm like, \"He's so good at his job that he's tricked me into thinking that he's relatable.\"\n\nWhat do you mean? You know me personally. We like, I think I said this at the beginning, right? I, I was guest 118. We are not the same, my friend. We are not. We are the same. Uh, and now you had over 750 of them. Um, we, we are not the same. And and but if there were a ratio of like, I feel like I could do whatever he's done to approachability to market cap ratio, you are, you get the gold medal.\n\nI think that's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.\n\nSam, you, you know what's one of the best things, uh, I did after that first podcast is basically every year for the last 5 years, I take about 20% of whatever my profits are out of my Shopify store and I just buy Shopify stock. Oh wow. That alone I think has compounded as good or better as my actual ecom brand, cuz now my earnings are growing, whereas like if I just reinvested it in the business, you know, not every business you can reinvest 100% of your your your profits back into. And so just that one little habit, uh, has been very, very helpful for me.\n\nWell, that means a lot to me. It's actually really neat. I get to, we're doing this thing called childhood milestones. Like basically it's, it's our version of like the Emmys or the the Oscars for for actors or the Grammys for musicians. We give these milestone awards. You guys have probably seen them around. This is the 10,000 one. So, we go on for 10,000 orders, 100,000, and a million. We got a bone to pick. Y'all are so slow. I got my milestone, but I'm already on the next order of magnitude. Like, this is so slow. How, how you guys set these out? I mean, these are heavy. We got to like ship them out and stuff. There's a lot of people. But anyways, so I get to, I deliver a bunch of mileston excuse. They're heavy. Yeah. Um, so you, you need to get to a million first and I'll deliver your million one, Shaan. But I meet these people when I deliver them. And often what I hear is not only like, obviously they built their business on Shopify, but many of them, you know, like they, they, they're also shareholders, which I think is a unbel\n\n\nUnbelievable endorsement as like, you know, it's one thing to use the product and build your business on it, but then also to invest your, you know, your hard-earned money into.\n\nTo be clear, not an endorsement, just a recovery of fees is what I was looking for.\n\nOkay, I'm paying you guys this money.\n\nI want to get it back in the...\n\nYou made it sound way less romantic than I did, just kind of...\n\nLet's be real here, dude.\n\nThanks for coming on, man.\n\nDude, this is great.\n\nYou guys are the best.\n\n[Music]\n",
