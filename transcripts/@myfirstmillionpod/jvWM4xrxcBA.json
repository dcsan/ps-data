  "cleanText": "Dude, manifest is out. There's a new word.\n\nUh, what?\n\nGenerative.\n\nWait, is high agency? Are we selling high agency?\nWe're selling high agency at the top right now.\nWe're spacking high agency.\nIt's gone. Taking that cash and we're plowing it into generators.\n\n[Music]\n\nAll right. What I miss? How was the week?\n\nWeek was good. Uh, what did we do?\nWe had Chris Corner. That episode's popped off. It's over 100K on YouTube, so that's going well. And uh, dude, there were so many replies to one idea that was in that episode. I don't know if you listened to the episode, the golfing one.\n\nThe golfing one, dude. I got literally hundreds of replies of people who are like, I could do this right here in my hometown. People are sending PowerPoint decks. People are doing driveby, sending me videos of the link where they think they could do it. They're reaching out cold. It's very intense. Uh, how many people have replied to this now where golf and what was the idea? Was it about betting as to where you could hit it?\n\nNo. So, basically on the way there's a place in New Zealand on the way to the golf course. Kind of side of the road. There's like there's a road that's driving by a body of water. And if you just stop on the side of the road, there's this thing called like whatever the hole in one challenge and you buy a bucket of balls and you go to try to hit this hole in one of this little golf hole that's floating out, you know, 100 yards away in the water. If you hit if you get it, you get 10 grand. And so it's just like a fun thing for you to do with your buddies like on the way or to or from a golf course. And he was talking about like, you know, sort of napkin mathing what he thinks it's making based off of the available information. He's like, I think this thing does like 300 to 500k, you know, in revenue. And, you know, the costs are pretty marginal. It's like person standing there with an iPad. Uh they there's a scuba diver that goes in once a week and fishes out the balls. Like that's it. And so people got we and we we basically said, \"Hey, I think this idea could work at more places than just this random roadside thing in New Zealand. Let's bring this to life. And who wants to do this? And a lot of people have come come out and so we're going to we're going to make it a MFM project. We're going to see what we can do with this.\n\nSo like all the comments were like this is what I've been missing with MFM because like we started a lot with that and then like our interests have grown and so the content has grown to be or evolved to be a little bit different sometimes. And one critique is like um uh what is this My First Million because we talk about like uh like you know bigger ideas and um I was thinking I uh you know we've become um acquaintances with Joe Londale who uh because of this podcast who's worth I don't know billions some amount of billions and I was uh with him recently by the way if you need to pick that up let me know if you need to pick up that that name drop. Uh did I drop did I drop that somewhere here? Did I drop that name drop somewhere? Uh, no. But he uh and he was telling me like, \"Oh, man.\" Or I was with him when I got my Twitter check. Like, do you know how you get like Twitter money now? Like you're like, for example, I for some reason my Twitter was $1,000 last payment. And uh like the month before it was like $600. And I was like, \"Man, this is crazy. I just got paid $600 for tweeting, which is insane.\" He's like, \"Yeah, I got like $400.\" And he was joking about how it feels uh just as exciting every once in a while to get like a $400 thing than it does however much money he's created in his lifetime. And I was wondering, do you feel like when you're talking about these things like you just lit up when you talked about $300 $400,000 when that may or may not I mean I don't think so. That's not going to really move the needle for you in your life. Um but it's kind of exciting, isn't it?\n\nYeah. Not because of the money. It's just I think it's awesome. Uh, I think the idea the idea itself is fun. Making it happen sounds like it's going to be fun. You know, actually I was just uh watching um an interview with a guy who they the NBA finals just ended. They had game seven, the Thunder one, and there was- I watched it. I watched it. There was this interview with one of the guys. So they they asked JD, they're like, you know, when you look back on this year, what's the one what are you going to remember? What what were the high points? And he goes he's like, it's weird, dude. He's like, I remember if you think if I think about this year, he's like, I remember me and Chad, we would go to our hotel room. We would do film sessions back when he was coming back back from injury to get it going or like these team dinners that we were having. He's like, I couldn't even tell. He's like, I don't even remember what happened last series. Like I don't remember in the the recent games what happened, but those kind of like those inputs on the journey are like just like are so vivid to me. And this has been a very common thing where if you talk to pro players after their career is done and you're like, \"What do you miss the most?\" And you expect them to be like the big pressure moments, the those big games. And of course, they do like those, but the thing they talk about always is the team bus rides, the locker room, the it's all of the like camaraderie stuff that happens along the way. It's like the kind of the buildup is the stuff that they miss the most. And um I think I think there's that for entrepreneurship, too. Uh, I think there's that that's a huge amount of the fun of it and it's what you get excited about. You need the number to sort of justify it. The the number gives you some air cover for why you're acting like a little kid. You're so excited about something. The numbers help because why are you taking this silly thing so seriously, but uh I think we would probably all do it without the numbers as well or if the numbers were half as much or whatever.\n\nYeah. And I've noticed the best the the the people who love MFM the most and the guests who you and I love the most are folks who um uh you know I hung out with a friend of mine um and she was like cuz she was from a bad neighborhood now she's rich. She's like you know I'm so good at going really high and going really low. I was like what's that mean? She's like I could hang out with like my homies from where I grew up and we could just like shoot the [ __ ] and kind of be a little like hood ratty or I can go hang out with a billionaire and I could I love that too. I can I have so much joy doing that as well and I can blend in and get along with everyone and I think that's like the that's like what the pot is is like you like talking about these smaller things as well as the big things and it's the same type of person who loves both.\n\nYeah. Exactly. Also, do you think about business as like a sport? because that's more and more become my mental model is the way that because I you you meet people and a lot of people we know have now become successful but they're still doing it and obviously for many of them I I call it they've already made the last dollar they'll ever spend right let's say you make $30 million at that point you've already earned the last dollar you'll ever need to spend especially once you take into account that that 30 million could just sit in a whether whether it's a simple interest bearing account or the S&P 500 and it'll just it'll double every seven years. So 30 becomes 60, 60 becomes 120, 120 becomes 240. And that just all happened over the course of you know something like 25 years and so you've you don't need to go earn the next dollar but why do they anyways? And part of it is I think it feels good to be good at something and if you're good at something it's hard to stop doing it because the feedback loop of being good at something is strong. But I think in that same way, if you think about business not as a mechanism to make money, but as a sport, as uh as a sport you play, then it's like, oh, of course, just cuz you're great at tennis and you won a tournament doesn't mean you'll stop playing tennis. Why would you do that? That's your sport. You love to play the sport. You'll basically play the sport till your body breaks down and doesn't let you play the sport anymore. And it feels good to manifest. It feels good to have an idea and to see it in the real into reality. And it's really fun flexing that muscle.\n\nManifest is out. There's a new word.\n\nUh what?\n\nGenerative.\n\nGenerative. What does that mean?\n\nThis This is This has happened a few times to me now. I uh agency. Are we selling high agency?\nWe're selling high agency at the top right now.\nWe're spacking high agency. It's gone. Taking that cash and we're plowing it into generative.\n\nOkay. So, generative.\nI was on a podcast and I was like at the end I was like, \"How was that?\" And you could tell me the truth cuz I do podcasts all the time with guests. I know it's sometimes hit or miss. Like, give me the from one podcaster to another. What was that like for you? And he's like, \"It was great because you're extremely generative.\" He goes, \"What?\" And he goes, \"It was also hard because you're extremely generative.\" I go, \"What does that mean?\" He goes, \"I'll say two things. Like I'll give you one topic, but you can almost like bloom that or expand that into like a story, a framework, a this, a related idea, a simple example. You just generated all that content off the cuff right away.\" And he goes, you know, biology is like that. Biology is extremely generative. you give him one thing and he's able to like take it from like the origin of man to, you know, the 100 years in the future and he can connect all those dots. So, I heard it once and I was like, \"Okay, that's cool. I don't know if I just got insulted or complimented being called generative, but I'll take it.\" And then James Courier said the same thing. He goes, he's like, he's like, \"The reason we get along is because we're both extremely generative.\" He's like, \"We like being around generative people.\" And he's like, \"You know, why do we admire Elon? It's not cuz he's rich. It's because he's the most generative of all of us, right? And he's the least fearful and that's why he's able to be more generative. He's he's like he literally generates businesses like the Boring Company and Neurolink and SpaceX and Tesla. He's like he's generating kids. He's generating ideas. He generates a president. He gener he's just doing so much. And that's admirable to somebody who is generative. And so I started using that little lens. I started looking at people being like how generative is this person? Meaning if you give them an inch, could they take a mile? And what is their overall level of output in their life? you know like how generative are they with like for example James Courier it's not just businesses he's generating he you know at one point he also started a church in San Francisco he like started a new religion and you know then he created this uh like sort of incubator this fund then he created a podcast he's just constantly creating things because he's extremely generative and it whether it's with his kids life or it's his business life or whatever so I started to realize oh yeah I'm really attracted to that I like people who are like that and I I I want to be like that and figure out a way to make that work is um is a fun challenge. And so generative is the new word.\n\nHey, I got a quick break cuz I want to tell you something cool. So, our sponsor for this episode is HubSpot, but instead of the ad telling you about HubSpot, they just want to do something that's useful for you. So, they did some research and they found that a bunch of people in our community uh have side hustles. They start a business on the side, they get it going, and then it becomes their main hustle over time. And so, instead of just telling you about the features of HubSpot, they wanted to give you something that will be useful for your side hustle. And so they have put together a database of AI prompts. So things that you could put into chat GBT or your favorite AI tool that will help you with your side hustle. So check it out. It's going to save you a bunch of time. I think it's a um prompt database that you should be using to uh make your side hustle more successful and you could use this as your little personal little cheat sheet, your tool set to be a better operator with your side hustle. So you can either scan this QR code that's on the screen or get the link in the description to get the AI prompt database. All right, back to the show.\n\nHave you ever heard of this book called The Inner Game of Tennis?\n\nI've heard of it, but I've never read it. Is it good?\n\nYes.\n\nWho Who's the pro Who is it about?\n\nOkay, so The Inner Game of Tennis, I randomly discovered it because I was at the airport and I was just looking for a book to read on my Kindle and I wanted something short and I for some reason feel like I'm in a bookstore looking for books to download separately.\n\nNo, like I I don't remember what I was just like I think like I was on Amazon on my phone and like a sports psychology book came up and I was like okay that's intriguing. What are what's\n\n\nLike the top sports psychology book there is or something like that, and I randomly came across *The Inner Game of Tennis*. It's about, uh, it's written by a guy named Timothy Gallwey, and it's one of these books that it's about life, and it just uses tennis as the analogy. The premise of the book is that you have two selves. Self one is your person. So, like when you say, like, um, uh, when you're playing tennis and you hit, you do a bad hit, you go, \"Uh, why do I suck so much?\" Or like, like that is self one, the critical self. And then self two is like your animalistic self who doesn't, um, who doesn't uh, think too much, and it's just your body. And that learns by observing. And it's all about how to be generative, uh, and by by ignoring self one and letting self two do all the work. And it gives you all of these tips and tricks on how to listen to self two. And this sounds very woowoo. Uh, and it is a little bit woowoo, but the book was written in the 1970s. And the coach of the Seahawks writes the forward. What's his name? Pete Carroll.\nPete Carol.\nYeah.\nAnd like every new edition, they still are like they're still releasing new editions where all these like who's who of leaders are writing about it. And I think I I didn't realize it, but after I started reading, I was like, \"Oh, wait. Tim Ferriss talked about this book as one of his favorite books of all time.\" And I've been reading it a whole lot, and it applies very much to business. I think it's only a 150-page book. I've been reading, um, I'm almost done. I read it in like two days.\nThe the it's very similar or very applicable to business, which is what you said about Elon of He's not fearful and things like that. This book actually gives you like a set of frameworks and a way to communicate to yourself in order to not be fearful when you are coming up with new ideas. This is incredibly fascinating.\nDude, this is awesome. I love this type of book. It says *The Inner Game of Tennis*, the classic guide to peak performance. Introduction by Bill Gates and a forward by Pete Carroll. Isn't that crazy? I didn't know that that I didn't I don't have I don't have the Bill Gates one, so I didn't know that. So, he wrote the the introduction. That's wild.\nAnd so, have you used any of this or give me like has it have you found a way to kind of apply any of these yet?\nWell, so like a very simple example is like for lifting weights or for going for a run. When you lift weights, you're like, \"Okay, I have to lift this weight for three times, and it's the heaviest weight that I've ever done, so I'm really scared.\" You don't listen to that at all. And instead, you just get under and you go, \"I'm going to let self two do all the work. I'm going to trust self, too. And if I fail, I will not be judgmental. I'm not going to say, you suck. Instead, I will say, uh, you know, your knee moved in a strange way.\" So, I'm just going to objectively acknowledge what's happening. And then I put and then I when I want to lift three times, I get it up on me and I just observe the weight on me and I only go for one rep and I be like, \"All right, how does that feel?\" Self two. Let's just do the second rep. So I basically am talking to myself sort of like an objective machine, not an emotional person. So the whole I'm fearful, I'm fearful, I'm fearful. You just set that aside and you go, it's self time. There is no room for that. It is only room for uh objectiveness.\nAll right. And I did something similar to this in this in this vein that I didn't even plan to talk about, but I'll just tell you this cuz I think it's it's kind of similar. So, one thing I noticed is anytime I go into a project, uh, you know, I obviously have a lot of excitement and have a lot of hope at the beginning. Correct? That's obvious. And then the second obvious thing is that I'm going to hit some sort of obstacles, walls, plateaus, something that I don't want to happen is for sure going to happen. I've never once experienced a project that I just simply started, everything went as planned, and it had a happy ending. Like, that's literally just never happened. For me to expect that to happen would honestly be a little bit foolish. It's like, why would I think that that was the case? Yet, at the same time, as soon as I hit those obstacles and those walls, I'm like, [ __ ] Like, I wish this didn't happen. I don't want this happen. Why is this happening? And I waste all this energy on something that was inevitable. It's like playing Mario and being like, \"Oh my god, I can't believe these Goombas are walking at me.\" It's like, dude, that's the game. Like, what what do you mean? Like, you wanted to play this game without anybody like trying to bite you? You know, I don't I don't understand what you thought this was going to be. And so, recently, I was doing a project and um last week I wrote out a thing in advance. I'm just going to kind of read you this. So, I basically wrote like a a simple letter to self for like two months down the road. And by the way, three months down the road, according to Tim, according to *The Inner Game of Tennis*, when you have that feeling, you don't you do not judge it as positive or negative. You say, \"Now this is a challenge.\" Okay, noted. And then you just keep going. Do you know what I mean? There is no why like this is horrible. This is awful. Why me? That that that there are no emotions. You do not judge.\nYou're saying you don't judge the the emotion you're feel, judge yourself for feeling it, or you don't judge the thing?\nBoth. So you uh you you only objectively acknowledge it. So you say like uh so the ball was out. Okay.\nRight.\nNoted the uh the ball was hit too hard. And then you're you trust self too to adjust. But you don't you you know what I'm saying? You do not acknowledge or judge it as I hate this. I suck. This is bad. It just the ball was out.\nSo I'm just going to give you a little sense of how I wrote this. So I was like I was like, \"Hey, it's me from the future. I'm writing I'm writing this to you 3 months from now. First congrats. thing you did so good turned out amazing. I'm really proud of you slash me.\" Uh, and I said this is a letter that is guiding you to some of the entirely predictable upcoming road bumps that are headed your way. Um, not only is it predictable that there will be road bumps, I could probably tell you right now what they're going to be, right? Cuz like that's true. So for example, I was thinking about this isn't what I was doing, but just to make it a simple example, let's say you're trying to hire a head of sales. There's some entirely predict, like you know you want to do it. you know, you'll you'll be able to do it, but there's some entirely predictable road bumps, which is like um, you know, you're probably gonna procrastinate starting it a little bit because it's the idea of finding that perfect person is a little bit hard and you might put it off a little bit. Then then you'll talk to some candidates who are disappointing. You may even run into a candidate who's really great, but the offer doesn't work out. Maybe maybe they don't take it. Maybe it's not the right time in their life, etc., etc. So, you could basically upfront tell yourself, \"Yeah, these four obstacles are probably going to be here. I've played this level of the game before or I could just see what's what's coming. And so when they come, it takes the emotional edge off of it because it's like, yeah, I know. There's no I don't feel betrayed by this. I don't feel surprised by this. Like I I knew you were coming.\nSay hello to it.\nHere you are. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.\nAnd I I also had already kind of thought about like what I would do to get around that before it hits me and I'm in like an emotional state. So it's like, yeah, I'm probably gonna meet a bunch of people who are kind of disappointing. And it'll probably feel in the moment like, \"God, am I ever going to find somebody great?\" But of course, I will. I only need one and it's a numbers game and I I should probably just expect that I'm going to talk to about, you know, 30 to 40 people and that 25 of those people are going to be truly just a waste of time. Uh, you know, in terms of the interview, but that's okay. That's so that's part of the process. And you tell yourself that up front and then as it's happening, you're like, \"Yeah, well, I already I already addressed this. I don't need to like react to it again because I already kind of pre-reacted to the whole thing.\"\nAnd what uh is this project that you're doing like big or like do you recommend doing this for a small thing or only a big thing?\nI don't know. This is my first time actually doing like the corny step of like writing it out to myself. I'm like, \"Dear Shaan.\" Um\nYeah. And then it's like, \"PS, you're pretty [ __ ] lame. Write this.\"\nYeah, exactly. I was like, \"All right, that's three pages now.\" This was cool when it was a paragraph.\nUm I think it was it was very helpful. I will do it again. Um, I will I will do it again. I I mean, I don't know how much this actually like it doesn't it sort of blunts the pain, but the pain's still there. You know what I mean? It's like when you get a shot at the doctor, it's like if you really are looking at it and hyperfixated on it and you start hyperventilating about it. Yeah. It's kind of a worse experience. If you look away, you might still feel a little prick, but you know, you took the edge off of it. I think that's what this has done for me.\nI have um All right, so we're talking about like big and small. Do you want me to tell you about a small thing and a big idea that are to me are equally fascinating?\nOkay.\nGo to patronview.com.\nSo, I was with Nick Gray this weekend. So, I did this amazing vacation where my friend David owns a home in Utah and about eight of us or maybe six of us plus our spouses and our kids all went and hung out and uh it was amazing and Nick was there and I was looking at his computer and I said, \"Nick, what are you doing?\" He goes, \"Let me tell you.\" And it was very fascinating. And so it's called Patron View, uh, patronview.com. And so Nick used to own this service called Museum Hack where it was kind of amazing that it existed, but you would pay $100 and Nick or one of his tour guides would take you to uh the Met and give you a sort of gorilla uh tour of the um of the museum. And it was amazing. And so that's where he got really into museums. and he became buddies somehow or somehow got um uh in with the guys who do the fundraising. And because he's a business person, he was like, \"Oh, wow. It's so fascinating that one person is donating a million dollars, $10 million, $20 million to these museums and they do it every year into tons of different museum museums. That's really amazing.\" And so recently with a mutual buddy Stson Blake, they built this website where it's pretty amazing where all he did was if you go to the Met or one of a dozen or hundreds of other museums, they every year they have to put out a PDF that explains who donated money and how much money that person donated. And so he's aggregated all of them, hundreds or maybe even thousands. And he used AI to upload all of them into a database. So, if you are fundraising for a museum, I believe, if I had to guess, you're going to be able to pay his service money to find out who the whales are, you know, whatever. And it's crazy that because of AI, he was able to make this, he told me, uh, for $2,000.\nI'm just going to read the about page. It says, uh, \"We're a research platform dedicated to documenting cultural philanthropy.\" I've never actually heard that before, which is just shows how like much of a noob I am about philanthropy, but that makes sense. So people who donate to things that are about culture. And then it says we're and then it says the data. \"Our research is pulling from annual reports, 990 tax filings, institutional publications, official documents, and proprietary sources. This lets us present donor information that's never before displayed. We like to think of it as celebrating philanthropy and enabling development departments.\"\nPretty cool, right?\nAwesome.\nIt's great, right? Like I was I was like, \"Nick, what's your deal here? Like you want to turn this into a business?\" And he's very Nick is happy. Like he's not looking for anything. He's like, \"I don't know. I'm just tinkering.\" And in my head, as someone who is probably less uh, you know, uh, content than him, I was like, \"Oh, man.\" Like, \"Nick, you could do this. You could do this. You could do this.\" And that's like how the entire conversation came about. But isn't this pretty cool that he's like building this and this is his hobby. And the fact that AI has made this so easy.\nYeah, dude. This is great. I mean, Nick, I've already, you know, really shouted him out on here a ton of times because he's somebody who's made a big impact on me just seeing the way this guy rolls through life. I'm like, he just does things for his own amusement. He does things on his terms and I think he does things\n\n\nWith high intentionality, and he doesn't seem, and he basically resisted the rat race. I think those are the people I admire the most of all: the people that resisted the rat race. Like, I think he neither chases money nor status. Um, and if you think about the people who are talented and successful in your life, how many do you think actually truly are resisting money and status? It's very, very few. I know probably two people: him and Jack Smith.\nYeah, it's pretty crazy. And so, you just sort of watch their moves, and then you look at them, and, you know, you can kind of learn from them. So, this is this is extremely cool. And what's funny about Nick is every two or three years or something like that, he likes to uh find a publicly traded company that he loves, and he'll make a big bet on it. And right now, his, or for the past probably four or five years actually, his bet has been Cloudflare. Like, for some reason, I don't know, he's got all this analysis. He like loves it to the point where, like, when he hosted an event, he specifically hosted his event in the Cloudflare uh event space because he's like so loyal, and he'll wear Cloudflare t-shirts, whatever. Um, like one time there was a race, uh, like a 5K or a marathon through Austin, and he'll like hold up a sign that says like, \"Cloudflare rules,\" like just 'cause he went.\nYou told me, like, at his birthday party, he had his birthday party at the Cloudflare office, and then midway through the birthday party, he ran upstairs and got like two, like, like a product manager to come down and be like, \"Hey everybody, quick word from Jack from the marketing department. Why don't you just tell us about the great things you got going on at Cloudflare?\" The guy's like, \"Uh, yeah.\" So, you know, and before, and before he brought that guy in, he goes, \"I need everyone to treat Jack from Cloudflare like a celebrity.\" And so, when he walked in, we go, \"Oh my god, is that Jack? Are you the VP of engineering at Cloudflare? Oh my god. He's here. He's here.\"\nThe stock is the stock is up 400% in the last five years. So, he's done pretty well.\nHe's done well. And if you click the about page, I know for a fact. So, he lists an area that says technology. Patron View is built with modern web tech to ensure fast, reliable access to data. And he only did that so he could list that he uses Cloudflare. I know that's exactly how he thought. Um, but the reason I'm bringing this up is I think that if you're like just starting to build a business or something, you should follow Patron View, or like go there, like go there once a week, and I, and I would bet that you're going to see, like, it evolve, like, uh, you know, it's sort of like measuring your kid on the wall. Like, you're going to see like the measuring, like, like that's what's going to happen.\nWell, this is cool too. I think another another cool thing about this is this fits into like a genre that, you know, personal software. So, uh, or maybe social software. So, basically, uh, when the internet came out, before pre-internet, the only people that made media were media companies, you know, you got your media from the New York Times and the Huffington Post, whatever, like newspapers, magazines, TV, etc. And then when the internet came out, and you got Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat, then social media became a thing, and everybody became a little broadcaster, right? Everybody broadcasted little moments of their life or their content or their their interest, whatever it was. And there was this explosion, like, you know, a sort of like 1 billionx increase in the amount of media that was created because everybody was doing it. And like one clear thing I see that's happening in the world today is that that's now happening with software. So, software used to be something that only software companies and software engineers could make, and you know, there's only like, I don't know, there's less than a 100 million, roughly, software engineers, like proper, like professional software engineers in the world, so, you know, 100 million out of 8 billion people could do the thing. And you know, if in terms of software companies, there's even less, maybe 100,000 uh software companies, I don't know, it's order of magnitude, roughly. And now with like Replit and V0 and all these different tools, it's going to be like social media, where like, \"Oh, I have, I carry in my pocket a thing that can make media.\" It's like, \"I carry in my pocket a thing that can make software.\"\nSo, a guy like Nick, who before this probably couldn't have taken his idea and made it into an app because he would have to either a, learn to code, or b, go hire like expensive programmers to make this happen. Like, he did most of this with AI, and so you see personal software, this like, you, this personal software category, which was like, didn't exist three years ago or five years ago, um, is now going to have the same sort of like 1 billionx, you know, increase, uh, just because anybody who's got an idea can now make their idea. Now, today, it's like broken three-quarters of the time, doesn't quite work, but like every six months, that number goes down by 15%. And so, you know, within two or three years, that number is going to be like zero, right? It's going to be like, when you have an idea, you make your app.\nEverything that I've been making on Replit and Lovable and Cursor, it's basically just like a Figma replacement. Like, I'm just like, \"It's basically just like drawing on paper.\"\nYeah. It's just like a mockup, and you still need someone to like actually do the work, but it, but it's a sick mockup. Like, it looks...\nYeah. So, somebody called it minimum viable promise. So, instead of minimal viable product, it's like, it's not really a product, but it's like kind of has, like, you make a promise. You can see the promise of something. And I think that's what a lot of these tools are able to do today.\nHave you heard of a guy named Edwin Chen?\nEdwin Chen?\nI mean, there's like, you probably have... There's probably 6,000 of them on my Facebook feed.\nYeah. Um...\nI went to school in Beijing. I, I think I got a few Edwin Chen in my rolodex.\nEdwin Chen might be the, like, if you uh did like a chart of like richest slash unknown/youngest person in the world, I think it's going to be Edwin Chen.\nIs this the guy who's doing Surge?\nSo, yeah, so Edwin Chen, uh, in like 2018, 2019, he worked at Facebook, and the story is is that he was tasked with like making some type of Yelp-style product, and what that meant was he had a list of 50,000 vendors, and he needed to figure out which of those 50,000 was a restaurant and which were uh a grocery store. Uh, and so he went and hired a firm, uh, some company to like parse it out, and it's like manual. You, you, you had to do it manually. Like, you had to like hire some firm that had a lot of uh offshore talent to go through and do it all manually by hand. And he was like, \"It took us four months or six months, something like that,\" which basically just meant we had to sit and wait, like, we couldn't do anything until we had that data, so I just had to sit and wait. And so he had this idea where he was going to make a better way to do data labeling, and the data data labeling is important now because that is what a lot of AI companies use, which I had no idea they they did that, and I'll explain how they do that. But basically, when a company like OpenAI uh wants to figure out if a certain reply reply is unethical. So, like, for example, asking, like, if it is it okay to like hit someone, or I don't know, like, whatever, like questions you would ask it a real person, and and actually not just a real person, but like a really smart person, uh, even someone who like does engineering or uh philosophy needs to spend time going through all the potential answers and to tell OpenAI, \"I think this one sort of fits what you're going for.\" Well, anyway, Edwin had this idea of, \"I'm going to create this massive workforce of philosophers, of engineers, of Ivy League grads who can go through and label all of these answers as good or bad, so AI companies can kind of, I can be like their offshore talent.\" And so, he's done this, uh, and it started in 2020. Now, he has a 100,000 people who are in the marketplace working for him as these data labelers. And this company is completely unknown. So, if you, I think it's Surge AI, I believe is the URL. So, if you go to Surge AI, it's a landing page with one paragraph. That's an amazing paragraph. If you want, you can read it. Do you want to read it? What made people like Hemingway, Ko, and Von Neumann so extraordinary? Their life. The books they read, the stumbles they had, the reinforcement. Every time friends laughed at their jokes, and every time they didn't. It's the people they met, the police they explored, and every decision they made along the way. Data does for AI what life does for humans. It elevates the neural networks that know nothing about the world into the intelligence capable of providing new art, sending rocket ships to Mars, etc. Our mission is to shape AGI with the richness of human intelligence, curious, witty, imaginative, and unexpected brilliance. We wake up every day trying to produce the data that makes this possible.\nAmazing, right?\nRomantic.\nIt's romantic. This guy made, like, a giant fleet of overseas data labelers sound like the the army from 300.\nYeah. Yeah, it's the it's the best. And so the way the business model works is they have a 100,000 of these folks, and they train them on different standards and whatever. And then they've also made software, so uh they can show the the the basically homework or task to their folks. And a company like OpenAI or uh Google, what whatever, is going to pay uh Surge millions and millions of dollars, and Surge is then going to take something like 30 or 40% of it and give it to the annotator to do the work. So, this company is only five years old, and it's uh it was leaked that they did $1 billion in revenue in the last 12 months. And this guy, Edwin Chen, he's only 37 years old, and he owns 100% of the company. They have not taken any outside funding.\nHoly.\nNow, listen, their biggest competitor is a company called Scale. Scale is run by this guy named Alexander Wang, I think. Alex, Alex Wang, I think his name is. And it recently sold for something like 30 times revenue. I believe it, they were doing like 800, 900 million in revenue. They just sold half of the company to Facebook. I think it was for 28 billion or 30.\nYeah.\n30.\nWhich mean, which means this guy uh Edwin, who's 37 and has a five-year-old company, presumably is worth something like $30 billion. And you can't find him on Twitter. He has no blog. You can't find photos of him. He used to have a blog, but you have to go to web archive in order to find it because he took it down. And his customers are like, \"Edwin is not online. You can't find him anywhere.\" And we like it that way. His bor, his business is very boring. The branding is basically non-existent. And it just does a very good job. And compared to Scale, who's like, you know, the hottest kid on on the block, like Alex Wang was just on Theo Von's podcast. He was at the inauguration. He's kind of like kind of like uh the the it guy right now. The these guys are the exact opposite. You're not going to find them anywhere. They only have 100 employees. They're totally under the radar. And uh it's super, super fascinating, dude.\nThis is uh this is wild. Um, I, I did not know that he bootstrapped the whole thing. I, I also had never heard of this company until Scale got bought. I had never heard of this company.\nSo, they're the company is is is killing it now because Scale got bought. So, because Scale got bought is now owned basically by Facebook, Google, and and a bunch of other companies. They go, \"Ah, we don't want to, we don't have with you anymore. We're going straight Surge.\"\nBut they were already winning. They were at a billion in revenue, and Scale was at 750 billion. And the reason why they're winning is because they are they charge a premium, and they're uh they, he's like, \"I don't, we got Scale,\" but he's like, \"I wasn't trying to get scale,\" meaning I wasn't trying to grow big. I was trying to hire the best people and to train them really well, and I charged for it. I charged three times what Scale charges, and the results have been better, and people really like us because of it. And this whole data labeling industry, I had no idea about this. I, I didn't know that people were behind the scenes making these decisions. It's kind of wild. I mean, this is one of the best like uh picks and shovels businesses. So, if you've never heard of picks and shovels, it's a the idea is like, anytime there's a gold rush, who makes the money? Yeah, it's the the few people who find the gold, but the more reliable way to make money is just to sell Pix and shovels to everybody else who's rushing into the gold rush. And Scale and Surge were the best picks and shovels businesses, maybe besides Nvidia, because what they were doing is saying, \"Cool, everybody, everybody wants to compete to become the, you, you want to make AGI, you want to make AGI, you're all raising billions and billions of dollars. Well, all of you have the same problem, and I will sell the data labeling service to all of you.\" And this is so funny that now that Facebook is buying uh Scale, it's like there's all that revenue has to find a new home, like this, that it's crazy that that's the best news ever for this guy.\nAnd there's another company called Handshake. So, if you go to joinhandshake.com, previously, or it still might be this, but they were known as a company that helped recent college graduates get jobs. And so, basically, they're a job board or job network for uh 22-year-olds.\nDude. Yeah, this was for college kids.\nOkay. Well, listen to this. They noticed a few months ago uh that Surge and uh uh Scale were using their service to find these these data annotators. And so they go, uh, \"We're going to do that now.\" And so in a very short amount of time, they pivoted, and that business that they have is going to be at $100 million a year in the next couple months in a very short amount.\n\n\nOf time because what they did was they went and just said, \"Oh, you are looking for a data annotation gig. We got you. Let's uh let's go ahead and get your train and we're just going to provide that service to folks.\" And so Handshake is uh building that business.\n\nNow, dude, that's so crazy. Yeah, I remember using this because I was like, \"Oh, it's interesting that nobody's really built the the kind of like one place to go hire college interns or college like fresh grads.\" And they built this like marketplace where you could go post on a job board at my local college here and I could get but it was like kind of crappy, dude. It was like it wasn't great. It was very like little liquidity in the market. But I remember thinking like this is an interesting idea. Somebody like it's a marketplace. I like marketplaces. Somebody should do this, right? And um I remember they were kind of like puttering along for a while it seemed like and uh this is so funny that they pivoted to this and now are going to just explode.\n\nYeah. And if you Google Handshake data annotation you can find the blog post that they uh that they wrote on them announcing that they were doing this. And so it basically just says that for the past decade Handshake has changed how college students started their careers. And then it goes on to basically say we're changing the company to like just hire just do this thing and it's already making and they don't actually say this but like it's now making $100 million a year.\n\nAnd you know I don't know how long this stuff will last. Like you know this might be a business that I think in like 7 to 10 years you may not need this anymore. Like it seems like the way AI is going you may not need this kind of human in the loop um to label all this data. Either either they label they label enough data where then the model learns how to label data. You don't need humans doing this or they use a thing that doesn't have the R RHF, right? Like you you just do reinforcement learning without human feedback and I think some people who are kind of pure believers in AI think you won't need the human feedback um at a certain point. So this might be a get get while the getting's good type of business.\n\nSo let me let me tell you a potential counter to that. So Tim Westeren founded a company called Pandora and I think he started it in 199 uh uh maybe 98. It was like pre iPhone. Um wait when did the iPhone come out? 0806. Yeah. So it was like probably like 2002 then. And anyway, uh, he told me this story because we had him talk at one of our events where he was like, \"I raised $7 million and all $7 million of that went to hiring basically ex musicians or musicians who were teachers and didn't make a lot of money.\" And for two years, I had about $150 of them listening to music and I gave them basically a scantron of all types of attributes that a song could potentially have. And so if you're listening to the Beatles, you would fill out like, okay, it sounds like it's at like uh 90 beats per minute. It sound like there's guitar, like it's melodic, it's lighthearted, whatever. And after 2 years of doing this, he put all the data, basically scantrons into this algorithm that he built. And he started playing like uh he told me a Beatles song and then and then he clicked next and it would suggest new music that was similar to the one that the Beatle song that he originally played. And he said the BeeGees came up and he was like the BeeGees and the Beatles they're not similar at all. What the hell? And then he kept clicking next. He's like oh wait they have the same melody or they have they all like have the same like they make me feel similar. And he was like it's working. It's working. And so originally his idea was I'm going to create kiosk at Best Buy. So you could say I'm interested in Beatles but here's like five other songs that Best Buy could show you and you will buy those CDs while you're there. And then the iPhone came out and he was like oh my god this is actually the exact way to apply this. And so this idea of data data labeling has been around forever. And I didn't when I was reading scale or about Surge AI, I was like, \"Oh my god, this is exactly what Tim was explaining to me how Pandora started.\" And so this has been around for 20 years. And so you say, \"I don't know if it's going to be around or not, but I don't know. It's been around for 20 years so far.\"\n\nYeah, that's true. But uh it's kind of like like self-driving, which is coming out now. I've taken the Waymos in San Francisco and Robotaxi in Austin. The Tesla self-driving just launched in Austin. um I think like two days ago or something, but they took two different approaches. So Waymo basically has this really expensive car. I I forgot the all-in cost, but it's something like $150 to $300,000 is the cost of the car with all the sensors on it, right? So they have this really expensive car with LAR, and in addition to the LAR, they um hardcode and hard map the road. So that you know for for years they would drive around and basically like map the road physically and they could only launch in cities where they had mapped the roads and Tesla took this other approach which was basically cameras only no LAR and we're not going to hard map the roads. We're going to let people drive around and then the car needs to have a brain that's smart enough to figure out a road even if it's never been on that road before.\n\nAnd uh it was this interesting bet because Elon was like, \"Lidar is not only we're not doing it, it's stupid and that's a dead-end path.\" And everybody else was all in on LAR. Everyone's like, \"Lidar makes it safer. It's better. You can't do this without LAR.\" And Elon's point was we humans drive with just eyes. We only have cameras. We don't I don't have a LAR in my brain and I'm able to drive safely. Right.\n\nSo LAR is what? LAR is uh uh like you're shooting some type of signal and it bounces back. You can see through things. So I don't know exactly what's the difference between LAR and radar and all these different things, but like it's another version of basically scanning that allows you to do what a camera can't. Camera can't see through an object. LAR can. It can sense that there's another another object behind it. So let the classic example is like you know you know maybe you're going to do a a turn. there's something obstructing your view, but then there's a little old grandma walking on the crosswalk, but you couldn't see the grandma till you started to turn visibly, but LAR would know that there's some there's an object there that's that's moving. Point is other sensors besides cameras. Whereas Elon was like, \"No, we're just going to put like whatever eight cameras on the car and that's going to make it work.\" And for a long time, there was a big debate. Some experts thought Elon is wrong. Some were just like, \"Elon is correct and Elon we trust.\" And very smart people were on both sides of the debate. And it was like a very high stakes debate because self-driving cars is one of the most valuable prizes that there is. Uh like self-driving cars I I don't think people really realize it. I think because it's I think because people talked about it for a while, they got kind of numb to it. This actually happened with AI too. People have been talking about AI, maybe machine learning, deep learning for a long time. People didn't really realize when something actually had changed and then suddenly like, wait, it's actually here. And those same people who had been tracking it for a long time were almost late to the party cuz they mistakenly wrote it off as, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard this before.\" And so the same thing's happening with self-driving cars where it's sort of like a Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like, wait a minute, it's actually happening now. Um, it's because it's an extreme game changer both like for society, for Tesla's business, right? Like Tesla's business is now going to be if you own a Tesla when you're instead of 95% of the time your car just sits parked, you're going to just tap a button, say, \"Go make me some money, please.\" And like a dog, it's going to go fetch, it's just going to go out there and it's going to start doing rides for people and it's going to start earning you money passively uh all the time.\n\nDude, I think uh I think Morgan Stanley or Chase, one of the big banks like last week was like wrote wrote this report where they had to say what the world's going to look like with self-driving. And it wasn't like um it it was far more grand. They're like the economy is going to look radically different because people are going to have so much more time. Like it was like at a macro scale it was like oh like the world will change because of this. But it was also like there's 60 I think thousand card deaths a year. Like what's the world going to look like with with more people? Like like it was like a pretty meaning like it was like a very grand way of thinking about it. than just like, \"Oh, wow. I could play on my phone while I'm walking or driving to work.\" It was like, \"No, everything changes.\"\n\nI I asked last night, I asked Grok, I said, \"What are the second order effects of self-driving cars?\" Here's what it said. So, it's like cities are going to look completely different. Right now, parking lots itself occupy 30% of all urban land um in some cities. And this is going to you're not going to need parking lots because the cars aren't going to just sit parked. They're going to be rolling around. You're going to need way less cars in a city. Plus, they don't they're not going to sit still. So you don't need all of the space. Just look around a city. How much space is dedicated just to parking? Like we're going to look back and that's going to look sort of like a caveman style thing. It's like cuz in the future those are going to be parks and public places. It's going to be smoking in a restaurant.\n\nYeah. Exactly. And so like the good version of this is that's like you know green spaces and affordable housing. But like who knows? Maybe maybe it actually gets co-opted for some other purpose. they all just become like, you know, drone delivery uh you know, parking units where where Amazon keeps like 10 million delivery drones. Um then the next one is labor. So right now there's three and a half million truck drivers alone, let alone all of the like Uber and taxi drivers and you're just not going to need that job period. Like and I don't know what happens to that, but there we go. Uh the next one is you know basically you I think the average person spends something like 90 minutes a day just commuting and so you get you know of your wake time let's say you're awake for 16 hours you're going to add you know what is that so let's just pretend it's two out of 16 you're going to add like you know 13% more time to everybody's day where they can now sleep work play right you're going to sit in a car and you're not going to have to think about the car you're just going to be able to do one of those things which als also means the car becomes a new place for entrepreneurs to build experiences, right? Like today, there's no one out there being like, I build car games, right? There's people who build mobile games and Xbox games, but there's nobody builds car games. Well, car games is going to be become a thing because people are going to sit in cars and play video games. People are going to sit in cars and they're going to relax, recover, they're going to work, and so you're going to build tools that that go in them. Uh, another one is insurance. It's like the whole insurance system like you know Buffett's big bets and Geico and all those things it's all based on human driving and so if humans aren't driving anymore like both the risk and the the the riskreward ratios change but also who are you insuring you're insuring the software company versus like individuals like how's this all going to work and so that whole all the whole insurance industry uh changes um and then basically like car ownership so today owning a car is both like utility but also the status symbol. So, it's going to be kind of interesting. Like, you're a car guy. Like, I wonder when there's self-driving cars and basically transportation's just on tap, like flowing like water, right? You just you push a button and in 30 seconds a little car the car of your liking pulls up.\n\nIt's just going to be like uh it's going to be like people who like horses now. Like it's going to be a small group of people who are passionate.\n\nYeah. It's just like, oh, you're passionate about it and you are lucky enough to have enough room or enough money to like afford it, but uh like maybe I'll like buy a group and can go experience that once in my life. Like that's what it's going to be.\n\nYeah. Or like you know like horseback riding is like therapeutic. People like to like brush a horse or pet a horse. It's going to be like that with a car. It's going to be like male therapy to just like get in there and just be behind the wheel. Have control over something in your life.\n\nYeah. It's or like punk.\n\nYeah. You're going to like feel the noise and like smell the gas. Like it's going to be um it's going to be like a hobby. Yeah. It's not going to it's not going to exist. I don't think I think it's going to be a lot longer. Um but like in 20 it could be 20 years, 25 years. It's not going to be in the next 5 years, but yeah, it's going to be a hobby.\n\nAre you sure about that? Why do you think it's not going to be in the next 5 years?\n\nWaymos are now doing 20% of all the rides in San Francisco.\n\nBecause um that was zero like Have you like Have you ever like a large percentage of\n\n\nPeople of Americans have to drive, um, let's say 60 miles one way to work, or they have to pull stuff or carry stuff. I just don't think, I think that for the urban, there's, it's not, um, oh, um, there's, there's going to be like a, there's probably going to be like four sections of users. So it's like young urbanites, and it's like, yeah, you guys don't need a car at all. Like, you're, you're, you're doing probably already there with Uber. Yeah. And then, like, the far end of that spectrum is like, uh, rural people who have to actually tow stuff, you know, even though everyone has a truck, very few actually use it. But there's like that section, and there's like the people in between, and there's going to be like a timeline, because like, if you ever, you can't really tow anything on an electric car right now. Uh, it's like, it's, they say you can, but go talk to someone who lives in rural Texas when you have to be driving around all day. It's like impossible. So I think that there's going to be like, um, it's going to be like for, um, you know, what's that early... when you say it's not going to be five years, are you saying it's not going to be, meaning self-driving is not going to work? It's not going to change? No, it's going to work. It's just not, just the user adoption. It's like, it's going to, it's going to take a minute for that for the whole spectrum of people. I think for the urbanites and people like that, it's, it's tomorrow, we're going to do it, I think. Yeah. I mean, that guy towing probably still doesn't, he still has an AOL email address, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like, so I think it's pretty safe to say that that person's not... Yeah. It might be 40 years before that person. It's going to be a long time. But then, like, you know, there's like a lot of, you know, people, like, I'm one of them. Like, I'm romantic about my gas vehicle. I had an electric car, and I got rid of it. And I'm like, in my head, I'm like, I acknowledge it's better. I acknowledge that, like, it's the future, but it sucks. I want... Yeah. It's like our vegan friends. It's like, I get it. We shouldn't kill creatures, but it just tastes so good. But yeah, but when you dip them in ranch, it's fantastic. Uh, but I'm excited to... What's crazy is in Austin, I think, or SF, people are actually paying more for the Waymos. Yeah. Yeah. It's not, it's not that much cheaper yet. That was... But people are, people want to not be around someone, and uh, that was unexpected. So, like, when I was, when I drive my, my, I have a BMW that has self-driving stuff. I feel way safer on that than if it were just me. Uh, and I think that there's like 20% of people, and it's usually men. I've noticed, I've noticed women tend to hate, every woman I've talked to hates self-driving, and every man I've talked to likes it. And uh, like, have you, have you, do you have any self-driving now? Um, no. Well, I don't, I don't have it, so I haven't had that, that level of a, I haven't had a sample size to notice that. I'm curious if that's common, or if you're just like indexing on three people. No, it's... Well, yeah, I am. But, uh, yeah, it's like five of my friends, like the husbands use it, and the wives are like, \"Nope, I don't mess with that. I don't use it.\" But I feel way safer with it. Um, you want to do one more thing, or you have something? Well, I have a... So, I tweeted something out that Elon replied to over the weekend. And... how did that make you feel? Did you like, did you like clap and like scream? No. So, I, first of all, I played it so cool. You wouldn't, if you had seen me, you would have thought I might be under the weather. That's how cool I was playing it. And actually, what happened is, um, I just texted my wife, and I was like, \"Oh, Elon replying to me.\" And uh, and then I just, I forgot about it. Next day, I didn't even think about it. I, I moved on. My mom calls me. She's like, \"Shaan, what did you say?\" I'm like, \"What?\" She's like, \"Shaan, what did you say, Elon? What did you say to Elon?\" And I was like, \"What?\" My wife put it up on her Instagram story, and I was like, \"Oh my god, I'm trying to play it cool over here.\" And then you made it like, you know, lame city. So, that felt interesting that I got like multiple phone calls from people. And I was like, that's like the only time your wife has shared something that is when another person replied to you. Yeah, exactly. And so, I thought that was interesting how big of a reaction she was. The thing I had said was, I wrote, \"Within a couple years, not using AI while you're doing your job will be the equivalent of coming to work without a computer.\" Like, if someone just turned up and they're like, \"No, I didn't bring it today.\" You'd be like, \"What the hell, dude? Like, what are you planning to do? What is the, what's the plan here?\" That's how it's going to be if you're, if you're trying to do your job and you're not using AI constantly to do your job. And he applied, and he was like, \"You know, sooner, probably.\" And, um, and, and so that was like, and, and so I started thinking about that, and I started thinking about, um, somebody else said this thing. They go, \"Pretty soon, being a doctor who's not using AI as a co-pilot, like, let's say you're a radiologist, and you're just trying to eyeball every, every MRI, and you're not also running it through AI, that'll be considered malpractice, because, like, you put the patient at risk by not at least including the second layer of AI diagnostics.\" And I thought that's pretty interesting. It's like the flip is going to go so much from this doesn't work, you know, something we don't do, we don't even use it, to if you're not using it, it's considered malpractice, whether it's corporate malpractice or medical malpractice. My doctor friend admitted to me the other day, he goes, \"OpenAI is a better doctor than me.\" And uh, he was like, and I knew this was going to be popular, because for years, he's been a doctor for 10 years, patients come to me and said, \"Well, Google says this, or WebMD says this.\" And he says, \"Over the last six months, the only people who have used that reasoning is with OpenAI.\" And I said, \"Well, according to OpenAI,\" Yeah, Chachi Pich said this. Uh, and he goes, \"And they're right. A lot of times the diagnosis is right.\" Dude, I got in a fight with a doctor recently about this. Did I tell you this? What did they say? My mom had to have a surgery, and but she was on a trip. And so I'm like calling in to the doctor. Every time the doctor would make her rounds, she would like FaceTime me in, um, cuz she's on this other side of the country. And so the doctor would come in, and like, doctors, doctors are very hit or miss. I love some doctors, but a lot of doctors, I'm like, \"Wow, this is an extremely underwhelming experience.\" And so this one doctor comes in, and she's like, \"Yeah, your levels were fine.\" And then I'm like, I actually read the test through chat GPT, and the levels were like high for this. And she's like, \"Well, which level?\" And I'm like, I tell her, I'm like, whatever the thing, the, the whatever the term was. And she's like, \"Yeah, that was high, but you know, um, it depends on the exact number.\" So I go, \"What was the number?\" I, I would have to check. I'm like, \"You're the doctor, so yeah, you would have to check. Like, you know, what are, what are you talking about?\" And I'm like, \"You know, basically, chat GPT said if it's above this, then you should consider doing this, like, additional, additional step. Like, do you believe that that's, like, do you agree with that? Like, do you think we should do that, that step?\" She's like, \"Well, I, you, I mean, you're putting me on the spot here, and I don't have the number.\" And I'm like, and she basically was getting pissed. And she was like, \"Well, if you're going to ask me questions, then I'm going to need to go look at the number.\" And I literally was like, \"Yeah, you are going to need to go look at the number then.\" Going to ask questions. Like, what are we doing here? I don't understand. Like, why are you offended by me asking if you, if you have seen the data from the test, the test you just said to run, and now you're coming back to discuss the test results, and you don't want to look at the test result. I don't really understand what's happening here. Well, I think what's going to happen is that, you know, how, have you noticed, so, uh, have you ever been to a doctor now with an AI scribe? So, like, they have, like, for... Okay, so for a long time... Oh, I was humiliating her in front of her AI scribe. Is that what happened? Well, for a long time, they could have been human scribes. And so, like, I, have you been to a doctor and seen like a person on an iPad? Like, literally, it looks like the doctor's facetiming, typing notes. Yeah. Yeah. And that's like a scribe. Now they have AI scribes. And I think what's going to happen is, like, the, the AI is going to, like, talk up and be like, \"Actually, ma'am, he's right.\" Uh, like, like, I think that's what's going to happen. And if I was an entrepreneurial doctor, I would 100% start a new practice all centered around, \"We are AI first.\" So, we work with uh, AI, you know, and I don't think that you, we, we aren't at the point, and maybe we'll never be at the point where you totally trust it, just like you always want the pilot, even if autopilot is still a thing, but I would like go heavy on that uh, of leaning into, like, \"We have all of the context here. Uh, we have all of your files uploaded to our chat GPT or whatever it is,\" and have an AI first, because I think that a lot of people, like you and me, and people listening to this podcast, they have the similar sentiment where they're like, \"Oh, no. I trust a computer way more than a human being,\" but I would also want the human being to put their stamp on it. It's also the same, cuz it's not even that, like, \"Oh, the AI found the problem and the doctor didn't.\" Sometimes it's just as simple as, cool, the doctor came in, they talked kind of fast, they didn't fully explain, I still have more questions. And so, you go and you ask Chat GPT to explain it to you maybe simpler, or you ask some follow-up questions. Maybe you're not as embarrassed to ask questions. You feel like you're not like, you know, the person's not like in a rush to get out of there, like a lot of doctors are. And so, sometimes it's not even that the AI doctor is better because it's smarter. Sometimes it's because it's infinitely patient, or it's an infinitely better communicator, or you know, it knows, um, you know, maybe other things about you, or you know, you could ask some follow-up questions. You don't feel silly doing it. Like, those are other components of the doctor experience, essentially, bedside manner that AI is better at. Yeah. And uh, so I'm like very eager to see how this works. I go to, um, I go to a doctor now, a concierge doctor, and it's not very expensive. But the reason I go there is the average, at most doctors, they have to see four patients an hour. So they're at 15 minutes... and is that insane? I remember I went to a doctor, and like, I had an earache. I'm like, \"Guys, my ear is killing me.\" And uh, like, he spent no time, like, trying to, like, help me, like, figure this out. And I went to a concierge doctor, and the average time is 45 minutes. So we can, like, thoroughly walk through things. And so if I can just use all the information that they have, and then go and ping chat GPT to further the conversation, it is pretty brilliant. Um, I'm very eager to see what's going to happen. I like people act like AI is amazing for a bunch of different stuff, and it is. But the what they're doing with medicine and drugs and cancer and things like that is like pretty astounding, and I think that's going to be the major breakthrough in the next couple years. Dude, the other one, lazy-ass parenting. So, your kid's a little young for this, but it is amazing, dude. I, I'll open up Gemini, and it has like a camera mode. Why do you use different ones? You've said Claude, or sorry, you said uh, Grok, and now you're saying Gemini, and then we also refer to... So, you use different ones. Well, it's like, you know, you go to your different friends for different questions. You only ask me certain questions. Sometimes you go to Jack Smith, and sometimes you go to your, you know, you go to Joe. You go to different people for different things. So, like, if you want to be, if you want something that's a little bit more real and objective, I think Grok is better. If you want something that's uh, either code or creative writing, Claude is better. You know, the the catchall is chat GPT. And then Gemini has some like advanced features. So this is what I was saying, like Gemini has the thing where you just turn your camera on, like FaceTime, and I think it's for like, maybe you're supposed to, like, show it your car and be like, \"How do I repair this?\" And it, like, tells you what to do. But I just pointed at my kids, and I'm like, \"Hey, we're playing charades. Guess what they're doing...\"\n\n\n\"And then my kids will like get on the ground and start like crawling, and it's like, \"Hm, seems to be a boy crawling. Maybe it's a snake. Are you a worm?\" And it like tries to guess it, and they love it, dude. And so I'm able to just straight up chill and let them play with AI. It is amazing.\n\nAnother one I'll do is I'll just be like, \"Hey, I have a 5-year-old and a four-year-old here, and they want trivia questions. They like animals. They like Paw Patrol. They like, um, you know, they know a little bit about Pokémon, but nothing too complicated. Um, ask them a bunch of questions. Cheer them on when they get it right. If they get it wrong, tell them the right answer. Keep track of the score. Here's their names. Go.\" That's the prompt. And it plays trivia endlessly with my kids, and they love it because it's all audio, which kids can do. They don't have to like be on screens to be able to do this. And, um, so I'm just discovering like game after game I can play with them. Like I'll do like basically replaced Kuman with, \"Hey, I need, um, advanced kindergarten math,\" which like I don't even know what that means, but it like gets you for whatever reason those three words give me the sweet spot of like a question that that that kind of works for my kids, and, um, it's like a tutor, right? It's an infinitely patient tutor with them, and it's not perfect in the sense of like, you know, sometimes it like starts and stops its audio because if you make any sound, it thinks you're talking, but damn, it's pretty, it's pretty good, and uh, it, it's like already usable for us.\n\nI've not seen, I didn't even, I didn't know much about Gemini. Gemini Live. I had no idea what this was. Is this Google? This Google. Gemini is like after summer break. You know that one kid who comes back. It's like they're kind of like hot now, but you still have the old image of them. Like their reputation is still being like not hot, but objectively they're hot now, but nobody's really on it yet. That's what Gemini is. Gemini was basically out of the game. This Google's AI tools out of the games like I was just chat GBT Grok. Yeah. And then she changed, and she like, it's like, wait, like she got contacts and like she learned how to do her hair. She like walked, watched a makeup tutorial. It's like she started rollerblading, which was like surprisingly good cardio, and now like suddenly Gemini could do things that like the other ones can't do, but nobody's on it yet, which doesn't really actually give you any benefits.\n\nWait, so Gemini is hot now?\n\nGemini is hot now.\n\nGoogle's hot. Google's hot.\n\nYeah.\n\nI don't know, man. That's hard for me to buy into. But yeah, because you're one of those jocks at school who's just stuck in seventh grade. You forgot what happened over seventh grade summer.\n\nAll right, I'll use this. Yeah, I'm just stuck on chat GBT. Uh, and I don't use Grok because I, I'm shocked when people say they use Grok. I'm like, wait, so you go to like twitter.com to use AI?\n\nThat's just, is that the same thing as, that's the Twitter one? Yeah, because Steph Smith just got a job at this other one. What was that other one called? Oh, no. She got it at Grok with a Q. That's stupid naming. Unfortunate. Unfortunate names. I'm a shareholder of Grok with a Q also, but unfortunate naming situation. Yeah. And it's AI as well. They're making chips.\n\nOkay. Well, they should change their name because they should change their name because. Yeah, that, that doesn't make sense. Or at least the pronunciation, right? Like I don't like, I don't know how you also need to be Groke or something like, I don't know what they're going to do. They could be Groke, I guess. But they, yeah, Grok is, so it's the same. You, I love how you putting the N in there like as Rob Gronkowski.\n\nWait, what did I say?\n\nYou're saying Grank.\n\nOh, what is it?\n\nGrok.\n\nGrok. Yeah, like the shoes. Crocs. Uh, yeah. Like Crocs. Yeah.\n\nWait. And so what is the Twitter thing?\n\nWhat do you mean? What is the, that's also, that's not, oh, that's not Grank. Oh, I thought it was Grank.\n\nYeah, there's no an any of them. That guy's a football player. He's a retired football player.\n\nDude, I went to Montana to visit a friend last week, and I wore overalls because they're like the best outfit. I saw a photo of that, and I just thought to myself, \"Holy [ __ ] this guy's got no, no limits. He's just wearing overalls as standard, standard wear.\" It's the best clothing because you could put your phone and your wallet right there on the chest, and so you're like holding kids, and like you just have so many pockets, and you have like vest right here, and I love it. And she's like, \"Oh, you got these? Did you think that we're all cowboys here?\" And I was like, \"Huh?\" And she's like, \"You wore your overalls to Monte? Are you trying to make fun of us?\" I was like, \"What are you talking about? I, uh, I've worn these for years.\" Like, I am not pretending.\n\nUh, no, I actually just got a, by the way, I was very inspired by your Instagram post. You wrote something, uh, the caption of your post. You go, \"From now on, I'm only taking photos that if my kid looked at it 20 years from now, they'd be like, \"My dad is pretty cool.\"\n\nThat was great. That's, that's because you have that photo of your father, right? Of him when he was in his 30s, and you're a baby, and he's like doing something cool, or he's wearing a cool shirt, and you're like, \"Oh, wow. Dad was sick.\" Or like, \"Oh, you don't see them like that anymore, right? Like they don't have hair anymore. They're like fat now or whatever.\" And so you don't, you don't see that side of them, but like it lets you put a little respect on their name when you see like, \"Oh, damn.\" When they were young, they were actually kind of, that's actually kind of fly what they were wearing.\n\nSo, I was smoking a cigar, and uh, uh, they were, uh, which I never do, but I like was smoking a cigar, and like they were going to take a photo with my kid, or someone had a camera. I was like, \"Oh, I'm taking photos.\" And I put the cigar. I used to hide it. I would hide it behind my back. And I'm like, \"No, [ __ ] this. She's going to be proud.\" Like, so I put it back in.\n\nDude, you think smoking is going to be cool in 30 years? That's going to be like you had like a slave with you or something. It's going to be crazy that you were just smoking with a baby on your shoulder.\n\nBrother, have you seen the photo of the eight guys sitting on the beam off the, like, off the Empire State Building?\n\nThat's a great picture. I think, I think to myself, those guys are crazy. They're dangerous, but they're [ __ ] hard. That is awesome. And so I will never be on the beam of the Empire State Building 1,000 ft above the air, but at least I could smoke a cigar and look remotely cool, dude. We should print this out. I want this framed, dude. Three of them have overalls very similar to the ones you were wearing.\n\nYeah. What's up?\n\nSame making model.\n\nYeah, you just need this like beret hat. You probably have this. Oh, what am I talking about? Of course you have this hat.\n\nYeah. And the courage to eat lunch 1,000 ft above, uh, the ground, which is like even back then the co-workers were like, \"Guys, what are you doing? There's a cafeteria like right here.\" Like, like what the [ __ ]\n\nLet's just end this episode with just this photo slowly fading away on our YouTube channel with just some great music. Let's just leave people with a good feeling and a reminder of of the men we once were.\n\nAll right, that's it. That's a part.\n[Music]\n",
