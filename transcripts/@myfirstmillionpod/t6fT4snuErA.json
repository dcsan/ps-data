  "cleanText": "The stock has grown in the last year from a $7 billion company to now a $44 billion company. 44 billion.\nOkay.\nYou know what I mean? That's what Elon bought X for.\nThis guy's selling Labubu.\nIt's insane. It's crazy.\nAll right, dude. Sam, do you know what one of these are?\nOh my gosh. Ramon will not quit talking to me about these things. Okay, so those\nAll right, so for the listener, Shaan's showing me what I'm holding up. They look like uh dolls basically in the same vein as a troll. But I have gotten texts from my friend, our friend Ramon, who says, \"Have you heard of this thing? It's worth.\" And he says the number and I'm like, \"Oh yeah, it must have been a typo.\" So what what's the deal with these things?\nDo you know what they're called?\nI don't. Super something. No, this this is a Laboo. All right, get get yourself educated. This is a Labubu doll. Okay.\nDoes it have a Prada sign on it?\nYeah, that's part of the part of the stick here. Okay, so what's the what's the story with these things? This is basically the most viral toy in the world.\nIt's one of the biggest crazes since, you know, Beanie Babies and things like that. And so, the story behind this thing is pretty crazy. I just wanted to tell you some of the things that I know about it. Of course, my wife put me on to this months ago and I just ignored it as the uh the stock of this company is up like 7x in a year because this thing is going crazy.\nChinese company, right?\nChinese company. Yeah. So, this is made by this these dolls are produced by a Chinese company called Pop Mart. And the maker for this guy, Wang Ning, he is now the 10th richest man in China. And like he's adding like a billion dollars to his net worth in the last, you know, but he's like 30, right? or or like he's he's he's really young. Like dude, look at this picture of him.\nYeah, but Chinese guys always look really young until they don't.\nUntil they don't.\nYeah. Haven't you ever heard like all of my Asian friends, they're like, \"We always look young and then we fall off a cliff.\"\nAll right. Can you see this guy?\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, he could be 12 or 50. I don't know.\nYeah. So, this guy is behind this company, PopMart. Uh but it's kind of fascinating what's going on with this craze, right? Like it's it's really taken over. So, somebody gave these to my kids as like a gift and I didn't really understand the significance of it. I was like, \"Oh, cool. Thanks.\" I didn't realize that we were just gifted like a really important thing. This is like one of the more valuable items in my house right now. Like these things sell for thousands of dollars. The top ones can sell for six figures. That's how crazy the uh the craze is for this.\nOkay. So tell me the story because this is this sounds like a good good stock to short because that's typically how these like collectibles kind of\nWe'll get to that. Yes, I I agree with you. We'll get to that. All right. So the story of the Labubu dolls is there's a guy who's an artist around 2015. He's he's in the Netherlands. He gets inspired for to create like a kind of like a a toy world. So like a uh a character world uh based on where he's at in the Netherlands. And he designs these dolls. these kind of like like look at their teeth like the little like gremlin looking doll\nand there's hope there's hope for us okay because the experts are describing this um as ugly cute and it's succeeded because it's ugly cute and I just thought like our podcast I just feel like that just gave us like some wind in our sales for what we could do as well on YouTube\nit's worse for us because we're not particularly ugly but we're not particularly good-looking is there like a eh cute\nwhat the kids call mid\nyeah So he creates these in 2015. Not a lot happens from there. But in 2019, so four years later, he partners with this company PopMart. And PopMart was started about a decade ago because this guy Wang Ning had this insight which is he thought that this kid trend, we talked about this before because you're into Legos. So he's like this kid adult trend, this like kids toys for adults is going to be a thing.\nYeah. And so he creates this store and the store uh to really takes advantage of this like style this business mechanic called blind boxes which I don't know if you've seen uh LOL dolls or mini brands where you buy the box but you don't know what's inside. Similar to like Pokemon card packs. You buy the pack, you don't know what cards are inside. And so this mechanic, which I think they call like the gotcha mechanic, creates a lot more spending, right? People will will keep buying because it's a little bit like a treasure hunt. And you want to see what you can find, what you can get. Will you get the\nbig be a scam? Like I remember Logan Paul or Jake Paul was sponsored or did business with a company called Mystery Box and that was like a rage, like a very trendy thing for like 3 months. Do you remember that? Like 10 years ago.\nYeah. Like these loot boxes are in games and people know that, okay, this is kind of not it's not a scam per se, but it's basically manipulative, right? It gets people to buy a lot more. People get addicted to this thing and especially when you're targeting kids, which is why Logan Paul and those guys got in trouble was, hey, this is targeting kids. The beauty of this is it's not targeting kids. So, the way these blew up is through celebrities.\nWait, can I ask a question about the company PopMart? So, he had a PopMart. He had just a it was a toy company for a long time or what was the the origin?\nSo, the story is 2010 he opens up a small designer store in Beijing and he's trying to build it off this kid collectibles brand. He starts selling blind boxes. This Laboo is not in play at this point. There's other blind boxes that he's trying to sell. And in 10 years, they grow from one store to, you know, 300 plus stores, 2,000 vending machines where you could just like, it's just, you know, you just buy one of these boxes, right, right out of a machine. It ends up going public in 2020. Stock doubles on the first day. The stock has grown in the last year from a $7 billion company to now a $44 billion company. 44 billion. You know what I mean? That's what Elon bought X for.\nSo that's so insane. Uh so the before it became when it was just a four or seven I think you said billion dollar company. They just sold like dolls that people liked and it so which which a $7 billion toy company is is that's already a mega success. So they sold other people's stuff.\nThat was over four years. But yeah.\nYeah. They're they're they're selling collectibles of different brands, different IP. And this is one of the IP uh that they have. And this doll alone, like these these Laboos uh did like 700 million last year. So they're like now like almost it's it's getting close to about half of the revenue of the company overall because the trend has exploded. And then they connect with this with this artist. And so that's brings us to where we are now.\nYeah. So the question is how did this explode? Where does a the thing that fascinated me is like where does a trend like this even come from? How does this happen? Because it's totally irrational, right? Like why this doll? Why not another doll? Who know? Is it the teeth? Is it the outfit? Is it what? What is it behind it? So, there's some I guess learnings to have from this about like the psychology of a winning product. So, just want to tell you a little story about how this happens. So,\ncheck this out.\nUh, exhibit A 2023.\nOkay. So, this is a photo that you clearly can tell it's just Rihanna like getting coffee or leaving a hotel.\nShe's going to an airport\nand she just looks like she's it's not sponsored. She's just being a lady and she has one of the toy BBOPs or boooos or whatever they're called hanging off of her book bag.\nBook bag.\nIs that what it is?\nIt's a little purse.\nOkay. I It looks like a book. I'm looking from far away. It looks like a book bag.\nOkay. So, she's spotted with it. Hm.\nInteresting. At the same time, another trend is happening in Thailand. In Thailand, people are starting to see these Laboo for whatever reason as possible good luck charms. And in Thailand, people are quite religious and they started to view these as like almost like a spiritual like a little guardian that they could have with them. And so that's that rumor starts to spread. And then what happens is uh do you know the bl the band Blackpink? Do have you ever heard of this band?\nNo.\nIt's like a Korean pop band. Basically, it's like one of the most popular pop bands in the in the world. So\nit's a girl band like Spice Girls.\nOh, I know it. Yeah, I like I like those guys. I I see their music videos.\nThey're very eye-catching. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Uh,\nwell, it's just like it's a sensation. You'll go on YouTube and you're like, \"What is this thing with a billion views on YouTube?\" It's sort of like the sensation of like the BTS thing.\nYeah. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. So, uh, okay. So, this is right here. This is now we're talking about Blackpink. So, Lisa from Blackpink goes to Thailand to visit her friend. Her friend says, \"Hey, what do you want to do today?\" They decide, \"Let's go shopping.\" She thinks, \"Okay, we're going to go shopping. clothes, bags, what are we going to go buy? But no, she wants to go to PopMart. And she says, \"What? Pop? I don't know what PopMart is.\" But they go to a PopMart store. At the PopMart store, the friend really wants a Laboo. And Lisa says, \"Honestly, not into it. Don't I don't get it. Don't don't care about it.\" Blah blah blah. But the friend gets super disappointed because they're all sold out. And the lady at the store is like, \"Listen, it's impossible. You're not going to get one.\" And that little mimetic monster inside Lisa starts to roar. the one in her stomach and she's like, \"You know what? If I can't have it, I must have it.\" And she decides, \"Actually, I think I do like Leoo Boooos and I think I do want to go get Leuboos.\" And she starts to collect these. Now, she starts getting obsessed with PopMart. She goes, she buys blind boxes and she starts collecting these. This becomes her destress type of thing she does from the the stressful life of being a world famous pop star.\nYeah.\nNow, she gets caught having a laboo.\nWhy? Cuz she posts it on her Instagram.\nSo, now we're fast forward 2024. This is the photo that created the craze. It went from just like, you know how a hurricane starts and there's like some some sweeping winds, maybe a casual storm, a casual rainstorm, and then then comes the hurricane. And this this Instagram story started the hurricane.\nAnd it's her hugging her lioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.\nCan I say something? I kind of get it.\nThat looks pretty cool.\nIt looks good for you, too. This photo.\nYeah, it's a it's like a old white guy in overalls. It's kind of what it looks like. It looks like a farmer.\nYeah, this does look like a Midwest farmer, actually.\nThis I kind of like I I And it's big. It's about 2 feet tall. I kind of think that's neat. I understand.\nThis is a big one. Yeah. So, they they come in different sizes. The the one that sold for over 100,000, that was like a humansized one. Okay. So, this is the stock since that photo was taken. And you can see the stock is up 7x since then as it's just been crushing. And so the Labou craze starts and what you know what's interesting about this is why okay so celebrities started posting about it that's okay I get that but what else? So here are some of the other things that I found kind of interesting from a I don't know behavioral psychology point of view. The first is the lipstick effect. Have you ever heard of the lipstick effect?\nI don't think so. So there's an economic theory that basically says that whenever people are under financial pressure, so uh maybe the economy is a little bit choppy, maybe there's um uh you know there's inflation, there's there's wage pressure, whatever it is, people will opt. People think that you'll stop spending, but what actually happens is you shift the spending. And so instead of buying a new bag, you'll just buy some lipstick. You'll buy a new lipstick. And so lipstick sales will explode at a time during economic pressure because you take away from bigger luxury purchases and they go into smaller luxury purchases. So instead of a $200 outfit or uh bag, you're going to buy a $20 uh item instead. And so people think that this is part of what's behind Lubu, which is that this thing uh you know, initially started where these are like, you know, a $20 $25 box that you buy and you get a Lubu. But the thing with these, the smart thing of these is I showed you the doll. This is the most important part, this little ring.\nBecause most stuffed animals, you just keep them at home. So there's no virality to it, right? You just have it at the comfort of your own home. Nobody sees it. Uh you don't get to show it off. It's not a status symbol. By just having the bag clip attached to these things, they suddenly became like luxury accessories. And so that's why Rihanna had it attached to her bag and this Black Pink lady had hers. And then David\n\n\nBeckham is posting that, and Kim Kardashian posts that she has 10 of them, and she starts clipping them to her bags, and it becomes this add-on to your luxury bag. This cute little add-on that you can put on your bag, and then each one of these has an outfit. So I can take this off, and I can buy new clothes for this, and I can upgrade my Labubu.\n\nSo now you have all...\n\nCan you spell Labu?\n\nL A B U B U.\n\nOh, okay. I see.\n\nBy the way, Labu is actually only one of the characters, but that's just what it became called. The characters are actually called the monsters, but nobody that didn't stick.\n\nOh my gosh. I'm on their website. I think it's kind of cool.\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd so, and so what I think is interesting here is that you have this kind of what Charlie Mer calls the Laal Palooa effect. So maybe you have the lipstick effect causing people to look for little luxuries. Then you have the kidd effect where you have adults looking for uh, you know, maybe comfort and pleasure uh because when there... that's another economic theory here, which is that when adults face stress uh from work and global events like wars and whatnot, they find emotional relief in uh collecting toys and things that connect with their childhood. So you have that effect kicking in, you have the lipstick effect kicking in. You have the status symbol effect of this where you can attach this to your bag. You have the ugly cute effect, which we are just explo... we're just crushing with right now. And so all these come together to create the phenomenon that is Labubu.\n\nGreat, great, great job. Uh, good find. I uh, I've been hearing about this, but I didn't exactly dive deep. So that's cool that you did this. This is not sustainable, and this is definitely going to go away in the next 5 years. But let's get it while the kitten's good.\n\nAll right. So, I've built a few companies that have made a few million dollars a year. And I've built two companies that have made tens of millions of dollars a year. And so, I have a little bit of experience launching, building, creating new things. And I actually don't come up with a lot of original ideas. Instead, what I'm really, really good at, what my skill set is, is researching different ideas, different gaps in the market, and reverse engineering companies. And I didn't invent this, by the way. We had this guy Brad Jacobs. We talked about him on the podcast. He started like four or five different publicly traded companies worth tens of billions of dollars each. He actually is the one who I learned how to do this from. And so with the team at HubSpot, we put together all of my research tactics, frameworks, techniques on spotting different opportunities in the market, reverse engineering companies, and figuring out exactly where opportunities are versus just coming up with a random silly idea and throwing it against the wall and hoping that it sticks. And so if you want to see my framework, you can check it out. The link is below in the YouTube description.\n\nSo I started thinking, how do I make money on this? All right. So the first way I should have made money on this was when my wife started telling me about this, which was, I don't know, six to eight months ago. I should have either bought the stock. I should have looked... I didn't even think it was going to be a stock. I just thought it was like a stuffed animal. I didn't think it was a public company. Should have bought the stock or, you know, you could have tried to collect and flip. Okay. That's too much effort. So what's the play here? So I went and looked up... I asked AI. I said, \"Tell me the last five crazy toy crazes as crazy as Labubu over the last 50 years and compare them.\"\n\nWhat were some of the other ones? So, it would have been Cabbage Catch.\n\nCabbage Patch was the first one that it came out.\n\nBaby Beanie Babies.\n\nBeanie Babies was the second.\n\nI think Trolls were popular for a minute, but I don't know if they were a craze.\n\nThen it gave me Pokémon. Pokemon cards, which had two bumps. There was the one when we were kids where buying and collecting packs reached about the same revenue, about $2 billion a year, and then it died down for about 20 years, and then recently when like kind of Logan Paul started collecting them again, they had another peak, and it had 1.6 billion in sales on the cards recently. So Pokemon, and then the last one it gave me, which was I thought kind of interesting as AI, but actually is a good point because I was thinking maybe Furbies or Tamagotchis. I didn't know what it was going to give me. Um, those were smaller.\n\nIt gave me Stanley cups, which actually makes total sense cuz it's the same thing. It's the exact same thing. And so it gave me those. And the funny thing about these is on a scale, Labu is actually still small. So this doll did about 700 million. Uh, those all at their peak were kind of like $1.6 to $2 billion in sales. I actually expect that over the next year this thing goes even the star kind of goes viral. Nova, it burns out and it hits a 2 billion or three billion in revenue. Um, and then it's going to crash cuz the funny thing with all of these is they all had about a two to three-year peak tops. And so I think the actual play if you want to make money on this thing is to short Pop Mart stock starting around uh, you know, end of 2026 and you know, maybe through 2027. Uh, now shorting is dangerous because you could lose your shirt. Uh, cuz shorting has sort of asymmetric downside. Uh, but if you... I think if you were a betting man, the odds are that, you know, by 2027 this thing is not a $44 billion company anymore.\n\nWhat was the name? Okay. So, you had a friend uh, Michael... Michael Smith, Michael Actton Smith, he had a... the guy who created calm.com. Before he created calm.com, the meditation app, he actually had a toy, a stuffed animal toy company called like Minnow Monsters or something like that.\n\nYeah, that's right. Um, what was the name of the...\n\nSo, his company was called Mind Candy, and it was Moshi Monsters was the name. Minnow Monsters was a mobile game. Moshi Monsters was his. If I remember correctly, this is all 15 years ago, so it's harder to remember everything, but he raised lots of money as a technology company almost, or at least from tech VCs. And he was like, \"I'm going to build a massive toy business.\" And I remember reading at the time, \"This is insane. You're stupid.\" But now that I think about it, there's been many examples of where that is not stupid. And this is yet another one of them where you could actually build a really cool IP toy company. And he was... sounds like he was on the right track. It didn't work out.\n\nWas dude, it was big in the UK. So in the UK it was like, I don't know, one out of every three kids is playing Moshi Monsters. It was like insane. It was like 90 million users globally. And I remember meeting him. I think it was still during the kind of like... it was kind of like the tail end of the peak. So it... it was big, but it was... it had stopped exploding. And he was like, \"That's okay. We're gonna like try to turn this into a thing.\" And he was telling me they're making Moshi shampoo and body wash, and you know, it's going into every category, but unfortunately that one didn't work out.\n\nWe have to get Michael on, by the way.\n\nI was going to say that we have to get Michael in the pond because...\n\nHave you met him? He is one of the coolest guys uh, I've met. He's such a nice guy, first of all, like total genuine good dude.\n\nSuper creative. Really creative genius. And then also like a rock star kind of like when you meet him, you're like, \"Oh, I'm talking to Russell Brand's like, you know, cooler cruer brother.\"\n\nYou should everyone should Google him. His name is Michael Actton Smith. And I remember back in 14 or 13 or 12 where... I mean, I'm still interested in this, but I was like, I want to be like... I was like looking for a person I wanted to be like, and it was like him because there was like photos of him like holding hands with like Paris Hilton or like he was like... if you Google like Michael Aton Smith, like he...\n\nbut they're not even dating. That's the best part. Just holding hands. He was like... he had like paparazzi photos of him because he would had this like tech angle, even though he wasn't exactly in tech, but he... if you guys Google him and see what he looks like, you'll understand. He looks like...\n\nDaily Telegraph described him as a rockstar version of Willy Wonka. That's his Wikipedia page.\n\nIt's great. This guy was so cool. And now he has since started calm, which I have no idea how big it is, but it's hundreds or hundreds of millions or billions.\n\nA multi-billion dollar company.\n\nHe's the man. This guy's absolutely the man. And he's been the man for 20 years. He has... he has... he is... he's amazing.\n\nOkay, I'm going to call him after this and be like, \"I will fly to you. Let's do an episode,\" because...\n\nWhere does he live now?\n\nI think he was in the UK. Uh, he was kind of back and forth between like, you know, US and UK. I think he's in the UK now.\n\nHe's just like a rich guy now. He just like does what he wants.\n\nWell, I don't... I think he always did what he wants. That's why he was uh, that's why he was our hero.\n\nThat's the difference between anything to do with being rich.\n\nThat's the difference between guys like me and guys like him, I guess. Like he...\n\nExactly.\n\nWe chased money and money chased him.\n\nYeah, he didn't run very fast. Uh, this guy's the man.\n\nYeah. No, that's hilarious. Okay, I have another one for you. Can I give you another one? So, we did kids toys. I have another one. You might know the story of this one. Have you ever had one of these before?\n\nOkay. What's this?\n\nOh, I'm holding up...\n\nNo, it looks like that bubble gum.\n\nA box of Tony's Chocolonely.\n\nHell yeah, brother. I love Tony's Chocolonely. Do they have some that have Pop Rocks in them? By the way,\n\nI've been saying it wrong for a long time. It's not Tony's Chocolone. It's Tony's Chocolonely. Do you know that?\n\nI just call it Tony's. I love Tony's. I learned... I have always bought them, and then when we hung out with uh, uh, Mr. Beast, I kind of... he told us the backstory. I didn't realize how amazing they were. I love Tony's.\n\nYeah. Yeah. They're... And their backstory is even better than I thought cuz when we were hanging out with Jimmy, he was like, \"Oh, yeah. I um, you know, he... for Feastables really wanted to get Fastables to have a supply chain that had no child labor. He's like, \"You know, most of the cocoa farms in Africa have child labor. All the big uh, chocolate brands, you know, Hershey's, etc., they all buy from them.\" When I learned that, that was effed up. I went over there and we try and we've basically been spending, you know, a couple years now trying to fix the supply chain so that that doesn't have to be the case. He was like, \"Every company... I don't like this, this, or that thing about them, but there's one company that I really admire that seems to be doing something well.\" And I think that's how he like phrased it. And he said, \"Tonies is the one. They do things right.\" Is basically what he said.\n\nExactly. And he actually called the founders of this and learned from them of like, \"Okay, what do I need to do?\" Which is cool because they were the ones who were who initially made the push.\n\nBut do you know the backstory of why they made the push into doing this?\n\nWasn't it started by an actor or a famous person in Holland or something like that? Like journalist?\n\nA journalist. Okay. It was like a non-businessiness person who started it, and they started it. It's one of these cool stories where they didn't so much care about chocolate. They cared about like helping the earth or human rights or something and we're just so happened to be doing it via chocolate. Like it was some like story like that, wasn't it? So the story is um, these... I think there was two uh, Dutch journalists, but these two Dutch journalists, they're covering the chocolate industry on their TV show, and um, they hear about, you know, that the chocolate companies are all... all the chocolate... all the cocoa comes from West Africa, and that there's a lot of child... yeah, slavery and child labor happening on the farms there. So they want to go and uh, investigate. So they go down there, they investigate, they find that it's true. And um, they put, you know, they put out a story to try to help. And um, I think the sto... the exact story is that at one point all the big chocolate companies signed like a treaty. They signed like a pact to say, \"We're going to stop this.\" And I guess like years later, they had gone back and they had gone to investigate, and it was like the exact same situation. They saw that it kind of nothing had really changed. And so these guys are pretty disheartened by it. So they decide... like this is where the story gets crazy because a normal person, even a normal... a great journalist would just report the story, maybe use some some some choice language when they when they talk about it, and then they would shake their finger at them and move on. But these journalists went and did like, you know, took the exit off of High Agency Avenue and were like, \"No, no, no. Watch this.\" And so the guys, they come back and they do... they decide to do a publicity stunt. So he eats the chocolate, and he calls the police, and the police come, and they're like, \"What are you doing?\" And he goes, \"I'm eating chocolate that was made with slave labor and child labor.\" And they're like, \"That's what? That's not a... you're eating chocolate. That's not a crime.\" He goes, \"No, no. actually according to statute blah, blah, blah, knowingly consuming this product, knowing what I know, that this is the product of child labor and slave labor, that's actually illegal. Arrest me, boys.\" And so they lock him up, they take him to jail, and that becomes...\n\n\nThis viral sort of news stunt that brings even more attention to this. Now, prosecutors end up dismissing the case because they're like, \"We're not going to prosecute this,\" but they decide to go in and create their own ethically made chocolate brand, and they decide to call it Tony's Chocolonely because they're like, the guy's name is Ton, and that's his Dutch name, but the Americanized, westernized version of Ton, I guess, is his name would be Tony. So they go with Tony's, and instead of, and he said it's going to be very lonely to build a chocolate company that's actually trying to be ethically sourced. So he called it Tony's Chocolate Lonely. Okay, great.\nAnd that's how they felt in their fight against the cocoa industry.\nAnd it becomes a hit pretty much right away. They sell 20,000 bars in two days because of the public resonance with their story, and it becomes the bestselling chocolate brand in their market, which is the Netherlands. They get like a 20% share in the Netherlands. It passes up Mars and Nestle and other competitors there. And then they start expanding, and they keep expanding, and then they start finding like-minded brands. So there, you know, I don't know if you know about Ben & Jerry's, but Ben & Jerry's is also one of these like very strong ethical, moral, opinion-driven. They stick to what they want to do.\nGood people, corporations.\nI actually saw Ben or Jerry, I forgot which one, talk at an event I was at, like 15 years ago.\nAnd I remember being pretty blown away by the how genuine it was for them and how the extent that they had gone, right? So, for example, I don't know if you know, like they have this one flavor that's like their brownie flavor. I forgot. Like, you know, I'm so [ __ ] fit now, I can't even remember the name, dude. It's insane. Chocolate fudge brownie. Something something fat people eat. So,\nSo, that's so my past, I just can't even remember.\nYou're like, \"I barely remember how that felt last week.\"\nBy the way, meanwhile, I'm holding up this tummy. Three bars are missing from this pack. Blame it on the kids.\nMy wife gets pissed off at me because whenever we bring a treat to a friend's house, we bring dessert, they cook dinner, and like it's already open. Like she's like, \"What the hell? You can't give a pack of ice cream when there's like one.\" I'm like, \"Why not? We're going to open it anyway. Like half an hour. Why can't I open it now?\" That's sort of what That's sort of what happened.\nExactly.\nShe's like, \"I'm a...\" She's like, \"I'm a...\" She always compares me to like a bear looking in the cabinets for honey. And I get my brother-in-law like this. My brother-in-law Aaron, he's one of these people that, like, you know, doesn't eat a ton in general. Like food's not a big He's not a big foodie.\nYeah.\nBut if you leave a snack, he's like a bear. If you leave a treat in their house, it's gone by the morning. And you're like, \"Did you wake up?\" And and and so like he'll eat the whole bag, right, of anything. And so my sister calls it, like, with Oreos, like, \"Oh my god, Aaron's doing a line right now.\" I was like, \"What?\" And doing a line to her meant you eat the entire row of Oreos. Like he did a whole line. And I just thought that was so funny. Aaron likes to party. Exactly. We got to have him back on. Brother Aaron, the OG's, the real OG's know he had two guest cameo experiences like way back in the first 30 episodes. It was hilarious. Anyways, chocolate company.\nSo Tony's Chocolate Lonely, what did they do? Um, or Ben & Jerry's finished the Ben & Jerry's thing. They opened up a factory, I think, somewhere like in upstate New York or something like this. And they, they, it was after they met um, what's it called when you get out of jail and like you're in the program, but you like don't want to go recidivism, like they wanted to reduce recidivism, like people go back, end up back in jail,\nwhich is traditionally incredibly high. It's really high, and one of the big drivers of why do people who, after a long sentence, get out and go back? It's not because they're like kind of morally corrupt at their core. It's like they couldn't get a job, and then they didn't have any money, and they didn't have a social life, and\npre friends were losers or they left prison without knowing anyone but only have $50.\nExactly. And so a big one way to decrease recidivism is if people can get a job, but nobody wants to give them jobs. So they created a whole factory. Their brownie factory is all brownies made by ex-cons, basically, the Ben & Jerry's flavor. They like wanted to, they, they met some guys who had a good recipe, and they like built a factory around them essentially. So they're dogooders. Um, so Tony's Chocolonely, to break into the US, starts partnering with Ben and Jerry's. Um, and the revenue has just grown and grown and grown, and so like last year, I think they did 200 million in revenue, and they made this like a legit chocolate company that started with two journalists just basically trying to make a stand against the man. How cool is that?\nThis is awesome. This is so cool. I, uh, do they run the company now?\nNo. So they're out now. Um, there's like a CEO. They like, you know, it's just kind of run by like, you know, normal suits basically at this point. And they get some flak because like, um, their supply chain is still not perfect, and but they're very transparent about it. So the crazy thing is, like, they'll report that they had like, you know, 11 issues this year of like child labor discovered in their supply chain, and people are like, \"See, you're not totally free,\" and they're like, \"What we're trying to like, we're trying to be transparent and say, you know, we, we're way less than anybody else. And we're also honest about this, and we're reporting it so that we can keep improving this,\" but they get some flak as like, you know, I guess like skeptics say that maybe they're just greenwashing at this point since the founders left. And even I think the founder has sort of alluded to, like, \"It's not the same since we left.\" I don't know the exact story. It's like I'm trying to read these like Dutch translations of articles and decided that like I'd rather just eat the chocolate and chill. Um, so I'm not sure the exact story, but I think there's maybe a little controversy around that.\nYeah, I, uh, I've known about this brand for a while, and this, and I didn't know the, I only knew what Jimmy had said, which wasn't in this depth, but it makes me like them way more. The product's awesome. I mean, I love the brand. They also, and I, I eat the [ __ ] out of them. I mean, it's it messes me up, but that's cool.\nMaybe you could be the influencer that blows them up even more. Shaan, I eat the [ __ ] out of them.\nIt's just like you, most of my like guilty evenings start with a bar of Tony's. Uh, like, and the end of how much time we got. Uh, the issue is they would sell their candy like it used to come in like the extra size. It was like a huge bar. They only sell in bulk.\nBy the way, did I ever tell you about the time we were talking about recidivism? This is not entirely related to business, but I think you'll get a kick out of this. Did I tell you about the time? Do you know that I've been to, like, I think we've talked about this. I've been to San Quentin a few times in Indiana State Prison.\nSo you've mentioned that you did, but I don't know the exact story. What's what's\ntell you the background of this. So I've gone to, uh, I have a friend who I'm This is the story. It's going to be about him, but I've been to Indiana State Prison a couple times, or once I went to San Quentin a few times. One time we went to Indiana State Prison. Uh, so we, we go because my friend has this charity called The Last Mile. And the idea is, like, when you commit a crime, particularly murder, you're not always sentenced to life. You're inevitably going to get out. And it's better for that person if if they get out and have a job. It's better for society if they get out and get a job. And it's better for the taxpayer if they get out and get a job because you don't want them to go back to prison because that's that's bad for everyone. And so it's we are all incentivized. It's totally bipartisan to get this person to be trained and to get a job. And so this company, The Last Mile, started by my friend Chris, they uh, help you learn, I think when I went, I think they were learning uh, WordPress. I don't know what they learn now, but this was a while ago. They were learning WordPress or they were learning like some uh, front-end development, so you can get a job at like an eBay or like coding now.\nYeah. I don't know what they do now.\nYeah. They have like some like weird like uh, like hot or not apps.\nYeah. I don't know what these guys are doing, but my friend Chris started it, and he uh, was a prominent venture capitalist. He helped uh, he was the first investor in Wish. He was an early investor in Snap. He did uh, Boom. He did all these other like cool startups. And for some reason, one day he went and volunteered at San Quentin at a prison. And he was like, \"I think this is my life's mission to like help reduce recidivism,\" meaning when you get out of prison and uh, you don't go back. And so he created this thing called The Last Mile. They now have hundreds of employees. They've had thousands of people who have gone through their program. And uh, I up until recently, I, he told me this stat a couple years ago, so I, I don't want to like jinx him. I don't know the update, but of the thousand or 2,000 people who graduated, not one had ever been back to prison. And that's like a huge thing. And uh, and so it's really interesting that this tech person has uh, like he quit, so he doesn't invest anymore. This is all he does. And I talked to another guy, Mike Novogratz. Uh, he was on the pod uh, two weeks ago, and that's his thing now, too, is uh, reducing recidivism. So, reducing the rate that you go back to prison. But I know a bunch of people who have given up their careers to go pursue this. I'm on their website right now. Pretty crazy stats. So, it says since the 70s, the prison population of the US has increased by 700%.\nWhich is not what you would expect. Uh, you know that's not just like, \"Oh, that makes sense, it should grow every year.\" It's like, \"No, no, the prison population should not necessarily grow at that rate.\" It says that every prison, every person in prison has an annual cost to the American taxpayer of $70,000, which means we pay about $50 billion a year is spent on state and federal prisons. Um, isn't that crazy?\nThat's it's it's it's amazing. Right.\nThe Last Mile's participants in The Last Mile who who go through their, I guess it's like an education program as they get out, have a 75% employment rate when they come out, which is I wonder what the non, I wonder what the baseline is. It's got to be half that or\nWell, so basically what happens, and I, and I talked to some of these guys when they were in there. They were like, \"Look, when I got out, I had been in for 10 or 15 years. I was a thug. Like I didn't want to associate with my old people, and like my family had either died or wasn't around.\" And they basically gave me a bus ticket and 50 bucks. And I was like, \"Sir, where do I go? I'm not sure where I go to right now. What do I do?\" And so they're like, \"That's why I came back here is I just started going back to how I used to behave.\" By the way, why does he have a um, this guy Chris looks awesome? Chris Reditz. Why does he have a serious radio show? What does does that get broadcasted into in the prisons in some way, or like is that just external thing?\nBoth. So he h So Chris is interesting. So we had Michael Harris on the pod. Michael uh, Harry O is his nickname. Harry O is the founder of Death Row Records. Chris is kind of, he I joke, he's an OG. He's he's an original gangster. So he knows all of these guys. So he's friends with Dr. Dre, Snoop, the founders of Death Row, all these cool guys, and they all have this like blend of like hip-hop, but also like crime like interests. And so he decided to have a show with Sirius where he would get some get some of these cool guys on the radio show, and they would talk about what his issue is, but also it was like wrapped up in like kind of cool stories, cuz it's kind of like like hip-hop and like celebrity. And so he had a show for serious where he would talk about it.\nDude, this guy's living the dream. Got rich, decided to do good in the world, has a great podcast, a triple threat. I love it.\nHe's cool. And so he actually, so I became really close with them. He invested in my company when I was a 25-year-old or 26-year-old in San Francisco. Very coincidentally, we both moved to this small town in Westport, uh, Connecticut together, and we hang out all the time. And his wife, her name is Beverly, she's a 95 lb woman. And I've been to San Quentin, and we we were walking on the yard with these guys doing like bench press and sit-ups and whatever. And I walked with this little lady through the yard, and the Red Sea parted, and she just walked through, and she's like, \"Tyrone, how are you?\" And she would go\n\n\n\"Miss Bev, nice to see you.\" It was the craziest thing that I've ever seen. It was like, I'm telling you, she like ran this prison yard. She was the only woman there, and it was the craziest thing I've ever seen. And they have a joke that says, \"If it glow, you may go.\" When you walk in to San Quinton, they stamp your hand. And so when you leave, you have to show them your stamp underneath a black light in order to get out. And they would do jokes where she would wink at the guy when I'm walking in, and he didn't actually stamp me. He just pretended. And I would go to scan my hand to leave, and my hand didn't glow. And they're like, \"Sir, you cannot leave. We have to get this figured out.\" And I was like, \"I'm not staying here.\"\n\nSo, like they would pull like tricks on you. Like when you go and see this place, it was wild. But Chris and Bev uh are two people when I think of how to live life, it's them. That is the way to go.\n\nThat's dope. Can I tell you a related story? So, my buddy Trevor was writing a book, and he did this great, a very smart move, which I, I never really heard anybody else do, but I thought it was a good idea. He goes, \"Hey man, uh check your email.\" I check my email, and there's like a plane ticket, and it's a plane ticket to go see him. And he's like, um, I'm going to do, I want to write this book, and I want it to be great, and I could sit here and brainstorm this on my own, but I really want to do something that I'm calling a bookstorm. And he basically decided to fly out the five kind of smartest, most interesting people he knew to hang out with him for a day and just help him flesh out and brainstorm the book together. And he's like, \"I will owe you one for life, but I just really respect you and trust you, and I really want your help with this because I'm trying to make this great.\" I go, and in the room is basically my buddy Trevor, his brother, and then there's the um head of like the women's volleyball, uh the US women's volleyball team, uh which is like way outperformed in the Olympics and won like a bunch of gold. And there was one other person, and then there was this guy, Larry. I'm like, \"Oh, I'm a professional brainstormer. This is literally what I do.\" I'm like just ready to rock and roll. But I'm just blown away by this guy Larry. Every time this guy Larry opens his mouth, he says something that's super wise, super smart, on the nose. Just a few words, but he's always on point. And so after about an hour of the brainstorming around the book, I was like, \"Dude, I got to ask Larry. I missed the intro. What's your story, dude? Cuz you're incredible.\" And Larry tells the story where Larry's like, \"You know, I um my name's Larry, blah blah blah.\" He goes, \"I was incarcerated for the past 22 years.\"\n\nWow.\n\nAnd I think he had just gotten out, I, I don't know how long it had been, maybe a year or two, something like that. And he goes, \"Yeah, from the age 18,\" he's now 40. He's like, \"At age 18, I was arrested and I was I was in for you whatever, 22 plus years.\" And I was like, \"Larry, no offense, but you just got out a couple years ago. How are you so smart? How do you know all this stuff?\"\n\nHe would have these amazing polls where whatever we talking about, he would reference this thing in this book and this quote he could just recite by memory. So Larry, I'm like, Larry, how do you know all this?\n\nAnd he goes, I was incarcerated at age 18. They lock you up and throw away the key, right? Like you're basically like the lowest man on the totem pole for society. They don't nobody invests in you at that point. You're you're a sunk cost.\n\nAnd so he's like, I was, you know, getting in trouble, and it was a rough place, and it was not a good time. And he's like, \"I made a decision. I'm no longer in prison. I'm in university.\" And he's like, \"So every day I just studied. I just decided to go to university for the past 20 years.\" He's like, \"I decided to read all the books and learn and write and better myself.\" And he's like, \"I would literally change what I saw. I would walk in the prison yard, and I wouldn't see the barb wire.\" He's like, \"I saw roses.\" He's like, \"I literally just re brainwashed myself that I am not in prison. I am in university.\" And I carried myself like that, and I acted like that. He made the most of what was, you know, otherwise a very bad situation. I just remember being so blown away and inspired by this guy, Larry, uh, when I heard that heard that story cuz I was like, you know, if Larry can do that at a life sentence in prison, this sounds stupid, but like then I can be bored in a line at Starbucks for an hour or, you know, whatever. Like you can change where you are. You don't have to be in the situation that it looks like you're in. Like you can literally just decide, no, no, I'm in university right now. No, no, I'm in a spa right now. No, I'm in I'm in the brainstorming session right now. I'm in I am where I want to be about that.\n\nThat's so cool. Yeah, it's really challenging because on one hand, for some reason, you start you feel like sad for someone like cuz you meet someone like I a lot of the guys I met, they I think they kind of had atone for their sins a little bit where like they've changed, but you're like, \"Oh, I feel so bad for you. Like that sucks. You didn't deserve this.\" And then you like learn about what they did, and you're like, \"Ah, actually, no. uh like consequences exist for a reason. Like that sounds fair to me. Uh and it creates like a you get whenever I've done these things with these guys, I get the so many mixed emotions. It's a very challenging thing. It's a very hard thing to be part of, too. Uh but it is a no-brainer, right? You want someone to like\n\nYeah.\n\nnot go back.\n\nDid I tell you my embarrassing prison story?\n\nNo, but that sounds so awesome.\n\nThis can go so many ways.\n\nSo, I go I I go with this. What are you making dad jokes in your first day in?\n\nSo, so um so I moved to Silicon Valley, and I'm working with this guy, Michael Burch. And Michael Burch is this wonderful guy. Michael's built a successful career in Silicon Valley. He's basically like a billionaire. So one day he messages me like, \"Pack like pack a bag with enough clothes for a day, two days, and um meet me like at like whatever, like meet me at like 8:00 a.m. at the spot. You're not going to work today.\" I'm like, \"All right, I don't know what's going to happen.\" So I go, and we start.\n\nYou had no idea where you were going.\n\nI think he tells me on the drive that we're going to he's a part of this group called the Inside Circle, and Inside Circle was a where they take guys from the outside to go meet guys on the inside, and um it was at the prison Folsom, was it called Folsom prison?\n\nYeah, Folsom. And so we go drive there. It's a maximum security prison. And I'm basically just a huge wuss, right? So I don't know what I don't know what I'm getting into. I don't know what I didn't actually sign up for this. Michael's just kind of like, \"Trust me, you you'll like this. This is good. You should do this.\" I still don't really understand what we're doing. I I think it's like a, you know, like Dare where they like scare you. They like take you in like scared straight. Like you're like, \"Yeah, I thought it was scared.\" I thought we were just going to observe from like behind this like really thick glass. I'm like, \"Oh, cool. We're gonna like watch.\" And I'm gonna be like, \"Wow, I learned so much today from observing tapping on the glass.\"\n\nAnd then they open the door, and they're like, \"All right, guys. come on in. Like, what?\" And so we go in, and they're like, \"All right, uh, you know, pick a buddy, pick a pick a partner.\" And so I'm like, uh, and I like pick this guy, and and the the program starts. It basically it's like a men's group. So you sit in a circle, you talk about your feelings. Oh, and by the way, when I walk in, immediately my eyes are drawn to one person cuz it was so obvious to me like this was the hardest guy in the prison. Somehow this guy had sunglasses, and I don't know why he was allowed to have sunglasses. He had a walking he had a cane, which I thought like you're not allowed to have like a like something that could be like a weapon. Uh he's but he's got a cane, and he's got sunglasses, but he's not blind by the way.\n\nHe has the sunglasses like up on his head sometimes.\n\nBlack guy or black guy?\n\nBlack guy. and he had like an entourage, like he had like two guys with him who were really big and like but they deferred to him, and he was kind of older, and I was just like I don't know who this guy is, but I've seen enough to know that this guy is somebody here um and maybe somebody on the outside, I don't know, but he's somebody in here anyway, so he's in my group and his two like entourage guys.\n\nSo we get in the circle, and I'm like, okay, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Am I giving advice? Is this a mentorship sess, what is this? And it's like, no, no, you're here to talk about, you know, it's a this is a safe space, unpack feelings. I'm like, \"Oh, God.\" And so, first guy starts, and he starts talking about how he's feeling pissed off. He's feeling pissed off cuz like I mean, crazy story, but like he's locked up in here, and his sister outside is having she's being abused by her boyfriend. He just wants to kill this guy, but he's on the inside. He can't get to this guy. She he feels powerless. And he's sharing this heavy emotional real life problem.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike a gradea real life problem. And I'm I of course cuz I'm horrible. I stop listening. I'm just like panicked thinking of what am I going to say? You know when you're like supposed to be listening, but you just actually just planning what you're supposed to say. I start doing that cuz I'm\n\neverybody going to like retell a fake movie so you sound hard. Like\n\nYeah. So I'm like my my startup doesn't have product. This is really grinding my gear. What the hell am I going to say? I don't have real world problems, right? Like my life's pretty good. And the C we're going around the circle, and it's just one crazy like real problem after another, and then um and then it's getting to me, and I'm just like what am I going to say? And so I'm like all right I guess I go deep in the bag. I'm like all right I do have you there is something that's like pretty heavy. I don't really talk about this normally, but like I guess thank god I have this because this is the time and place to unpack this story. And so I start unpacking this story, and in my mind I'm and also I'm like I'm talking kind of slower and dramatically cuz I'm like let me really ham this up a little bit. Like let me not let me not be me and laugh during this. Let me uh you know try to be serious here. And I think I'm doing a great job. And the guy with the glasses just midway through is like, \"Man, I don't believe none of that shit.\"\n\nAnd I'm like I'm like, \"No.\" And I immediately I'm like, \"No, it's true.\"\n\nHe goes, \"I know it's true.\n\nHey. And I'm like, \"So what? Just to clarify, you said,\n\n\"Are we cool? What's going on?\" And he was like, and he was like, \"Man, that ain't your truth though.\" And so he's like, \"It's true, but that ain't your truth.\" And I'm like, \"What is this puzzle? What is this riddle? I don't know what this means.\" And then um creates this like really intense moment where I had to stand up, and he's like they're like, \"All right, it's time to do the work.\" I'm like, \"What?\" and stand up like we're getting beat up. And so\n\nhe's like,\n\nright?\n\nHe's like, \"What's your truth?\" And I'm like, \"What? I just feel uh\" And I'm like, I'm like I'm like, \"No, but that is a real situation that has happened to me.\" And they were like, \"No, what's your truth?\" And I was like, \"All right, the truth is I'm just trying to say what I think you guys want me to say cuz I just want you to like me.\" And I point at the guy. I'm like, \"I just want you to not\n\n\n\"Hate me.\"\n\nAnd he looks at me, he just stares at me. He stands up. He gets in my face. He goes, \"That's no truth.\" And I go, he gives me a big hug. And then we sat down. And then for the next hour, I was like, I don't know what the hell just happened, but I think I'm in a prison gang. And this is awesome. I think I think I'm accepted. This felt amazing. That's called a breakthrough.\n\nYeah, I had a breakthrough. So that was my awesome prison story.\n\nThat's great. Did you uh How did it end? Did you guys like exchange information? What do you do?\n\nDude, have you ever taken ecstasy? I haven't, but I assume assumed that's what it felt like cuz for the rest of the time I was just like the weight of the world was off my shoulders and I just enjoyed myself and and I realized like, oh, I could just be my insecure neurotic self and that's fine here.\n\nOkay, cool. I don't have to pretend.\n\nGreat. And then they were like, cool. He ain't pretending anymore. We like this guy. Uh, whatever you whatever you say now, we don't really care, but we just know that you're not pandering to us.\n\nAnd what value do these guys get?\n\nWhat a lesson learned. What value do these guys get?\n\nWell, I think you know they live hard life. No, I think it's just in general they live a pretty hard life and they go to this meeting every week. So, they have this kind of like two hours a week where they get to go and kind of like as they would say like take the mask off, put the armor down. In fact, like it would be a mix of like the Hispanic guys, the white guys, and the black guys in this session. But then they would like openly say like, \"Yeah, but like he his friend like shanked my friend.\" And so it's on. But here it's not on, but as soon as we get out, it's on again. And I was like, this is like a pretty bizarre dynamic. But they all agreed like, all right, when we're here, it's whatever, but when when we're out there, it is what it is. That's this the way that's just the way things are.\n\nI remember being like, that's insane.\n\nUm, but, you know, understandable in a way. So, they have this as a space where they can like delo kind of emotionally, mentally, which is important, and feel like a human being and be able to like express themselves. I think it's a pretty dehumanizing feeling, right, when you're again locked up, throw away the key, and you know, anybody who comes in, they just see you as your label, right? But like in that environment for those three hours that we were there, you know, nobody was there was no status. Nobody was better than anybody else or like Yeah, there was us. But I was worse than everybody else, I guess, is probably the more accurate way of saying it, but like there was no they got to like be treated well and be help and be just talked to one man to another man. Um, at least again, these are my this is like my interpretation of it. I'm sure that people who do this more have like a more sophisticated way and a better way of saying it.\n\nBy the way, now that we're talking about this and we can wrap up, but Jack Smith, I forgot this is his big philanthropic cause as well. So Jack Smith, if you ask him what he's doing on a regular basis for a long time, I would say, \"What are you doing?\" He's like, \"Oh, I'm I'm pen pals uh with like people who are locked up and they I have a system where they can order any book and I'll get it for them.\"\n\nIsn't he giving books? Isn't it a book program?\n\nYeah. Where he created a website? I forget how he did it, but uh where they can order a book and he'll buy them any single book that they want.\n\nDude, most generic name Jacksmith. You can't find anything when you Google for Jack Smith. Like, yeah.\n\nOkay. Well, maybe we do this. So, there's The Last Mile, which you could donate to. So, go to the last mile.org, you can donate there. There's Inside Circle Foundation where you can donate there. Um, so maybe do a little good. So, if there's anybody who's listened to this and inspired either to to start your own uh thing or to attend one of these or to donate, uh go do it, man. Because it's a seen it firsthand does a lot of good and um I think doesn't get the type of attention that I would ever want. By the way, the Inside Circle guys, they also made like a movie uh a documentary about the program. And uh Chris Reditz is the guy who um who I who's kind of my mentor and someone I look up to. And you can find him on Twitter. He's um he's super low-key, but he's been the seed investor of like probably 5 to 10 different unicorns. Hugely successful, and now has dedicated his life to that. So, just DM him if you're want to do whatever. He's he's pretty open.\n\nDo you think you're going to do something like this, by the way?\n\nYeah. I haven't found my cause for a long Do you have like a a career arc in mind where you're like, \"Cool, I achieve I climb success mountain and then I uh you know parachute over to like you know save the world.\"\n\nTell Sarah that at the age of 40 I'm going to stop the getting of money. So I said by by 40 I will no longer pursue any money and we will have a cause and that's what we will dedicate ourselves to. That's what I That's\n\nYou've also told me that you're going to disappear off the internet. I think this is badass and you should talk more about this.\n\nI said at the age of 40, yeah, I want to get off the internet and I want to not pursue any money-making things ever again. I don't want it to like ruin my perspective and just be a shallow capitalist and only care about that and just delete the internet and just focus on like doing something good. That's that's what that's the current that's the current plan.\n\nHow old are you now?\n\nI turned 36 a month ago. So, uh I'm uh 36.\n\nFour years away, dude.\n\nDo you think that's a crazy plan?\n\nOf course it's a crazy plan, but it's a pretty cool plan. I think it sounds pretty cool.\n\nI said by\n\nAre you I mean, what's your level of seriousness about this? Is this like that's what's happening or like I'm just testing this out seeing how these words sound in my mouth? Oh, I I just think that I think that um I think if you only pursue making money, I think that you become a very shallow person. I think that there's more to life. I think that there's been so many times where I've seen something inspiring and beautiful. And in my head, I think, oh, then we could do this and turn it into this and then like optimize by doing this as opposed to saying, \"This is beautiful. This is wonderful. I want to experience. Let's keep it small.\" Uh and so I want to like force myself to appreciate that.\n\nOne of my heroes is this guy named Felix Dennis. He wrote the book How to Get Rich. Felix Dennis was a publisher in England where he founded a bunch of companies, a bunch of publishing companies, eventually was worth $600 or $700 million. And he wrote that he was diagnosed with cancer something like at the age of 60. And then at the age of like 61 while he was like learning about his cancer or something, he got into poetry and he was like, I'm obsessed with writing poetry. Why on earth did I not discover this sooner? And he quit business partially because he was dying and because he fell in love with poetry. and he wrote in his book that if I could do it all over again, I would have quit at the age of 40 because I had enough and I would have pursued poetry because that was my calling. And I always found that to be amazing because I think that often times when we're doing what we're doing every single day, we get caught into the make more, do more, optimize more when it's like kind of I want to be in the present and I want to enjoy the things that I want to enjoy regardless if they make money. Because how many hobbies have you had where you're like, well, I would only do it if I could like make like, oh, I want to like buy these toys and like maybe I could buy like 10 of them, turn into a moneymaking thing.\n\nNow, what you're doing is actually pretty cool. You But you still have a capitalistic mindset to it. You are playing the piano and you are live streaming it, which I think is amazing, but in my head I'm like, I want to do that, too. It's like, well, I only want to do that because I want people to see me learning a hobby. Do you know what I mean? And I like that's like tainting the\n\nI only live streamed it once. No, I'm not criticizing you. I'm criticizing I I was inspired to do it because I want glory. Do you know what I mean?\n\nAnd well, I um I learned pretty quickly when I started playing the piano that um nobody gives a [ __ ] if you can play the piano, by the way.\n\nIt's not like a thing. Like uh if somebody plays the piano well, it's like, oh, cool. You can play the piano well. They don't want to listen to even one song. Nobody wants to listen to somebody play a fiveminute song on the piano. That's a very like clear thing to me since learning to play piano. It doesn't matter because playing the playing a fiveminute song is incredibly fun. In fact, I was I sent Ben a text message. I'm gonna read you this text message because I think it's very relevant to what we're talking about.\n\nSo, Pomp did a a spack recently. Did you see this?\n\nYeah. I I I saw it, but I don't entirely know what that means, but yeah.\n\nSo, our friend uh Pomp Anthony, they spacked a company, and the company's goal was to do the kind of Michael Sailor playbook, which is it's a Bitcoin acquisition and finance company. And so, what they're doing is they they raised I think $750 million. they spacked it. Um, it's now public, you know, it's going to be a public company and they basically bought $750 million worth of Bitcoin and they're going to raise debt and buy more Bitcoin and they're gonna\n\ncompanies can companies or pension funds can own Pomp stock but they can't own Bitcoin. So, this is how they get exposure to it. Is that right?\n\nUm, that's one one aspect to it. There's others which is like it's levered. So, like, you know, you could for every dollar you put in, let's let's say you buy Bitcoin directly, you could buy $1 of Bitcoin, but like their thing might they're going to borrow and buy more than a dollar of Bitcoin for every dollar of equity, you know, for example. Um, they also want to eventually turn it into like a full financial services thing. So, essentially like a Bitcoin backed bank. Um, I think that's like part of the vision. Anyways, I don't know exactly what they're doing.\n\nThere's, you know, they're only allowed to say certain things. But point is, uh, it's like Pomp, this guy who's very much like us. I think he's the same age similarly.\n\nI hang out with Anthony all the time. Creator on the internet. Good dude. And he's, you know, he's not like some uber uber uber genius that's like, you know, but he's like relatable is what I'm saying. So he's like he's like one of us. And it's clear that, you know, this didn't just happen. He's been working on this for, you know, some period of time. Maybe 6 months, maybe a year, maybe two years, you don't know. So he he it's like, oh wow, Pomp raised $750 million, has this public company now. I think he owns 8% of it. that I saw from the filing. So, like, you know, theoretically Pomp has like $80 million of value from this, right? Some creators make courses. Pomp's going to make like, you know, probably hundreds of millions of dollars from this thing if it goes well. Okay. And uh that's clearly what he put a lot of energy and focus on and did a great job fundraising for. And I was texting Ben. I was like, \"Wow, wow, that's incredible.\" I was like, \"Meanwhile, I've logged 120 hours on the piano in the last 6 months.\" And I go, \"Honestly, no regrets, though. [ __ ] love the piano, dude.\n\nSo, listen. You tweeted out, you said, \"I used to think jealousy was a bad thing, like a sin, and I try to avoid avoid it. But jealousy is a wedding crasher. It shows up uninvited. And recently, I started using jealousy to my advantage advantage. Jealousy is an incredible signal. It tells me at a very primal, no logic level what my subconscious wants. It's a heat signal for taste. I don't obey the signal, but I do observe it, and it helps me now.\" And so, this sounds very strange, but when I saw what Pomp was doing, I was like, \"That's so badass. Congrats to him.\" But then very weirdly when I saw you streaming you played the piano for some reason I thought that was oddly one of the cooler things you've done in the last year or two and I felt stronger and I'm like well why do I feel that why do I think that that is cooler? I don't know why exactly but it relates to that tweet where I'm like what's the signal there that that's sending. So anyway I thought that was really cool. I thought that was significantly cooler and I said this as well when you were contemplating making a play or or starting a business or something like that. It's like I don't know, for some reason the play is so much cooler. So I think I would pursue those like artistic things over the money thing. And this sounds like a very trite, you know, uh like not everyone has the privilege to be able to do that. But I do think that like it's better for your soul that way.\n\nYeah, exactly. I mean, you could\n\n\nAlready, you know, hear the comments,\n\"Oh, it must be nice for you. You don't\nhave to work.\" Another version of it is\n\"tech bros discover hobbies.\" There's more\nto life than money.\nAlso, by the way, both true. Yeah, both\nboth very valid points of view. I don't\nthink it's the important point of view,\nbut I do think they're valid points of\nview. I think the important point of\nview is like try to figure out what you\nactually want to do and then pursue it\nlike in a relentless sort of un um\nunashamed way. And I think it's very\ncool when you said that thing. I think\nyou told me like in five, seven years I\nplan to delete my social media,\ndisappear from the internet and and now\nyou're talking about like you know and\nyou know stop the stop pursuing the\ngetting of money.\nYeah.\nI really hope you stick to that. I don't\nknow if you will because I think it's a\nvery hard thing to do. It's like, hey,\ncould you turn down like it's like being\nlike, \"I no longer eat sugar,\" right? It's\nlike those people who like are like, \"I'm\ngonna stop. I'm gonna diet,\" right? It's\nhard to stick to a diet, but if you\nactually did that, you would like shoot\nup in the rankings of like most badass\npeople I know. You know what I mean?\nYou're already top 10, but you would\nshoot up.\nI've got four years to go. I better get\nall I better get all of it while I can.\nBut I do think that that it's also about\nGive me a percentage. How certain are\nyou you're going to do that at the age\nof 40? I just need to know. I'm going to\nhold you to this.\n60 to 70%. I mean, look, I feel this. A\nlot of it has to do with family, too.\nLike, I feel uh like when my little kids\nstart like talking and having\npersonalities, I think I would fall in\nlove with them even more. And I just\nwant to like be a good example that\nthere's more to life than than just the\ngetting of money.\nYeah.\nYeah. I'm totally washed. But the kids\nare so cute. I'm just washed up now. I\ncan't do I can't do anything, dude. I'm\njust\nYeah.ooked.\nLike the old the more personality she\nshows, the more where I'm like, \"Oh,\nnothing really matters except our health\nand being around each other.\"\nRight. Right.\nI don't know. Is that Does that stay\nlinear like or does it like uh like does\nit keep getting higher the more they\ntalk to you?\nYeah, it is. But I I think at least for\nme like there's a there is a cap. It's\nnot one of these unbounded things. It's\nnot like I want to spend every waking\nmoment with you. I'm like, \"No, you got\nlike you're too annoying. I'm I'm too\ntired. This is too much.\" But it does. I\ndo I do have like a a u it became my\nfavorite thing for like three hours a\nday. Like for three hours a day, my kids\nare my favorite thing in the world.\nThat's 3 hours a day that my favorite\nthing used to be working. It used to be,\nyou know, reading. There was other\nthings that were in that spot of like\nthat 3 hours a day of like voluntary\ntime. I could shoot I could direct\ntowards anything. And now my kids are\nthat, right? Like we're just like\njumping in the pool with them and doing\nstuff or playing a game or whatever.\nThat's like it is super super fun. But\nit is capped at like a three to four\nhours a day. Beyond that, I'm like like\nhow dare my wife make me raise my own\nchildren? This is too much. I need to be\nhelped and saved. Who's who's here to\nsave me?\nThis is the softest episode we've ever\nhad.\nAll right, we should get off before uh\nwe start crying.\nAll right, that's it. That's a pod.\n",
