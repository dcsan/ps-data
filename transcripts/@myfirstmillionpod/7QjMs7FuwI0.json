  "cleanText": "All right, my friend.\nI recorded one of my favorite types of episodes.\nMy friend Howie started a company called Airtable.\nThey're worth around $10 billion.\nSo, he has seen it all.\nHe knows what's going on in the world of AI, and he has an amazing perspective.\nAnd for this episode, I asked him a very simple question, which is, if he were 21 again today or he didn't have Airtable, what companies or business ideas would he want to work on?\nAnd he came with seven different ideas that he would work on today.\nAnd so if you are looking for a different business idea or you're an AI nerd, which a lot of us are right now, you're going to love this episode.\n[Music]\nTell me about live shopping with AI avatars.\nI personally think this is a really interesting area.\nI mean, you think about live shopping, uh, which is a huge thing in Asia.\nI mean, there there's like probably tens of billions, if not hundred billion dollar plus, uh, GMV in commerce, uh, dollars that are getting transacted through live shopping.\nThis is basically where you have, uh, an influencer go and pedal a product right now.\nIs this like on in like, I mean, I pay attention a little bit to Asia, but where like is there a website I can go to to see this right now?\nThere's actually a big, uh, chunk of Temu that is powered by this.\nUh, and definitely TikTok.\nSo, TikTok has a huge amount of these, um, these kind of like influencers that basically go and and, uh, you know, there's actually a shop tab that you can even click on.\nYou see these products, and it's a person basically describing the benefits of a product.\nSo, think about like influencer marketing like taken to the extreme where you just watch, you know, people pedaling products and and you click it, you you, uh, you buy.\nAnd, uh, there's actually one, uh, company that's doing really well in the US called Whatnot.\nUm, and it actually started\nYeah, I like Whatnot.\nYeah, exactly.\nUm, and then you know what's cool about it is like there's so much personality, you know, to the content.\nLike in a way it's almost like watching Twitch.\nIt's not just about the actual product.\nIt's about like seeing this person like talk about this product, and maybe it's a, you know, um, like a really cool like new shoe from Nike or like a vintage shoe, and they're talking about like their own experience with it and childhood, you know, uh, experiences with like the Jordan brand or whatever.\nAnd and so it comes this like really interactive experience.\nYou know, my pitch for this idea is basically, well, obviously you can have like really rich engaging experiences in the very near future with avatars, right?\nI mean, if you go to heygen.com, it's a great avatar product.\nIt's the easiest, fastest self-serve avatar product out there.\nAre you an investor in these guys?\nUh, I am an investor in HeyGen.\nUh, and I really like the team there, and they just built like the best, easiest to use avatar product.\nThat was kind of their their claim to fame.\nThey have, uh, basically pre-made avatars.\nSo these are like, you know, trained on or effectively created from like real human actors that they've licensed from.\nSo, um, you know, you can use one of their pre-made avatars or you can create your own.\nYou know, I think of this as like a really fundamental capability.\nLike you think about all the things you can do with avatars.\nUm, you know, sending a sales video, uh, where you're pitching each target customer, you know, in a in a personal way, right?\nSo, uh, a CEO sending a thank you note via video to every single attendee of our last event, that kind of thing.\nIn this case, like I think applying the avatar concept to live shopping where you can now have this one-on-one interaction with, and it could be a celebrity, like maybe you get some, um, uh, some like real influencers to sign on to this, and you know, it's like, uh, Kim Kardashian type who's actually like represented in avatar form, and each person shopping gets to have a one-on-one interaction with her about skins and, you know, the skins products that they want to try out.\nAre you guys using any of this at Airtable?\nWe actually do have an internal setup where it's all powered by Airtable.\nWe use our own Airtable web agents to go and and research different, uh, target customers.\nWe learn a lot about them, and then we can actually generate customized email pitches for each of them.\nSo right now it's just email.\nWe are experimenting with with more of the video stuff.\nWe actually have a setup internally where we can now generate an avatar video powered by HeyGen automatically from content in a row of Airtable.\nSo, it could be a list of different event attendees.\nAnd that use case I I just described, like I may actually do it for, um, uh, thank you notes for for different events that I host in the future.\nLike if I host a, uh, a dinner with with, um, our, uh, you know, some of our customers, I could actually now go and automate creating a video that looks like it's me, and I I would probably be upfront about it and say like, \"Hey, like here's an avatar version of Howie,\" like saying thank you for coming.\nAnd like the novelty of it itself actually would tickle people's fancy.\nBut, um, but like to send a a personalized thank you video from me to every attendee for all of our events.\nCan you do that now?\nLike if I if I wanted to implement, I mean that sounds awesome.\nIf I want to go and do that right now, how would I set that up?\nSo you you can do it today.\nIt just requires a little bit of scripting in Airtable, and that itself you can actually generate with AI.\nSo the idea is like you would go and create like a list of different people you want to send the video to or even a list of topics you want to create a video for, and then we already have in Airtable a scripting layer where you can define any arbitrary code.\nIt's hosted in our infrastructure, and in this case you would just define the code to go and talk to the HeyGen API.\nA lot of these AI products have APIs, and so you can go and create your own kind of orchestration layer in Airtable to go and automatically for each row ask HeyGen to generate a video programmatically for you using this avatar, and then you get a link to a HeyGen video that you could then go and directly send to a customer or download it and then attach it, etc.\nWhat's this AI personalized news thing?\nWhen I think about like my news reading habits, uh, you know, it's like I do sometimes appreciate reading just like the front page of like the Journal or the Financial Times, right?\nAnd there is something very valuable about like that curated experience, like everybody sees the same front page.\nSo, ironically, like I actually do get the, uh, the print edition of, um, of newspapers because I like that like physical and consistent experience.\nLike I know I'm seeing the exact same paper as like millions of other people out there.\nBut for anything else, like if I'm reading something online or if I see a link, like I end up usually just taking all of the contents and copy pasting it into chat or Claude and then asking it to summarize, right?\nAnd say like, hey, like pull out like the key information, etc.\nAnd I even have some save prompts to do this.\nBut what I really want is not just to do that manual summarize for each article.\nI wanted to go and like automatically look for all of the articles that are interesting to me.\nLike there are certain topics that I care about, and I just want like an AI news aggregator that goes out and knows what I care about.\nAnd more importantly, like it doesn't just summarize the news for me into like here's the summarized articles.\nIt actually becomes this interactive agent that I can talk to.\nSo like, you know, your friend who is the super news expert, they're always reading all the articles, like, uh, Nick, our our mutual friend as an example, like he knows everything that's happening in the world.\nLike you go to Nick and you get 30 minutes with him and you learn about any topic you want.\nLike I want that.\nI want Nick in like AI form, uh, where I can just ask it like, tell me more about this, and it can go and give you more info.\nDude, my, um, so my company, I my company that used to own this podcast before we sold it was The Hustle.\nIt was a it was a daily newsletter.\nThis was our pitch to our customer.\nWe were like, \"We are your smart, I think our tagline was, we're your smart, no friend who will tell you what you need to know every morning.\"\nAnd I had a team, it it was crazy.\nWe had a team of three people who would reach almost 3 million people a day writing this newsletter.\nAnd we actually were tinkering with this idea, and it was so manual where we were like, what if a user tells us what they care about and we write tons of different bits of news and we plug it into someone's email based off of what their interests are, and then we'll even go\nYeah.\nSo you can mix and match.\nYeah.\nAnd I was like, we'll even go and get like an expert like Howie to like comment on some of the stuff and we'll put some of the comments in the thing in the newsletter.\nAnd it was like I was like, \"Oh my god, this is so manual.\"\nAnd what you're describing is like whenever I'm thinking about newsletters, I'm like, \"This is just changes everything.\"\nAnd and I actually think, but you know,\nyeah,\nit could still be a great business.\nYou I would just use AI for all of it.\nTotally.\nAnd and maybe like you could take it to the next level, which is like it actually becomes a platform where, um, like Substack, you allow creators to actually create their own branded newsletters and they push the distribution promo of each one.\nBut because you're powering this like kind of white label AI, you know, uh, powered platform, like they can very easily spin up their own custom newsletter, um, you know, a different direction is like you create these like different AI personalities.\nUm, I think a commonly, um, underappreciated thing is like AI doesn't have to be robotic, right?\nIt doesn't have to just be like utilitarian, summarize this article in like a clean, you know, um, uh, AP, uh, you know, style.\nLike you could actually have it injected with tons of personality and say like be like a TMZ gossip, uh, reporter who just like sensationalizes the crap out of this like new celebrity gossip, right?\nAnd and I think there's just so many interesting ways to play around with that.\nAnd like news by nature is like a very, uh, high engagement, uh, use case, right?\nIt's like literally something you you read every new every day or maybe even every hour.\nAnd and so like the opportunity to like change how people interact with like finding out about this stuff, like I think that's a there's going to be a very large business to be created there, right?\nLike Buzzfeed, you know, Hustle, etc.\nLike you know, all of these were like high growth businesses in that era of news.\nAnd I think now there's going to be a different high growth era of AI news.\nHey, I got a quick break because I want to tell you something cool.\nSo, our sponsor for this episode is HubSpot.\nBut instead of the ad telling you about HubSpot, they just want to do something that's useful for you.\nSo, they did some research and they found that a bunch of people in our community, uh, have side hustles.\nThey start a business on the side, they get it going, and then it becomes their main hustle over time.\nAnd so, instead of just telling you about the features of HubSpot, they wanted to give you something that will be useful for your side hustle.\nAnd so, they've put together a database of AI prompts.\nSo, things that you could put into chat GBT or your favorite AI tool that will help you with your side hustle.\nSo, check it out.\nIt's going to save you a bunch of time.\nI think it's a, um, prompt database that you should be using to, uh, make your side hustle more successful.\nAnd you could use this as your little personal little cheat sheet, your tool set to be a better operator with your side hustle.\nSo, you could either scan this QR code that's on the screen or get the link in the description to get the AI prompt database.\nAll right, back to the show.\nAre you a personal finance nerd?\nKind of.\nUm, you know, I was a very early Mint user.\nUm, and I remember like really, um, you know, wanting to like go and and more like have visibility over my different, um, uh, expenditures and like aggregating it.\nI will say like, um, the the tedious act of going and like doing a lot of planning is not, uh, is is not my forte.\nUm, but I, you know, I have like a, um, like basically a multi-family office type setup that now helps with a lot of that stuff.\nYou know, you listed on here real-time AI avatar products for different vertical applications like personal finance advisors.\nTell me about that.\nSo the idea here actually is like, you know, if you're a very, um, high net worth client, um, you can get a very strategic wealth adviser who literally sits down with you, looks at your balance sheet, looks at all your assets, and talks about your goals and actually comes up almost with like a plan as good as a, you know, a CFO's plan for a real corporation, but for you as an individual, right?\nLike the business of you, Sam, as an individual, um, and you can plan it out, you can think about the cash flow needs you have, what kind of assets do you want to invest into for near-term versus long-term yield.\nAnd I mean, the reality is like most people don't get that level of attention, right?\nAnd don't get that level of of like, you know, thoughtful design to a financial plan.\nAnd and you know, furthermore, like most people don't even have access to a live financial adviser to just call up and talk to, right?\nLike, um, there is something very comforting, I think, about like getting to like literally talk to somebody.\nAnd it's maybe why, uh, a lot of banks still have like, you know, retail locations, right?\nSo many of them, even though like, you know, for most transactions, you don't really need it, like people want to go in and talk to to a person.\nSo I think the idea here is like using the really smart reasoning capabilities of the newest models, like I don't think you could have done this pre-O3, where you actually can come up with like a very thought-out, um, you know, kind of personal financial plan, um, and you know, recommend like here's how much you should invest into equities versus bonds and like here's how much you should spend, um, but do it like with a, you know, an avatar on top of it so that it's a very human-like experience and you get to talk to them and and just like call them up anytime you're feeling stressed about your financial situation.\nDo you use any consumer-facing personal finance apps at all?\nNow I don't because, um, I have this this team that, uh, that I can actually go and talk to.\nBut like I think, um, you know, to me\n\n\nIt's like if everybody could have that experience. I mean, it's awesome. Everybody would be able to plan better. Have you seen, um, let me show you one. It's called Kubera. Kuba.com. I have no association with these guys, but I've talked about them so much that I'm actually like on their homepage cuz they like quote, they like they quoted me. Oh yeah, there you are. And this doesn't matter if you're worth $50,000 or $100 million. Uh, a lot of people use, um, software to aggregate their aggregate their net worth because even if you only have 50 grand, sometimes you'll own a couple cars, you'll own maybe two bank accounts, you'll maybe have some amount of money in Robin Hood, whatever. And then if you're really wealthy, you have many, many dozens of accounts, right? You have like, uh, your you have some money with this person, some money with that person, you have probably have some like private investments. And this just does a really good job of aggregating it of of all of it, which a lot of companies claim they do that. The issue is is that Addepar kind of does that for like the high-end. Yeah, dude. I at Addepar seems awesome, but I think you have to have a like I think so like Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan, I forget who I talked to. You have to have at least $50 million in liquid net worth with one of those banks in order to get access to Addepar or something like insane. Like you have to have you have to be a uh a little bit more even than an ultra high net worth client. So like you Addepar is crazy, but I've I've never even seen it. But with Kubera, they do such a good job of aggregating all the stuff because the connections don't break. And so anyone who's ever used Mint or who have used uh Wealthfront or like whatever, the connections to all of your accounts breaks all the time and you got to like re-enter the password. Oh my god, it's the hugest pain. And so these guys have done a good job with that. But what they do is they have this version where you can export the information. Is it called, is it what's it called? Is it called JSON? Uh yeah, JSON. So you could export it in JSON format, which is what chat GPT uses, or you could just connect your Kubera with your chat GPT. It start it started as an export, now it automatically does it, and you can ask it questions. And so what I've done is I've I've used Kubera, so I use Kubera to upload all my accounts, and when you do this, you're they don't actually have access to transact, obviously, they can just view your accounts. And then I use chat GBT where I will uh create a project that has like a Warren Buffett book, or sometimes I'll have like a more aggressive financial advisor, like a book of someone who has written something on financial advising, because like you have different gurus sometimes, you know what I mean? Like different, and I can use this to ask it questions and have my own personal finance advisor. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. That's all like give me advice using the the uh fund fundamental uh investor theory. Yeah. And so you'll be like, look, uh, my net worth is blank today. If I want to be at this mark in 10 years, show me what I should do. Or uh, if I want to buy a house in 8 years, what would you suggest is a good budget to have based off of what you know about me now? You know, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it works great for that, dude. It's awesome. It's so awesome. Now, having a financial adviser is still great sometimes because you still like financial advisors often times the value is not in the advice that they give. It's the fact that there's a human being that you can trust. But anyway, I this is how I've been using uh AI with my I mean, imagine that like that experience that you're getting, but like now, you know, to your point about like feeling like you can trust a human more. I mean, how much of that is based on like the fact that it actually is a human versus how much of it is like literally just like the psychology of like talking to a face, right? I think you and I think that because of our age. I my if I had a Here's what I had to bet. If I I'm making this up. I bet that the 18-year-old today in 5 years, they're going to go to the doctor and and when they go to the doctor, they're going to tell their doctor, \"This is the illness that I have and I think it's this because what you and I would have said 5 years ago or your parents would have said five is web WebMD says that it appears as though I have this illness, right?\" Yeah. No. So the young guys nowadays, they just say Chat GPT said this, and the doctor is going to say, well, I agree with you, and according to my belief, chat GBT says blank, and chat GBT I think is going to be the stamp of approval or AI, like I think they're going to trust AI more than a human being. Does that make sense? Oh, for sure. I mean, I think like today, it's already better to I mean, everybody should be taking all of their, you know, personal like uh health diagnostics. You get a blood test or whatever and like running that through chatb, like upload it, ask like, hey, like here's my my uh other symptoms, here's how I feel, like tell me what I might have, right? Or tell me what could be wrong, like um I've I've seen so many stories from like both personal friends as well as like on Reddit, Twitter, etc., of like people who caught diagnosis that their doctor just missed, not necessarily because they're bad doctors, although a lot of doctors probably are bad doctors, right? Like there, dude, they spend 10 minutes with you, like what are they going to solve? Exactly that. So like I I had a I got an injury lifting weights uh like two months ago or something like that, and I just used Chachi PT to do PT, and they just told me what to do, and I just followed the routine for three weeks and like my back improved totally. I mean, it's literally trained on the best knowledge out there, like you're getting the the like wisdom of like Peter Aia meets Huberman meets like, you know, all of these like, you know, health prognosticators to to uh to inform like, you know, Chacha PT's response to you. I've become the most extreme version of optimist for new disruptive entrepreneurs and startups. Meaning, you know, I think um I think the world moves through these different, you know, kind of phases, right? And in in a stable phase where the technology has been pretty stable, you know, that was basically true of the web um and web tech for, you know, at least like 2018 maybe until like Gen AI hit. So for a few years, like it was very stable. The technology became very mature, and then it really became about like how can you go and either leverage your existing distribution if you're an incumbent, so it's really hard to compete against big existing players like Salesforce or Microsoft, etc., you know, in in that era. To now, like it's like the all of the assumptions are off and every company is kind of up for grabs, right? And what I mean by that is like you can look all the way at non- tech companies, and let's say if you're a property management firm, like you know, half of your cost structure is is uh automatable, right? If not more. And in that world, like the the margins on the business are so low, like um I actually talked to a uh the founder of a uh of a company based in Germany that's doing exactly this. They're they're buying up different property management firms and basically using their own AI tech to automate a large part of of the job. And actually, they don't fire people. They they keep everybody employed, but they take on more business as a result. And so they've quickly become um one of the largest property management companies in Germany, if not in Europe, um by just going and aggregating these traditional businesses and creating that AI leverage, taking what probably was like a low percent margin business to become a you know, tens of percents margin business. I mean, you know, that from a PE standpoint, that leverage is huge. So I think that's a playbook that we're seeing a lot of like excitement around because I think every traditional uh business, especially one that has a large, you know, uh part of their cost structure that could be automated, is kind of up for grabs, like think about obviously call centers, BPOs, um, but really any labor intensive um business process uh outsourcing uh companies, so that's basically, you know, there's a lot of these um offshore companies that have like literally thousands of employees that you can go and outsource course very um wrote tasks too, right? So like analyst work, like go comb through these documents and look for um, you know, kind of uh facts or or uh, you know, do research for me. Um, support centers themselves are a form of BPO, right? So you have these like big call centers that are basically uh client agnostic. So it's not just one company's call center. They can take on business from any client. So we could go and say like, hey, like I want to spin up a call center for Airtable. And traditionally that just meant like you have a whole bunch of humans sitting in a room somewhere and you know, you're you're basically hiring them on demand. And now, of course, a huge amount of that can be automated. Dude, I get so many of those calls a day and a lot of times they say that they are an AI. They're horrible. They they they still suck. Do you get a lot of those calls? I I do. Although I mean I I don't pick them up, dude. I pick them up. I always pick them up. Like I like I like want to get to know these people. Like you know, sometimes it's like that I could I could hear like where they are. Like here's what I get all the time. I always get a text message that says, \"This is Coinbase. Uh, someone in Serbia logged into your account,\" and like I know it's a scam, but I call them and I'm like, \"Oh my god, let's like figure out how this scam works a little bit.\" Like I I do it all the time. So I'll spend like I mean, you're first of all, you're totally feeding the bear because if they if you even give them a response, they know you're like you're a more likely uh target. Dude, I'm so into it. They're like, \"What's your name?\" I'm like, \"Oh, it's uh Kevin Smith.\" And they're like, \"Oh, I see your account right now.\" I'll be like, \"Uh, you do what?\" Like, \"Tell me about it. Tell me about how much do I have? How much?\" Yeah, this is awesome. Uh, and and so like they're like like they go through these whole scripts and I'm like, \"This is this is awesome uh that that you found my account.\" That is really uh do you you got to figure out how to scam the scammer? Like by the end of it, you get them to give you their their uh their info. Have you seen the YouTube channels that do that? They're so funny. No, I haven't. Dude, there's guys on my weekend. There's guys on YouTube that have 10 million subscribers and they're really sharp guys and they will like get they'll pretend like they're old ladies, like they use a voice changer and they get this scammer to install software where they the scammers uh web camera will come on and they can control like the it's like the greatest the greatest it's the greatest but these these AI call companies, they're hor they're still horrible. Are you bullish on them? Well, you know, I think the um the models have to get better at real-time synchronous uh interactions for for uh you know, for especially for voice calls to fully get taken over by AI. I think for chat, like you're chatting with somebody, like it's already better in in many cases, right? Because like you know, those chat experiences are horrible with humans because like the human is probably doing like 20 different parallel chats. They don't really know or care about you, whereas an AI can be fully attentive. But I agree, I think the voice uh is just not quite there yet. Um, you've probably seen that Sesame um, voice demo where it's like a uh, you know, one of the better real time voice interactions interrupt and uh, sesame.ai. You can literally call it um, oh yes, I did see this. I absolutely you think this is a good product? I you know, it's a research team and this is a demo product, but I think it shows where the models are going, and I think you know, it could be from this team and this company, but also I mean, you know, that OpenAI um and 11 Labs, etc., they're all working on making that interactivity better. OpenAI revealed the the the last voice mode release where you could actually interrupt the AI halfway through a conversation, like that was kind of a big deal. It's still not there yet because it doesn't feel right. I mean, if you just talk to it, like it doesn't feel like a human, but I think that will be um a frontier that we just we pass or across in the next year or two. So one of the last things you had on here was uh AI productivity tools. Um, you said cursor for email. Uh, what's that look like? So I just generally think this this um this form factor of it's not about using AI to completely replace the current workflow. Right. So the cool thing about cursor is it's not just like a chat interface alone that you're using to generate code or to say like, hey, you don't need to code, like it's actually an IDE, like they forked VS code, a popular IDE, and then they added this like agentic coding experience on top, but as a developer, you can still be in the code. In fact, I think that's the value of cursor. So I just think applying that um paradigm to a lot of other productivity experiences, one of them being email, it's like you think about email, you go in and like usually you just come in and like you know, click on each email, read each one, etc. You can currently go to a separate product like Gemini or now Claude and Open Eye both have um integrations into email and you can ask questions about your email. But I think the ideal experience is actually a blended one where you can actually do agentic workflows and maybe AI is automatically doing some pre-ereading of your emails, telling you what's important, what's not. Maybe even doing some like research across your other content sources, like looking up, you know, info in your other accounts, in your calendar, doing a web search to help you decide like, hey, like I got this pitch from an entrepreneur who wants to be on my podcast. Like, is it worth my time? Right? And it can already have a recommendation for you. So I I just think like you\n\n\nYou know, one of the places that you spend a lot of time today, I mean, news, I think email, um, if you're a developer, you're in your IDE. Like, I think that's where I would attack is like, start with where people are actually spending a lot of time, and on first principles, like a lot of that time could be automated or augmented with AI. So, I want to um ask you how you would build this because from my I had an email company. I know a little bit about email, but not I don't know the tech, I don't know the technical capabilities of everything, but like email sucks to build on top of because Gmail owns everything.\n\nAnd Superhuman did something interesting where, so for the listeners, Superhuman was a brand new email client, and you download Superhuman and you use that instead of Gmail. They recently sold last week for, I think, the rumor was 800 million or something like that to...\n\nYeah, I saw that, too.\n\nYeah, to um Grammarly. And it was a very bold mission. I think they fell short if they sold, or that's that's what I'm guessing if I had to guess. But it was pretty magnificent of a of an effort to like get get after it. And my question to you is, if you were going to build something like this, you pretty much would have to start from scratch, I would think, of a new email client, not a Gmail plugin.\n\nYeah. So interestingly, um, I also worked in email before Airtable. So my my startup uh before then was a YC company, ETAX. Uh, and it was actually, I think we were the first startup to build a Gmail plugin, and it wasn't like an official plugin at the time. There was no plug-in framework. We literally figured out like kind of on our own how to hack what's called the DOM, which is um basically the HTML representation from Gmail of of the email client, and like literally just injected a UI on top of that with a Chrome extension. And so, you know, we kind of pioneered this idea of like, oh wow, you could be an email, and then we added our own sidebar to every email that you had to show information about who you're talking about.\n\nBut could they have banned you? They could have certainly sent us a cease and desist and said like, what you're doing is against our TOS as a site. Um, and then, B, they could do some things to make it annoying for us, and like it's almost like they could ch they they could just keep moving the uh target. So like they could change the layout of the page HTML without making it look different.\n\nYeah. To to the user in ways that would break our integration. Um, and and that did happen. I don't think it was intentional. I think they would just update the page, rerender it, and then it would change the layout, and then like for a day our our extension would like be broken. We'd have to furiously try to like code a fix to it. That was like kind of the really, really early days. And ironically, um, Superhuman, uh, the founder, Rahul, was actually the founder of a a company that kind of competed with us back in that time, like 2010, Reportive.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Oh my man, for anyone who's above probably 33 that was involved in technology, Reportive was a game-changing tool. That was so cool that they created that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, you know, email has been like, I mean, it's it's it's interesting because from the time that Reportive and ETAX existed to now, like email really hasn't changed very much at all. Like you look at Gmail, like it's kind of the same product. And you know, the um status quo argument is like, well, it's like good enough, don't fix it. But I think that like, you know, to me, Superhuman was like an interesting innovation on email. Like they did build their own client. I don't actually think it's that hard. Like certain things seem really hard to do um in theory, but then in practice, like it's actually not that hard. Like Airtable, I mean, obviously it's hard to build Airtable, but like, you know, we ended up architecting our own proprietary database engine to power it instead of using something off the shelf like my SQL or Postgress to power the real-time collaboration parts of our table. And it turned out that like it was the right decision. And ultimately, it turned out to be cleaner and better for us to go that route than to try to repurpose something off the shelf.\n\nBut it's harder. You have to raise, you have to raise tens, or or you did, uh, and someone else would also have to raise a fuckload of money to do that. But also getting revenue for that, I think, would be a slog. I don't, you guys did it fast, but like Superhuman did not.\n\nYeah. And I think, I mean, Superhuman was an interesting product for a number of reasons. I mean, one, I think it was a really good product, but it was really hard to articulate like what is the killer feature or set of features that make it 10x better than email without, you know, or normal email, right? And I think it was, you know, was like faster, they had some nice features like tracking emails, etc., but it was hard to say this is like clearly a different paradigm, like this is 10x better, right? And I think that with AI, like you could now build a product that actually is radically different, radically better, um, and so, in fact, like uh, a former Airtable uh, employee uh, of mine, JB, uh, is now working on a company that's doing exactly this. I I did a little funding uh, round into it. Um, so, Chief.so.\n\nOh, is it loading for you? Okay, there we go.\n\nYeah, you have to give them, you have to write a bigger check though, so they can get a like AI.\n\nExactly. Yeah, I think it's a really interesting space. I think um I actually think that you can build this product without a massive team and a massive funding round, and maybe part of that is because, you know, like in a very meta way, like if you're very AI leveraged in how you build products, like you can get so much more done um as an AI leveraged team than you could have done in the past. Um, like Cursor itself...\n\nIt's just hard to build a business when you charge $20 a month.\n\nMeaning it's like, it's that's not enough, or that's it precludes too many people.\n\nUh, the first one.\n\nYeah. And so actually, um, one of the premises here is that there is a top 1% audience, and not necessarily meaning like 1% like richest people, but like there's a 1% power user audience of email for whom email is like their life, right? Probably for you, definitely for me, every VC, maybe even like realtors, lawyers, etc. Email is everything to them. Like, and and like if you can make them 10% more efficient at email, like they'll pay not 20, but 200 a month, right? Maybe even like 2,000 a month. Like if you gave me an awesome email product that even saved me like call it 5 hours a week in in uh in time. And like not only that, but allowed me to not miss key opportunities. Like sometimes, like I mean, I get like literally hundreds of real emails every day that Gmail considers important. Frankly, with that many coming in, like I miss some. And sometimes they're really important.\n\nI have a I have a full-time assistant, and it feels like a large chunk of her job is just categorizing my emails.\n\nYeah, for sure. Um, and you know, some people have like, you know, a full-time EA who like literally doesn't just categorize the emails, but like goes through and does research on each one and tells you like, hey, I did some research. This is how you should respond. So, I think u I think it's a huge, huge space. And um I mean, one of my lessons learned from uh from Cursor actually, and uh I remember um...\n\nDid you invest in them?\n\nYou know, first looking at Cursor, what's that?\n\nYou invested in Cursor?\n\nI I did, um, and uh, actually, I was introduced to them by Peter Fenton from Benchmark, who's our investor at Airtable, and uh, you know, just what one of the most like phenomenal uh, pickers of talent and opportunity uh, spaces uh, that I've ever met, and just, you know, brilliant in in uh, every way as an investor. But I remember having this discussion with him of like, what is the TAM for something like Cursor? And you have to factor in like, of course, like Microsoft exists. They actually literally own VS Code, even though it's open source and you could fork it. Um, they already have GitHub. They have this massive developer audience. Like, how big can an upstart get? And this was when like Cursor was probably like low millions in revenue. And you know, my argument actually was that like the the developer audience for for AI augmented coding is so large. I mean, today you might have like call it 30 million developers. That's the number that um Stripe always quotes.\n\nMaybe that actually will expand to like 50 to 100 million developers. Gets easier to develop. And then on top of that, like it would be perfectly rational for every single one of those people to pay at least $1,000 a uh a year for a AI um like an a coding agent that makes them way more productive. Like not like 10%, but like 2x, right? And maybe even rational for them to pay $10,000. Okay, now you're talking about like a 30 to 300 billion TAM. Like carving off even a small few percent niche of that, especially when like coding itself is so fragmented. You've got like different types of coding in different languages, front end, back end, etc. Like all you have to do is win like a sizable 5% niche and you've built like a multi-billion revenue business.\n\nIs that the framework for how you think of what's interesting for starting companies?\n\nI think so. I mean, I I think there's like you can either go really broad, um, like in this, you know, Cursor example or Cursor for X. So, pick a market that's just so big, like there's so many potential target users, like tens of millions at least, and for whom the the value is significant enough that they will pay for it. It's not a premium or it's not purely like a free ad- driven product experience. It's not a consumer product. Pick something that's like broad enough and deep enough where there's just a very large pie to capture value out of. And then even if you end up only capturing a niche of that pie, like you have a really large business on your hands. I think the alternate path is go really deep and narrow. So, this is more like the property management example where it's like you're probably never going to have like a hundred million users who need property management software, but like if you go into that vertical and you attack it, you might have 5,000. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And if you go and and attack it very deeply and for each one you can extract even more revenue out of them because in this I mean the most leverage way you can extract revenue out of out of vast phase is like not just to sell white label software that you charge a property management firm X dollars per month. You actually take the entire cake by buying them out outright running the PE playbook and getting leverage on their...\n\nAnd what's Airtable the first one?\n\nAirtable is definitely the first one. Um, so, you know, we're in a space where like, especially now that we've um relaunched the product as as basically an agentic first product. So you can literally come in and talk to our agent Omni to ask it to build any app, right? So like it's very much akin to the vibe coding products out there. But the difference is like ours is backed by the reliable noode components that we've spent the past 10 years building and making scalable and real-time collaborative, etc. And so if you want to build any business app, I mean for you guys, for instance, um for your business, like if you want a CRM, right? If you want a way to track um you know people who are coming on your show, if you want like a content pipeline, any of those things, like we want to be the best way to spin up a reliable business app for internal operations, like we're not trying to be like a external consumerf facing prototype tool, like if you want that, go to like, you know, the replets and the vzeros etc. world to spin up like a consumerf facing hobby app. But like for a business app, like you know, the the need for that definitely is at least tens of millions of people out there who want to build apps for their own business, and every single business should be creating apps this way and probably replacing is you know uh over the next few years like old legacy software with this. What's uh last question, what's this uh all you wrote on the sheet you just wrote exotics question mark.\n\nExotic ideas um for um uh for AI, like so that you know, just more off the beaten path stuff. Um, I think I think there's some like really interesting new niches that will be created. Like an example would be like what's the next consumer social app that's AI native, right? And I don't think that just means like, you know, it looks like Instagram, it looks like Tik Tok, and it's got some like AI features to help you like write posts and and so on. Like I think it might mean like I mean there are a few startups that are trying to do this where, you know, it's like you actually have like social networks or chat groups where half the participants are actually AI avatars, right? And like what does that look like? Um, and and uh, I think what's interesting about this space is that like unlike the PE AI approach where it's like take a known problem and do something that's very like solvable, right? Like automate support cost, automate property management costs with AI. It's like you can very clearly visualize what that looks like. I think what's really interesting is that like we don't know what the consumer uh behaviors are going to look like in an AI native era. Like, you know, we saw the transition from like linear TV to internet um to mobile, etc. And at each point, I think there were there were some surprises about like the the the way that the content and the engagement patterns actually change, right? It's not like we just took people watching linear TV and then gave them YouTube to do the same.\n\nWe somehow went from TV to watching video games on my phone.\n\nExactly. Yeah. I mean, like nobody would have guessed like Twitch, right? Um, like how's that like the big thing? And so I just think like there there's um when you have people who are not just technologists, like the the first wave of post-ChatGPT innovation was very much driven by like technologists who are very close to the uh the models and the model research and understood what the models were capable of. I think we're going to see more and more people who are actually more artists than technologists and think about like the artistry of like what does consumer psychology and behavior look like when you have this this new paintbrush, which is like AI powered experiences. In some cases, I think you can create like hyperengaging consumer engagement uh consumer experiences that like actually could be even more addictive than than uh you know, social media is today, right? Imagine like...\n\n\nYou have, you know,\npeople have like the perfect girlfriend\nor boyfriend avatar.\nYou know, people are already kind of doing this, right,\nwith even chat or Grock, etc.\nGrock unhinged.\nI don't know if you played with that, but like it's it's pretty interesting.\nLike it's Grock, the Elon AI product, but unhinged mode is where and they also have a sexy mode, which you can guess what that is.\nIt's basically where they've taken off all of the um, the PG and safety features that Chad and Claude have, right?\nSo like you could have a very explicit conversation with this AI and it will happily engage, which just kind of shows you like most of the AI experiences we're getting, especially from the big model companies, have been very like cleaned up.\nDude, I ask my chat controversial questions all the time, like\nyeah, like\nand it's like it refuses.\nI can't answer that.\nAnd sometimes I ask it things where I'm like asking on like, like for example, I love history and I'll like if I'm reading about World War II, I'll ask it about very sensitive topics, but I'll just like explain to me this topic, but I'll be like uh, but anyway, it it won't even touch some of these things.\nYeah, exactly.\nAnd and you know that's the whole debate is like, you know, it's a little bit like free speech censorship, but like applied to AI, right?\nIt's like, you know, at at like how much can you actually, you know, censor AI for safety and and for moral clauses.\nUh how much of that is is even like globally applicable versus like what's moral for one one uh one culture, maybe immoral for another, etc.\nAnd and I think it's interesting to see Grock be uh they're not like completely un uh unfiltered, but like it is a lot more pushing of the boundaries, right?\nSo I had never heard of this.\nI don't think there's Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nNo.\nI mean, you should try it today.\nLike try try the be unhinged mode.\nLike I was trying to learn about the Israel Palestine conflict.\nLike I'm just trying to understand the background and like Chad won't even like touch some of the topics and I'm like I'm just trying to learn\ncontroversial like Exactly.\nYeah.\nLike um and and so I think that's that's going to be really interesting when when you start to see like people really push the boundaries.\nI mean, you know, they say um uh a lot of great uh tech is like always always uh pioneered for like the uh the salacious the black market, you know, I mean, Silk Road type stuff, right?\nLike and and so like what is what does that look like in the AI era?\nWell, you're the man.\nI appreciate your your insight.\nI like\nNo, I enjoyed this.\nThis was awesome.\nIt's fun because uh you have a really interesting perspective.\nYou're uh a young guy, but you've been in the game for like so long and you have such breath because of uh the size of your company and so it's really cool to just see your thinking and uh how you uh how you are going to like somewhat predict the future and and and all that stuff.\nBut uh dude, you're badass.\nI I appreciate you doing this.\nOh, thank you.\nWell, really enjoyed the the combo and happy to chat anytime, bud.\nAll right, that's it.\nThat's the pod.\n[Music]\n",
