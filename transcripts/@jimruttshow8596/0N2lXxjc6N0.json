  "cleanText": "Howdy, this is Jim Rut and this is the Jim Rut show.\n\n[Music]\n\nListeners have asked us to provide pointers to some of the resources we talk about on the show. We now have links to books and articles referenced in recent podcasts that are available on our website. We also offer full transcripts. Go to jimrutshow.com. That's jimrutshow.com.\n\nToday's guest is Thomas Schindler. Thomas is an amazing character and it's kind of really hard to describe who he is and what he does, but he's a guy I've been talking to for, I don't know, two, two and a half years on a regular basis. One of the most interesting people I know. He's dabbled in building tech companies, not for profits. Uh, he's a font of interesting ideas, just one of the most interesting people I know. And so rather than giving him a formal bio, best thing to do is check him out and all of his amazing projects at thomas.cr. CR standing for Costa Rica, where he spends a fair amount of time. Welcome, Thomas.\n\nThank you, Jim. It's amazing to have this conversation in public after I've had so many other conversations in private.\n\nYeah, exactly. This, you know, if we can have a conversation as good on the air as we do privately, it'll be solid gold. I mean, every minute I've talked to Thomas has been value added. I got to say, uh, just an amazing person.\n\nIt's absolutely mutual. Absolutely mutual.\n\nSo, today we're going to talk about one of Thomas's big ideas, probably his biggest so far, but could be more coming. He calls heliogenic civilization, a vision for a regenerative future. So,\n\nMhm.\n\nWhy why why do we need to think about something different? Why can't we just do the same old [ __ ] we've been doing for the last 300 years?\n\nOkay, so there's a slight danger in me reexplaining something that's all of your listeners have heard gazillions of times before. They haven't all that's keep in mind the listener base is large and only a subset listens to any given podcast. So give some background. I'll give a little idea of our and when I say our there's a there's a group of people that are roughly as crazy as I am and roughly as um independent from the current systems as I am. Um we've been assessing the system that we're in as a as a whole as human global civilization for a while now and trying to find out ways to move into a better place. And our assessment is very, very similar to many others like Daniel Schmuckenberger and Nate Hagens and all of these people who've done amazing work. Essentially the way we look at it is we're producing money at exponential rates. M3 globally doubles every roughly 10 years and we back that amount of money by our own productivity since 71 and we call that GDP. Therefore, GDP needs to grow exponentially as well, roughly doubling every 20 years or so. Now, if you look closely at what GDP actually is, it's the amount of atoms you can move in a given society. And that's regardless of whether you're a producing or service um economy, really doesn't matter because you always have to move something. Moving atoms requires energy. So, energy demand is tightly coupled to that chain. Therefore, energy demand doubles every 30 years, right? There's there's some efficiency gains in between, but Jeb's paradox working against those anyway. So, we then take the 19 terowatt that we have to turn by burning fossil fuels mostly and turn that into 100 billion tons of material every year while also producing 50 billion tons of waste and pollution. That's not a very efficient system. And we all can see that. We all notice that. But we keep that situation in place by both politics and the economy measuring their short-term success by GDP growth. And that keeps us in an eternal loop or a multipolar trap that locks us into this machine that we call the [ __ ] show or moolok that is really, really good and become it becomes increasingly faster at turning life into waste almost literally. So that's that's the big why. I mean the underlying why of that is because my parents told me so and I owe it to my children really and and to every other child um on on this planet and and we all do, not me particularly, but but to to to dedicate my privilege, my life to helping us all move into something better. And now we spend a fair amount of time to think about what could be pathways to move us out of this multipolar trap that by the way I haven't met anybody who really wants to be in that place. Nobody really enjoys it, but nobody sees how to get out of it. And we ultimately see three main vectors to do so. One is getting back in touch with the understanding what it means to be human. The way we like to phrase this is 300,000 years of being human is stronger in us than 300 years of being distracted by the [ __ ] show roughly, right? To to put it in a into a meme version of the of of a big idea.\n\nAnd but to hold on to this once you've once you've grounded yourself in the understanding that you're a human and what that actually means is really, really hard. If you move back into the everyday situation of the multipolar trap, therefore you need two more things. The second vector being coordination. The 98% of us or so without any meaningful resources started talking to each other and finding out that this sense of being human is quite similar and mutual. We could align with that, which is would result in something that you started calling coherent pluralism. Right. And we found that again and again across our endeavors over the last decade or so that um this is actually true. People see it very, very similarly all over the planet. And then finally, for groups to be able to live into this whatever it means to be human, there needs to be some pathway of on a material level get out of Moolok. And what we found is so simple that it was for a while really, really hard to believe that it is that simple. And essentially we could say the race for the fusion reactor can end here today because there is already a fusion reactor. We have this big fusion reactor in the sky that's sending us 172,000 terowatt for free, distributing that evenly across the planet. And so far, all of our ingenuity has managed to turn that into solar panels and maybe wind if you're generous. Um, wind could also be seen as second order solar, right? So, but if you look at the largest and most successful economy on the planet that I would call nature, it knows how to produce 150 billion tons of material every year without any waste and pollution. And if we if you look at yourself and you see that you have eyes and teeth and fingernails and bones and partially run on electricity, then there's not much that you can imagine on a material level that you couldn't grow, right? So if we put some of our ingenuity into moving our material stack from extraction and high intensity energy into growth in natural processes, then we would have that material abundance for all.\n\nLet me insert a data point here. I think this would be the right time to put it to your point about the comparing the biological to the human uh way of building things. A human body, all the cool things it does, consumes about 100 watts. A typical American, if you include all the energy burned on their behalf uh to build buildings, run cars, make steel, etc., is running about a continuous rate of 11,000 watts. So 110 times as much as uh what our body actually generates. Europeans about 8,000 watts. Now interestingly, sub-Saharan Africans less than 500. Uh India about a thousand. So if we think about the extended phenotype of humans, an interesting way to think about it is how energy intensive is it? And then of course then you look at the second order which is where is that energy coming from? And if you extend that picture, if you look at the different processes that you could use to transform some molecules into other forms of uh usable molecules, then usually the way we do it is quite brute force with a lot of heat with chemistry, etc. But nature or life has figured out how to do that with a lot of lot less energy. Right? So, so instead of only thinking about it from a from an energy perspective, also think about it from a material perspective in the in the sense of transforming molecules from one shape into the other. And that's called more or less enzymes, right? Right. And if you look at what cutting edge material science does at the moment in the lab, that's exactly this. Finding enzyatic pathways for material transformations that allow you not only to do this at really, really low energy demand, but also with definable properties. And that's that's very interesting because that frees you from extract extraction and from logistics all over the planet, right? You can you can literally start growing your material stack in place in your bio region. And ultimately, if you want to put a focal point on what we're trying to achieve is um exactly that, liberating that knowledge stack such that everybody on the planet has access to it for free. And we like using an analogy. I know you're not 100% convinced of that analogy, but there was an internet before the worldwide web, right? People don't usually remember that, but it was very siloed. It was proprietary. It was very boring. It was very limited. And then along came Unix, Pstack, the worldwide web standards, all gifted for free essentially to the world, open source. And that's ultimately you could see that as the moment where the explosion of creativity unfolded into what we now think of as the internet. And now as a thought experiment, what's what would happen if we did the same thing on the atom layer? What would happen if we allowed everybody on the planet the stack for free so that they can literally grow their material pain? All of the stack. And then we could build a much more colorful, thriving, beautiful, and life-saving economy on top of that. What would that look like? Right? It compared to to that image, what we're doing, whatever we're doing right now looks boring and quite poor. And it's certainly true to use the bioanalogy that uh nature is not shipping at least not directly and in a pinpointed fashion, you know, carbon from California to build a person or a tree in Germany. It just doesn't happen, right? Nature uses the carbon that's accessible within a few feet or a few miles, few kilometers of where a living thing is. And so that is an interesting uh interesting analogy and uh probably a good good way to center one's design thinking. You know, how can we learn to do things in a way that does not require shuffling container loads of crap all around the world all the time?\n\nMhm. And this might sound absurd when you first hear it, right? But if you look around, there are people just going to highlight one, Mary Oxman. She's following that path in a private company like proprietary situation. So, and and there are many others on the planet doing this work right now. Want to point out one lady who helped us see this in the first place a couple of years ago, an Mer. She runs a lab in Rochester University and she knows how to use enzyatic processes based on the process of producing nre in in nature to produce all kinds of materials with different properties depending on what's desired. But how do we get this A out into the world and B into liberty? Right? That's that's the that's the important path. Now what we currently found is that there might be an interesting synergy between large scale infrastructure projects and our attempt of trying to understand those pathways on a bio regional scale. So just to give you an example, there's a large 600 million euro development happening in in the North Pacific in Costa Rica that a friend of mine is undertaking. And um as part of this we are liberating a couple of those millions uh to build a 90 person research hub that allows us to identify those pathways and then lift them into a global coms through digital layers for everybody to use. Right? Because there are other people somewhere else on the planet who might want to use knowledge from tropical regions of let's say just an example, how can I use my local natural environment to cure bamboo such that I don't have to replace my bamboo and my bamboo structure every four to 5 years because it rots away and that's doable, right? And that's just one s very simple, straightforward example of of many and then we're partnering with another large scale infrastructure project in Sri Lanka where Sri Lankan is in need of 1 million houses and our partner has the government contract for 10,000 of them. So in that we're partnering to replicate the the model of Costa Rica and there the benefit um the win all situation that we're creating is um they were transferring the knowledge of our first prototype which is in South India into Sri Lanka and in that moving the production cost of a of a house from 200 per square meter to 100 per square meter and this is this is enormous if you think about 10,000 houses, right? And so, so that's how we earn the liberation of compostable money into a what we call a miracle factory because that's what we ultimately need. We need some miracles also there. And there are other places that have shown interest. Um, so we're really starting to move this into reality out of a out of a weird crazy dream into physical reality. In the US, not fancy new construction is about $2,000 or just a little a little bit uh less than €2,000 per square meter. So you're talking 100 versus 2,000. Well, that's counting for the fact that you can build in a way that you don't need air conditioning. You can you don't need heating. You don't need many of these things. But what's most important here is there's a different code, right? Building code in what what's called around the North Atlantic serves industry in large part, right?\n\nYeah. The building codes are famous. There's all kinds of lobbying that goes on. I happened to be involved with the electrical code people many, many years ago and I was shocked and appalled at how it's basically a creature of the industries uh that supply electrical components and the code is adjusted to be good for their businesses to make people buy [ __ ] they don't need. Surprise, surprise. Right.\n\nExactly. Exactly. No surprise. It's it's a sympto it's a sympto of the multipolar trap and that that drives the [ __ ] show. Right. you need to feed this lobbying into the system to grow the GDP and there's there's no need of fingerpointing in this. There's no need to get angry with anybody. There's there's um people are trying to do the best in their situation and that's understandable.\n\nUm so there's an there's obligation, there's a deep agreement in in in in the group people that I'm working with. there's an obligation of using our privilege that we definitely have, right? And in order to shift shift that game and therefore we\n\n\nWe're also looking towards other places of privilege, right?\nUm, if you look at where large accumulations of money have happened over the last century or so, definitely Norway is one of those places.\nNorway has taken natural resources in the form of oil, sold it to the world, and accumulated enormous wealth.\nThey own roughly 2% of everything that's ownable on this planet.\nBut they also are aware that some of that should be composted back into life, right?\nIf you follow where money actually comes from, you could make the statement that every token of money is ultimately a claim on life lost, right?\nBecause it's been extracted somewhere.\nUh, some ecosystem has been desolated.\nUm, there's been some form of death happening.\nSo if you have a surplus of that stuff, of money, then the best thing to do with that is composting it back into life.\nAnd they've seen that, at least a glimpse of it.\nSo they're wanting to compost some of that money.\nAnd so helping Norway to see how this could be done is one of the things we like to undertake, right?\nWe, that's why we package the whole project of building miracle factories around materials, around, ultimately, at later stages, around food systems, educational systems, etc., to create blueprints that then can be elevated through a digital space all over the world.\nBuilding that, we call the Oslo Project at the moment, as a nod to the Manhattan Project.\nRight.\nThe Manhattan Project did save a situation.\nAbsolutely.\nRight.\nThere was a real threat that Hitler would be the first with a nuclear bomb, and I don't want to imagine what the world might look like if that had happened.\nSo the US thankfully threw 34 billion or something like that in, of today's money.\nOh, today's money, yeah.\nProbably about 30, 30 billion, not a lot actually on the scale of things, right?\nIt would be, uh, you know, three months worth of fighting in Iraq at the peak.\nYeah.\nSo, so it's actually quite cheap to do this.\nUm, and they threw 34 billion of today's money at this and solved it, right?\nAnd we see what we're trying to do as our contribution here, um, as an inverse Manhattan Project, right?\nSituated in Norway, that's why we call it the Oslo Project, to say, let's create a situation for mutually short thriving rather than mutually short destruction.\nAnd, uh, that's what we're after.\nAh, several questions.\nWe'll get into some of the details later, but if you're successful, how are you going to avoid the temptation to fall into the multipolar trap and try to, you know, preserve this intellectual property for yourselves, monetize it, as we say, you know, if you're building the next nuclear power, right?\nWhat kind of governance do you need?\nWhat kind of agreements do you need in place, uh, to make sure this when this doesn't happen?\nYou know, just a recent example, there was a, there's a little company called OpenAI.\nWhat hilarious that its name is OpenAI, right?\nAnd, uh, you know, before they even had their product in the market, they decided that, oh, we're going to be closed AI, right?\nAnd now they're a for-profit company worth $300 billion.\nWhat the [ __ ], right?\nHow do you avoid that happening to your project?\nThe easy answer is, of course, we're doing all of this as a nonprofit organization.\nWe're doing this as a foundation in Norway, the ANS Foundation, as you just pointed out with OpenAI.\nThat's, uh, that's clearly not enough.\nUm, I can see how influx of liberated money, like from the Nova Sover wealth fund, potentially, there's, there's no conversation happening at this point, but, um, potentially could also create public oversight into this, right?\nBecause there's, if the donor into this project is, uh, the basically the people of Norway, they want to have oversight into the actions.\nSo that could be another layer.\nThe third layer is a technical layer.\nWe would introduce that for several reasons.\nSo once IP has been created in one of the miracle factories, we believe that it should be stored in an immutable way.\nWe could say, let's put it on a blockchain, right?\nAnd people like Trent McConn and his projects, his crazy projects that he's done, have provided the layer to do so easily, right?\nSo, we can put this knowledge out in the open, right?\nIt's immutable.\nEverybody can have access to it forever, as long as, at least, it's as long as there's two computers running the blockchain.\nBut ultimately, if we establish that pathway, which is definitely part, a core part of the strategy, then this will be out in the open from the very beginning.\nRight?\nSo even if, if we somehow, as a group, allow the situation to for us to be hijacked, anybody else could start building on this.\nRight?\nAnd so, and also, and this is the second, and also equally important reason for this, um, to be in a dist, stored in a distributed way for everybody to use for free is, not everybody will be happy about this, right?\nAnd if you store, um, IP like this in, in centralized spaces, and, um, then there's a risk attached to that.\nI love the idea that we have this technology at our disposal to store things in a distributed way so that they become immutable.\nSo that's a multi-layered approach, and we're still need to really experientially figure out what, how is, what's the best governance protocol for all of this.\nI don't know it right now, but I know that everybody involved at this point is fully aligned with all of these ideas, and we will put that into code to make ourselves forced to do this.\nYeah, I say that's an interesting.\nI'm involved in a similar exercise now, and the not for profit.\nI just joined the board, and we're, you know, working the bylaws to make sure that we don't fall into the, uh, OpenAI trap as well.\nSo be very interested what you guys learn.\nHappy to tell you what we learn.\nWe can, we can share our thinking on, uh, how best to protect it.\nAnd, and to your point, nothing is foolproof in this world, right?\nBut what we can do is put in layered defenses in multiple ways so that the odds are good that we can achieve what we're trying to achieve.\nExactly.\nAnd I want to add one more, which, um, was the first time I saw it was in the Consilian Project, and then my friends at AIM Imagination also did the same thing independently, actually, which is giving the organization a death date to prevent whoever's part of the organization to create patterns of continuation just for the sake of their maintaining their salary or whatever they, their gain is, and rather know that this will be over, this game will be over.\nUm, and whether you achieve the goal or not, right?\nSo, you better achieve it so you have something to build up.\nYou know, I talked to Daniel quite a bit about that at the time when he came up with that idea, and I said, \"Okay, I understand where you're coming from.\"\nBut trying for the, you know, the present to define the future that extremely, I, I personally have doubts about.\nBut what I would suggest, you might consider this, see if there's a way to implement it in your world, is what we eventually discovered is the answer within corporate venturing, right?\nI mean, trying to build new businesses inside a major corporation.\nMajor corporations have the bureaucratic disease way worse than not for profits do, believe it or not.\nOnce you start something in a corporate environment, people have jobs, they have bosses, they have budgets, the inertia to get rid of that [ __ ], it's like amazingly difficult.\nSo when we started building on a massive scale new businesses, uh, we decided to rather than having, you know, a specific death date, we essentially structured something very much like venture capital uses, which is what's called gates, you know, it's the equivalent of running out of money in a as a as a startup company, right?\nSo this project is authorized for 18 months with this budget, you run out of money, guys, you die, right?\nYour goal is to get to that gate with a proof package sufficient for us to approve you for the to go through the gate with whatever it is you asked for.\nAnd so I don't know if I'd suggest, but I would say that I've never been a great fan in most cases of this closed-end date thing because one, we don't know how long things will take.\nWe don't know what new, and this is key, what new opportunities we'll see once we get on the road, right?\nSo consider a gated approach, which is just, you know, it has a committed life of five years, let's say, like Consilians did, but there's a gate process at the end of that for everyone to decide if that goes forward, and some of those everyone are not the bureaucracy, that's the key part, right?\nUh, that you have, uh, people who have a an external perspective on global value add to the system to decide whether it should go through the gate to the next phase.\nLet's add an additional perspective.\nUm, because with the example of the consumer project, and I think it makes this case of publicizing the IP radically even stronger, which is once death of the organization occurs and all the IP is public, the only value of the organization itself is the group of people representing the organization, right?\nThere's no value stored in that entity itself because all of the knowledge is public, but what you've lo, and this is key, what you've lost are the dynamics of the organization, but that might be a good thing.\nSo, so the people at that point can regroup into one or two or n new organizations based on the publicly available, sharable knowledge and run with a fresh operating system, right?\nSo, and I, I would, I would even argue this is how nature does things.\nEverybody dies, right?\nEverybody dies, right?\nSo, your organization should also die.\nAnd, and I, I've, I've struggled with setting a a fixed date myself.\nI, I agree with with that with that push, but there needs to be some form of stewarding not only the exponential growth curve, but then also plateauing and then decay, right?\nAnd, and this this can be stewarded.\nI'm convinced of it.\nI don't know how to do it yet, but the death date is the is the closest mechanism that I found so far.\nYeah, it's an interesting conversation.\nBe interested to see how that, you know, thinking works, and particularly if the death date is built deeply into the culture, right?\nPeople will think about post death, right?\nAnd in the early days of Game B, for instance, we declared the hardcore operational stage over, and we put it into spore, spore mode, we called it, which was send the people out into the world.\nSomeday you may find conditions right to restart.\nAnd it turned out some subset did.\nIn 2017.\nWe did not necessarily have that date in advance, but it just seemed the right thing to do at the time.\nNow, here though is a negative, which I also pointed out to Daniel at the time.\nWhen you have a death date, in many cases, your best people will leave well before the death date, and you'll have adverse selection on people, uh, which is people who don't have good alternatives for their careers will stay to the end because they're being paid more than they're worth in the marketplace, while those who have more value in the marketplace, uh, will tend to, uh, ex, exfiltrate from your organization some considerable period, a year, even two, uh, before the death date.\nSo keep that in mind as another possible negative of a hard death date.\nWell, if, if, if the best people leave and the IP is public, then they can either do something completely different, but if they continue to do what that organization was supposed to do, but they get bored with the organization, they might go out and do it in a better way.\nSo, that's a win.\nIt's actual win.\nThat's the other argument.\nSo, it be very interesting to see.\nI'll be watching this with great interest to see, uh, how that goes.\nConsilience Project must be coming up on its five years pretty soon.\nMaybe that's an interesting conversation to have with them.\nMaybe I'll have Daniel on.\nWe'll talk about that.\nThat'd be interesting.\nAll right, let's do an overview of the many things that could fit into your Heliogenic Civilization, and then we'll come back and dig deeper into the material side, where it looks like you've done more real thinking about what it might be.\nBut I think the breadth of this vision is interesting to show off.\nFirst, let's talk just briefly about the categories of material infrastructure things, uh, that you guys are thinking about.\nThen let's get into some of the other interesting things, like, uh, how do you replace silicon?\nThat would be interesting.\nMy notes basically show me that, uh, you know, one of the first things you're thinking about is, uh, construction systems, and as I say, we'll come back to that.\nTell us what you can tell us at a high level first about construction and maybe other infrastructure things like roads.\nHumans have built houses for a long, long time, right?\nOr homes or places to to live.\nAnd it's just recent that we've started using the kinds of materials that we've used.\nSo a lot, a big portion of the material stack that you could use for a truly helogenic, regenerative, um, nature-aligned, life-centered way of building is already existing.\nLet's take one example from a place called Auroville in South India, um, which is compressed earth blocks, stabilized compressed earth blocks.\nSo essentially, with a little addition of clay or sometimes cement or other stabilizers like geopolymers, etc., and a manual machinery that you can use to compress the earth, enriched earth or the local earth if it works, which happens into into blocks that after a drying period of a week, two or two, can be used as building blocks for a house.\nBasically reduces production cost to almost zero to the labor and a machine that can be used over and over again and with almost zero extraction, right?\nYou might, you might, uh, want to flatten the place where you where you want to build your house anyway.\nSo, you need to extract some earth anyway.\nSo, you could use that immediately.\nNow, there's a problem on the upper end of this.\nLet's, let's, um, switch over to New Mexico, where a lot of earth construction is also happening in the form of earth ships.\nAnd if, um, uh, people haven't heard of it, uh, it's, it's really worth checking out because it's a ingenious design to use laws of physics to cool and warm a house in a way that requires almost zero active energy.\nSo it can use run fully on on passive solar, but it requires glass, a lot of glass, right?\nSo essentially, it's a, it's a long house wrapped in earth, lots of thermal mass on three sides, and one of the long sides is positioned such that it receives a lot of sunlight and shielded from the outside by two layers of glass, which essentially creates a greenhouse in the front and a temperate space in the back.\nThis is where your living quarters are.\nNow, where does glass come from?\nGlass usually comes from some silicutri sand somewhere on the other end of the planet that needed to be extracted with heavy machinery.\n\n\nRunning on fossil fuels, um, being heated up several times with a lot of fossil fuels and shipped across the planet with a lot of fossil fuels so that we can build this earth ship.\nNow, can we find a replacement?\nAnd it turns out that absolutely yes, we can.\nAnd there are several, um, let's go first back into, um, old knowledge.\nThere's a, there's a way of producing glass with from bones.\nIt's not completely see-through, but it's absolutely usable.\nAnd it's a, it's an old, old technique that can be refreshed and is being refreshed.\nWe're in conversation with a young lady from Germany who's perfecting that art and currently using it for big installations for global brands, right?\nBut not, not, not at scale yet.\nBut that's that could be one solution.\nBut also you could be more sophisticated than that and use E. coli with enzymes on their outside who in silicutri water create little spheres of glass around themselves.\nAnd these spheres of glass are being used to as lenses to increase to to to to make the properties of solar panels better.\nBut if you give them a scaffold, they will grow along that scaffold.\nThis is early, right?\nThis is this is maybe TRL 2 or three, right?\nThis is not this is not to not scalable yet.\nBut that's exactly the task that we're after with the miracle factories to identify these kinds of projects, these kinds of scientific insights and then help us all to start growing glass.\nRight?\nSo that's, um, that's one of the pathways.\nThere are actually two interesting attempts at at roads.\nUm, one is a Norwegian startup in that case.\nUm, and I want to say something about startups in a after this.\nWhat they do, their name is Carbon Crusher.\nYou can look them up.\nWhat they do is they use biop-olymers.\nThey obtain that from waste paper, but there could be other sources.\nThey essentially crush the surface of the an existing road that needs repairing and they bind that crushed material with biop-olymers and the the properties of that road are as good as a a fully fossilbased road.\nThey can also do that and, um, they don't have to have to crash old roads.\nThey can they can build new roads with that process as well.\nAnd there's a there's another startup in Munich, Germany.\nThey're called Bindex.\nThey're producing microorganisms that bind loose materials like dirt.\nThey use that for different applications.\nOne of them being dirt roads in the global south, which is a huge problem in the global north.\nYou're not really aware of that, but when it's dry, there's a a lot of dust creation with every car that goes through or if there's wind that then is detrimental to health, is detrimental to many things.\nAnd people use water, really scarce and really, really precious resource to stop that from happening very often.\nOr in Costa Rica actually molasses is used from from sugar cane but it it washes away.\nSo what they do is they bind the surface layer around 8 cm with microorganisms that they can apply.\nSo there are many, many, many applications already and I just want to want to give, um, one idea here that can help us, um, use the the power of both of those that I mentioned as the last points are startups, right?\nSo they're entrapped in the multiple trap ultimately if they're successful, they will hit a point where they need to take part in the in the [ __ ] show and extract from somewhere in order to survive in the in the marketplace.\nSo way out could be to offer a new exit path.\nWe call that exit planet that would make the founders and the investors and everybody happy but creates a win all situation for the world and also the ambition for the founder most of the time, right?\nThe founders want to do something good in the world.\nSo what does that mean?\nThat means that large pools of liberated money could offer to buy that startup at market valuation.\nSo nobody's losing anything and then gifted into the commons.\nAnd through this mechanism, we could very, very quickly point entrepreneurial activity and also capital towards life-saving solutions that then end up in the commons and allow us all to spin out of the or create a multipolar dance to move out of the multiple trap.\nYeah, that's interesting.\nIf you can get enough capital to essentially surrender itself from the money-on-money return game, my conversations with especially the next generation, the children of the billionaires, more and more of them are willing to consider that at least at a, you know, 2, 3, 4, 5% of their portfolio scale, which, uh, adds up to a considerable amount of money, though whether it's enough to actually buy successful startups, I don't know.\nIt depends on the stage.\nIt could be an interesting question to to discuss whether this needs to be happen at at market saturation, at at like late scaling stage, or whether this happens before scaling.\nThe time would be when does it become uh self-sufficient with respect to capital?\nI don't think you want to do it before that because otherwise you just have a recursive problem of now I got to go out and get more game a capital, right?\nSo if I were think about this as a way to truly liberate them into the commons, it would be at the point where the company no longer needs external capital, no longer needs external capital, but would need external capital for additional growth.\nSo if, if at maintenance point, if you want to, if you, you could make the decision, we want to capture the entire market globally or we just maintain the situation where we at because we are sustainable from an economic economic perspective.\nThat's a really interesting sweet spot for exited planet because after that the the founders and early investors will be diluted out anyway because there's a lot of capital required for the for the for the growth phase.\nRight?\nSo their interest is not necessarily to enter growth phase.\nTheir interest might even be to exit at this point and maintain the mission that was originally set.\nThat's often what happens anyway, that you know, the founders get outgrown by the business and sometimes unfortunately the founders don't realize it and hold on too long.\nThat happens quite frequently.\nThe other though might be what would happen if you engineered the businesses and the processes such that instead of growing vertically in size, they grew horizontally into multiple companies.\nRight?\nYou thought from that day one we said we're going to build instead of building one, you know, 20 billion company, we're going to build, uh, you know, 200 hundred million dollar companies that once they reach cash flow break even, uh, could then grow organically at some natural rate in situ.\nUh, it might be a a radical different business architecture rather than focusing on mega growth in the vertical.\nI actually actually have a term for this.\nI call it feminine scaling.\nIt came up in a in a conference.\nYou know Thomas Burkeman, right?\nI think he's been here too.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThomas did the emerge conference in Berlin once and he, um, asked me to do like a little workshop on deep tech actually and we had this beautiful, really powerful, uh, board of people there that did a did a fishbowl.\nIndie Johar, um, I think he's been here too, right?\nYeah, he's I'd really like him.\nNow there's an interesting guy, right?\nYeah, I love Indie.\nUm, he's given me really, really good thoughts, um, so many people of the kind of Indie.\nAnd, uh, we started talking about deep tech and then Indie put in the idea of care economy and then suddenly because it was a fishbowl, the audience showed us that we're not at all interested in what we were talking about deep tech, but they were interested in first care and then feminine tech and I had no idea what that meant, right?\nAnd so I invited, I changed the topic midway.\nI said, let's the rest of show we talk about feminine tech, whatever that is, and I only want to hear from women and first it was really, really confusing.\nWas a lot of sorting going on, but what's what's came out at the at the conclusion of it was that there's a difference in thinking about scaling.\nOne is growing linearly, right?\nAnd and making something planetary sized and stuffing the planet inside.\nLet's call that masculine scaling.\nAnd there's the The other form is more like replication.\nHaving a solution that works here in place and it's always placebased.\nThat's really interesting.\nIt needs to work here for me, otherwise it's not of value and then gifting it somewhere else or passing it somewhere else and saying, this works for me here.\nSee how it works for you over there and what you need to adapt to do it.\nThis is very similar to the to the very nuanced difference of how Tyson thinks about growth versus increase, right?\nThere's a some something just growing in size is a pretty boring thing.\nSomething increasing in in its in its density and its inter relations is not only more resilient, but also has the potential to yield more additional innovate flares on top of it.\nThere's more surface, right?\nYou know, quite simple just from geometry.\nYou take a one big sphere of mass X or 100 little spheres, who has more surface, right?\nThe the little spheres.\nSo, I think that's all very interesting.\nI do think you can that does touch back to Tyson Yonaporto who's been on the show several times talking about these very interesting topics.\nBut now, let's turn back to the hard part.\nOkay, these are all interesting ideas, but they are also locked in a multipolar trap, which is, you know, I'm a developer in Sri Lanka and I want to build 10,000 houses, right?\nAnd I can do it with these bunch of hippies, but it's going to cost me 50% more than if I did it in whatever the traditional method of building houses in Sri Lanka is.\nIt's actually 50% less.\nYou said that.\nI know you say that, but is that really true?\nThat's really true.\nAnd if it's really true, why aren't the commercial builders in Sri Lanka already do it?\nI honestly don't know because it's been tried.\nBut the first part I can definitely, um, say and people can look it up.\nUh, in Oruroville, which is an interesting place in itself, which we could talk about forever, there's a place called the Earth Institute.\nThe Earth Institute was established roughly 40 years ago in order to understand how to construct with Earth.\nAnd so there's a lot of research and a lot of, um, experience, I don't know, around 50 countries, um, of building with these kinds of processes.\nAnd these houses, I've I've I've been in them, I've touched them, I've seen them.\nThey require no more maintenance, uh, to be stable and and and to to serve as as, uh, solid, safe houses as as conventional industrial methods might need.\nSo So that's that's solved.\nIt's there.\nWhy doesn't it, why isn't it being applied at scale in in Sri Lanka?\nI have some guesses.\nThere was a actually Earth Institute conducted quite large project together with the UN.\nThere was a couple of thousand houses, uh, built in that way.\nUm, that first ran into cultural differences, right?\nThough people had problems accepting this kind of building because it wasn't what everybody else was, um, doing.\nIt wasn't what they were seeing on television, how you and everybody lives.\nUm, you want to have concrete because that's, um, how people in the global north do it, etc.\nThese kinds of ideas.\nHouse as status symbol, not house as use value.\nCorrect.\nSo that's one.\nThe other one could be a resistance by the industry because once somebody sees how it's done, they can replicate it.\nSo essentially as industry, you're making yourself obsolete if you go down that route because the the construction process and the supply chain are fully transparent and replicable and that's not something you would like to do as as a as a industry, right?\nSo I'm only assuming this.\nI don't know that makes sense in that sense, especially the cultural barriers.\nYou in a mass consumer product, it's hard to get people to change from what is at least in part a status game, right?\nAs you say, the north does it this way, therefore it must be better, right?\nEven though it may be completely inappropriate for their culture and their climate, but let's let's take the same question and apply it where it's a businessto business question where the economics come or sharply to the edge.\nUh, and that would be like, well, for the things we've talked about so far, your bioglass project.\nHow does bioglass get to the point where it's economically close enough that people will use it versus an extremely mature industry that goes back hundreds of, maybe thousands of years, the manufacturer of glass by applying heat to quartz.\nBasically, the way we think about this is that at this point we don't know this particular question.\nThe assumption is, and that's what we need to find out with our miracle factories.\nThe assumption is that as the production cost of glass essentially drops to zero money and some time and effort instead swapping money for time and effort, it becomes a no-brainer for a community to do so.\nRight?\nAnd and that's that's in a community.\nThere might also be somebody who is the person who is compelled to constructing houses.\nSo that's could be seen as a business.\nSo that uh that entity could start growing that kind of glass in place and um having some means of transaction.\nYes.\nBut but I ultimately I think it's going to emerge into a different form of economy completely, right?\nUm, I think we have to be really, really careful here not to entrap ourselves in the idea of trying to reinvent capitalism.\nCapitalism is not the economy.\nCapitalism is one way of thinking about the economy.\nRight?\nIt's it's easier to imagine the end of the world of end of capitalism.\nBut that that's exactly what we're asking because if you see nature as an economy, which it ultimately is, it's a web of actors interacting to in mutual benefit.\nI don't know how to better describe an economy.\nThen what if we could do something similar though?\nKeep in mind, ma nature is based on one person eating the other, right?\nYeah.\nWell, well, that's not one person, but one living entity eating another.\nYes.\nAbsolutely.\nRight.\nWe're It's all about who we eat, too.\nThat's the classic food web, right?\nWe're we're composting each other.\nBut but um but the the notion could be rather than seeing ourselves as an apex predator, which currently we are to our own detriment, we could start seeing ourselves as an apex custodian.\nI'm saying an not the but as an apex custodian weaving the conditions of nurturing of of of of lifeerving solutions around us in our bio region and that's actually a crucial element in the idea of the Heliogenic Civilization, which is if your entire material stack that is required for a successful thriving life is growing out of your bio region, you will automatically take care of your bio region and you will become the custodian of that of that bio region and you since you can be luxuriously self-sufficient in that because there's no real limits to to to what can be grown and I know you're eager to talk about the all of the high-tech stuff that could ultimately be grown, then there's no need for any kind of extraction locally or elsewhere.\nRight.\nIt's it's really, really important and that turns into a fundamentally different kind of economy and in which I'm not dismissing the use of\n\n\nMoney itself. Money as an abstraction is useful in part, right? I'm not using, I mean, you can see me; the listeners can't, but I'm not... I might have to use a lawn mower to cut my hair, but um, but I'm not doing that, right? I'm using the right tool for the right purpose. I'm using money as a, as a ultimate abstraction for any kind of economic activity, which might be um, quite silly actually. And so, so um, that's why, that's why I'm not sure I can really answer that question of what's a business-to-business relation.\n\nYou know, I would suggest then, and of course, we thought about this a fair bit in game B economics, is that to make that work, you essentially have to build a membrane that chooses to assume dollar-dollar economics as the measure of all value. Right? So, for instance, you could say this community, by an agreement, says that we are not going to buy glass even if it is cheaper, right? Because it's cheaper in a false sense that does not properly value the ecosystem, the ability of locality and self-sufficiency, etc. And so we, as an accord, choose to close our membrane to that particular thing coming through to provide an ecosystem that works for this alternative way of doing it in outcome.\n\nI fully agree in pathway, want to be really careful about the language. I don't think we build the membrane. I think the membrane is an emerging property of the building blocks that create a Heliogenic Civilization. I was going to argue that they have to co-evolve. It's just like, uh, this is very important. Life, we now think, could not have evolved in the open. Uh, the membrane may have come first. There's a number of origin of life thinkers who have done a lot of work that a certain class of lipids that in water will form a membrane. And it may have been that the ability to concentrate reactions in the membrane was a necessary precursor before the reactions could get concentrated enough to create life. And so, in some sense, they co-evolved. I'm going to suggest it's worth thinking about that in the same way that chemicals that might have been able to form an autocatalytic network to produce life, uh, could not do so where they're constantly being diluted by other things. The same might be true for this class of entrepreneurial bootstrapping where if you're competing with the glass coming from all over the world, it's really, really hard for anybody to get any traction at all with bioglass. And so that you may need to have co-evolve, uh, the membrane at the same time you're co-evolving that you're evolving the technology, or it'll get diluted by the, uh, systemic multipolar trap.\n\nYeah, that invokes several pictures here. But um, I, I'm just going to pick the idea that my mentor in all things money, Bernard Lietaer, um, shared with me and ultimately turned into his big life stream. So just a word on Bernard, he was the head of the central bank of Belgium before he was the chief architect of the introduction of the euro. And I met him in 2003 because I wanted to create a new currency somewhere in Germany together with the head of the central bank back then. Um, I was, uh, I was there because I had a software company that was supposed to build a platform for them. All of that never happened, but in the aftermath, in the years after this, I learned a lot, everything really I know about money from Bernard.\n\nAnd he used to relay this story about um, the city of Gent in Belgium. So they had an issue with a part of town with a lot of illegal immigrants, and uh, because of their status, they obviously didn't have uh, much income, and that led to the usual downward spiral: substance abuse, violence, all of, all of that desolation in the place. Nobody knew how to help these people to legalize themselves and to get out of that multipolar trap they were in. And ultimately, the Belgian government called Bernard and asked him if he was willing to help. He came in and he asked the people what they dreamt of. And somehow it emerged that most of the people were dreaming of a little piece of land so they could grow something. He got a piece of land from the city. He made it accessible for rent by a currency that he invented that was only earnable by doing things that would increase, improve the living conditions, the environment. So cleaning the streets, being nice to your neighbors, putting flowers in the windows, clean the house, all of these kinds of things would earn you the currency that would get you the what you wanted to fulfill your dream. And then next to nothing, the environment changed. And with the change environment, people started pulling themselves out. And that was then replicated in other cities in Belgium. This worked.\n\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, this is where you add additional dimensions into the signaling regime. You know, the problem of money on money return is it's a single dimension which then trounces all other values. When you add other signaling dimensions, in this case, it sounds just like that where you're saying if you do these good things, you get these signaling capacities to produce another good that may not be strictly denominated in terms of money.\n\nLet's try to bind this with what you said earlier about the membrane. I think the dream is the membrane of the Heliogenic Civilization, like the ion channel. The dream is the channel, the opening, the pathway to the outside.\n\nYeah. The membrane must be semi-permeable, right? Semi-permeable in a cell. There's ion channels among humans and other things. Yeah, there's lots and lots of different ways that things move through membranes in living worlds. Ion channels is one of them, but there's many.\n\nYeah, that's a communication pathway. But, but let's, let's, let's say dreams are something like the ion channels, the communication pathway between the inside and the outside that binds back to the understanding of coherent pluralism in the deep grounding of ourselves in what what it means to be humans. If we get in touch with our 300,000 years of being humans on the inside of the membrane, we're very coherent because we share some form of dream, and we usually call that culture. And on the outside, there's a, there's a different kind of dream maybe, but it's, it's compatible to an extent at the coherent level. There are some things we agree at the outer, because an outer membrane, let's call it, that controls the whole heliocentric civilization. There's a a group of small group of things that we all agree are, if we're going to play the heliotropic game, we all agree on these things. And then we use theme and variation to provide coherence around things we agree on and at multiple levels. For instance, this group, this pod of membranes could include an intermediate level membrane around them which says we're going to use these approaches but not these approaches. And oh, by the way, we have a governance mechanism to change those rules over time. Right?\n\nNow, we're beginning to explore what it could feel like to be inside of the Heliogenic Civilization. And it feels really, really weird from, from the perspective of North Atlantic mind and soul. Right.\n\nYeah. The nation state came from the, uh, what the hell was it, the at the end of the 30 years war, where we established the nation state as this, or not even the nation state, the state, the sovereign state as this all-controlling, all-coercive entity.\n\nI agree that's that both have to co-evolve, and they, they will be emergent properties of each other as they evolve. It, it is always, and that's why I start using the term multipolar dance, right? It's not only, it's never only one thing that has to be pulled up, but it is surprisingly easy to see the patterns of healthy dimensions of a civilization once you start deeply looking into and trusting the fact that um, we've already done this. We're not, we're not really inventing anything new here, but it's more a deep remembering and a reweaving of, uh, what it's actually that we're doing here as, as humans. Right.\n\nYou have to your earlier point. We're in part at least returning to 300,000 years of species history. We obviously did live as biological creatures for most of that time. 5,000 years ago did we start the transition away from being biological creatures once we tame nature in the form of agriculture. And then we made another inflection point when we, uh, figured out how to, uh, understand nature a deep enough way to, you know, do really crazy [ __ ] you between 300 and 400 years ago.\n\nOne additional portion of that, uh, permeability is maybe, and sticking with the theme of of governance but also technology, is there's this interesting pattern that um, institute Jeff West scale discovered, which is really, really interesting, a really interesting perspective to understand why people would like to flock to cities while it is very unhealthy and not a lot of fun to be in a city. Uh, people still do it because there's so many benefits of being in interconnected groups.\n\nWe now have technology that might make that obsolete, right? There's no, no clear reason anymore why we should be physically in the same place when we can be virtually in the same place. So, building on what you just said about remembering and going back in time, we're not talking going back into caves here, right? We still want to have global communication like we have right now, like we have been using for the last couple of years to have these conversations, and we still want to have that because it is of enormous value.\n\nYeah. Let me insert here that someone who's really worked on formalizing this is Jordan Hall in his Civotas conf. In fact, that was Civotas. Uh, we've had him on the podcast a few times talk about it, and he's written a fair bit, and he was indeed inspired by Jeff West, and his insight was there's really two exponentials in scaling of cities. One is the scaling of the good. You get more patents, you get more classical music written, you get more, uh, businesses started, you have higher incomes, people even walk faster. As it turns out, all on the same scaling law on the size of cities. The bad also scales at the same exponential, right? Crime, disease, mental health issues, pollution, etc. And so Jordan's very interesting but simple concept was to your point today. Why now? You know, the answer we often ask ourselves, we think about why are we trying this crazy new social operating system stuff is because you can actually separate the two. You know, let's live at scales small enough so that the the bad exponential is tiny while using technology to allow ourselves to interoperate such as that the positive exponentials still exist. Very clever move.\n\nNow, how would that fit in a Heliogenic Civilization? Well, right now it, uh, we would still have to use rare earths to build the satellites and computers and all of the devices we need to do this. But also there, if you look into cutting edge science, you see the evolution of biological compute, right? People are actively using um, human neurons in some cases. Uh, there's enzymatic compute, there's mycelium compute, there's DNA compute and storage. Um, and these are at the beginning, right? These are these are not evolved yet. They a mycelial computer can play a 4x4 chess game, right? But, but it can do this. So if we, if we actually and think again in Oslo Project scale, right, or Manhattan Project scale, if we apply the ingenuity of humanity to these kinds of challenges, we will solve them if they're solvable, but they may or may not be, that's a thing to keep in mind. You know, mycelial computing, maybe DNA-based computing, people have been fooling with that for 40 years and really hadn't found just a few toy examples that work. There should be have a portfolio of these things. We should be thinking about them, but, but we have to have keep our balance on the balls of our feet so that we make, we don't make religious judgments about what the right road is, but rather what worked.\n\nExactly. Of course, I'm the last one to fall or try, I hope I don't fall into the technoutopian trap because I think that's an actual trap of hoping that we will innovate ourselves out of everything. This is like getting on a, on a spaceship that's half-built and saying, \"Okay, we've got to travel for 100 years now.\" And uh, but we'll figure it out along the way. And of course, that's where we actually are today, right? Our technology driven by the money-on-money return engine and the multipolar trap is on the, uh, tech utopian. Let's just hope that a miracle occurs and we don't actually [ __ ] everything up, right? That's where we actually are.\n\nThat's why we're having building the miracle factory. But if you look at, for example, the CO2 pollution happening in Germany, 40% of that is due to construction, and and so if you just shift that, if you shift construction, if you reduce the need for logistics as a second order of shifting construction, you already go an enormous way, not only in reducing CO2 emissions, but also in in ecosystem destruction, right? You go a long way.\n\nAnd so we don't need to invent biological Heliogenic compute today. There's no need, right? We also have working infrastructure today. But we should start going and we should start moving on this. Um, while we're doing the low-hanging fruit, right? And the low-hanging fruit starts with the heavy polluters, the heavy extractors, construction, logistics, food systems, clothing, all of these aspects. And these are these are easy to solve compared to the compute. I agree with you, and I'm, I'm not sure I would put it much other than some R&amp;D dollars on biological compute right now, but you know, a small slice, why not? But there are a lot of, as you say, there's many things we can do between here and there. The one of the most important is solar energy. To your point earlier, uh, that you know, we're we're about uh, turning material into stuff using energy just as nature is, but and we can do so much more efficiently, but we still need some, and uh, and interestingly, I'm, I'm thinking here, dangerous to do in public, but that's never stopped me before, which is the level of your technologies is going to grow over time as all technologies do. And I'm going to conjecture here that one of the ways of measuring the maturity of your biomimicry technologies is the decrease in external energy embedded in the product. So, for instance, a fungal building block will have less external energy embedded in it per brick than a brick cooked in a brick oven will. Right? But that will not jump from zero to one or one to zero overnight. So therefore, uh, there will be a diminishing but not abrupt decline in the external energetic intensity of the things as biomimicry gets better. So therefore, we will still need to scale our external energy sources. And one that seems compatible certainly with the heliocentric civil\n\n\nization ethos is solar energy.\nAnd, interestingly, the podcast that will be on just before yours, actually, we published it, uh, last night as we're talking, two nights ago, uh, which was Don Farmer on complexity economics. He also, uh, talks about and has done a lot of work on the surprisingly optimistic, uh, learning curves around solar energy. You know, solar energy is coming on extremely rapidly and will get even more economical, uh, in the relatively short term. And, yes, there's still some exotic materials used and, uh, and such, but, you know, the main materials are pretty simple. They're aluminum and sand and some copper. And, uh, you know, we can sort of build these into these two intercepting curves: uh, re-increased, decreasing cost of solar energy and broader dis- uh, deployment and reduction of extrinsic energy embedment in materials using biomimicry. And we run both those two curves together, and it makes a lot more sense than running either curve by itself.\nAbsolutely. And I would add to that that the way we think about, uh, solar energy only in electricity and solar panels is very, very limited. And we could also add other, other vectors to that, um, producing gas from natural processes driven by sunlight, for example. I mean, yeah, I've been in conversations with people for now 15 years on artificial photosynthesis, for instance. Right.\nWell, that, that's, that's, that's advanced stuff so far. Are not successful. Uh, and I would say there's, there was also been a disappointment so far in trying to use algae to produce, uh, diesel fuel, uh, precursors, but that's another one where a fair bit of money was spent, a lot of it, oddly enough, at an American nuclear weapons lab for some reason. They let some people work on it there. Uh, but those are some other things that might work someday. Uh, but I'm going to put, you know, my own bet on that particular one is that in the short term, the answer is going to be solar energy plus hydrogen electrolysis to produce hydro, truly relatively green hydrogen, and then hydrogen, uh, can be formed into dense liquid fuels at not that expensively. And so there may well be a heliocentric road to liquid dense fuels, which will still be needed for certain things. Uh, not as much, obviously, the more, more heliocentric the material side is, the less of those highly dense materials we'll need. Uh, those highly dense energy sources, but we'll still need some for like jet, jet planes, rockets, things like that. Uh, uh, those can will be able to be built using solar energy. It could be done now. They cost, uh, Seammens has a full stack that can produce diesel from hydrogen. Uh, the current cost is about twice, uh, producing diesel fuel from market energy. But twice is not a big number when you're talking about something that's improving as rapidly as both solar energy and hydrogen electrolysis, both of which are growing at very amazing, uh, amazing rates. And you project that out 15 years, uh, one could have diesel fuel or jet fuel, which is really the same thing, uh, more or less competitive with petroleum-based products. And, uh, uh, you know, that would be a very interesting inflection point where, you know, among the things that look like, looked like it was hard to do, you know, uh, electric battery, uh, long-range airplanes, no time soon, probably, but, uh, you know, solar to hydrogen to, uh, synthetic diesel, probably doable. And this is driven by necessity, right? So the, the thing that we call the Heliogenic, uh, material stack or or Heliogenic Civilization, that's nothing special or new, right? It's, it's been termed biomimicry before. It's been, it's been termed biomimetic. It's been, it's, you can use many, many different names for this. How we distinguish the Heliogenic idea from all of the others is that we say it needs to be in the commons and it needs to be highly distributed. And the reason why everybody already right now and for a long time has been working on this is we're running out of fossil fuels at one point. I mean, even if it's, if we're, we're still on peak or before peak or whatever, but at one point we will run out of these, right? And, uh, we will, we, we don't have an abundance of materials on the planet, and we don't yet have proven that we can harvest, uh, comets and moon, the moon and etc. And I don't know if you've had Simon Misho here at one point.\nNo, have not.\nNo. So, so Simon has, has done a lot of, um, interesting work around the actual material constraints or the current, uh, state of technology and science. What's his last name?\nMisho. M I C H A U X.\nSounds right up my alley.\nSo, Simon has done a, at a Finnish government-funded institute, a lot of research around the question of how much materials will we need, right? And if we built everything on top of the current state of technology, replaced the entire economy, the entire fossil economy with electric economy, we would need around 4.7 billion tons of copper.\nNow, the last couple of thousand years, we've managed to find about 700 million tons. We know of reserves of roughly 900 million tons, which we are planning to extract in the next 30 years. So we're short about 3 billion tons, right? So where do they come from? The current race to, um, deep ocean mining is the answer to that because they're quite distributed on the ocean floors in so-called nodules, which contain a small amount of copper. Now, there's an issue with that because the ocean floors are the largest carbon sink on the planet. I, by the way, refuse to invest in a, uh, seabed mining operation because I believe the ecological costs are excessive.\nThey're, they're, they're just actual suicide.\nI think it's the stupidest. I mean, I understand this is a classic multipolar trap. Game A is sending the signal to do this. Holistic thinking about the planet that we live in and our longevity says this is a very [ __ ] bad idea.\nSo, I've had a conversation with Enrich Salah. Um, Enrich is a really amazing ambassador for the oceans, working on making, protecting a large portion of the global oceans. And he pointed out that right now, drag nets of the fishing industry are stirring up stored carbon from the ocean floors and releasing it into the atmosphere, resulting in as much carbon emissions as all of Germany. Let that sink in. Drag nets create carbon emissions the size of Germany.\nNow imagine us picking the nodules all over the ocean floors.\nIn order to have the copper we need to run electricity all over the planet.\nThat's suicide. That's literal suicide.\nWow. That's I'm glad to know that. Send me the link to that guy, too. That also sounds like very important. By, by the way, though, I got to say I'm, I do happen to know something about the electrical grid and how the math of electrical, uh, transmission works. I think that Simon may not be correct here because actually, uh, we can trade off copper for aluminum in, uh, in transport of electricity. The conductivity is maybe 40% less, but you basically just grow the size of the wire, and because aluminum is light, much lighter than copper, the actual resultant wire is actually lighter. So that the amount of infrastructure you need to hold the wires up is less to transmit the same amount of electricity on aluminum as on copper. And we have unlimited aluminum. There's essentially an infinite amount of aluminum on the planet. It's one of the most common elements in the Earth's crust.\nThat, that could be one pathway, but, um, Simon, I'm sure, has, has a, has a strong view on that. But if you, if you actually think about in more distributed ways, like, like you said, it's, it's a, it's a both way, right? There's a, there's a crossing at one point after which we don't need to put wires everywhere anymore because we can actually produce in, in on site where we are. Getting to that sweet spot as quickly as possible is definitely at the core of our, of our, of our thinking, of our, of our work to, to help us all get into that, into the knowledge stack to do that as quickly as possible.\nYeah. So let's, let's recap. I think what we're thinking here is that using these biomimicry methods, we can reduce the energetic intensity while using solar and including bio solar like artificial photosynthesis or maybe or production of gas.\nYeah. To produce, uh, various organic high, you know, long-chain organics to be used as fuels. The two cross, and we can mostly be distributed. Though I would keep in mind that, you know, true efficiency is still going to say you can get a hell of a lot more electricity out of your cell solar cell in Morocco than you can in Germany, right? You're going to have to be pragmatic and say for a while it makes sense to produce electricity where it's cheap to produce and just transmit it to where it's not cheap to produce. Uh, so we always have to keep that in mind. But as our demand for extrinsic energy goes down, then that, that constraint becomes smaller.\nExactly. Beautifully put. Out of that which we've done, we can, we can then unfold all of the aspects of what makes up a, a thriving civilization.\nWe can, we can look at education systems. How would education systems in such a place work rather than what they're, what they're doing right now? How would governance principles work?\nFor example, there's a, there, there's at least a correlation between the ease at which central resources in a region, let's call it a nation state, can be controlled and the form of governance. So usually, there are exceptions to this, of course, but usually the easier it is, the more autocratic is your system. Idea of that that we follow here is, um, if everybody is able at least in theory to grow their material stack, it's really hard to control these people. So there will be different forms of governance that will be much closer to a true form of democracy. That's, that's at least I hope there's no proof to that.\nUm, but I think it could be a function of, um, material liberty, and that is true also for the education system. Right now, the education system is a symptom of industry, right? Industry essentially dictates to politics what they need as, as the next generation of workers if they have that kind of vision, and then that gets produced. You've seen that in the commodification of university. University used to be a place where people explore open-ended without goals in broad ways to understand, right? And now we're training people to do specific things. Now, what would that look like in Heliogenic Civilization? I don't know. But I guess it has more to do with actually being in service of the world, being in service of the people, being in service of nature, being service of yourself. We can, we can play that, we can play that across any dimension, but it all comes back to liberation on the material level.\nYes, that, that's always the threat. And particularly in our totally globalized world, there's a tremendous number of choke points where we can make people literally starve, uh, in many countries by essentially political decisions. You know, Trump just cut off a number of programs that are essential for medicine and food to poor countries in Africa, for instance. Right? This the stuff I'm talking about here, we've, we've ran various prototypes in the form of NGOs's over the last couple of years to test assumptions. Now, one of these assumptions, um, we tested in Africa where all we did essentially was, um, help, uh, farmers in Zaya, Kenya coordinate a little bit better among themselves, right? And so 800 farmers and their families now have higher food security despite losing more or less three harvests due to climate disruptions. Higher food security than anybody around them just because they coordinate it.\nSo, they're able to do that also in place. And we're adding vectors to that, right? We, we can, um, there's this, there's one specific farmer. He's, he's, uh, really outstanding. He's re-establishing lost knowledge about how to create organic digesttors in order to turn food waste into, into fertilizer and then spreading that because he, he can only produce so much, but the idea can, can spread easily. So that's, that's, um, what I would call, uh, feminine scaling at its best, right? Um, he, he, he can serve, he actually sells part of it, but he can only produce so much, so he shares with his friends, so his friends can do this, replicate the same thing.\nAll right, well, we've talked about all kinds of interesting things in the details, and in the last 10 minutes or so, let's kick it upstairs to your project miracle. What are you actually saying that we should do?\nYeah. Well, this is what we currently call the Oslo project because, uh, project miracle sounds a bit hippie-ish, and we want to get closer to\nYes, it is.\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\nWell, we started calling it the Oslo project. Um, because we're doing so much work in, in Norway, and you want their money.\nWe want to create a match between the money of Norway and the pathway of actual effective building of infrastructure towards life-saving civilization, right? And, um, and so we're, we're rooting that in the ideas of a philosopher in, uh, from a Norwegian philosopher, um, Arne Næss, um, he termed, termed the words deep ecology somewhere in the 70s, and, um, it's, uh, it's very similar in some ways to what we were proposing with the Heliogenic Civilization.\nAnd so, so we're, we're, we're connecting, we're connecting those two ideas in order to live into, um, a world that actually builds the ideas of what we call deep ecology.\nAnd, um, there's a lot of learning that have, has happened since, um, uh, since the 70s and since, um, Arne Næss has, has, has died about 15 years ago or something, which turns us slightly away from, from the original ideas, right? Arne Næss's ideas of deep ecology were very much about no touch, don't interfere with nature, where, um, at the other end of the spectrum, we're saying let's be custodians. Let's, let's actually get in touch with nature and let's nurture nature and life as much as we can. To your question, what are we doing with the Oslo project?\nWe're bringing together the people and the institutions that are already working on what we would call the helioenic stack, materials, but also education systems, food systems, etc., organizing funding for them to liberate themselves to do that work at scale and liberate the IP into the commons over the course of the next 15 years. So ultimately, we have a 15-year lifespan where we first identify the existing technologies of the matrix of what's required for building a Heliogenic Civilization, funding them, then releasing them into the world through releasing the IP and partnering with other organizations, nation states, and such to scale them up, and then starting to let go and wind down the operation so that we're, we're actually the hands-off organization that we want to be and not hijacking any of this for ourselves or not trying to be hijacked by it, right? So that's, that's ultimately what we're doing. It's a, we have a 15-year game plan ahead of us that we're beginning executing right now based on the active learnings on the building of knowledge on the building of resource over the last decades in our network and now\n\n\nWe're activating that.\nVery, very interesting.\nIs there a place people can go online to learn about this yet?\nAre you still undercover?\nWe're still a little bit undercover, but um maybe my blog is a good place to um get early knowledge about this, which is blog.thtoomas.cr, which is a Substack.\nUm you could also head to project miracle.\nUm or the miracleactory.network um to see more.\nUm and as you said in the beginning, thomas.cr R is the entire stack of lists of links that um help people fan out into um whichever aspect of what we're working on um to to to really go deep or just reach out um anybody who wants to engage learn more I'm really happy and the team is really happy to speak with you.\nVery cool.\nWell, Thomas, I want to thank you for an amazingly interesting conversation.\nWe covered all kinds of cool things, right?\nAnd we also, of course, we left continents left to be explored.\nWe could have spent 20 hours on this podcast.\nI had to make a number of tactical decisions.\nGo, okay, I could go down that rabbit hole.\nNope.\nI think it's go over here.\nYeah, I could see you're making these decisions.\nYeah, exactly.\nThen, but I managed to squeeze in a fair bit into our hour and a half.\nActually, went over by a few minutes, but it was well worth it in this case.\nSo, I really want to thank you for this wonderful conversation and the great work that you are adding to the world.\nThank you.\nAnd I'm deeply duper grateful for all of our conversations and also definitely this one.\nOr are you looking forward to our next one?\nAbsolutely.\nWhich will be on Friday.\nYes.\nAll right.\n[Music]\nAudio production and editing by Andrew Blevens Productions.\nMusic by Tom Mueller at modernspacemusic.com.\n[Music]\n",
