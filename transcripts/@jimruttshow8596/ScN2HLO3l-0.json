We now have\nlinks to books and articles referenced\nin recent podcasts that are available on\nour website. We also offer full\ntranscripts. Go to\njimrutshow.com. That's jimrutshow.com.\nToday's guest is Mark Stahlman. Mark is\na biologist, a computer architect, and\nex-Wall Street technology strategist.\nHe's the president of the not-for-profit\nCenter for the Study of Digital Life.\nYou can find out more about that\norganization at\ndigitalife.center. He also writes an\ninteresting Substack at\nexogenous.substack.com. As always, links\nto that and anything else we reference\nin the article, you can be found on our\nepisode page at\njimrutshow.com. Welcome back, Mark. Jim,\nit's great to be talking to you again.\nYeah, it's always good with lots of\ninteresting conversations. Don't always\nagree, but that's all right. That's part\nof the fun. Mark's a returning guest on\nI don't know how many times, three or\nfour at least. Most recently in EP 303\nwhere we talked about Trump as the\navatar of the digital paradigm shift. It\nwas good. Today we're going to talk\nmostly about the new pope. Mark is my\ngo-to guy on things Catholic. He's one\nof these real Catholics, goes to Latin\nmass, the whole shmear. And uh very\nthoughtful, smart guy despite that,\nright? So, uh you know, we somehow got\nreconnected recently and decided, hey,\nlet's do a podcast about the new pope.\nSo, let's hop into it. Well, this is a a\nvery remarkable development. I know many\npeople who literally fell off their\nchairs when this guy got elected and\npicked his name. The selection of the\nname Leo XIV has enormous\nsignificance for those who've been\npaying attention, which of course\ndoesn't mean every Catholic, but a lot\nof people I know were paying attention\nand this was the last thing they\nexpected. It's a very big deal. Yeah.\nI've uh noticed that there this was a\nbig surprise. A couple things were a\nsurprise. One that it happened so\nquickly, right? A lot of these things go\nmultiple rounds and also that was this\ncomplete darkhorse American which wasn't\non anybody's league tables. Well, as it\nturns out, and this is I think probably\nthe most important thing we're going to\nsay today, the Catholic Church has gone\nmissionary and they got themselves a\nmissionary in this new pope. Now, what\ndoes that mean? Well, it it means that\nlike any large organization, you've been\ninvolved with many of these, there's a a\nwhole series of different concentric\ncircles, and you might think that the\npope is is somehow sitting on a throne\nsomeplace, and that he's surrounded by\nvarious insulating layers. The most\nimportant of which it would be the\npermanent bureaucracy, otherwise known\nas a curia in Rome, or mostly in Rome.\nAll of that has been bypassed here. In\nfact, this new pope, Leo XIV, most\npeople didn't know this, but he was\nworking very closely with Francis who\nhad pissed everybody off. And so people\nweren't even paying attention. And so he\nwas elected, Leo XIV, the new pope\nwas elected by\ncardinals in Africa and Asia who had\nbeen appointed by Francis. I have read\nthat. Yeah. So talk about decentralizing\nan organization. And of course the\nnumbers bear it out. The Catholicism in\nthe US is about static. In Europe it's\ndeclining but it's booming in both\nsub-Saharan Africa and I didn't really\nknow this till I started doing my\nresearch in Asia as well. And soon the\npreponderance of Catholics will be\noutside of the traditional West. Uh\nwhich is kind of interesting. The other\nthing that's interesting is Francis,\nright, the kind of that cartoon version\nof Francis is he's he was this radical\nlefty, right? But as I was doing my\nresearch for this episode, I came up\nwith a much more nuanced understanding.\nIn fact, uh the thing that most\nimpressed me was a review of Francis's\npontificate by a bishop Robert Baron\nwho's thought to be conservative and it\ncame out in First Things, which is a\nquite conservative journal of society\nand religion which I have subscribed to\nfor 30 years. Know your enemy, right? uh\nand uh it was way well you will remember\nthat First Things began as a kind of\napology for capitalism in the quote\nconservative Catholic ranks. So maybe\nthat's why you've been subscribing for\nso long. So Novak and and people like\nthat were associated with it. It's not\nquite there now. It's very different.\nReno has been the editor the last\nseveral years and he has taken it into a\ndifferent direction but it's still one\nof the best Yeah. well-edited quality\nthings. It's one of the few magazines I\nstill get in paper and also they use\ngood paper and good ink which matters. I\nhave a promised lunch date with Reno\nwhich I'm going to cash in on one of\nthese days. So that's that's a few years\nold but I'm looking forward to meeting\nhim. And when you do kick him in the ass\nfor me I've binged him a couple times\ncome on my show to talk about Return of\nthe Strong Gods, crickets. No response\nat all but kick him in the butt and say\nhe's missed an opportunity here to pedal\nhis wares. I can do that. Go ahead, do\nthat. I appreciate it. Anyway, before we\ngo further into Pope Leo XIV, maybe\ngive us your perspective on\nFrancis. This will be a unusual\nperspective. I'm sure Francis was a\nthug. What does that mean? It means that\nhis predecessor who did the\nextraordinary thing of resigning, people\nkeep talking about an earlier\nresignation which had nothing to do with\nthe current one but just happened with\nBenedict XVI or B16 as we sometimes\ncall him is that he stepped down and\nthen there were two popes I guess for a\nwhile. He's gone now but he was a\nmemeritus pope which is a completely odd\nthing. So what what was going on here?\nAnd my answer to that is that the worst\npart of the Catholic Church, which is\nusually the case in a large hierarchal\norganization, you could say the same\nabout IBM or or probably Microsoft, was\nthe permanent bureaucracy. And they\nhad been very aggressive against B16.\nB16 was a Southger theologian,\nrelatively frail guy. He had repeatedly\nattempted to resign. The pope for him\nwas St. John Paul III. He kept\ntrying to resign and and you have been\nin these situations, I'm sure. And the\nboss wouldn't let him go. So when when\nhe became pope, he was reluctant from\nday one. And then it only got worse.\nBurggalio, Jorge Burggalio, who then\nbecame Francis, he was someone who put\nhimself through college before he was a\npriest. He put himself through chemical\nengineering as a bouncer in the port of\nBuenos Aires. Oh, I love that. That's\ngreat. Both parts, you know, chemical\nengineering is probably the toughest\nundergraduate major. I mean, it is a\nnutbuster of the first water. So, that's\nimpressive. Then that he was a bouncer\non the waterfront. Even more impressive.\nWell, as as you can well imagine, to be\na bouncer on the waterfront, you have to\nhave a loaded pistol in your waistband.\nYou don't go to work, you know, with a\npairing knife. This is a very serious uh\nsituation. And so that's why I say in\nquotes that he was a thug. So he was\nbrought in. I don't know to what degree\nB16 was involved. Nobody does. But the\nmovie Two Popes, I think, is a fairly\naccurate description of how they got\nalong with each other. But he was\nbrought in to knock these Curia guys to\nwhack them upside the head with a 2x4.\nAnd he did it. He put through a\ncompletely new constitution for the\nChurch. He reorganized dramatically the\nCuria. And as a result of this, he wound\nup in one of his most important but\nprobably least attended to annual\nevents. He he did what was called a a\nletter to the curia on Christmas. So his\nChristmas letter a few years back he\neffectively said got up in front of the\nwhole curia and said uh boys you're all\nfired. Unfortunately, uh I don't have\nanybody to replace you with. So, you go\nback to your office tomorrow, but I want\nyou to understand that that this is just\nnot going to continue. We're not going\nto keep on going this way. So, as a\nresult, of course, everybody hated him.\nHe had very very few and and Leo XIV\npost was one of the very few who worked\nclosely with him and that was not\ngenerally known because most people just\nrejected him. So, you're absolutely\ncorrect. Most of what's been written\nabout Francis has been written by his\nopponents. Much of it is tendentious, if\nnot seriously opinionated and unfactual.\nBe that as it may, we really have a\ncontinuation of uh many of the key\npieces that uh Francis put in place, but\nwith a much kinder, gentler Francis, who\neverybody is applauding as opposed to\ntrying to figure out how to throw him in\ninto the lion pit in the coliseum. I got\nto ask you a question. If he was so\nhated, how did he get elected pope? He\ngot elected pope because the the feeling\nwas we need a tough guy to clean this\nplace up. But as you know very well,\nparticularly in in executive suites and\nso forth, the tough guy is going to come\nin and piss everybody off. He was\nelected on the resignation of\nB16 to read the riot act, particularly\nto the Curia, the permanent bureaucracy.\nHe did it. So now we have a situation\nwhere Leo XIV inherits a very\ndifferent Church. The other thing that\nFrancis did and this is a very important\npart of this conversation is he\nemphasized and of course the\nimplementation was imperfect at best\nsomething called Synodality. And\nSynodality is this urge to decentralize\nto push things down to the grassroots\nlevel which tend to be the the dascine or\nmaybe arch dascine level above the\nparish but and it was not implemented\nwell and all sorts of people have\ncomplaints about it all of which is very\nreasonable but it's been an emphatic\npart of Leo XIV's statements that\nhe is going to continue it and\nstrengthen.\nSo this\ndecentralizing of a what might be\ndescribed as a medieval monarchy about\nwhich most of us know very little about\nhow they actually operated. But the the\nnotion that this is there's a tyrant.\nThere's actually a book that has I think\nfinally been claimed by its author title\nof which is Dictator Pope. So the the\ncasting of Francis the thug as a\ndictator may have some truth to it but\nwe're past that now and now we're going\nto try to implement what's been put in\nplace over the course of the last two\nyears. Should be interesting and it's\ninteresting that Pope Francis' exterior\nreputation was this kind guy that washed\nthe feet of beggars and right very much\nof a pastoral type pope that did not\nhave any idea that he was the master\nbureaucratic operator behind the scenes.\nThat's actually good to be able to run\nthe two faces simultaneously. Right.\nIsn't it? Is it? Yeah. I will confess to\nhave used that trick on a timer. Be that\nsmiling nice guy, but who's also the\niron fist when needed, right? Yeah. Jim,\nyou've just advised me to kick the ass\nof the editor of a magazine you've been\nsubscribing to for 36 years. My guess is\nthat you've had a few opportunities to\ndo that yourself on occasion. On\noccasion. Not with this particular guy,\nthough. Uh let's go back to something\nyou mentioned before which was that the\nuh selection of the name Leo XIII is\nsignificant in your mind and uh I think\nwhen we first started communicating\nabout this you suggested I go back and\nread Leo XIII, it's called Rerum\nNovarum, I think it is, written in 1891\nand I did and uh it was quite quite\ninteresting I mean it was uh kind of a I\nthink fairly reasonable centrist\nposition about how the Church should deal\nwith modernity. Maybe why don't you give\nus a quick prey from your perspective\non what Leo XIII was talking about then\ntie that back to why that's significant\nwith respect to Leo XIV. So let's jump\nin the wayback machine here and let's\nrecognize that in the late 19th century\nthe Catholic Church, primarily based in\nEurope, was on the ropes, in particular\nin Germany, something we have now\ntransposed into English as culture war.\nCulture comf had removed the Catholic\nChurch from their role in education in\nGermany. France had not recovered from\nNapoleon who'd removed the Church from\ntheir teaching responsibilities. In Italy\nbecause uh the papal states which were\nin the central across the middle of the\npeninsula had been captured by the\nrepublicans and the hostility between\nthe Church and the Italian political\nestablishment basically telling\nCatholics in Italy don't vote for any of\nthese guys, the hostility between the\nChurch and France, Germany, Italy, and\nbeyond\nwas was really severe. So into that\nsteps Leo XIII. What year was that? Why\ndon't we give our our listeners some\ncontext? I believe he came in to the\npapacy in\n1878. I'm going to go with have to hit\nthe Google here and see what the Google\nsays. Uh 1878. Boy, you're a good\ncattle.\nOne of his most important encyclicals,\nwhich is the one that revived the\napproach to Thomas Aquinas, was 1879.\nSo I knew roughly the time zone we're\ndealing with here. One of the first\nthings that Leo XIII did before\nreviving the interest in Thomas Coinus,\nwhich was crucial in itself, which I'll\nexplain in a minute, is he went and\nnegotiated with the Germans and\neffectively shut down culture comp. So,\nso he was making some very bold\napproaches successfully. So, he\nstraightens out the situation in\nGermany. He then publishes this Italian\nencyclical. Thomas Aquinas had been at\nvarious points throughout Church history\nvery important, but he had largely\nfallen out of favor by the 19th century.\nSo for instance the the critical event\nthat precedes him is a very circle the\nwagons defensive Catholic Church when\nthe the first Vatican council which\nended literally when the the\nrevolutionaries took over the papal\nestates and effectively deposed the\npope. So the big thing that came out of\nthat was this notion of papal\ninfallibility. So you you can imagine an\norganization that's on the ropes.\nEverybody is is trying to figure out how\nto undermine them. Then they go to Rome.\nThey say the the pope can say things on\nbehalf of God. Not everything he says,\nbut when he he speaks ex\nCathedra, he is literally 100% these are\nGod's\nwords. Nobody who is successful in their\norganizational life would ever do that.\nThat's like an admission of total\ndefeat. No one's paying attention to me.\nSo now I'm going to speak on behalf of\nGod. It led to all kinds of and probably\nLord Acton is one of the characters you\nremember from your your history here.\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely.\nActon was a Catholic who effectively\nuh defied papal infallibility.\n\n\nAs did many others. So it was a big mess that Leo stepped into. But he, in part because of his brother, part because of others in his family, he really tried to put Humpty Dumpty the Catholic Church back together again. And so the most important thing that is enduring here, which you had a chance to read, which is a part of the larger story, *Rerum Novarum*, he was effectively saying, \"Look, we've got Marxists on the barricades. We've got reactionaries declaring all kinds of offense against organized labor. People are dying on the picket lines or in strikes. We got to stop all of this. And you're correct for a late 19th-century position for a church that had never said anything about this before. He's opening up a massive new can of worms. He's saying both the capitalist and the labor need to behave themselves. We all need to figure out a way to make this thing work.\" Very, very powerful statement at that time in that context.\n\nInteresting. So what does that say about the signal that the new guy has sent by adopting Leo XIII? Well, he made it very clear the category overall category into which *Rerum Novarum* and a series of other encyclicalsâ€”because he's not the last one to speak about this, and in fact, the one that I, for the listeners, if they would like to delve into this, the, uh, *Quadragesimo Anno* in 1931, published a very important encyclical entitled *Quadragesimo Anno* 40 years. So it literally was published 40 years after *Rerum Novarum*, and so the difference between the 1890s and the 1930s, of course, historically, is huge. And that encyclical, the second of them, there's a third done by John Paul II, *Centesimus Annus*, 100 years, and there's many other documents on this, but it turns out that Europe has made use of many of the principles from these Catholic encyclicals. Most importantly, subsidiarity. Now, subsidiarity is crucial because it declares that not just decisions need to be made at the lowest possible level, but that responsibilities need to be taken up throughout the entire hierarchy. So you don't get to make decisions at a lower level unless you take responsibility for what you say. So the idea you can just sit back and let somebody else make your life decisions for you, some distant place, you don't know who the people are, you don't know why they're doing it, but you're powerless. This was a very important principle after World War II in Europe in particular. As you might imagine, there were some really aggressive efforts to basically make sure that Germany would never be an industrial power. And what intervened in that were a series of Catholic economists who said, on the basis of subsidiarity, if you do that, yes, you can screw Germany, but you're going to screw yourself too. The whole European project will collapse if you take that approach. And as we know, in the end, that was not the approach that was taken. Instead, the Marshall Plan was taken. Instead, Germany was rebuilt, and that was largely done under the heading, economic heading, of subsidiarity, done by Catholic economists. It wound up in the Maastricht declaration. So the treaty that established the EU has subsidiarity. That word is critical in the formation of it.\n\nI don't think it was necessarily followed, and indeed, Brexit could be described as, among other thingsâ€”and I'm not sure this is close to as important as protecting the prerogatives of the monarchy, which is probably the more important part of Brexitâ€”Brexit in the end, even though the queen was against it, but no, the, um, subsidiarity is the anchor of Catholic social teaching, CST. And that is exactly what Leo XIII said why he picked the successor name to Leo XIII, that he was going to be the pope of Catholic social teaching. JP2 wrote an encyclical 100 years after JP2, or for non-insiders, that's John Paul II, right? John Paul II, yeah, sorry, B16 and JP2 are the way I tend to abbreviate these guys, if you don't mind. And so he went so far as to form an organization, John Paul II did, to support Catholic social teaching, but then he stepped away from all of it. He was a busy man. He had lots of other things he had to worry about. And so, in fact, that organization formed by JP2, which is supposed to be the church's primary organization for Catholic social teaching, has become a fancy dinner party for Italian bankers. It's doing none of the work that it should do. And I've had contact with a variety of people who have attempted to sort of redirect it into a more aggressive outward-facing program and failed.\n\nWhat's going to happen now, I'm quite sure, under Leo XIV, is that there will be conferences. There will probably be new organizations that are started. I think much of this is probably already underway. It was what was announced when he came in. And so that's why he picked the name is he thought that the church needed to, in addition to decentralizing, in addition to moving power away from the prominent bureaucracy, curia, and into, in fact, the hands of the lower levels of the church, both clerical and layman, which is the Synodality. In addition to that, he is going to push this whole Catholic social teaching exercise forward. And my hope is, I know some of the individuals who are involved, but it's too early to get a clear reading. I think the recognition because he paired that conversation with the conversation about AI. So there's a recognition this is not your favorite old popes or old saints Catholic social teaching. We're in a whole new situation here. So we have termed that digital Catholic social teaching. In '22, I actually did a, um, eight-part series available on YouTube, uh, on digital Catholic social teaching. So this is why people that I know who've been very frustrated that this wasn't going anywhere fell off their chairs when they heard the announcement.\n\nInteresting. We're going to revisit that and particularly the AI part, which again has gotten quite a bit of chattering in the AI world. Interestingly enough, before we go back to that though, maybe a little bit just on some of the more surface aspects. When I was doing my research, one thing that popped out was Francis always opted for great personal simplicity. And Leo XIV, when he made his first public appearance, wore the traditional mosetta, the man-trimmed robe that Francis had never worn. And I think he's probably moved into the palace and all that sort of stuff. What do those style choices tell you about both men? Actually, Francis, and if Francis was elected to knock some heads, he was in many critical respects publicly in opposition to the church that he headed. So that opposition showed in these stylistic questions. Didn't wear the red slippers, didn't live in the, um, palace, lived in a guest house instead. So this was all his personal style, and and he had, of course, had a long history in the church by then and had, in particular, he was well practiced at being widely disliked in Argentina, which was his base of operations. He had initially been brought back to Argentina, aborting his attempted PhD in Frankfurt on the theologian Romano Guardini. He was brought back to basically take the severely left-wing Jesuits of Argentina, the liberation theology Jesuits, and bring them back to the church. And I think what I've heard is that he lasted less than a week in the Jesuit house in Buenos Aires. Jesuits tend to all live in the same house, and that's been a pattern for a long time now. The way I heard it was that he did not visit a Jesuit house after being kicked out of the one in Buenos Aires until he was elected pope. He never went back to a Jesuit house. So all of this left-wing Jesuit stuff about him is just more fodder for a really messed up bureaucratic situation, which is hopefully now behind us. So the, but these more symbolic readjustments to the traditional dress and residence of the pope. What does, what signal does that do you think Leo XIV is sending with that part of his adjustment, his personal behavior? No need for us to have fights with each other anymore. We have obviously some very important responsibilities, tasks to pursue here. Unlike Francis, I'm not here to hit you upside the head. That's already happened. I'm going to not allow you to have any objections to me because of the shoes I wear. Gotcha. So, that's interesting. That's interesting. If that's indeed his theory, trick bulls sometimes work.\n\nNow, I've also read, however, that the reforms that Francis began are by no means complete and that there are still, particularly on the financial side, still great needs to reform the administration of the church. Honestly, I don't know so much. There's a long history of lack of transparency, of scandals, and more potential scandals. So, the Vatican Bank has been a strange component of the overall banking system. But let me use your question as an opportunity. I'm not just simply saying that the world is decentralizing. I'm not just simply saying that ideas that you've been kicking around for a decade, two decades about devolving these bureaucracies, hierarchies, and so forth. I'm going to go beyond that. And and I'm I'm not yet ready to talk about the specifics of this. Maybe we'll have a chance in a later podcast, but there is a massive effort now underway to build a completely new financial system. It'll be based upon central bank supported stable coins, as others have reported. It's going to change the whole international trade settlement situation. Does not mean the dollar is going to be discarded, but you're going to be able to settle in a number of other currencies. And from what I'm hearing, the so-called axis of evil, China, Russia, and Iran, are all involved in this new system. They've all been briefed, recruited, plans are in place. This is a big deal. So, yeah, and I think a well overdue big deal. The US has been fat, lazy, and just bad in riding the advantages it gets from being the global reserve currency, has developed some hideously bad habits about consuming more than it makes. So, I've long advocated to get the dollar overthrown. It's going to hurt like for the first couple years, but on the other side of it, I think we'll be a much better off, much healthier society. People keep going back to FDR's meeting with King Saud and how all this ties back to oil. And as we all know, oil is not the big story anymore in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia may be the big giant mileong building is a disaster, but it's a reflection of the fact that the Saudis don't want to simply be an oil country anymore. They actually want to be, as was shown in this most recent visit by President Trump to the kingdom, they really want to be involved in a very much more front row seat sort of fashion. So a trading system based upon post-World War II Saudi oil. The used-by date expired a long time ago. So the details of this, I only have access to a few people who are involved with this. It reminds me of, I was tangentially, perhaps this conversation. I was very close to the head of Olivetti, Vittorio Kosonei, who was also a chemical engineer, by the way, on loan from Alabeti to run AT&T computers for a while. We became close friends. Unfortunately, he died shortly after that. But I was sort of in the middle of the early efforts to build the European Union, uh, based on the bankers who were involved. So Olivetti obviously was fiat with de Benedetti, and so the European Union was a financial reorganization, not a political reorganization to begin with. So I, I kind of remember the intensity of what was going on there and the secrecy associated with it, parts of which I saw because I was coming in through the Olivetti side. The need to do this with digital currencies, the need to do this in a way that all the trading partners get a chance to participate and not get ripped off. This is this is the basis of what Trump's attempting to do with the tariffs and all the rest of it. This is a major reset of every aspect, but as you know probably better than I, you got to reorganize the financial system if you want to make any of this stuff work. Absolutely.\n\nNow, I will tell you, you may not know this, but there is a huge pocket of high-end blockchain developers in Dubai. They've Dubai has established a regime there, very favorable on a tax basis, on a regulatory basis. And so, a surprising number of heavy hitters in the crypto world are hanging out there, and I wonder if they're being used as to create some of this infrastructure. Yes, interesting. They are interesting. I'll check with some of my people there and see what they tell me.\n\nAll right, let's turn back to the pope here. Uh, why don't we start by, as our next step, to the degree you can synthesize your current take on what the church's current social teachings are at this moment in the evolution of humanity? The three pillars of Catholic social teaching as outlined in the three encyclicals that I just mentioned: *Rerum Novarum* 1891, *Quadragesimo Anno* 1931, and *Centesimus Annus* 1991. The three pillars are number one, human dignity. That's very important because you cannot have human dignity if you believe that AI can replicate humans. It goes out the window. So the church, by declaring themselves on Catholic social teaching, cornerstone on human dignity, has put themselves in a very strong position to distinguish between AI and human activities. Number two, subsidiarity is this principle of pushing decisions and responsibilities down as far as possible. Doesn't mean you don't have a federal government. You do. Some things have to be done at a federal level. Doesn't mean you don't have a military. Some things have to be done that way. But if it can be done in your own backyard, that's where it'll get done. So this decentralizing or desentering through subsidiarity with a enormous history, particularly the early days of the EU in terms of modern history. This is a crucial approach to human organization. So we have human dignity, we have subsidiarity, and the third principle is solidarity. And solidarity, of course, is a peace initiative. It's a variety of other takes on the world. My view is that while it may have been important in the 1930s for the church, I haven't found any significant history, but let me presume because I know a lot about Leo XIII, and he was being fought tooth and nail back and forth. A lot of people just ignored what he had to say. It's important the foundation they laid, but I think by the time we get to Pius XI in the '30s, people are paying more attention, and he can mobilize things. So in particular, Pius XI on a solidarity basis, the\n\n\nThird leg, he mobilized something effectively and called it the Catholic international in opposition of the communist international, not very well known perhaps, but he could mobilize resources around that. One of the things that he, in particular, which I focused on in my own research, is he focused on art, literary, and other expressions of art, set up various organizations, and promoted it. And as we've discussed in our earlier encounters, Marshall McLuhan is very important to me. Marshall McLuhan should be much more important to the Catholic Church. He hasn't been up till now, but Marshall McLuhan was caught up in that.\n\nLeo XIII. So I think what we're going to see here is much more serious thinking about AI, much more serious thinking which is human dignity, much more serious thinking about hierarchical organizations, decentralizing, which I know is a project that you have been involved with with your own ideas for quite a while now. You were on that particular merry ground before many other people. And solidarity is going to wind up being a very important part of this because it'll wind up flying in the face of all of these forever wars. The forever wars are not going to be able to be sustained under these circumstances. You reorganize the world's financial system. You reorganize trade towards some measure of fairness. You build a new, not necessarily reserve currency, but settlement capabilities. I'm not here predicting that the dollar will stop being the reserve currency, but I am predicting that settlement will shift away, probably fairly quickly, away from a dollar or dollar-oil sort of axis.\n\nNow, I will say as a student of monetary theory that settlement and reserve are closely linked. They're not exactly coupled. They're strongly linked. If it's a settlement currency, that's what I want to hold in reserve at least at my top-tier reserves, right? And further, if they engineer it correctly, it ought to be fairly resistant to inflation, which will certainly make it better than the dollar, which has been, you know, plagued forever by inflation. So I would suggest that that's a little bit Pollyannaish to think that you can switch the...\n\nI think what's going on here because my access to... remember, I'm primarily... my background, and I have said this to a few other people recently, I tend to have access to some information based on personal relationships that tie back into my Wall Street career. So, I'll give you an example. Last summer in fall, I did interesting conversations with many of the people that I worked with, still in touch with, about the Trump election in November. And I kept getting repeatedly, the senior Wall Street people that I was talking to were looking forward to Trump. We know there's going to be volatility, but we long ago mastered volatility. Goldman Sachs does not care if the market goes up or down. They will do very well in either direction. Others will maybe not quite so much. But the support that Trump has gotten from the financial community must in part be because he is supporting and moving along this financial reorganization. So the fact that they say, the fact that BRICS, for instance, says we're not trying to replace the dollar as the reserve currency, a fine statement for today and for this month, as you have correctly pointed out here. If they pull this thing off a year or two from now, inevitably all of that's going to shift. Exactly. That's a feel-good, sound good that anybody knows anything about monetary theory knows not true. It's like Leo XIV. I'll be glad to wear the red slippers. We're not going to have a fight over the red slippers. We're not going to have a fight over dollar reserve currency. And yet he's got his sneakers in his briefcase.\n\nLet's now pop up to a higher level of strategic thinking. One of the core elements that's come out of our game B analysis is the concept of the multipolar trap, and that is in a community of people who mostly want to do the right thing, all it takes is one or two people who want to do the wrong thing that if it turns out to be profitable and effective in the short term can force everybody else into doing the wrong thing. And the classic example I've been using lately is look at a class of new associates at a management consulting firm who there's a lot of pressure to put in the long hours, do lots of work to get on the partner track and maybe get to be made partner, make a lot of money. One of the guys starts doing Adderall, not because he's ADHD, but because Adderall let you work 3 hours more a day at the same level. Well, because everybody's doing Adderall. It's a standard part of Adderall. That's the next thing that everybody else has to, 'cause I can't let Bill work 3 hours more than me. So, we all do Adderall, and we're all going to burn out our dopamine systems, and yet none of us can stop. This is the essence of a multipolar trap. Once you start to see multipolar traps, you see them throughout all competitive social systems. And so, this is where I... this is one of the core lenses I use to think about proposals like solidarity, dignity, and subsidiarity.\n\nBut let's start with solidarity, right? Solidarity historically has been a word that's been linked to things like trade unions, for instance, right? The solidarity of the working man, and to be sure, in 1891, that was important. Yep. And could be, could be again, still is in places like Sweden, where like 75% of the... in Denmark, where 75% of the workforce is unionized, though in honest, non-thuggish unions, unlike the American counterparts in many cases. There are some still some good unions in America, particularly the trade unions, but some of the other ones are pretty thuggish. But not SEIU, correct? Yeah. Not SEIU. That's for sure. So when you think about solidarity, whenever there's a system of solidarity, there's always benefits for cooperation and benefits for defection, right? And this is what essentially has killed the labor union in America. We've made it easy to defect from working with unions by moving to right-to-work states. Right. Move to Alabama. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Move to Alabama. Don't need... You don't need no dinking unions. Right.\n\nSo, in a competitive world, how does the Catholic Church envision defeating the multipolar trap tendency, which inevitably erodes things like solidarity unless there's an overarching regulatory framework which we all agree to, that we all agree not to do this because we understand that it produces a race-to-the-bottom dynamic, and our society seems to be very bad at recognizing these traps and doing anything about it these days. I don't have a very good answer for you except to say that Catholic Church... going to start with the Catholic Church. So building solidarity within the Catholic Church, which has been heavily factionalized. So here I'm going to just simply say that the right-wing, left-wing distinction that we've been living with since at least the French Revolution, if not before, progressive, conservative, however you wish to name it, no longer makes any sense under digital conditions.\n\nTalk a little bit more about that because obviously that's a huge idea if true. The notion of class war, which Marx and Engels gave us so emphatically. I've been a student. I've been a, I guess, a hands-on participant in some sense in Marxism for quite a few years. Couple years ago, I was fortunate enough to be invited to come to the second world congress on Marxism taking place at Peking University in Beijing at PU. And because of language and because of my own curiosity, I went out of my way to sit with the Western Marxists at lunch and dinner. Uniformly, they declared that what the Chinese were doing was not Marxism. It had so much of a Chinese overlay or with Chinese characteristics.\n\nAre there left-wing and right-wing components within the Communist Party of China (CPC)? Not as much as there once was. So you probably know more than I do about Tiananmen Square. But amongst the things that are interesting is that nobody was killed in the square. There was no massacre. Furthermore, that event is just one on a long timeline of very severe left-wing, right-wing conflicts within the CPC. And it took them a long time to in some sense resolve it. But the right-wing, if you will, insisted on keeping the structure of the Communist Party as it was, dictatorial, authoritative, authoritarian. The left-wing, if you will, wanted to open up. So they compromised. That compromise is probably not going to hold because of digital. What has happened is that Xi Jinping, who is not very well understood in the West... I just recently participated in a conference in which the standard Western view of Xi Jinping's authoritarianism, which maps into the Chinese quasi-religious structure of legalism, is very widespread and wrong. In fact, today's Chinese leadership, which as best as I can tell is not well understood in the West, is more Daoist than anything else. Now, Daoism, for those who haven't studied China, might have recognized that Daoism was the nature religion, so to speak. Well, Jim Rut is a natural scientist. And so if you were looking for a natural scientist in China, you wouldn't find them in a Confucian temple. You'd find them in the modern version of Daoism. So it's happened throughout the party structure and the other power structures in China. But it's... it's the party. The party is no longer interested in left-wing, right-wing conflict like they were at the time of Tiananmen Square. Obviously, many of the hardliners aren't with us anymore. So, we're... we're a generation later in this whole process, but digital demands of us a different level of sensibility about these topics.\n\nIf in fact... so now we're back to the Catholic... human dignity. If in fact AI posits that human beings are really no more than programmable biological computers, that is going to get a lot of people very upset, and it's already happening. So the shift on the part of human beings who are absolutely, as you described it, prone to falling into traps, prone to not understanding what the larger dynamics are involved here, just continuing to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. Digital says stop. You've painted yourself into a corner here. You've lost track of your humanity, acquiesced to universal grammar. You've let the linguists tell you that you can be programmed. Lots of interest in brainwashing nowadays also for a variety of reasons, but all linked to this. So as humanity, not all of us, doesn't take all of us, you know very well, 5, 10% of the population can really make a huge difference. The population is shifting away from why are we fighting each other? Why don't we bring ourselves together in a much more serious fashion? There will still be lots of divisions. There still be lots of factions, but it's not going to be the same. It's not going to be the old left-right division, and digital is forcing us into that situation. Now, it would be nice if it were true. I don't see any sign of it so far. In fact, I see quite the opposite. That we're weirdly at the same time both more polarized, more fragmented, and with considerably less trust across our society than we were, say, 50 years ago.\n\nWell, this is the whole media story. We've... we have moved from television, which organized our lives, yet we... there are 500 shows, nothing's on, but we can pick one that we want and binge-watch it anyway, and so forth. The polarization that you're referring to is a result of the collapse of the narrative. The narrative, the post-World War II globalist narrative. The only way we can avoid fighting each other is by one world government that has completely fallen apart. So we're now in an interim time period where these polarizations are being accentuated, particularly by the television and related media. So we... we still have Fox fighting CNN. The ratings are going down on all of that. The motivation for all of that, and we're getting a new generation.\n\nSo one of the things we did at CSDL, the center, is we started an online graduate school called Trivia University, and Trivia University was intended... it didn't wind up exactly that way, but a significant part of those who came into this are Gen Z. This is very, very important. Gen Z, according to the people that I talk with who have big budgets in the marketing and PR space, Gen Z has already distinguished themselves in many ways as being quite different from their predecessors. So Gen X, Gen Y, otherwise known as millennials, and Gen Z. In the marketing community, we have a very strong understanding that we're witnessing significant generational changes. By the time we get to the alpha and beta generations, which are coming next, these kids will never have watched the television show. They will be completely free of what was driving that polarization. Not saying they'll agree with each other. Not saying they'll like each other. I'm just saying that the forces have changed, and in this new situation in which we are... I think your characterization is a good one. On the one hand, it looks this way, and on the other hand, it looks that way. Well, that's... that's always characteristic of transitional periods. But we... but we know not only that we're in a transition. Our gut tells us that nobody can ignore that. But we know the direction that it's taking us. It's not random. All of which for me at least speaks very positively towards an opportunity to redraw the lines. But what's important is breaking down the old lines. That'd be good.\n\nWhat role do we... do you see the new pope playing in this? Right. The West... more... a lot of this digital stuff is playing out. The Catholic Church is losing ground and has been losing ground for a few generations. Has been accelerated with the sex ship boost scandals and what have you. Uh, does the pope hope to regain ground in the West, or is he going to depend on the growing numbers elsewhere? I think he's going to be very focused on Europe. We can throw our hands up and say Europe is lost. We can throw our hands up and say what a disaster. But the truth of the matter is in the most important country as far as the Vatican's concerned, France, a Catholic country, vocations for priests, first communions are significantly up among French Catholics. Now, I would not be surprised at some point here because the French politics is so messed up at this point. Can you believe these European countries that are just simply canceling elections and banning parties? I mean, this is... this... this cannot be sustained. So, statistics, the series, you know how this works. You ask the same question year after year after year, and it may no longer be the right question. But statisticians all want to...\n\n\nI have a series.\nSo they want to compare the answer to the same question over the course of 20 years.\nWell, by and large, those are not the right questions anymore.\nSo you have to kind of be on the ground in the situation itself to judge it.\nAnd the people that I know who are in that situation say that that Europe is a is a very interesting dynamic mixed bag at this point.\nSo I I suspect, but what I don't know, we've stated and many others have confirmed that the Asian and African cardinals elected Pope Leo XIV.\nWhat do they want from him?\nSo my guess is that in terms of emphasis, a lot of people have indicated they thought that an American pope would bring more American money into the Church.\nI think that Europe is going to get a lot of attention, but so will the rest of the world.\nSo this will be among Catholics.\nThis is not going to be, I mean, yes, the Vatican offered itself as a negotiating point, and yes, on Russia Ukraine, and Russia has responded in public saying, we're an Orthodox Christian country.\nTherefore, it would be inappropriate for us to negotiate the Vatican.\nNo offense, we like you guys.\nBut the Vatican's diplomatic efforts are quite significant.\nA fellow at the center is Victor Genen.\nHe's a journalist writing about the diplomatic efforts.\nGod's Diplomats is his most recent book.\nSo, Jim, I think I think that one of the people who was most surprised at his election was Leo XIV.\nSo, it'll take a while to see this all panning out, but it's going to be if he's got the hands on deck to help him with this, and that that may or may not be the case, it's going to be full court around the world.\nInteresting.\nYou mentioned France.\nNow in Europe in general, the Catholic Church is gaining, as you mentioned, is starting to pick up a little steam with the young people, but is falling away with the middle-aged people.\nAnd the big, as you know, the big political question in France is whether the traditional lacetate, the lease is written into the fifth republic constitution.\nAnd I believe it was first put in the fourth republic constitution.\nThe acetate means effectively there is no such thing as a religion.\nWe're all the same.\nWe're all layman.\nAnd it's right there, I think, in the first couple paragraphs of the current constitution of France.\nI don't know enough about the internal situation in, but one of the things that would not surprise me in all this mess around Mccron and so forth, parties being excluded, is the French seem to like to do this.\nSo, and I have no knowledge of it happening, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get a new French constitution out of this.\nThe Catholic Church is losing its power, but the Muslims are coming on strong with great fervor, and this is of course a challenge to Christendom across Europe.\nYes.\nAnd France Francis was pretty well known for reaching out to establish better relations with Muslims.\nDo you think Leo XIV will continue this?\nOr absolutely, absolutely Jewish outreach, Catholic Orthodox outreach, accuminism, ecumenical contact is very important, and that will continue.\nAll right.\nWell, I I I think the most important thing for people to keep in mind here is that we're we're not all sitting around wondering what this liinal situation is going to turn into.\nThe wheels are turning aggressively.\nThe Catholic Church is only a part of that, but an important part of that.\nThere is a new system currently being designed and over the next five plus years will be implemented.\nPost World War II financial, military, trade, political organizations are all now obsolete.\nDigital has forced this change upon us.\nIt's not that we couldn't have continued if we continued without that impetus, but digital changes everything.\nAnd so the result, as a result of this, the Church's role in helping us to emphasize the human being different from the machine.\nThe Church's emphasis that humans are not stupid.\nThey don't need to be technocratically controlled.\nThey in fact can figure out what needs to be done at lower levels, subsidiarity.\nAnd these wars have got to stop.\nNobody who I am in contact with, and I'm I'm primarily, I have certain access into at least parts of what you might call the intelligence community.\nI have access into certain parts of what you would call the financial community because that was my career.\nWall Street pace at which things are now moving, almost completely unreflected in the headlines or the mainstream press or the mostly the alternate press is people don't have the connections to figure out what's going on.\nBig things are coming, decentralizing, and plans for how to do this are now being listened to.\nYou've had a lot of experience in various aspects of this.\nMy guess is that one of your reactions to our conversation today, I think you said it a couple of times in the conversation, is about goddamn time.\nExactly.\nRight.\nRight.\nAs you know, this has been the work that me and others have been working on, and but we have been patient waiting for the right time.\nMaybe the right time is finally here.\nI believe it is.\nAll right.\nMark Stahlman from the Center for Digital Life.\nAnother excellent and interesting conversation.\nThanks, Jim.\nAll right.\n[Music]\nAudio production and editing
