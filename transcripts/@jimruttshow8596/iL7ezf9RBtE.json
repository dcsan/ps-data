  "cleanText": "Howdy, this is Jim Rut and this is the Jim Rut show.\n\n[Music]\n\nListeners have asked us to provide pointers to some of the resources we talk about on the show. We now have links to books and articles referenced in recent podcasts that are available on our website. We also offer full transcripts. Go to jimrutshow.com. That's jimrutshow.com.\n\nToday's guest is Richard David Hames. Richard is a philosopher, activist, and strategist. He's an adviser to boards and governments, mentoring leaders out of their manufactured normality. I love that. Welcome, Richard.\n\nThank you, Jim. It's good to be with you.\n\nYeah, it really is. Richard is also the author of several books. The most recent of which is Man-made: 50 Failings of Our Making, which I have indeed kindled, though I haven't read yet. I reached out to Richard David Hames to come on the podcast based on an essay he published in all ludicrous places, Facebook, and he graciously agreed. And that's what we're basically going to talk about today. But as usual on the Jim Rut Show, God knows what we'll actually talk about. So, Richard, what caused you to write that essay? What burr under your blanket caused you to write that? Very simply put, probably the state of politics in the world at the moment, which I find so irritating and frustrating because I have this view that we are being governed by the least among us. Secondly, that politics and democracy actually don't mix. I really don't think the way politics is practiced, the two can coexist. They're opposed. And the third thing which is important for me is that if that's the case and governments has kind of subsided into a performance more than anything and a spectacle, then the nature of governance itself is being eroded and and that's not leaving us in a very good position at all. So it was frustration. I wanted to vent.\n\nIt's definitely a rant and it's pmic, but I I went through the thing and I go, \"Damn, damn.\" Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And in fact, you uh start off with a pretty uh strong statement that we may be witnessing the final performance of a civilization in the west. And then this is then I think the key is forgotten how to distinguish between theater and governance. As you say, the ass clownery on display every day. And by no means only in the United States, but our ass clownery is probably better than anybody else's ass clownery in terms of being ridiculous. You've certainly honed it into a fine art at the moment with the people you've got in Washington. There's no there's no doubt about that. But let's not confine it to the US. I would probably if if I were to draw a boundary, I would confine it to the eurocentric US empire. That that's what gives me great concern because as a kid I was educated in England, the British Empire at that stage, you know, all all the pink bits on the map were where the sun never sets and and that was inherited by the US. And so all of the knowledge the and the colonial knowledge that was inculcated when I was a kid gradually more and more as I as I grew older confused me and I started traveling and and actually seeing the reality of how the rest of the world lives and so that too has been I I viewed with a degree of dismay.\n\nYeah. And then if we think about the west which we can use it as a simple label it's you know oversimple label we know but the west in some sense is the child of the enlightenment where finally we put away millennia of superstition and attempted to live on a road based on trying to understand what is the truth. And as you say in your in your essay, uh, one of the most startling things that we're currently seeing and what you point out the historians have long observed about dying empires is an almost pathological retreat from truth. Yeah. In the historical record, we can see it. And so I include the contemporary West in that category. It's almost a succumbing to a rejection of objective reality. I mean, when when you look at how facts are increasingly politicized, our most venerable institutions being hollowed out, even even the law, truth seems to be being replaced by wishful thinking and outrage. I mean, it's it's just extraordinary.\n\nWell, you one thing I ultimately regularly point out is it's not a coincidence that the rise of the post-truth world is coincident with the rise and penetration particularly in our elite educational institutions of postmodernism.\n\nRight? And now yeah postmodernism is interesting because it's both true right the idea of meta narratives is actually false yes but where the lumpen form of postmodernism that is being inculcated in students today which is nothing is true so just emote is clearly highly destructive of a functional polity. Yes, it is. And and you see it I mean the thing I see all the time is especially with young people is a confusion and an almost I I told you before we started recording I've got nine children so I see this in my own children. The the eldest actually is 48 years old. So I mean they're they're all grown up but I see the confusion and the dismay. And this was brought home to me fairly recently, just last year, when I was actually working with a group of school superintendents in the United States and the problem they have with teen dropouts and the extraordinary survey where really only three out of 10 wanted to be at school. So, seven out of 10 didn't. And out of those three, only one out of those three felt a sense of a positive future, not just for them, but but generally speaking. So that sense of angst is almost hanging in the air and it infects us. They had this conversation yesterday actually and you know pointed person he was 10 years older than I was went to college university in 1981. And I went in 1971 and I said 1971 despite the fact we had the bomb hanging over our head. People forget, you know, you talk about global warming. My generation we thought fair reasonable chance that the bomb would fall and that would be that.\n\nOh yes.\n\nAnd uh and we had Vietnam, we had Nixon, we had riots, we had the weathermen. I mean all kinds of crazy going on. But we were we were all optimistic. uh could foresee reasonable futures both for ourselves and uh society. And while we were not entirely right, we were far from entirely wrong about it. But today, even though we have far more material wealth than people had in those days, obviously the technological capability of humanity is increased very substantially, there is this complete pessimism about the future. I mean, I think it comes down to how do you identify what's the truth and what's not because the traditional anchors of truth as in universities, journalists, science, all those things are being dismissed or or they're being degraded. So, it it's creating an intellectual void where belief and emotion are supposed to replace evidence and reason. And and and I think that's absolutely fundamental.\n\nYou know, you mentioned the fact that these institutions are falling into disrepute, but of course, at least I would argue and many other people would, they're falling into disrepute at least in part and sometimes overstated for good reason, right? The sciences have become corrupted by its own institutional structure. How many of the dollars that get invested into elite university R1 research are actually uh money well spent by the common wheel? I would say\n\nmhm\n\nif we're lucky 40%. Is the careerest track for the scientist today which means you're not actually a freestanding uh researcher in the community of scholars till you're 42. you know, after you've gone through two posttocks, you know, a five or six year uh doctoral program, a assistant professorship where you're basically sprinting to try to get tenure and then at 42 you can actually do what you want. Yet we know most great science is done by people in their late 20s and early 30s. Uh you know there's a lot a lot wrong with current science. You know, the media world has become, you know, well, no surprise, it's always been, but was now completely captured by economic uh returns on attention hijacking, right?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nAnd I read some of the UK newspapers regularly. Even they're full of the worst clickbait trashy articles, right? Because they're in the business of selling eyeballs advertisers, etc. And governance has fallen in great disrepute for good reason. I mean, the American Congress can't do anything, right?\n\nNo. What's astonished me is that again, when I was growing up, the BBC was where I turned to for the truth. And the BBC nowadays, I mean, it's it's as bad as any other medium and outlet. I mean, it really is. You can't you can't rely on mainstream media any longer to know the truth. But if you turn to social media, that's probably worse because there uh opinion takes the place of of ev as I say evidence and reason just goes by the board. Well, again, as we as I mentioned, you know, the ethos of postmodernism basically says reason is the white western man's tool of oppression, right? Literally, a lot of young people were taught that and unfortunately believed it. Now, just as as the worship and the cannon were tools of the white man's oppression of people around the world, reason was as well. But it doesn't mean that that's the only thing reason is good for. And that's the huge mistake that these radicals have made is throwing out reason and rationality along with its misuses. And uh you know where do you end up with a society that basically refuse to acknowledge that there is something called reason and reality? Yes. I I mean I think that's an an enormous trap, isn't it? When division works that way in terms of knowledge and knowledge systems. I mean, I do believe that the knowledge system we have is is now based too much on objective facts and reason and has eliminated ancestry and um connection, relationship and and and different kinds of knowledge and and and I what what I think we need is to reinclude all of the various knowledge systems in the world to make make it far richer and and not just reliant on one kind of knowledge.\n\nAbsolutely. But I think what I took away at least from your essay and certainly my own belief is that we should do that but we should not throw away the important parts from the enlightenment rationality reason that there's a real world out there that we're trying together to figure out. But to extend that including participate with participatory knowledge which is not propositional which is what we get from the things that we do with our hands the relationships we have with our friends the love affairs we have these are participatory these are real learnings these are real knowledge right and perspectal knowledge as well where you put yourself in the shoes of others and say all right how does a my my good friend uh the Australian aborigy Tyson Ynaporta how does he see the I've had incredible change in how I see the world from my conversations with him and reading his books and uh you know those things are outside of the traditional enlightenment 1.0 1.0 perspective on what constitutes knowledge but to have a world where you eliminate the rational and reasonable and realistic basis of thinking you you know you risk what we have right now which is nihilism and a show. Yeah, that's right. I mean, I don't think we should reject anything or just going back to the enlightenment. The one thing that does alarm me slightly is not scientific realism, but cartesian logic, the that that framing of duality in politics where you get in your country, Democrats and Republicans um effectively trying to differentiate themselves when they wherein they're actually the same relative to the deep state. They're the same. there's there's no difference at all. And also the tools we use in conversation. I I I think debate is irrelevant. I I I think we need to move beyond debate and and use a greater sophistication understanding the complexity of the world and and not just think you can uh just summarize it into two camps.\n\nYeah. And of course the two camps thing is an artifact of our institutional structure uh to a substantial degree and there are a lot of countries that have many uh camps. You think of places like Italy or Israel where they have 10 parties competing typically. Switzerland I think has a number of parties. The Anglosphere has tended to choose institutional structures with first pass the post voting single member districts in the US at least. I don't know what y'all do in Australia, but we have partisan primaries which accentuate the votes of the most extreme members of each party. Our curious institution of electoral college all produce from a game theory perspective a dynamic where it's very difficult to have more than two sides. And once and if you operate in an institutional structure where it's difficult to have more than two sides, you're going to have two sides and they're going to fight relentlessly for the 50.1 percentile voter. And that's the game they've been playing. Yes, I'm in Australia. I've been watching very very carefully because of the the recent election and the primary vote for both parties is just collapsing and we've got uh independence coming through. But I I think the Australian system is slightly more intelligent than yours is at the moment.\n\nWouldn't be hard, right?\n\nEven the UK is, you know, more intelligent. There's a little bit more room there for a third parties. Also perhaps the system of a parliamentary government where the executive and the legislature are unified may be better for our current very rapidly changing world where the brilliantly designed for the 18th century balance of power system devised by James Madison in the US Constitution is really good for avoiding tyranny because I even think the current clown and chief is not going to be able to hijack it. But it moves slowly by design and we're now in a world of exponential change that's been going on for a long long time. But we're now at the sharp point in the knee where the rate of change is so fast uh that our institutional ability to adapt seems to be breaking down.\n\nYeah. And and another factor which disturbs me is that politicians have stopped listening to the community. the political class generally believe they are the the creme de la creme in society and they they have all the knowledge all the answers are vested in their knowledge and I think that's a real danger or they just don't care right that's no longer a reality based decision-making process it's now based on as you've pointed out essentially entertainment and popularity I mean think of some of the clowns that we have had in government these people are not serious people they're not interested in the truth at all. I think they're interested in their truth. And that too is a problem because a lot of them are sociopaths. Let's face it. This is what I really meant when I said we're governed by the least among us. I think they're interested their self-\n\n\nInterest overrules everything else.\nThough I would say, uh, in my experience, politicians tend to be narcissists as opposed to sociopaths because they don't really have much power.\nIf you're a Congress critter, you don't have a lot of power.\nUh, but where we get our sociopaths in our society is, and you should know this, at the sea level suite in our major corporations.\nTrue.\nI've gone on the record, I've been there numerous times, is, uh, that perhaps 10% of sea level executives are clinical sociopaths as compared to about 1% in our, in the general population.\nAnd the combination of narcissists in politics and sociopaths in business.\nAnd I've also said that in finance, high-level finance, the level of sociopathy is probably more like 30% rather than 10%.\nAnd you combine those two things, sociopathic business with narcissists who just want attention and tenure in office, and you have a very bad situation where the, uh, the powers of money can corrupt governance.\nAnd as you know, Ralph Nader said, we basically have two corporatist parties.\nWe have a pro-abortion corporatist party in the United States and an anti-abortion corporatist party in the United States.\nI think this, the psychological attributes have a fair bit to do with that.\nI think you're right.\nI think you're right.\nIt's one of the reasons I live where I do.\nWe should explain to your listeners that I live in Thailand.\nI've been living in Thailand for the past 18 years.\nAnd there was a pragmatic reason for that.\nBut Thailand has become very much my home, and I, my work in the region.\nI work in China.\nI'm in China every month.\nI work in Singapore a lot, in Vietnam.\nAnd I just find the energy and optimism in this part of the world far more grounded in reality.\nThere's a willingness to innovate that, that's certainly, um, the entrepreneurial energy is very strong indeed.\nBut there's, there's also this, um, willingness to innovate in a very serious way and not just merely reinvent something that we, we have already and call it a breakthrough.\nIn another conversation I had two days ago in the West, today again, in, I would argue at least, and have, in the pursuit of short-term money-on-money return, a whole lot of our investment in the future is around, uh, small-scale optimization, right?\nHow do I squeeze an extra 2% out of this?\nHow do I take this piece of cost out of the business?\nAnd maybe less than in the past is invested in real breakthroughs, unlike the competitors to the West, which you point out are in a quite different place, you know?\nAnd often I'd like to point out that the, uh, Chinese Communist Party Politburo, at least last time I checked, more than half the members were engineers or scientists by academic training, as compared to the United States, where it's 60% lawyers and, uh, a miscellaneum other things.\nI think there's one PhD scientist in the US, uh, Congress, or two or three, very small number.\nWell, I, I, I'll probably say something now that will shock some of your listeners because I've, I've realized, looking at very closely, uh, at China, and I've worked with some very high-level people, both in the government and, uh, at regional government levels and in the private sector, is that China today is probably more democratic than a lot of so-called democracies in the West.\nYeah.\nSay more about that, 'cause I did read a book on the governance structure of China, and I was somewhat surprised that, you know, there is this hierarchical method of voting up several layers before it becomes a party-driven kind of authoritarian system above that.\nSo there is quite a bit more, quite a bit of actual democracy in China to my surprise.\nMaybe, but tell us more about what you see there.\nThe real meritocracy, I mean, you have to perform at a local level and then a regional level before you get a look in at the national level.\nAnd so it means that when you get elevation to the Politburo or close to it, your experience with large numbers and great numbers of people has been real, really in-depth.\nIt's, it's not superficial at all.\nThe other thing that's a misnomer very often that you see in Western, uh, Western media, which is sheer propaganda, is the lack of ability to protest as long as it's not, uh, political protests.\nYou can protest about almost anything in China.\nI mean, I think just last year there was something like 1,700 different protests of citizens saying, \"We want this,\" or \"We don't want that.\"\nAnd so I think the, uh, deeper understanding of Chinese society is missing in the West, though.\nBut of course, it is still true that you dare not protest the Communist Party, or you, you may not advocate Falun Gong or whatever that religious thing was they were out to suppress.\nSo it is still a totalitarian top-down regime which tunes how much protest is allowed, but there's more than the typical American might understand.\nYes.\nAnd, and I think the overwhelming majority of Chinese citizens support the government.\nAnd perhaps the reason for that, unlike ours, is it can actually get things done.\nIf you look at the statistics of how many, how much high-speed rail China has built, how many houses China has built, uh, how many airports China has built in the last 30 years compared to the West, it's unbelievably, insanely staggering.\nThey still know how to do things there.\nIt is staggering.\nI mean, I started working in China many, many years ago, and I was in the, in the room when the Premier Wen Jiabao signed with Siemens the contract for the first Maglev, which was the, with the only Maglev train, uh, from Shanghai airport to...\nThe plan at the time was an extensive Maglev network throughout China.\nNow that, that didn't happen.\nThe fast train network happened instead, but now they're actually going back to the Maglev idea, and the, and the plans for the next 5 to 10 years for Maglev is almost double what we've got in high-speed trains at the moment.\nIt's just absolutely mindblowing.\nYeah.\nThey're not afraid to think big, right?\nIt's not just big, Jim.\nIt's, it's the time scale.\nSo, their plans are 50-year plans, and they, but they yet they execute in the short term at a high rate of speed, which the two together is really quite interesting and makes me somewhat pessimistic for the West's ability to compete over the longer haul.\nI would agree with you if the West can't open their minds to understanding the benefits of working with China instead of using the language of warmongering all the time.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I, uh, like to get your thoughts on what strikes me as a kind of dumbass policy, which is the attempt to restrict advanced chips to the Chinese.\nI mean, we are not in a warlike situation with the Chinese.\nWhy shouldn't we engage in trade with cutting-edge chips?\nBecause if we don't, they're going to just develop them themselves, of which they're perfectly capable.\nWell, okay.\nSo, I'll give you a practical example.\nI've been advising an event which is being held at the end of this month in Singapore, and it's in this region.\nIt's being labeled as the first world summit on quantum computing, and we invited people from all over the world.\nThe majority of the leading scientists in AI and quantum computing, uh, are coming either to, um, demonstrate new applications in quantum computing, which are about 10 years ahead of what we've got in the US, but very disappointingly, all the people we wanted from the US who initially said, \"Yeah, we'll come,\" for some reason, and we don't know where the pressure was coming from, but almost to a man, and within a couple of days, they were all crying off, saying, \"I'm very, very sorry, we can't come.\"\nInteresting.\nYou suspect that's from, uh, the NSA or somebody like that?\nMy suspicion is CIA.\nCIA.\nUh, okay.\nBecause NSA is the one that's really pushing the envelope on quantum computing in the US for code-cracking purposes.\nAs we all know, one of the first and easiest applications of quantum computing is basically breaking RSA encryption.\nI thought could, could have been there.\nI, I, I think the, the fundamental thing we're talking about here is the overwhelming sense in the West of competition, competition, and relentless growth on a planet which, um, cannot sustain, sustain either of those.\nI think the future has to be in cooperation, collaboration, and in, uh, well, in terms of growth, inclusive growth, which means more equitable growth for countries that need it and societies that need it, rather than just relentless growth everywhere as reflected in GDP.\nI mean, that, for me, that simply does not make sense today.\nIndeed, in fact, you say the fantasy economy of endless growth on a finite planet, uh, very much to the core of my own thinking, which is that just ain't going to work.\nAnd, uh, and, and here's the issue about us not learn, not being a learning society anymore.\nWhen modernism started to come together around 1700, the population of the world was only 600 million people.\nIt's hard to believe that in 325 years we went from 600 million people to 8-plus billion, been heading for 9 or 10, but we did, you know, further the intensity of extraction of energy and materials, roughly a tenth per capita of the current global average.\nSo we got 12 times as many people, 10 times the intensity for each person on average, including the poorest and the richest, 120 times the imposition on ma nature.\nAnd it turns out ma nature has a limit, and we're right about at it.\nAnd yet the institutions of the West seem to be able to do nothing about that.\nWell, they're not listening.\nI mean, again, that comes back to the science, doesn't it?\nBecause I just wrote a piece the other day on the, the nerve of the so-called climate skeptics.\nI mean, there was the, I forget the, the group that's come out with this paper, 1900 scientists, and none of them are climate scientists.\nThey have Nobel Prizes in mathematics or something else.\nAnd then there are the venerable, uh, Lord Vic Count Monton from the UK and people like that who's has got no credentials in science at all.\nYou know, to, to put a, to put that kind of person up against a Jim Hansen, for example, it just doesn't make sense.\nIt's nonsense.\nYeah.\nActually, Hansen has agreed to come on my podcast at some point when he finishes his next book.\nSo that, I'm looking forward to that conversation.\nAnd so this actually ties back to this issue of disconnect from reality and truth, right?\nUh, if we, if we started far from the boundary in 1700 and then steam, and then electricity, and then internal combustion, and then rockets and nuclear power, just increased our ability to extract, and we've now reached the boundary, why is it so hard to realize that?\nRight?\nBecause what is your thought about that?\nWhat is it that causes us to?\nIs it the ostrich in the sand?\nWe just don't want to change, so therefore we'll pretend it's not true?\nOr is it something even more wanting?\nOkay, it'll hang together for my lifetime.\nEverybody after me.\nSpeculate on what's going on there.\nI think it's a lot of different things, to be honest.\nI don't think it's one thing.\nI think certainly there is a discomfort with confronting the truth.\nTo think of it, the, the rate of some species, the, the rate of extinction with some species, especially in terms of insects, for example, bees, uh, bee colonies, that, that's very uncomfortable to, when you understand the links between the human food chain and those kinds of extinctions, that becomes really, really desperately uncomfortable.\nThen I think it's a matter that we're able to abandon the illusions we have that give us comfort.\nWe, we tend to think, \"Oh, you know, things won't be as bad as that.\nIt can't be because it's never happened to humanity before, so that can't be right.\"\nAnd I, I think those illusions are a problem.\nAnd so I think it's a number of different things, but until we recommit to the real truth and, and the situation that the human family is in, I mean, it's not all this, um, confrontation and war at the moment, which is really such a distraction away from the things that really matter.\nUh, until, until we can turn the corner, I think, um, we're in trouble.\nYeah.\nThe, uh, I, I regularly say that, you know, war is the stupidest activity of the human race, especially at this late date.\nIt's particularly disturbing that we seem to be back in the vortex of more war, at least more spending for war than we had been for a number of years.\nAnd, but it's also ignorant, isn't it?\n'Cause there hasn't been a winner in a war since 1870.\nI think the, uh, the Prussians won the Franco-Prussian War, got some indemnities from the French, and it probably paid.\nI don't think a single war has paid for either participant since 1870, basically.\nNo, quite the opposite.\nIn fact, it's been detrimental to everybody.\nThat you're right, there have been no winners.\nBut for me, the, the whole idea of solving a problem through confrontation rather than dialogue and fighting rather than diplomacy is just sheer insanity.\nAnd, and surely we're past that.\nSurely humans, given everything that we've achieved.\nYou look at the arts, music, dance, architecture, science, the, the inventions in, in healthcare, for example, the extraordinary, uh, initiative and in, uh, in inventive capacity of humans.\nDo we really have to resort to fisty cuffs and, and throwing bombs at each other?\nI mean, it's just insane.\nYeah.\nWell, it's, I guess, useful to remember we're descended from a very aggressive, very obnoxious species called the chimpanzee.\nWe also have some, some probably descent, or we're actually a common ancestor with the bonobo as well, who are a little nastier than the, their PR, their PR firm puts out, but chimps in particular are, you know, vicious, hierarchical, territorial, murderous, etc.\nUh, so it's, you know, and I sometime I mentor young people in business, they'll come to me and say, \"You know, I was at a, at this meeting at my company, blah, blah, blah, it made no sense to me,\" and I say, \"Ah, you use this rut trick, just visualize the participants as apes with clothes, it'll make a lot more sense.\"\nAnd people, people report back.\nSo, so that, you know, more seriously, the issue is that we are an aggressive killer, uh, society species, uh, and we need institutions and personal change if are going to escape this, uh, this bad attractor of fisticuffs again.\nEven, you know, even the Chinese, uh, you know, they just seem to refuse to rule out the use of force to settle the Taiwan situation, when in reality the answer is Taiwan does not want to be part of China at all.\nAnd yet the Chinese refuse, it's like what, 3% of the people want to merge with China, and yet China continues to wave the nuclear, uh, stick, uh, at, uh, at Taiwan.\nAnd then, you know, that's another, uh, example of, uh, this regression, even of seemingly a better-managed state than in the West, uh, falling back to that old chimpanzee bad habit of hitting the other chimp with a stick.\nHere we might have a point of disagreement, because I don't think there's any reason for China to go to war with Taiwan or the other way around.\nI think inevitably there'll be closer and closer relationships, uh, because it'll come through trade.\nIt's there at the moment.\nIt's growing, and I don't know anyone in either of those\n\n\nTwo countries who would really seriously say, \"We'll have to go to war in order to get what we want.\" Well, she keeps saying it, but, uh, you're right. It makes no sense, right? Particularly if he could back off of that, right? Say, \"Taiwan, do what you want. We don't care, and we will develop. We have ethnic, linguistic, and economic, familial, uh, links, and we'll become, we'll be like Canada and the US, but separate countries.\" But hey, I know the Canadians get pissed off at this, particularly at the moment. They're basically the same people, plus or minus 10%. Uh, and that would be a perfectly good trajectory for Taiwan and China. But at least officially, that's not the Chinese line.\n\nNo, I, I don't think that's going to come to anything. I mean, I really, and all, all the talk about the potential war between China and Taiwan, I'll put on my futurist hat and say I don't see that happening in the next two to three decades. Putting on my military strategist hat, I say if the Chinese don't make a move by 2027, it'll be too late because the long-term change in the balance between the offense and the defense has now switched to the defense, uh, due to, uh, smart weaponry, and Taiwan will be basically unconquerable by 2027 as the, uh, you know, the first hedgehog state where they're investing so heavily in smart munitions that, uh, there's no, there's no way that either an airborne or seaborn invasion could possibly carry off in just a couple of more years. So, and the Chinese aren't probably ready to do it anyway. So, uh, if we could pass that window of vulnerability, 27, 28, it probably won't happen at all, irrespective of what people's motives might be.\n\nSo, so in this case, in this instance, the futurist is agreeing with the militarist.\n\nYep. Exactly. And I am both a futurist and a militarist. But we should go back though to this notion of women. Now, you mentioned my latest book, which was actually written, uh, with a friend, Adam Jacobe. It's called *Man-made*, and it, it's literally looking at the problems that have been caused by men, not just through design, not just through politics, but through a whole range of approaches that deny women the opportunity to have an equal voice. How many, going back, you were saying, uh, well, you know, that's changing, thank goodness, and it has changed, but it's not nearly sufficient, uh, at the moment, I think, to counter the weight of, of the patriarchy in, in effect. Yeah. And when I, and I say this regularly, that when I believe that when historians look back at the 20th century, it won't be the two world wars, it won't be the automobile, it won't be nuclear energy, it won't be landing on the moon, it won't be the internet, uh, that will be the number one accomplishment of the 20th century. It'll be the beginnings and understand the underlying beginnings of the real liberation of women from at least 10,000 years of oppression by the patriarchy, uh, showing real signs of progress by about 1975. And of course, that journey is nowhere near complete, and it's also very important to remember that it is far less complete outside the West, right? Uh, you know, consider the, you know, China, Korea, Japan. I have no idea what the relationship between the genders is in Thailand, but outside the West, there's still a lot more legacy patriarchy, and so patriarchy, uh, you know, leads to, you know, sociopathic, chimplike competition for status, which it does. Then, uh, you know, until the rest of the world can evolve out of its patriarchy, uh, we'll continue to have those problems, and all the, all the societies are changing, with the West way ahead, and none of them have completed the journey yet. So at least I think that's an optimistic vector for the future, uh, as, uh, women become, you know, more front and center, uh, and you know, there's now countries in the West where 50% of the legislature is women, right? That's pretty interesting. We've got a, uh, a woman prime minister in Thailand, or although she's just been suspended, uh, by the constitutional court, but the, the matriarchal knowledge and and application here is in the region, I mean, in Azen generally, is very, very strong and growing.\n\nThat's a good, good threat and and an optimistic vector for the future.\n\nYes, it is. Oh, yes. But to your point, that we still have a fair bit of legacy patriarchal chimp fighting alpha male, uh, that has led us to the place we are.\n\nWell, the other, the other factor, Jim, there is that the women that have made it so far have tended to make it because they played men's games.\n\nThat is very true. I was actually had that discussion recently as well. I mean, go to Wall Street, for instance. There's plenty of women on Wall Street, but they are, they play a lot of them are playing a very masculine game. You know, they're, they, they speak in a with a masculine vocabulary. They think, uh, you scorekeeping, and you know, just like a 14-year-old boy shooting hoops with his buddies, right? Uh, so there is, I think there is some truth to that that, uh, because of...\n\nWell, we need the, we do need the feminine energy coming through in politics and business.\n\nYep. And in, in the West, at least, the electorate is 51 or 52% female. So the opportunity exists over time.\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. No doubt.\n\nAll right. Let's move a little bit in your, in your essay. It's only got a page and a half, but it's, it's rich with stuff. Uh, you do mention that history shows that such cycles of decline are not inevitable. Societies may reverse course. Did you have some examples in mind of, uh, empires or, or systems, uh, that have reached the state of, say, the West, that were able to turn it around and come back? The obvious one, I suppose, is what happened after the Second World War. You know, the Marshall Plan, every, everything that happened in terms of the institutions that were created, League of Nations, then the, um, the UN. I mean, that was extraordinary. That was a real reversal because at the time it wasn't expected. Uh, you know, we, we didn't know where we were. So that, that's the most obvious recent example.\n\nYeah. And in history, I've recently read a history of the, uh, Eastern Roman Empire, and they had their ups and downs, and, uh, you know, various changes occurred in their governance structure, and frankly, a lot of it was just the luck of the draw, who happened to be the empire at the time, and their fortunes fluctuated over time. So it's, it is useful to recall that we can change, and I do like that post-World War II world, cuz the world looked pretty screwed up from World War I through the end of World War II. You know, fascism, communism, uh, you know, wars of ever-increasing intensity up to World War II, the most intense worldwide war ever, by a bunch, punctuated the nuclear weapon. Now what people, somehow we managed to invent a sufficient series of institutions that were appropriate for that time, though not necessarily ours, uh, that got us through, uh, till the, uh, by probably by luck to some degree, when the Russians made the mistake of appointing Gorbachoff, but the collapse of the USSR, when I say mistake from their perspective of appointing Gorbachoff, that the USSR fell, that was a very interesting, highly contingent node in the trajectory of history, and, uh, could have allowed us to build a even better new world, but we failed to do so. We failed to build new, new successor institutions that actually worked.\n\nYeah. I, I, I think if, if you're looking at empire collapse in history, the things that worked, uh, to reverse the, the collapse were two things. Uh, reform, obviously, of, of institutions. Uh, but the other thing was innovation, and the other thing in our favor is today is technological innovation and the rate of change in terms of technology and how, how that can be a real plus for us if we don't allow the, the latest technologies to get into rogue hands or become misused, which is always a great danger. Of course, I'm very, very aware of Jeffrey Hinton's, um, concerns about where AI might be heading if we don't put the guard rails up soon. This is a very two-edged sword. We talked about the fact that the accelerating rate of change and the accelerating complexification of society has now seems to have exceeded the ability of our, at least political institutions, to make sense of the world and to act correctly. Again, at least in the West, with our cumbersome 18th-century, uh, institutions, and so I suspect some of the things that are coming from the current technological revolutions are going to actually continue to increase the stress on our governance institutions. For instance, the *Guardian* just posted, uh, a story the last two or three days that since chat GPT came out in November 2022, it's a 37% reduction in entry-level positions in the UK. That's crazy. Now, of course, correlation is not causation, and some of it may be, uh, Brexit related. Some of it may be, uh, other macroeconomic things related. Uh, but that's a, if, if has anything to do with Chad GPT and the use of LLM style AI in business, it could really stress the system. I mean, your knowledge in the field of complexity far exceeds mine. My, mine doesn't come from a scientific background. It comes from the fact that I was a bunch of, I was in a bunch of composers where our music was called the new complexity. And so my understanding and experience of the science of complexity comes from an arts background. But I think, uh, going to complexity, when, when you understand how different it is from complication, you know, different, different roots, plexa and plea, very, very different roots, that one of the things we lack at the moment, especially in politics, is the ability to visualize patterns. So unless you can do that, you don't really grasp what, what the complexity is and what's, what the dynamics are. The complexity has actually been increasing very rapidly as we have debureaucratized, right? The, uh, think about the changes in, uh, in American businesses, and again, something I know pretty well. There was a lot of big, gray, dominant bureaucratic structures in 1960. You know, General Motors, what's good for General Motors is good for America and vice versa. And the, uh, radical reforms in finance, driven by going off the bold standard in '71, I believe it was, and the deregulation of the stock markets soon thereafter under the Carter administration, similar things happened in the UK, uh, has produced an explosion of complexity in the economic sphere, uh, which has been good for productivity because those big, gray bureaucracies were self-serving, you know, the, the, um, agent principal risk, uh, was manifest in those big organizations, uh, they were run for the benefit of the managers, not for the shareholders, and, uh, they, they did take better care of the c, of the employees than than the complexity-based comp, uh, competition, uh, related market-driven economies that emerged in the '70s and '80s. Uh, but the total level of complexity in society, with products not even asked for that just came out at an incredible rate, uh, has made, is yet another aspect that has caused the, the total complexity in the system to rise by huge amounts, way beyond the ability of our extremely old and oriented towards a more complicated world institutions. And indeed, that post-World War II structure was basically a complicated structure, not a complex one.\n\nThat's right. Another thing that I, I'd pick up on something you've just said, that the, the organization was geared for the manager's benefit, and absolutely right, but that that industrial ethos happened in healthcare. I remember I started life as a as a medic, and the whole system was geared to the convenience of doctors, not patients, and the same thing in education. It was geared to the teachers, the professors, not, not the students.\n\nYep. It's interesting. The market has its huge pluses and its huge minuses. Its huge pluses in theory is at least it makes business accountable to the customer first. On the other hand, it's extraordinarily hard to understand what the second-order effects are. You know, for instance, something like chat CPT, an incredible technological triumph, and interestingly, totally unexpected. You know, I've followed the field of AI closely since I was an undergraduate back before electricity, right? And, uh, nobody expected, except for a tiny, tiny number of people working on them, as as late as 2015, 2016, nobody was expecting this explosion of this particular vector of AI, and it suddenly appeared and manifested in the public eye, uh, with Chad GPT. The, if the *Guardian* story is correct, and may well be, the implications of just this one technological vector in terms of radically restructuring everything about our, how we make a living, how families are structured, uh, etc., could well be immense, and there's no ability to plan for it. It's, you know, it's, we just have to deal with the emerging effects as they come. The notion of emergence and also perhaps a phase transition that because of its use, because I mean, for example, with SMS, nobody really understood how it would be taken and then used by the community. I mean, there was a total, it was extraordinary. So I, I think we may be looking to a phase transition in AI. I, I like to, I, after David Martin, I think I cried this from David Martin, who you probably know, but he's a de, very dear friend, and he refers to AI as augmented insights in terms of what it is at the moment, rather than artificial intelligence, which is, is an interesting definition, but what I, what I know is happening at the moment, there, there are two kind of branches happening. There's the, the pathway of LLMs in terms of what, for, for example, example, what Sam Altman and Johnny IVive are working on at the moment, which I think will be radical or, or even revolutionary within that framework. But then there are others working on a totally different pathway for AI, working at evolving community conversations more deeply, translating languages more effectively, and in the whole communitarian aspect of what AI could become.\n\nYep. And it's as always, we're at a cusp, and whether it's towards on balance the good or on balance the bad is unknown. And I think that the thing that we, you know, the sort of the root of your conversation is that our, our current institutions aren't up to the job of dealing with something at this level.\n\nThey're not. And, and the problem, of course, is with incumbent power, they won't vote themselves out of power. So, how do we, how do we deal with second and third-order change in particular? And the, the only way to do that is not just top-down or, uh, perhaps not top-down at all, but grassroots.\n\nRight? In fact, that's our game B thesis is that we need to move from a fundamentally top-down, but also competitive dynamic to a more cooperative and bottom-up dynamic. But that's a six-hour conversation to explain all that. So we'll pass, we'll pass that by today. Talk about that another day. Uh, now let's move on to another aspect which I've found growing resonance to, which is not only do we have an institutional problem, uh, but I would argue, through the infection of postmodernism, a complete dismissal of the idea of character, morality, and even nobility, right? Those are now laughable virtue, you know, you say character, virtue, and nobility, and most people will assume, accurately in my case, you're an old...\n\n\nFart, you know, uh, we don't think that way anymore. Uh, uh, it seems like you and I share the belief that matters of character, virtue, and morality and even nobility of character matter.\nYeah. I mean, and we were both brought up to believe that, but in our day, there were people, there were individuals we could look up to and admire and respect. There are very few of those today. If you go outside of celebrities, that's a problem. I think a different kind of problem within public life. There are very few people compared with in the days we were growing up where you could say, \"I really admire and respect this person and and and can model my behavior on that person.\" Very few.\nYeah, and even those who've accomplished tremendous things. I mean, I had a, I still have tremendous respect for Elon Musk's entrepreneurial career. You know, I've got something I haven't published on comparing Elon to Napoleon. And if anything, Napoleon was even more outrageous. I mean, Musk was even more outrageous than Napoleon what he accomplished. But the way he did it is, to my mind, not the right way. You know, the, the, you know, he just burns the people relentlessly. You know, he, this just go on and on and on that he is an optimizer for the game he's in, but not a, not, he's not an optimizer at all for character, virtue, or nobility. And that is a real problem. I ask you a question then because do you see his wealth as part of the problem? Do wealthy people tend to be more dismissive? Because I, I must confess that in something I said a few years ago now, I was talking to a government, the cabinet of a particular country. And I was saying in policy terms, I believe every additional billionaire is a policy error.\nI'm a strong believer that we need a vastly more egalitarian form of economics. Right. In the bureaucratic days, the CEO of General Motors made 20 times what the guy on the factory floor made. And now it's probably 500 times. This is just, you know, getting out of hand. And then you get the compounded uh explosions for people who are also playing serious financial games, you know, leverage, etc. And you end up with these not just billionaires, but now we have centabillionaires, right? What the, right? Extremely dangerous. The, the asymmetries uh and then the power that comes from those asymmetries are not what we really need or want. I also point out on the historical record that at the time of the signing of the constitution, the largest free enterprise outside the slave plantations in the United States was a shipyard in Philadelphia with 100 employees, maybe as many as 200, but it was basically what we now call a small business. And that's what we designed our institutions for. Our institutions were not designed for somebody with a, you know, net worth of $300 billion dollar who and then a broken campaign finance system that's been totally gutted uh by the courts uh who can then, you know, help buy uh a presidency. You know, that's obviously wrong. And the fact that we can't fix that shows that our institutions are deeply wrong and flawed, that we can't see that as an obvious problem and fix it. I agree with you totally and this is another advantage I have sitting in this part of the world because with my own family, for example, my Thai family, they, my wife's family are subsistence rice farmers in the far northeast of the country and I see it firsthand when I travel uh still right across this region. I do a lot of work still in Africa, for example. I'm the patron of a small orphanage in uh just outside of uh Kala. And I remember the first time I went uh through Suetto, the thing that struck me most was the entrepreneurial nature of the kids, the young kids in Sutoetto and the even then the big broad smiles and optimism in spite of the uh the poverty. If you can't see the contrast between the wealthiest people, if, if those people can't see the contrast between the life they live and the the bottom 10% of the population, then there's no way they can actually appreciate the difficulty of the need to close that gap.\nYeah. And and it's not just, I mean, the 0.01% 01% for sure, but there's also the 10% top upper middle class people in the western societies at least who over particularly the last 30 or 40 years have insulated themselves from everything else with private schooling, gated communities, fancy condos, etc. Even the food they eat is now quite different than the working people. I grew up in a working-class lower middle-class community. My dad dropped out of high school after 9th grade. He was a cop. Uh, my mother left home when she was 14. You know, crazy story. But in those days, lower middle class, upper working-class people drove similar cars to the doctors and the lawyers, right? They might have driven Cadillacs and we drove Chevys, but what's a Cadillac? But basically a Chevy with a fancy body and a little bit more sound insulation and more chrome. Uh, but now we have, you know, $300,000 Lamborghinis and all this horseshit, right? The, the wall between the social classes has gotten so strong that the people in the top 10% basically no longer feel coupled to the the other 90% of the population.\nWell, this takes us back of course to again the industrial revolution and mass production and what that has given rise to today in terms of excess consumption, excess production and consumption. But again with with incumbent power, how do you tell people, how do you, how do you tell major corporations that they're producing too much or too much variety, you know, when when the whole system is geared to to profit? That's the fundamental, fundamental flaw that so long as a society is based on one dynamic which is money on money return in the relatively short term. This is the emergent result and emergent result you should expect, particularly with the ability for wealth to hack the political system. This is, I could, I put this on a whiteboard. This is three connected lines and three boxes. Uh, you know, we have what we have because we have the system that we have. Well, yeah. And of course, a lot of people blame the system for not working, but actually the system's working as it's been designed to work. It's been, it's working perfectly. Exactly. It's, I wouldn't say perfectly, but it's, it's doing what it is intended to do. Right. Uh, which is extreme, extremely sad. I just did a little side search. Sometimes I do these things. You mentioned Thailand and billionaires. Turns out Thailand has 25 billionaires and a population of 71 million, which means it has slightly more billionaires per capita than average. Isn't that interesting? It is interesting, isn't it? I know a few wealthy people here and they are stinking rich.\nYeah. And the interesting about South Asians in particular, they don't at all mind flaunting their stinky richness. You see a lot of that in Hong Kong though.\nYeah. And in India, too, surprisingly. Right. So it's not just the west that has been infected by this disease. Most of the world is uh is infected by it. Most of the world is also looking for solutions because there's uh, I, I sense wherever I travel that there's a dis, it's, it's, it's more than discontent. There's a feeling that something isn't right, that we're not being told the truth, that the, that that life could be better. And this came home to me even a few years ago when I was, I was mentoring the CEO of one of the world's largest and most successful banks and uh, it was our second meeting and this guy is in the press all the time, very powerful, good decision maker, was actually a very good CEO, and in 5 minutes into our second meeting and he starts cry, I don't know what the question I asked him, but he started crying and I was taken aback. I could, I couldn't believe. But after about, I couldn't get a question in for 5 minutes because he was, he literally started sobbing, sobbing, sobbing. I, I said, \"Are you okay?\" He said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"But Richard, there must be more to life than this. The pressure I have is destroying my marriage. I don't actually believe in the principles I have to adhere to.\" And and and it's tearing me apart. What do I do? And I've come across so many people, not, not necessarily as important or as as he was, quite famous, well-known and wealthy, but there are lots of people all over the world feeling pressure at the moment and can't really describe why or what they can do about it.\nExactly. Actually, I think that is surprisingly hopeful in in the game B world. We, we refer to the fact that we're in a liminal period between two worlds. In fact, uh, Zack Stein, one of the people who I would say is part of the game be movement has written a book called A Time Between Two Worlds. Right? So more and more people every day are starting to feel this way. And you know, 15 years ago it was a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny little fraction of people. Today it's even CEOs of big rapacious banks. So I think we could end on a hopeful note here, which is if we're in a time between two worlds, uh, what does world famous adviser of governments and businesses Richard David Hames suggest for what we ought to do to make sure that the next world is a good world because just because we transition between two worlds, no guarantee it's a better one, could be a worse. What do we do as a civilization to increase the probability we end up in a good new world on the other side of this very distressing liminal period? I think Jim, we have to go back to first principles in a great many respects and ask a fundamental question in the anthropic age. What does it mean to be human? And we have to go back to first principles to really look at ourselves and what we value and what we want to become and think very seriously about what we therefore need to change. From your lips to the world's ears, thank you Richard David Hames for a very interesting wide-ranging conversation based on a recent Facebook post. And as usual, the link to that essay and the other things we've referenced will be on the episode page at jimrutshow.com.\nThanks. It's a real pleasure. Thank you.
