  "cleanText": "Howdy, this is Jim Rut and this is the Jim Rut show.\n[Music]\nListeners have asked us to provide pointers to some of the resources we talk about on the show.\nWe now have links to books and articles referenced in recent podcasts that are available on our website.\nWe also offer full transcripts.\nGo to jimrutshow.com.\nThat's jimrutshow.com.\nToday's guest is Samuel Arbesman.\nSam is a scientist and residence at Lux Capital and a senior fellow of the Silicon Flat Iron Center at the University of Colorado and a research fellow at the Long Now Foundation.\nHe's also the host of the Orthogonal Bet Podcast from Lux Capital.\nWelcome, Sam.\nThank you so much.\nGreat to be chatting with you.\nYes, this should be fun.\nSam's written three books.\nThe first is called Overcomplicated and the second one The Half-Life of Facts.\nSo I'm going to read that one.\nThat just looks very interesting.\nAnd then the one we're going to talk about today, The Magic of Code: How Digital Language Created and Connects Our World and Shapes Our Future.\nVery interesting.\nSo what caused you to write this book?\nWhat was it that motivates?\nA very personal book.\nWell, thank you.\nYeah.\nAnd it was right.\nThere's a lot of a lot of stories about kind of my childhood and my experiences with computers.\nAnd to be honest, when I look at the current conversation around technology and computing, it feels slightly broken.\nI feel like we're kind of either knee-jerk adversarial towards technology.\nWe're worried about various aspects of computing or we're just entirely ignorant of it.\nAnd the truth is a lot of these responses, they're not necessarily bad.\nThey're totally reasonable.\nBut when I think about my own experience with computers growing up, it wasn't just worry and concern.\nIt was full of wonder and delight and like I I didn't feel that computation was just this branch of engineering.\nAnd it was this weird humanistic liberal art that connected to language and philosophy and biology and art.\nAnd and when I think about my childhood full of I don't know the early Macintosh or the Commodore Vic 20 or things around like fractals and Sim City, there was all these weird and exciting aspects to computing and and essentially that's kind of the point of the book for me.\nwas to rekindle that sense of wonder and understanding and to try to provide a sort of healthier way to approach computers to kind of connect the machine to the human and hopefully repair that somewhat broken relationship to technology.\nYeah, I really like that you made the distinction between the uh wondering stance and the utilitarian stance.\nI thought that was that was good and and actually I kind of did it in reverse as an undergraduate at MIT.\nThis was still in the days of punch cards, right?\nAnd IBM mainframes and stuff.\nAnd I had a pretty negative reaction to all that.\nTook one computer science course, kind of distinguished myself from by not being a computer nerd at the time.\nBut then in the uh late 70s, I started seeing these things.\nI was a college textbook pebbler of all weird things and was seeing on these professors desk these early Northstar horizons and mits and what have you.\nWhat the hell are those things?\nComputers.\nReally?\nThat's kind of cool.\nThen uh in 1980 I dumped about 90% of my net worth and bought a totally loaded Apple 2, you know, with a big six, no, not even 64, 48K of RAM.\nWow.\nAnd huge floppy disc drives, right?\nI was the uh most popular computer kid in Lexon, Kentucky, cuz I could copy floppy discs with my two drives, right?\nThere was a way to do it with one drive, but it was a real pain in the ass.\nYou page it back and forth to memory and all this stuff.\nSo, you know, in the days and I just immediately fell in love.\nIt was like, &quot;Wow, this is what it's about.&quot;\nNow I understand why people like computers, which I never liked before.\nIt was the glass house and a bunch of rules and and punch cards and all that sort of stuff.\nAnd I've always found delight and wonder in computing.\nAnd it is interesting and curious for it now to become just a job like any other.\nYeah, I think there's yeah this sense that I mean right now when we think about it right there's this corporatized or kind of enterprise software sort of approach and underneath the hood right there's all these fun and exciting and just weird things and and to be honest that that utilitarian sense and the wondering sense like they've always coexisted within computing like so alongside the punch cards there were people doing kind of early experiments with early computer games and then with the advent of the personal computers not only was there kind of the more playful stuff that that you were introduced to there were also all the office software and like actually putting up a personal computer in into an office space and which probably felt far less exciting for some people.\nAnd the truth is even nowadays when we think about the web and we think about like the the wall digital gardens of like social media and everything like that, it doesn't feel that exciting.\nBut underneath it there are actually people who are they refer to this as the poetic web.\nThey're kind of trying to find and build these just weird websites that are just fun and and and different and just kind of there for the sake of being enjoyable.\nAnd I think we need to find paths to that aspect of computing and because for most people either it's been lost, maybe they had it when they were younger and they kind of forgot about it or some people have just never even been exposed to it.\nYeah.\nAnd you you make an interesting point that a lot of it's about scale, right?\nI had a very curious career.\nWhen I was 17, I had the title of programmer for like six months.\nWhen I was as part of my student labor, pay off my student loans was the programmer for the earth and planetary science department at MIT writing uh uh I think I wrote for my big project was a model of the atmosphere of Jupiter, which was the first planet other than Earth to have its atmosphere modeled.\nNo, the direction of you know, a professor or what have you.\nBut since then, I've never had the title programmer, but I've been manager of software development, senior VP of technology, CTO, you know, all kinds of crazy stuff.\nBut when I do personal writing, it's always at the one person scale.\nAnd that's where the wonder still lives, right?\nWhere you can hold the whole thing in your head and you can play with it and twist it and change it.\nAnd I got a pretty big capacious head both in physical circumference and I think in processing capacity and so I can keep a pretty big program in my head.\nUh but that is then qualitatively different of the skills you need to manage software development.\nAt one point I had 200 techies on one project and that was like holy [ __ ] It was really not much different than running a railroad or something and I will say that particular one everybody had fun.\nAnd we were doing some interesting hard fresh things, but still an awful lot of the reason it was successful and or less successful than it could have been or more successful than it than than you might have expected.\nAnd it was all three actually had much more to do with the the execution of management than it did about the technical magic, which was kind of sad.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I and I think in perhaps one of the reasons I've been able to be a little bit more connected with some of that kind of the the wondering stance kind of approach is I've never worked as a professional software developer.\nI mean I've I've done a lot of programming in the course of scientific research and just kind of using it as a tool and for various projects but as a result it's always been at the level of like working at like on the order of one person.\nAnd so because of that it it always feels a lot more playful.\nAnd I'm sure if I had moved into the realm of yeah more professional software development, a lot of that kind of fun might have been leeched out because sometimes you have to do that in order to push something like ship something and actually get something out the door.\nYeah.\nAnd and it also of course depends on where you are.\nEven today, there's still two or three man teams building cool little apps and that still has a lot of that uh you know magic aspect to it because you can the amount of stuff you can build today with well even before AI with two or three people using the the unbelievable depth and scary stack of software people build stuff on top of these days.\nUh you can get out some pretty cool stuff with two uh two three four person team which you could not do in my day.\nIn my day, you needed, you know, to do big things, you needed big crowds because you had to write everything basically, right?\nAnd I think this is one of those things where it's the the people can do fun little things with small teams because we're able to build on that foundation of all the hard work of the big teams.\nAnd so there is this kind of nice feedback between those two two different things.\nAnd right and certainly now with generative AI, it's uh it is a lot easier to build sophisticated software as just a single person.\nYeah, it is amazing actually.\nAnd uh that was one of the points you made early in the book is that uh where I think you call it a hinge of history where where AI is was doing lots of things and you know I've gone on the record and say I believe that the uh the AI revolution not just including LLMs but the other AI things that are coming like I'm not a believer that LLMs will get us to AGI contrary to some folks uh opinions.\nI think it's an important piece and solved a puzzle we didn't expect to be solved so early which was language right but there's still lots of other parts about reasoning and things that these things are not that good at actually and such but uh it is amazing how it has opened up for those who are have the right mindset uh the ability to have people with no technical background at all become power users of this amazing technology whether it's creating graphics creating music or writing code.\nI have a close collaborator, good friend of mine.\nHe's probably written a 10line Python script or something, right?\nBut nothing any more than that.\nHe's now creating games and all this stuff.\nHe's become a master of uh non- techy techie uh using the the new LLM empowered tools.\nIt's really quite amazing.\nOh yeah.\nAnd and the truth is this is almost and this is the reality of this dream that people have actually had for for decades within computing which is the idea of creating means for non-programmers to actually build software.\nThis is the whole idea of like democratization of code or end user programming or or whatever we want to discuss or whatever we want to kind of term it.\nThis idea that like building software should not be the domain of some sort of scribal elite.\nIt should be available to everyone.\nAnd so if you have an idea you should be able to build things.\nAnd it doesn't necessarily mean you have to build something that is some slick piece of software that could be turned into some venturebackable startup.\nIt should just be something that you might want to use for yourself or for you and your loved ones actually.\nSo the uh the novelist Robin Sloan, he has this great phrase of an app is a home-cooked meal.\nAnd I think that's really what we need more of.\nWe don't necessarily have to be cooking in industrial strength kitchens.\nWe can just be making our own little things.\nAnd now through coding enhanced by AI, people can really do that in ways that would never have been possible before.\nMy friend Peter Wang coined the expression in December 2022 that it was the Wright brothers moment.\nYou know, when GPT 3.5 shipped for the first time from the general public's perspective, the thing got off the ground, could actually do something useful for most people.\nI now like to use the analogy, it's France and Belgium 1916, right?\nThe airplanes are getting good faster and they're becoming diversified.\nWe now have fighters versus bombers.\nWe have spotters.\nWe had reconnaissance planes.\nUh and then was the cool uh French invention where you could shoot the bullet through the propeller by synchronizing the they the timing of the propeller.\nYeah.\nThe propeller and the firing of the machine gun mechanism were linked together extraordinarily clever way.\nAnd so things were happening extremely rapidly and and that's what's happening right now.\nWe're seeing diversification etc.\nBut anyway, I've predicted that AI in all of its glory will have more impact than the internet and the smartphone and that to go back to find a foundational technology as uh powerful, you'd have to go back to the PC.\nAnd of course, uh the smartphone's only a little PC, right?\nAnd the network, well, it's kind of implicit with PCs, at least it was very soon there, soon after they were launched.\nAnd so, uh, we're, you know, this is, and it's and like the PC revolution, it opened up unlimited opportunities for people to find their niche, right?\nAnd it's so unexplored even to this day that uh I god damn it, you know, I wish I was 45 or 35 or 25 instead of some retired old dude.\nUh, this would be so much fun to be out there and be a person with the ability to just invent with all these amazing new tools.\nNo, I definitely think yeah, there's this great I think one of the the features of AI that is most exciting is just kind of the open-endedness where people are just going to be trying lots of different things and experimenting with how to use them and we don't we don't really know where they're going to go.\nAnd yeah, whether or not as you mentioned earlier, LLM are going to be the beall endall or it's going to be some combination of different techniques.\nI'm I'm pretty agnostic there.\nI think we we need to try lots of different things and we don't necessarily need to say that, oh, a specific type of technique is going to solve all of it.\nBut, uh, yeah, it's going to it's going to change a lot.\nI'm hesitant to say how it's going to change things only because I've just I've discovered I'm pretty bad at prediction.\nSo I I don't want to make any any grand predictions, but I'm excited to see what's going where it's going to go.\nAnd but certainly when it comes to software development, it's changing things already massively.\nEverybody I talked to, she knows all about how they use I had a guy on recently, professional high-end uh software architect for a big company.\nHe estimates his personal productivity is up 30x.\nThat's amazing.\nWow.\nI figure my own personal productivity.\nI just finished a little software project where I didn't even look at the code.\nI decided to see if I can do it entirely with the AI and I would say 7x uh now I I'm not quite done.\nWhen I'm done, then I'm going to look at the code.\nNow, the code may horrify me.\nWe'll see.\nBut uh uh I don't\n\n\nKnow. Anyway, let's get back to the book and get down to some of the specifics. Uh, one of the things you talked about is the dual nature of code, that it's this interesting combination of text, but that can result in action. Tell us a little bit about that idea. Yeah, so I mean, when people think about code and kind of the stuff of computation, there's not really any good analogy to what it is because when you're typing text out or generating it, it is text. But the difference is, unlike words in a book, it actually can be executed. It can actually do things. And so it's somewhere in between the stuff of ideas and things that actually operate in the real world. So it's certainly not concrete or physical or anything like that, but it's also not just fun ideas because it has the ability to act in the world. And so one of the, one of the points I make in the book and tying back to kind of the title of *The Magic of Code* is that in many ways it is the embodiment of these ideas that we've had for millennia of using text to coerce the world and using words to control the world around us of spells and incantations and sorcery. And we now have that to a certain degree in the real world, which is, and we can, we can do magic with code where it was this thing where it seemed like a cool idea for a long time, and only since, I don't know, 75 years or so, whenever the first digital computers came around, now it's a reality, and because it's text that works, that operates in the world. Yeah.\n\nYou used quite a few analogies to magic and to the Jewish mystical cabella and also the talmid, uh, as examples of code that had impact in the world. Don't eat pork. You know, there's text on a page that has impact in the world, or you know, *Book of Joshua*. Always say you want to really understand Yahweh, you got to read the *Book of Joshua*, you know, killed them all, right? And those words, uh, you know, had impact, and you're actually quite eloquent in comparing how way back yonder magic wasn't just for the shamans. Everybody practiced magic at one level or another, uh, in a way that today, at least in some sense, we're all using these magic spells, right? And yes, I mean, I, I certainly give a lot of analogies when it comes to magic, and um, hopefully not so many that the analogy fully breaks, but you're right, like there are a lot of deep similarities, and clearly, right, it's, it was not just the domain of the elite. Like on the one hand, magic was not something that just worked. It wasn't kind of this like wishy-washy wave a wand and you're done. There was a craft and and work to it. Um, in the same way, I, whether or not you're studying for seven years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry or studying to understand Python better or whatever, like there are similarities. But at the same time, though, there was this idea that magic could be democratized, that there were certain spells for, I don't know, finding lost cattle or whatever that, whatever it was, um, that could be performed by everyone. And we're now seeing, and going back to like the democratization of code, that's a thing we, we should want. We want everyone to be able to write software, enter, or engage with it. And, and I would say probably the first widespread example of that, uh, which many people don't think of as coding, is the spreadsheet, because if you're, if you're writing functions and spreadsheets, you are doing coding, at least to a certain degree. And that's one of the few democratizing code examples that I think people have been able to point to for several decades now with AI. Maybe we're going to have some new ones. But yeah, I think there's both obviously effort and craft, but it shouldn't just be the elite. There should be ways of allowing everyone to, to have a part to play in this, in this kind of magic. Yeah.\n\nI still recall, uh, when I bought my first copy of VisiCalc for my Apple, and this was in the days when software was still sold in ziplock bags with, uh, dot matrix printer labels on it, and I had, it had a serial number on it. It was 254. I very much wished it was 255. Oh, that would have been great. But it was 254. And I took it home and I started building models like crazy. Oh my god, what the hell? Right. This was, uh, you know, I was still a young business dude at the time. I'd been trying to conceptualize how to model a company and things of that, and in minutes, uh, I was doing more like I do writing, you know, basic programs on my Apple and stuff, and then I ran into the fact there was a bug in early VisiCalc, because if you built a model that was too big, it needed a memory buffer to write this the model out to disk. And about 4:00 in the morning, I went to save this crazed model I'd created. It totally filled up my computer and it wouldn't save it. Oh no. Oh god dare. That's terrible. That was so annoying. But, uh, yeah, it really is an example. There was, you also called out another example, which I was never a heavy user, a little bit. Uh, or I don't think I used it directly, but I used to clone that ran on the PC was *HyperCard*. That was quite a thing in its day. Yeah. Yeah. *HyperCard*. Yeah. So that was, and the truth is, *HyperCard* was my first experience with programming. So, *HyperCard* was this piece of software that came bundled with the Macintosh, probably beginning in the late '80s through maybe like the late '90s or so. And it was this authoring tool for building what it referred to as stacks of cards. And so the cards were basically just pages, and then you can kind of connect them together and into an entire, basically, think of it as a website that lived on your own machine. And you could enter text, you could enter images, you could draw on them, but you could also add little buttons and then make a button that would, I don't know, make a beeping noise or bouncing noise. You could have a button that would take you to another, another card. And then under the hood, there was actually an entire language. It was called HyperTalk. And it was this very relatively simple language to understand and to read. So *HyperCard* was this weird thing where, and so there's, there's a phrase attributed to the computer scientist Seymour Papert. Uh, he was the one of the developers of Logo. He referred to low floors and high ceilings. And my *HyperCard* really embodied this idea of it was low floors. It was very easy to just build a simple stack or cards, but the ceilings were very, very high. You could, you could build all these different, very sophisticated pieces of software. So, for example, I think the first version of the computer game *Myst*, which was like, I think the bestselling computer game in the 1990s, that was built originally in *HyperCard*, and people use it for running databases, all different, different kinds of things. I remember building simple like password generator using, using *HyperCard*, and for me that was really my first taste of programming, and it was, I think for me, only possible because it had that low floor. It allowed me to just mess around and slowly but surely become comfortable with that kind of programming, and so for a certain generation of Macintosh users, it was eye-opening and life-changing. And now I think there's many people who look to it as this kind of like mythical golden age of, of, of end-user programming or, or software development for non-programmers. I played with it again, I think in emulation on the internet archives website, and it was a little janky. It wasn't quite as good as, as quite as what, what I remembered in my, in my memory, but it was still very powerful and, and unbelievable, and, and I certainly think we need that kind of feeling to be in, in our software development. Now, of course, the thing that killed it was the web, right? And, uh, you know, when I look back at the web, as a person interested in computer architectures and protocols and stuff, I'm still horrified by HTML and HTTP. The fact that our world is built on these shitty, shitty protocols is just unbelievable to, right? The fact that we can do all these amazing things on top of something that clearly was not designed for all those things. And so, right, there was actually, I think the developer of *HyperCard*, Bill Atkinson, who I believe actually just, just passed away recently. He kind of regretted that he never thought about kind of building a sort of worked version of *HyperCard* or that he never kind of quite thought of, quite thought of the web. And certainly if we had had that kind of architecture, kind of a more hyperardy architecture underlying the web, I think the democratization of web development would be that much better. That being said, the truth is, the early days of web development in like the, like the mid '90s, there was not that much of a difference between professional websites and amateur websites. Because that was exactly my point is that in the early days of the web, you could say, \"Wa, look at that.\" You know, the, the, uh, you know, the brick store down the road's got a website, and you tell your secretary to go show her how to use show source, copy and paste, right? You look at the source, you Yeah. And you, and you, you, right, you learn from it, and, and now it's in completely, it's completely impenetrable. You look at the source and you have no idea what's going on, which on the one hand, yeah, is really unfortunate in terms of allowing people to have that low floor and kind of that entry point. But I guess on the good side, it's, it is still impressive that we are able to have come so far on such a shoddy foundation, maybe. I continue to shake my head. It's like, oh my god, I absolutely nothing I hate worse than primary web development. Uh, if I've done very, very little of it. You know, I, I try to find, uh, find other tools that will do so. One of them I, I currently use, if I have to build something for the web, I use Flutter, which is, uh, a Google product that it's a real programming language and let you do everything on the web and more on the web with normal programming tools and, you know, debugging, all kinds of good things. No CSS. Uh, so if you want, you want to try doing web without all the horrific sludge of the last 30 years, check out, uh, Google's Flutter.\n\nWell, let's get back to the main line of the book, though, and this is, and you, we're kind of hinting at it. We're dancing at the top level. Uh, but what, what has made all this tower of babel possible is layers and layers of abstraction. And you go all the way down back to the days when programming meant connecting wires. Why don't you tell a little bit the story of how the tool chains arose? Yeah. Well, I, well, certainly, so one of the other reasons I actually include a lot of history, one, I actually think it's very, very important to understand the history of computing to actually kind of get a better sense of where we're going to be going. And I actually think that the world of Silicon Valley, unfortunately, is deeply ignorant of technological history, sometimes proudly so. And that that's certainly a problem when it comes to not trying to reinvent things that have been discovered and understanding the path dependence. And so I tried to do that. I also wanted to delve into the history because it's interesting, but also the fact that I mean, given the fact that with AI and everything else is changing so quickly, the history is the stuff that I know is not going to be changing. So I want to discuss, discuss a little bit more of that. But when it comes to the history of computing, right, there is this idea of abstraction. This, this idea that you can abstract away the details. You can kind of ignore details and build upon interfaces and kind of higher level things without necessarily having to know somewhat of the details that have come before you, which as a result has allowed us to build really, really sophisticated things. And we were talking earlier about the fact that you can now build very powerful things with only one or two people because we have this foundation upon which to build. But that foundation started a very long time ago with just, I mean, with chips and binary and working with wires and cables and very early ones, and then working with machine language, which was really instructions in zeros and ones, and then eventually assembly code, and then eventually at a certain point, people realized we need better languages of interfacing with our computers, and they actually created kind of modern computer languages, which were then were then compiled into these kind of lower level languages, and the truth is that is kind of how things have always in, is that even though we might be operating at some very high level using these sophisticated web frameworks or whatever it is, at some point it all goes back down to the bottom of binary and machine code and and that kind of thing. I think most people who are engaging with computers are aware of at least at some, some vague level. If you took a intro course, you probably know that somewhere at the bottom is are the bits, right? But even, even programmers who work with these things on a daily basis, you don't, you, you really can't look at that for too long without kind of being overwhelmed by it. You kind of have to say, \"Okay, this is the fact of these things when things go wrong, maybe I have to kind of splunk down into the depths, but by and large, I really do not have to to do that.\" And I actually think the fact that you don't is an unbelievable accomplishment. Like that is one of these things that I mean, so there is this, um, computer scientist Edgar Dijkstra. He was foundational for writing a lot of like early algorithms and early ideas. He did alcohol, didn't he? Um, I actually don't know. Um, he might have been involved, and he wrote a lot of, a lot of essays about computing, and he was kind of this interesting kermogenly figure, and one of the phrases he talks about is this idea of the radical novelty of programming, and and I think when people talk about programming, they try to use lots of analogies, which I, which I do as well in the book, um, of like, oh, it's like, it's like writing a recipe or following a recipe or or writing a set of instructions or doing these kinds of things, and it is sort or assembling Lego bricks or whatever it is, and it is sort of these things, but it's also wildly different because of this vast edifice of abstraction that we build upon, and and I think that's it's unbelievable that we're able to do these kinds of things. But it's certainly worth revisiting and and thinking about at least a little bit, and, uh, and as you say, that's how you know, three dudes can build a cool project. And it's interesting how the stack, there's a depth to the stack, because, uh, the people understand certain things down below, but they don't understand down, like back in the day when, uh, my companies were doing PC-based fancy information systems, we always had to have on our staff someone who could debug the output of the compilers, right? Oh yeah. And then and\n\n\nI look back at how I mean I read about these like the legends of like Steve Waznjak and the way he was programming things by hand and then and then running and and those kinds of accomplishments, they're unbelievable, but I cannot even fathom doing anything like that because we are now so distant from those levels on a daily basis.\nAnd there are certainly people, some people who are involved in that, but uh but by and large, I think most programmers kind of make a point of trying to avoid those details.\nYeah.\nSo you have a floating stack.\nMaybe you go down a layer or two below where you're working every day.\nUh but but no lower than that.\nAnd as the stack gets taller, the uh uh you know the distance you are from the real machine because even in our day when we thought we were cool cuz we could debug assembler that the compiler put out, uh we had no idea what was going on at the chip level, which is another level of abstraction.\nI later got involved with a couple of chip design software companies and there's a you know there's physics underneath and noise and you know averaging things out to zero and one is not as obvious as it seems.\nRight.\nOh yeah.\nNo, it's it's unbelievable.\nThere's a whole a whole stack of things that give us stable zeros and ones.\nYou know, physics does not give you zeros and ones.\nRight.\nRight.\nNo, there is a there is a hard set of Yeah.\nThere's a a a great deal of effort put in to create the discretization of the zeros and ones of the binary, right?\nTo avoid kind of all the messiness of physics and which is one probably one of the reasons why these things are being constructed in in clean rooms.\nYeah.\nTo avoid kind of the messiness of the real world.\nYeah.\nIn fact, now the at the four nanometer scale, you actually have to deal with the uh quantum effects.\nUh so the whole thing just gets gnarier and gnarier.\nThere are your magicians.\nThere are your sages and your shamans.\nThe people that create 50 billion transistor chips, you know, the size of, you know, a couple of posted stances.\nAll right.\nIt's mindboggling.\nIt's like whoa.\nIf I think about the stack of humanity's technology, somehow that's the top, right?\nThat this whole thing is focused on creating those suckers.\nAnd of course, as we go into the AI world, it becomes even more the case where, you know, be okay, how many uh uh chip equivalents equals one person in cognitive ability.\nAnd that number will will continue to uh you know, improve at Moore's law probably for another five or eight years at least, which is uh kind of mindboggling.\nThat's wild.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat's super interesting to think about.\nIt really is.\nLet's return to the idea of code and magic.\nThere's one little section in the book that I found very charming.\nMaybe you stretch the analogy a little bit, but within but within the tool range for entertainment purposes, and that's where you laid out four categories of names, combining and manipulating text, grimaries, and sacrifice.\nWould you be willing to go through all four of those?\nI think that they're kind of interesting and fun.\nYeah, sure.\nSo, so yes, the first one, the idea of names in stories of magic and the ability to name something or have or elucidate the true name of some creature or or someone that confers upon you a certain amount of power because you can control something with names.\nAnd so for me, the relevant analogy there in in code is that of variables.\nSo understanding the variable of kind of this name of some sort of bit of information within within your code is the same kind of thing.\nAnd it turns out, I mean, there are simple variables that just hold single numbers or a single word of text, but often times variables themselves can actually have complicated structure under the hood.\nAnd so understanding the nature of that name, the nature of that variable can also actually give you a certain amount of power.\nUm, and then I also discuss how there is certain type of variable um called a global variable where it's the these are variables that that can be used anywhere within a computer program.\nThey're often considered to be far too powerful for your own good because someone might someone else who use us use uses the code or you yourself might use it accidentally somewhere else and you can have all these unforeseen consequences.\nSo there are certainly true names that have far more power than you might want and so global variables are an example and we should avoid them.\nSo that so that's kind of the example of variables and names as sort of this interesting similarity when it comes to magic.\nThe other idea of the second one is around combining and manipulating text.\nAnd so uh the example I give there is within the idea of the cabala.\nThis kind of like this sort of cobbalistic manipulation of letters and words that somehow if you can kind of figure out the right combination of letters then that can give you power over some a golem or or some sort of other creature or whatever it is.\nUm or you can actually do do magic and and at one level that is essentially what what code is.\nYou kind of that's a direct analogy with spells essentially.\nRight.\nExactly.\nSo it's exactly with spells.\nYou put the right right strings of zeros and ones together you can do that kind of thing.\nI give one example of I think I talk a lot about regular expressions as kind of these like fun which are they are compact expressions for snippets of text where you're kind of like doing searching and replacing or finding and things like that that often have this feel of looking like kind of random strings.\nThey are not random.\nThey're just kind of weird things you have to kind of cobble together.\nBut if you do them the right way, it can immediately ma and almost magically pull out the exact dates within a large file or whatever it is or names and things like that.\nAnd so that was kind of another example I gave.\nBy the way, uh that's one of the things that LLMs boost your power on the most is regular expressions.\nTrying to write a useful regular expression hurt your head.\nI mean, I know no programmers, maybe I know one who's a true expert in regular expressions, but turns out even early chat was a wizard at it.\nYou just describe what you want and it generally get it right on the first shot.\nIf not to get it right on the second shot, you gave it a couple of examples of what it did wrong.\nSo, if you ever need to use regular expressions, folks, just fire up chat GPT if you don't have anything more powerful than that.\nOh, that is good.\nIt also just shows you the extent to which in humans are and we're limited in many different ways but our minds just we can't hold that many things in our heads and when it comes to regular expressions you often have to hold a lot of things in your head and it's very hard to do that well you only got a working memory size of seven max and some of those work some of those strings are 30 you know tokens or at least 15 and that's like can't do that right and so yeah so the the third example you gave was the grimoire and so is these like texts of mag of of m of magic texts of spells and books of spells and sorcery and incantations and things like that and obviously they exist in the magical world but it turns out we have these in software and we have whether it's computer manuals we have like numerical recipes in C or whatever these things are but of course I mean one of the grandest grimmooars is Stack Overflow it's a crowdbuilt website where people can ask questions and people can provide little snippets of code that can allow you to do all the different things so if you need oh I to flatten a list in a certain way in in Python or some other language, you look online and invariably there is someone who has also had that problem and you can go and look into your grimoire and find those answers.\nNow, of course with JPT and some of these other kind of tools, the usefulness of these is is somewhat lessened, but uh but yeah, there is a grand tradition as well of kind of combining and collecting little tricks and tools and techniques and small algorithms together into these kinds of books similar to the Grimars.\nI don't know if you mentioned or not, but the the one for my generation, every real nerd had them on on their bookshelf was Kuth's Art of Computer Programming.\nThree three volumes full of recipes all written in his own personal pseudo code, right?\nHe Right.\nHe had his own pseudo code.\nHe had his own I think chip like it was like a custom chip that he like it was like a like a sort of like a chip.\nYeah, it was a Yeah, a thought experiment.\nAnd and the truth and so I think I mentioned Canuth and various other things.\nI don't think I I don't know if I mentioned Art of Computer Programming.\nI mean it's also and it is this multi volume thing which is still under construction like he is still currently working on this thing which I don't actually know what volume it's up to but you're right there's some foundational algorithms in there as well which is which is delightful for the longest time back when before all these libraries existed where all these li people have now implemented these all these things like say in the Python world it used to be just go up look in cano and look it up and okay now how do I convert this to my language and 20 minutes you'd have something that would have taken you 3 days or more to do if you could do it at all.\nRight.\nExactly.\nIt was an extraordin\nevery sorting algorithm I've ever heard of.\nI think yeah, one entire volume is just sorting, I believe.\nRemember, it was like the thing is nuts.\nBut every nerd my day had it on their bookshelf.\nI proudly had a copy.\nYeah, I I definitely I think I have I have the first the first volume somewhere I'm pointing down.\nYeah.\nDown next to me.\nBut uh yeah, no, that that would definitely be another example of a of a grimoire.\nAnd then your final category with a little bit of a stretch, sacrifice.\nYeah, so it was a little bit of a stretch.\nSo that one actually was inspired.\nI had this wonderful conversation.\nIt was like at this online salon where I was talking about magic of code and someone mentioned this interesting idea around sacrifice and it got me thinking more deeply and uh and I thought I thought it worthwhile to include because in in stories of magic there's often this idea of something must be sacrificed in order for the magic to operate.\nAnd for many people when we think about how these powerful AI tools are operating we realize they're not coming out of nowhere.\nThey are enormously sophisticated algorithms, but they only operate because they have huge amounts of data being poured into them.\nAnd so essentially what we are doing in somewhat of an analogy, we are sacrificing huge amounts of creative work into these systems in order to get them to become as powerful as possible.\nAnd you can see some of these hints of and when you there were certain versions of image generation tools when you would generate an image and it would you would get sort of a fuzzy Getty watermark on there and you realize oh they are actually using copyrighted images as the grist as the raw material for these kinds of things and so so it just made me realize that right there is an element of sacrifice as well in allowing these powerful AI tools to operate.\nYeah, that is and so of course this is a hugely latigious field.\nNo one quite knows how it's going to land, right?\nAnd of course the other thing that's important for us to think about is the whole idea of copyright is relatively new.\nI don't think it's any earlier than the 17th century.\nUh it used to be creators created, people copied, right?\nAnd that was just the way it was in the world.\nYou know, think of Homer, poor dude.\nAs far as I know, he got no royalties, right?\nAnd ideally like the ideal world of copyright is that you have to find a way of balancing the idea of okay you want creators to be incentivized to create but you also recognize that creation should eventually become part of the public domain.\nThey should be public goods that can be the raw materials for further creation.\nAnd I think right now with the AI tools kind of just sucking in all this stuff, I think there hasn't been a lot of deep thought at least maybe from the from the side of the companies doing this kind of things of how to think about this properly.\nThat being said, I certainly think certain of our copyright laws have have aired on the side of locking everything down.\nWe need to have some sort of common source of foundation of c creative work that can be drawn upon.\nAnd I think right now where it's was it 70 years after the death of of the creator or whatever it is the Disney exactly that feels that feels overly excessive and so we should figure out what is the right balance and I I'm not sure we're there yet but I am glad that a lot of people are having this kind of conversation because right there needs to be a balance like and and the answer is I don't know where where the answer lies.\nI am glad people are having these conversations.\nUh, I do wonder if some of these lawsuits will squaltch certain things in sometimes counterproductive ways, but I also recognize that they can't just suck up and hoover up all the information that's out there without realizing that it actually does have implications.\nSo, that's a long way of saying I don't know what the right answer is, but I do know that we haven't figured it out yet.\nYeah, our current laws obviously didn't anticipate this.\nAnd so John Perry Barlo I think very vividly said about copyright.\nUh copyright protects the bottle not the wine.\nRight?\nSo it's the only it's the exact sequence of words and not the ideas.\nAnd LLMs are great at sucking the ideas out without giving you the exact words.\nOccasionally they do by accident.\nThey're not supposed to.\nRight.\nYou can sort of coers them into doing so to some degree but in general they don't.\nAnd uh but the ideas which are under our uh system of law not copyrightable.\nIt just says titles are not copyrightable.\nInterestingly enough, this was just you know a case of first experience where law doesn't actually apply.\nMy bet is if uh there's an honest uh outcome in the courts.\nThe courts will rule that uh calculating uh you know vector statistics from a body of work is fair use under any conventional read.\nBut it doesn't mean it's correct.\nRight?\nIt means that that's how the law should be literally interpreted.\nAnd unfortunately with our broken politics, I'm not at all sure how we're going to get to have a discussion about how to do this balance, which you you know eloquently point out.\nThe creators need incentives, but humanity needs to be able to benefit from from the creators.\nAnd this is a a classic social question, right?\nThere's no right or wrong to this.\nIt's a it's a balancing act.\nWell, by the way, I do have an answer on the right answer for\n\n\nNormal copyright, and it's very simple.\nHeristic. It should be 10 years so that when you're 25, you can dub the music in from when you were 15 into the movies that you make.\nInteresting. Okay.\nYou know, so when you're 25 for me, that would have been okay.\nOkay, I can start using Led Zeppelin in my, uh, my home movies and in my, uh, YouTubetubes and things.\nWell, and in truth, and you know this as a writer, very few people make any money after 10 years.\nAnd so what, what you're essentially doing is clipping off some lottery tickets.\nAnd there's no real need for lottery.\nYou didn't write your book on the thought that, you know, this thing is going to sell 17 million copies and people will be throwing, uh, red tomatoes at you because you offended some politically correct thing.\nYou, you figured out, yeah, this is what this kind of book sells, and it's worth my work to do it.\nAnd for other reasons.\nAnd of course, winners of lottery tickets want to preserve those lottery tickets for as long as possible.\nAnd that's the real corrupt thing about our copyright.\nWe just said 10 years.\nYes, a few, a little bit of injustice would be done at the margins.\nVery few things are created to have a 10-year useful life.\nMaybe a new dictionary or something.\nAnd not only that, there are very few situations where something be like, where is, is not successful for the first 10 years or whatever of, of its life and then suddenly becomes successful.\nAnd I, right, and that's the situation I think people are trying to protect against, but that is clearly very much an edge case.\nYeah, such an edge case relative to all the other benefits that would come from doing a 10-year.\nWhen I'm 25, I want to use my, the music that I fell in love with when I was 15.\nThat's interesting.\nA very simple heristic.\nLet's got to continue this because it's, uh, it's related but different.\nAnd, uh, you do a little bit of a dive into open source, and you know, open source isn't quite as intuitive as the name sounds, right?\nThere are different flavors of open source, so tell us what you know about open source.\nYeah, and so open source, right?\nIt's in some ways kind of an extension of what we're talking about, of this idea of being able to develop things that become part of the, the found, the common foundation that people can build upon.\nAnd so in this case, open source, and there are certainly different variations, but, but the idea behind, behind it is that the, the source code, in this case, the actual code that a piece of software is built upon should not be locked up.\nSo oftentimes when you have a piece of software, you have the kind of compiled version, so you can use it, but you can't necessarily edit it or see how it was written.\nBut when it comes to open source, that, that aspect of the, of the software is available for people to either add to, combine to, build upon, to copy, or to kind of build their own versions of it, often with various kinds of restrictions.\nUm, it kind of depends on the various licenses and things like that.\nBut it turns out that kind of that openness really is ultimately just kind of an example of sort of the creative process more broadly, which is going back to what we were saying, that all creativity is this process of recombination.\nAnd when you combine recombination with this idea of abstraction within software, that is this, the idea is that you can only build things if you have a foundation to build upon.\nSo rather than having to reinvent everything from the ground up, you can, you can incorporate various software packages that other people have built.\nYou can build upon other people's software.\nYou can take something that someone has made and then make it your own.\nAnd ultimately that is kind of, and that is the way in which all creativity really is done.\nAnd so open source is kind of one example of that.\nAnd I go into the ways in which software has been built over time.\nAnd actually, I, one of the examples I give, it's sort of even before open source was really open source, which is the idea of Unix and Linux.\nAnd so Unix, I mean, was originally developed by, by Bell Labs.\nIt was not designed to be open source software.\nIt kind of escaped, and then there's many, many different variations.\nAnd for me, the way I think about it is, I actually think about it as a sort of like textual, oral tradition, kind of by analogy of like ancient myth, mythological tales.\nAnd so when it comes to mythological tales, like there's no real canonical example, like a canonical version of a story.\nThere might be many different variations of the stories of Hercules or Zeus or whatever it is, but over time people add to the stories, people modify them, they change them, and the ones that are kind of the best and resonate with people, those are the ones that stand the test of time.\nAnd in many ways, that's what happened with Unix.\nIt was kind of modified and changed and honed, and, and there, there's different variations and more truly of software in general, especially open source software, that is kind of how it, it evolves, that there is this kind of textual tradition.\nUltimately, though, it's not enough to just have something as open source.\nYou can't just have, \"Oh, the thing that is available to be downloaded.\"\nIt has to also be part of a community, and because in the same way that ancient mythological tales were part of the community of the ancient Greeks, right?\nLike, they were the ones promagating these things, and, and people, people who listen to them and enjoy them.\nYou need the same kind of thing.\nYou need a community that is actually preserving and maintaining these pieces of software as well.\nIt doesn't work if you just say, \"Oh, here it is.\nYou can download it, but if no one really cares, it kind of just vanishes without a trace.\"\nAnd so this, this combination of tradition and community is something that I think many people sort of outside of the realm of open source software don't necessarily realize that these things are really powerful and really important for allowing that kind of open-ended creativity.\nYeah.\nIt is interesting that, you know, your point about it is a live ecosystem unless it's a very narrow thing that you're trying to get your open source software to do.\nI always look at how many commits have been done recently.\nRight.\nThere's one I use that hasn't had any commits for seven years, but, uh, well, they might have just, they might have honed it to perfection, and they're like, \"We are done.\nWe're not going to break it ever again.\"\nExactly.\nWhich is not a bad thing either.\nBut anything that's somewhat modern, you're definitely looking for.\nAnd you, and you do reference the Python ecosystem fair bit.\nAnd in, in Python, there's layers and layers and layers of open- source software, like NumPy, which is this matrix math thing, is used in stacks upon stacks and stacks of software.\nAnd you know, everyone relies upon it.\nAnd if you know there's any changes between additions that are, you know, that has to be stone stable, has to be backwardly compatible.\nAnd this all requires considerable work, not just within the core team of building NumPy, but with the other people in the community so it can be tested to make sure there's no breaking changes, etc.\nIt's quite an elaborate ecosystem actually.\nOh yeah.\nNo, and yeah, the Python ecosystem, it's unbelievable, and I've relied on it and in my own research and work, and yeah, just the sheer volume of libraries and packages is amazing, but ex goes back to exactly what you're saying, which is where you need this active community of maintainers.\nAnd I think many people, even users of software and, and programmers, sometimes think, \"Oh, because this thing is open source, there's going to be this huge community of people working on it.\"\nAnd by and large, that seems to not be the case.\nOften times, it is a very small number of individuals who are maintaining even very, very powerful and active and popular packages and pieces of software, and, and often times people don't realize this until, and something breaks or you discover some weird bug in some, some foundational bit of the internet or whatever it was, and you realize, \"Oh, it's just like one or two people who have been working on this kind of thing thanklessly,\" and, and even though it's really, really important.\nAnd so there's this, uh, I think attributed to, uh, Linus Toval from Linux, the idea of like, with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\nLike, you have enough people looking at things, then everyone, then eventually all the bugs will be kind of worked out.\nAnd I think in theory that is, that is true.\nBut by and large, there are not nearly as many eyeballs as we would like, especially when it comes to maintenance, because yeah, these things which should have huge numbers of people involved in actively maintaining and modifying them, they are really just kind of a small number of put-upon people, which is, which is kind of unfortunate.\nMany of the little ones I use, 1.5 seems to be the magic number.\nThere's one guy that does like 80 or 90% of the work.\nThere's two or three people that each do 5% or something.\nAnd that would not surprise me.\nYeah.\nEven, you know, one I use a lot, Zero MQ, very tiny team, a very exotic piece of software that's a, a messaging, uh, infrastructure for the, for any language, basically.\nWorks really nice with Python.\nAnd, uh, you know, if you ever need to do interprocess communication really high speed, 200,000 messages a second, truck, check out zero, you, and real easy, you know, it's, it's, it's really perfect.\nIt is interesting, the, uh, the incentives people must be getting to do this work is often times it is thankless, particularly on a mature piece of software.\nWe're not adding anything too interesting here, you know, tiny incremental improvements, fixing weird little bugs in obscure corner cases and something, but we'd be damn, uh, you know, damn glad that somehow either psychic income or reputational income or somehow it works.\nYeah.\nNo, I'm glad that, right.\nOverall, even though it is, yeah, these systems are far from kind of a theoretical ideal, it does work much better than, than would be expected, which is, which is wonderful to see.\nYeah.\nAll right, let's move on a little bit.\nAnd, uh, you talked about some of the kind of interesting ideas of microcosms where small bits of things can produce amazing, amazing things.\nAnd you referenced a, a game, I think it's called No Man's Sky.\nIs that the one where you, a single number generates the whole world?\nYeah.\nI, so there obviously is a huge amount of, of code that is going into elaborating that, that single number.\nBut you're right.\nThis is the, the these emerging microcosms are really examples of the fundamental idea of computers, which is a computer is not necessarily doing any specific thing that is mind-bogglingly complex or sophisticated.\nIt's just doing a lot of very simple calculations a huge number of times.\nAnd those kinds of things can really add up.\nAnd so as a result, if you have a clever algorithm, it can actually elaborate a very sophisticated thing, very sophisticated procedurally generated world within the case of a game or especially within kind of the world of mathematics.\nThere are these mathematical objects like fractals or cellular automata where you can describe them in a very sort of compact way, sometimes handful of lines of code, but they can sometimes have infinite complexity where you can kind of, you can jump into the mandler set as deep as you like and see new things.\nSometimes things that no human being has ever seen if you dive in deep enough or in the case of cellular automata.\nIt's just these simple rules of how different dots on a screen are interacting or, or points on a screen or it's kind of this grid of black and white dots.\nAnd so like the classic one is John Horton Conway's game of life.\nAnd, and then from that you get this, this emergence of various creaturelike objects that move about the screen or do different things.\nAnd for me, I just find that aspect of computing, uh, unbelievable.\nI, I certainly like my, my first kind of experience with a lot of these is through like early screen savers that use a lot of these simple bits of code to just make really cool images on the screen, ostensibly to kind of prevent screen burnin on your cathode ray tube, um, which is now irrelevant, but in the process kind of used a combination of math and randomness and just kind of delightful like animations to make some really interesting things.\nAnd I think that that whole world, whether it's creative coding now or back then screen savers or the, the demo scene or whatever it is, are able to really take seriously this idea of using a small snippet of code to unfurl this entire microcosm of complexity.\nYeah, it's very cool.\nThe regular listeners to the podcast know I have a game out in the world called Network Wars.\nYou can check it out, networkwarss.com, or get it on iPhone or Android.\nAnd it also has a 32-bit world generator number, and everybody plays the same games, one, so you can rank yourself against everybody else, cuz they, everyone's gone through the same sequence of games, which is kind of cool, and it was an idea I had.\nI didn't realize somebody else had had it.\nThey have a, a single seed to generate the world, but it makes sense actually from a, from a, a programming perspective.\nNow, this section of the book did horrify me was something I said, I think I said in the pregame.\nI, I did learn a few things despite knowing a fair bit about the history of computing, and that was code golf.\nOh my god, exactly the wrong thing to do.\nBut nonetheless, tell the audience what is code golf.\nSo by analogy with golf, where a lower score is a better score.\nCode golf is the practice or the game or the hobby or pastime, whatever you want to call it, or maybe some misbgotten practice based on the, the way you reacted to complete a task in as few lines of, of code or a few characters of code as possible.\nSo it might be to create a, the, the smallest program possible that will actually calculate the, the number pi or will, I don't know, draw the mandler set or, or whatever it is.\nAnd so the, uh, and so code, and people compete, and they'll, they'll say, \"Okay, let's see who can make the smallest program in PHP or Python or whatever it is,\" and it is alternately horrifying, maddening, confusing, and also humbling and impressive because it's, it's this thing, like, it's, it's a means of taking a language and sort of bending it to your will in a way that you might never have expected and just do something that you never really thought was possible.\nAnd I found that unbelievably interesting.\nIt was amazing to kind of see how people are able to kind of compress something really, really sophisticated into this very small, well-night unreadable snippet of code, and that it was sort of an extreme example of these kind of emergent microcosms of something people were, people are working very, very hard to compress it as much as possible.\nThat being said, I will, I will, um, caveat this with, and one of the things when people think about programming languages, and I, I, I believe I, I quote this in the book.\nSo there's this classic textbook, structure interpretation of computer programs, and in it they mention that, and I think within like the first pages, uh, that in programming language, they are for people and only incidentally for machines to execute.\nAnd so ultimately, the idea is that when you write\n\n\nSomething in code and use programming languages. It is for yourself to understand. It is for other people to be able to understand, and then, of course, it's also for a machine to actually run, but it should be somewhat readable. Now, of course, code golf kind of goes very much against this, but it shows the degree to which there is all different types of expressiveness and style within programming languages.\n\nYeah, and that's why I was like, ah, a person who spent more of my life managing the development of software than actually doing it. The one thing you don't want your people to do is write these, you know, obscurely elegant one-line bits of code that generates six levels deep of recursion and do the whole thing. And because, and actually, one of the first commercial things I ever wrote had all those bad habits in it, right? And I actually had to hire two people to actually like chipping away at a block of marble to try to make sense of this horrific thing I did. And it was an object lesson. Never, never do that, right? And there are certain languages that try to lead you away from that kind of thing more easily than others. I mean, people have talked about how, and I think people have described Pearl as a write-only language where it's very hard to understand. And I, I, I definitely can remember at least one instance where I wrote something and then the next day didn't actually understand my own code. And so there are some languages that make that a little bit more possible than others. Other ones, through whitespace or certain kinds of things, try to force you to make things a little bit more readable. But yes, you definitely can bend these systems far beyond the way they might have been designed.\n\nYeah, there was one in particular. For many, many years, I taught myself one computer language a year, just past the hello world level. Sometimes I do, I'd sometimes do the error tones or some other little simple project. But the one I refused to ever look at was APL. That one I've never done. It's like a matrix language. It uses, does not use any, uh, very few letters. It's all weird symbols, Greek symbols, upside down letters, you know, it's like, what? Apparently, it, it's hugely expressive. You can do a lot of stuff in one line of code, but oh, yeah. I'm sure that one is perfect for a lot of this code golf, but it's, uh, yeah, it's one that I am willing to...\n\nYes, exactly. Because in cooperative programming, you know, the first thing to keep in mind is somebody else will have to maintain the code, right? And then typically in a bigger project, this is, you know, again, cubicle coding rather than individual coding, you know, different modules of the code have to talk to each other. So it's very useful for people to be able to look at each other's code and understand what they do. Code golf or, you know, the impenetrable Pearl. Now, I did take a Pearl at one point because I did a lot of text manipulation, and it was the best thing at that time, but I rigorously wrote my Pearl just like C. Okay. For the purpose of making it readable, which you could do, basically, right? Yeah. The one interesting thing about Pearl is the way it was designed. My sense is like it kind of gave you lots of different ways of writing it. And so, yeah, if you were comfortable writing in like C, yeah, you could do that. Uh, and so it was this very style agnostic language. But I think sometimes as a result, it caused a lot with Python as soon as I discovered Python basically. Yeah, I, I, I didn't, I used to, uh, sometimes say you could write anything that could be written in 300 words of 300 lines of Pearl. Uh, but don't ever do that. That sounds not unreasonable.\n\nYeah. Let's talk a little bit about programming languages and, you know, how they differed. Uh, and actually, I was preparing my notes this morning. I did a Google, I said, hm, as far as I know, all the major programming languages are based on English. The Google agreed with me. Couldn't, it came up, well, actually, I asked Perplexity. I never use Google anymore. I use Perplexity, people. I should be hitting them up for a sponsorship actually because, uh, I tout Perplexity all the time as far better than Google, which it is. But it gave a few weird examples. But as far as even Perplexity knew, almost all of our computer languages are based on English. Isn't that interesting? Perhaps it's not surprising, given that a lot of early computing was done in, in the English language or in kind of English-speaking countries. But you're right, that is interesting that there are not many other programming languages, or I mean, maybe, I mean, maybe APL. Yeah, there's a couple weird symbol ones, and there, there was one. It's called Brain [ __ ] I think it was that. Oh, that one's nuts. Yeah. Yeah, that one's crazy. I think it has like eight symbols and it can do everything. It's kind of this kind of warped like touring machine sort of thing, and yeah, it is turning complete. It can do all these interesting things, and it's completely unreadable and is very much true to its title. And there is this whole realm of eso lang or so lang, these kind of like esoteric languages where it's sort of like programming language as a like twisted work of art, and there are a lot of those, and they're very interesting because they give you a sense of the true space of programming languages. That being said, by and large, the vast majority of programming languages kind of fit into like a number of different categories where like most of them are sort of like the like imperative kind of C-like kind of languages. Um, and then you have some that are more functional like a like Lisp or something like that. But by and large, right, there is kind of this straightforward sorts of categories. And then as a result, often times if you learn one within those categories, it's actually not that hard to learn all the other ones in those categories as well. But you're right, there is, there, there is not non-English variety as far as I'm aware.\n\nTurns out that there was a German translation and a Chinese translation of Python. Those seem to be... Oh, wow. That's great. And, uh, they basically just translate the keyword. So that, that wasn't really a new language. There was a couple other weird little languages, but nothing much. It was kind of interesting. I like seeing those like the esoteric languages. It, it really gives you a sense of, oh wow, programming can be a lot weirder than I might have expected. Of course, the one line that is relatively significant, and I think it's growing on the functional side, is the line between imperative programming and functional programming. Functional programming goes way back to one of the first computer languages, which was indeed Lisp. Now we have things like Haskell and Erlang and F and all kinds of other things.\n\nYou want to take a shot at try to describe the difference between imperative programming and, uh, functional programming? Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I will do my best. And so imperative, really the way to describe that is it's a series of instructions that are kind of executed one at a time, and they kind of operate on variables and and information, and there might be loops and things like that. While functional languages are based on taking functions that operate on other functions. You would have a list of numbers or or code or objects or whatever or or variables, and then you would have a function that would operate upon that list, and then you could make another function that could operate upon that list. And so it was kind of these functions that then operate on other functions and lists, and so it's this kind of very nested sort of way of thinking, while imperative is much more like one step at a time. I think that would be, that would probably be a rough, likely not entirely accurate way of describing the distinctions, but I imagine, but it would be one where it's one is nested and one is like stepping through. Does that seem like it's not exactly wrong? Yeah, it's not. Yeah, I'm, I'm kind of missing some of the flavor of it. I mean, I would say the other interesting thing about a lot of functional language, and and the other thing is also, yes, as you mentioned before, some of the the barrier between these kinds of languages is breaking down. So, for example, you can do, you can do functional programming within Python, which might have more kind of traditionally imperative kind of features. Um, and actually I do a lot of that where you can use the word lambda to then kind of generate your own functions and then you take those and operate on a list or an array or or or do whatever you want. Um, and so there are ways of doing both of these. The one interesting thing about a lot of functional programming often involves recursion, this kind of like self-reference in a way that non-functional programming does not. And so I remember the first time I learned a more functional language after having learned kind of more traditionally imperative languages. It was just a wildly different way of thinking and kind of it almost like required me to like rewire my brain and kind of rethink how I thought programming could operate. It was frustrating in the beginning because I had no idea what I was doing, and then once it clicked, it was enormously eye-opening.\n\nYeah, I would say that's another powerful feature of of functional programming. Yeah. And then also typically, uh, functional programming things are immutable. That's the other key aspect. The interesting thing about recursion is I have long been saying, uh, that recursion is a good tool for smart people. But in fact, I made a a life career decision back in the mid-80s when there was this big Lisp explosion, one of the earlier AI summers before the AI winter came along. Symbolics and Lisp machines ain't, but some of my college buddies went to work there. They tried to get me to come work there. I came over and visited them over in Cambridge. I had my little company down the road over in Austin. I went and talked to them, and then they, you know, showed me all this stuff, and I called myself a list. But I said, \"Dude, you got a serious problem. You're trying to sell technology to the IT departments of major corporations. Uh, to be able to understand recursion requires an IQ of 130. Number of IQ130 and above and corporate IT departments, I can tell you from personal experience, is small. So your whole enterprise here is based on a false premise. Thanks, but no thanks.\" And I still warn people of that. If you have, you know, PhD computer science type people, uh, or maybe just a tad below that in capability, then yeah, encourage recursion. If you have normal IT people, absolutely forbid the use of recursion without permission of the VP of engineer.\n\nWell, and it's similar to, we were talking about like global variables before. Like there are some very powerful techniques, but we traditionally shy away from them because they have sometimes a little too much power. And I feel like recursion in a very different way is another one of these where it can be very, very useful. It can also completely destroy your memory if done properly. Um, not your human memory. Oh, it could do that too. But also the actual the actual memory of your machine can run away. I, I will allude to my network wars game actually. The world builder system I wrote was this horrendous spaghetti code of special cases and all that that I had a blinding insight that I could make it all go away with a very tight recursive function. And I had it all in my head for about the 15 minutes it took me to write it down, and it worked. And the thing's been in the marketplace for like six years and no bugs reported. It was there. But it was like one of these things where I probably reduced 500 lines of code to 30 lines of code.\n\nThat's amazing. Right. And and and those kind of experiences are Yeah. It's a very special moment when you Yeah. You have these like flashes of insight and realize you can kind of combine it and do it this a very different way and then Yeah. And then after those 15 minutes or whatever it is, you realize I, I don't fully understand what I did anymore. But it, it seems to have worked. But yeah, it worked. Never had any. I tested it extensively with a test framework I created that could test for valid worlds and never failed. I go, I don't, I don't know, you know. But I'm going to go back and look at that code. It scares me to even think about.\n\nAll right, let's move on to the next topic. Something has always been near and dear to many of our nerdly heads. I've never found many that were that good. And that is software for thinking. Software for thinking or tools for thought. I mean, this is something that I mean, people have wanted this kind of thing since quite early on in computing. People have thought about computers not just as tools for simulation or calculation, but as a way and means for helping you analyze information actually. And the truth is, one of the most kind of seminal thought experiments for this was actually before, like around the time of the beginning of the first, uh, digital computers, so it's this essay was in the Atlantic, I think, in 1945 by Venevver Bush, who was a developer, I think, of eventually the National Science Foundation, is called \"As We May Think,\" and in it, he describes this thought experiment, this, this machine called the Memex, which is this desk with, I think, projectors and microfilm, and it's this very interesting thing where he's basically describing a rudimentary worldwide web where you can kind of connect to lots of different information and step through it and and and trace the the way in which you do your research and think about these kinds of things. And this kind of thing was sort of this north star for many, many years, and then through the years people have tried to build software as a way of helping us think better. I mean, cuz the truth is, we are very limited beings. There are a lot of things we can do well, and thinking is one of them, but thinking also has an upper bound. There's a small number of things we can keep in our heads at the same time. If I want to go through all the things that I know or things that I'm thinking about on a topic, I can't just rifle through my mind the way I would like a file cabinet. I have to kind of just have free association. And that's going to be extremely imprecise, impractical, and non-sistatic. And if we could have tools to help us do kind of the act of thought better, then we should build these kinds of things. And and I think the people who have thought about computers as basically tools for thought, as like these machines for helping us improve our thinking, have really been kind of guiding this kind of thing. And so certainly I would say certainly spreadsheets have been one of these kinds of things. And so spreadsheets that allow us to imagine the world as it might have been, um, are certainly these kinds of tools for thought. But in many ways, a lot of the current excitement around AI and LLMs, it does do this kind of thing. And the way I kind of view this is if you want to be able to stitch together ideas or help with...\n\n\nBrainstorming, or whatever it is, you want to be able to have some sort of landscape of ideas or information.\nAnd that is where the world of LLM operates.\nIt operates in this latent space of ideas that are kind of all embedded in this high-dimensional space.\nAnd if you can navigate that, then that can actually ideally help with some of thought.\nAnd so, and people have pointed to the ways in which, and if you pour in scientific articles into these things, and maybe it draws connections between different papers.\nI think I point to one example of this, uh, paper where it was looking at research within material science, and there was something, some material that was discovered with a certain, that was found to have some specific property, and they showed that if you had poured in all the literature before that discovery and looked at how these papers were related and based on key terms and things like that, you could have actually had an AI-based discovery showing or at least hypothesizing that it would have had this property several years earlier than would be expected.\nAnd so I actually think with AI, you might be able to have some of these kind of AI tools for thought.\nThat being said, a lot of the tools for thought space is kind of colonized by better note-taking apps and things like that, which are not bad.\nI'm always a fan of kind of better note-taking apps, if only for the fact that people, that the more people transcribe and capture when it comes to information, the more raw material they'll have when they're going back and searching or creating new things.\nWhether or not they need the full features of all these is an entirely separate thing.\nBut uh, yeah, I I love thinking about these sorts of tools and and at least the need for these sorts of tools.\nYeah, it is interesting that I'm now using AI a lot for that purpose, where where you sort of half know something.\nWhat exactly is Hegelian dialectic?\nYou know, I know enough that A B equals C, but obviously there's a lot more to it than that.\nSo, I'm engaging this mailing list with a bunch of Hegelian philosophers.\nSo before I jump into that, I said deep research chatp03, uh, explain to a smart 15-year-old the Hegelian dialectic, and you know, you quote actual stuff from Hegel in reasonable to understand English, right?\nAnd oh my god, so they have a, you know, an AR-15 for arguing with the Gallian philosophers that uh, I would never have done on my own.\nBut on the other hand, you know, we, you know, you reference all these various personal organizing tools.\nI've tried so many of them over the years, and not a one has ever stuck, at least for me.\nHave you ever found one that worked for you?\nSo, I mean, to be honest, I don't use the most sophisticated ones.\nI I have like a fairly simple note-taking app, and you can, you can stitch together different notes and say, \"Okay, here this one is connected to this other one or or or have various citations to to one of the other notes.\nFor me, I think just the fact of capturing the things I want to write about, that's the most important thing.\"\nYeah.\nSo, I I I've never really used anything that sophisticated.\nI've tried.\nIn general, it's also the kind of thing where the best tool is really the one that you use regularly.\nUm, it really doesn't matter the the specific details of this.\nAnd I actually remember this.\nThis was, this is years ago when I when I first started writing my first book.\nI got the book deal and then I said, \"Oh, great.\nI'm now going to spend the next few weeks looking at all the best writing tools and figure this out.\"\nAnd my editor told me, he's like, \"Just use Scriber.\"\nHe's like, \"It's a lot of people use it.\nIt's good enough.\"\nAnd then you can kind of just move on with your life.\nAnd and I've still been using Scrivener, and it's a, it's a great tool.\nI'm sure there are many more sophisticated tools or specialized tools and things like that, but it's good enough, and it's the one that I feel comfortable with.\nAnd so, and I think that really is what it comes down to is you kind of just have to choose one and live with it, and that will work.\nThat being said, I think having a simple tool that maybe is able to engage with AI or you can kind of pour your notes into AI and then kind of look at them.\nI think that kind of thing can be very valuable.\nHaving those kinds of conversations with with AI around like trying to understand things or figure out the specific jargon and terms that you might not have.\nYou kind of have something on the tip of your tongue, you can't figure out exactly what it is.\nThat that kind of thing, it's really useful for.\nYeah.\nWhen it comes to note-taking, to be honest, I don't actually have that sophisticated uh taste myself.\nIt's funny.\nI've always thought, you know, like you, oh yeah, it's worth spending some time finding the perfect tool, and then I try one, totally gets in the way.\nI I go all the way back to Lotus Agenda, probably one nobody remembers.\nI was friends with Mitch Kapor, and that was actually his favorite piece of software, a Lotus Agenda.\nHe later spent millions trying to create an open-source version called Chandler, which never cohered, and it was even more sophisticated than than agenda, which it was quite sophisticated.\nBut I've tried Amberote, I've tried Notion, I've tried Obsidian, I've tried four or five different flavors of mind maps, and none of them have ever really done it for me.\nIt's funny, I still use Scriber, you know, for a writing project.\nScrier is at about the right level.\nNo, it's sophisticated.\nThere's a lot of things you can do in it, and it's it's also like open-ended enough, and kind of the downside, it's like 1997 technology, something like, but yeah, it's not the most, yeah, it's not that does not feel the newest, and trying to share files with other people is a pain in the ass.\nYeah, you kind of ask for nightmare.\nAnd the other one was, this is just a funny old tech gazing tech story was Semantic, now a huge company, right?\nBack in the day, it was three guys uh above a bank in central square in Cambridge, and their first product was something called Think Tank, which was an outlining tool written in assembler language for Windows, fast as [ __ ] for years.\nis whenever I started a new or a business plan for a new business, because I used always say I think of 100 business ideas, I actually work on 10, and I do one right.\nSo at the 10 stage, I'd build little outlines uh, and for years, even after you couldn't get DOS machines anymore, I always kept the DOS machine of old enough vintage to run my copy of Think Tank, because my fingers were.\nAnd I think George R. R. Martin, the novelist, I think he still has a DOS machine for Word, I think, oh my god, um, cuz he was he most comfortable with that.\nYeah.\nAnd and so it's really, it's whatever tool you're most comfortable with, like that's the one for you.\nAll right.\nLet's now step up from our own little petty uh keeping track of stuff to this very an area much closer to the work I do in the real world, which is numeric and world simulation.\nTell me about your uh adventures in learning about that.\nYeah.\nSo I mean, I, my own personal experience has probably been in the realm of of complexity science and complex systems.\nI kind of got into it initially in things probably related to biology, but then also in social systems and kind of network science, and there's the whole realm of agent-based modeling, kind of using agents that all interact.\nThis is basically all the whole idea like large systems with huge numbers of interacting parts.\nBut but more broadly, whether or not you're using differential equations or agent-based modeling or or or whatever tools you want to use, computers, they are able to do this really interesting thing, which is prior to kind of the modern digital computer, the ways in which you'd build a model is you'd either have a description of a system, so like a mathematical formula that was kind of just inert, but it kind of gave you some sense, or some sort of physical model that maybe could be dynamic, so like a like a an ory of a of a subset of the solar system.\nYou kind of crank it, and and the earth moves around the sun, and the moon moves around the earth, and you can kind of see all the relationships there and maybe look and see how how eclipses work.\nBut not until the digital computer did you really have this ability to create a description that actually was dynamic.\nAnd like that was at least in my mind one of the most interesting things about computing, that you could build these descriptions that really elucidate entire dynamic worlds as simulations.\nAnd and in truth, like the these are one of the first things that were done with modern computers, and this it wasn't like, oh, we had to wait until '70s, '80s, or '90s.\nNo, this is like almost immediately.\nThese were the kind of the first use cases, and since then, through a combination of better data as raw material, better computing power, and better algorithms, these these simulations have gotten more and more sophisticated, and we can we we can now model the weather in ways that we could not possibly have imagined decades ago.\nWe can model how how pedestrians move through stadiums and things like that or trying to understand the behavior of societies there.\nThere's all these different applications we have.\nBut at the same time, we still have to remember, and these are still models.\nThey are necessary simplifications.\nAnd so I think it's one of these kinds of questions is how do you kind of balance the sophistication of the model with the ways in which I things that are still kind of understandable to to the user?\nWhat is the goal of the model?\nIs the is the goal purely prediction?\nIs it understanding?\nBecause if it's understanding, then a simplified model is actually going to be much more useful.\nSo for example, in Sim City is not actual cities, but if if you just want to gain some sort of insight into the ways in which complex systems have unanticipated consequences and systems bite back and things like that, Sim City is great for that.\nIs it useful for parking in a city?\nNot really.\nI don't think there are actually any parking lots in the original Sim City.\nBut that kind of consideration of how we balance simulation and modeling and just the fact that it can do these things, I think is incredibly exciting.\nYeah.\nA lot of the work we do at the Santa Fe Institute involves agent-based modeling and large-scale simulations, things you write about in the book, A Life, that used to be a hot thing at Santa Fe.\nYeah.\nSo I have a whole chapter about A Life, one, cuz I just personally find it fascinating, but I also think it's this, in some ways, while it did have its heyday in the the 1990s, maybe like early 2000s, there's actually some interesting things still happening right now within A Life, and I've I've been following it carefully and have a number of friends who are kind of involved in this space, but also it's just an unbelievable example of one of the very fruitful ways of thinking about modeling and simulation, which is not necessarily trying to model the entire world in great detail or fidelity, but rather saying, \"Okay, I'm going to strip down a certain field down to its essence, down to its barebones, whether it's the features of life, the nature of evolution, and then slowly but surely build it up within within computation and see what are the features that matter, and then how do these how do these pieces interact and really try to get an understanding of, in this case, not just life as it is, but as they say, life as it could be.\"\nAnd I find that entire thing absolutely fascinating.\nYeah, I was totally addicted to A Life when I first retired from business, and I started playing with evolutionary computing first and then A Life and then agent-based modeling.\nAnd when I went out to Santa Fe Institute, I was so proud of my models with 47 parameters.\nAnd they'd slap my hands and say, \"Boy, can't do, you don't know [ __ ] about a model got 47.\nIf you get it down to three, we'll talk to you.\nIf you get it to two, it's better.\nIf you can find one parameter, best of all, you then take that to heart some degree.\nBut on the other hand, to model real systems, you do need a fair number of parameters.\nAnd A Life is fine because as you point out, you can do the simplest things like Sugarscape, which are very, very simple early agent-based modeling, you know, a landscape of sugar and mounds of sugar and things that go around and eat sugar and fight each other about sugar, and then you can have, you know, very elaborate aquariums in a computer that uh, you have very elaborate food webs and seduction and everything else.\nAlways like who's currently working in A Life.\nI truthfully haven't looked at A Life in probably 15 years.\nSo one person who um is doing a lot of work and kind of managing some organizations related to this is Olaf Witkowski.\nHe's based in Japan.\nUm, and actually I think a lot of some of the cutting-edge work in A Life right now is actually happening in Japan as well.\nInteresting.\nYeah, we do on the podcast a lot of origin of life work, which is different but related, right?\nThere's some bleedth through uh, and it's getting kind of a different purpose, but they also use uh, you know, essentially uh, biochemical simulations to think about what might be possible and proto cells and things of that sort.\nOh yeah.\nThere's definitely some overlap there in terms of yeah, trying to kind of really understand, yeah, where where life comes from, how life works, how it does its thing, and yeah, it's it's absolutely fascinating to see how people are thinking about these kinds of things.\nThat's good.\nOne last thing to exit, which is something that I say, don't ever tell anybody about this when they're tripping, and that is the simulation hypothesis.\nYeah.\nSo the simulation hypothesis, I mean, is essentially this idea that it asks whether or not everything, like us, humanity, the entire universe is all in a computer program.\nAnd and to be honest, as the as the question stands, it's it's a fun thought experiment.\nThere's not, yeah, there's no real way of answering it as it is.\nFor me, I find it very useful not as kind of the answer to everything, but more as a means of thinking about our relationship, like the relationship between physical reality and computation.\nAnd so, so whether or not you want to think about, okay, what would it mean to play at the edges of a computer program that you yourself are in, what would that mean?\nQuestions around what does it mean to to even ask the question about the laws of physics actually doing computation?\nAnd these are all kind of fun, weird questions.\nAnd the simulation hypothesis is able to allow you to to ask those questions in kind of a a fun sort of sideways way.\n\n\nAnd so for me, yeah, I'm basically agnostic as to the question. I think trying to answer it entirely feels like an exercise in futility. That being said, taking some aspects of it seriously is enormously fascinating, and it can lead you to think about buffer overflows and weird little exceptions and breaking out of computer games. And so it was a fun question to examine, but only in the sense that it leads me to think about the deeply physical nature of computers or other aspects of games or what have you.\n\nYeah, I'm with you. It's an interesting thought experiment. I remember we, uh, some of us were first talking about it as sophomores in college, you know, going, \"Huh, I wonder if our universe is a simulation in some kid's computer.\" Right? I feel like that is like the ideal time for talking about that question with a couple of doobies along the way, right? I've also come to the conclusion that it's an interesting thought experiment, but probably way above the pay grade of humanity anytime soon to know the answer to. And one of the nice things about learning about complexity science is to realize there are lots of questions we may never know the answer to and just be happy to live in the air in this kind of mess scale that we live in, which is its own interesting stack of emergencies. And what happens below, what happens above, we may never know. And who cares? There are plenty of fun things to operate in and the scale in which we can operate.\n\nThat is a great philosophy and approach. Yeah. And unfortunately, not that common one. Unfortunately, in your book, you mentioned in passing two billionaires that had supposedly funded research and looking for glitches in the matrix. Is that really true?\n\nThat is mentioned in a vague way in one New Yorker article. I think it was in the context of, I think it was profiling Sam Altman a number of years ago. And a number of people have kind of mentioned that as well. I do not know the details. I have no idea the veracity of that. Um, I assume it is at least somewhat there must have been some accuracy to it back when it was written due to the New Yorker's backing. I do not have the names of those billionaires or any details.\n\nYeah, that would be very interesting to learn more about that. Yeah, I suppose if I was, you know, a billionaire, I might put 5 million against looking for glitches in the matrix. Why not, right? Better than buying another yet another large yacht. My concern though is what happens if you do find those glitches and we get turned off. That could be a very negative outcome or you know as people who have hacked things like Second Life and things like that. Remember, you can find glitches in the Matrix and make infinite amounts of money cuz you figured out how to create money out of thin air and Peter Teal, that's probably his motivation.\n\nAnyway, well this has been a very fun conversation. I want to thank Samuel Arbesman for coming on and talking about his really quite nice book, The Magic of Code.\n\nYes. Thank you very much. This was a lot of fun. I had a wonderful time. It was a great conversation. Really good.\n\n[Music]\n\nAudio production and editing by Andrew Blevens Productions. Music by Tom Mueller at modernspacemusic.com.\n\n[Music]\n",
