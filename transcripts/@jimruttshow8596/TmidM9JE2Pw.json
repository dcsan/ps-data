We now have links to books and articles referenced in recent podcasts that are available on our website. We also offer full transcripts. Go to jimrutshow.com. That's jimrutshow.com.\n\nToday's guest is J. Doyne Farmer. Don is a complexity system scientist and entrepreneur with interests in chaos theory, complexity, and econopysics. He is professor of complex system science at Oxford University where he's also director of the complexity economics program at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. He's also an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. Welcome, Don. Nice to be here. Yeah, good to chat. Not only is Don a very distinguished complexity science, but he also has an entrepreneurial business background. He co-founded the Prediction Company, one of the first companies to do fully automated quantitative trading. Made a pile of money at that, I believe, and is today chief scientist at Macrocosm, Inc., a company aiming to scale up complexity economic methods and reducing them to practice. And one of my favorite Don stories is one of his earliest business enterprises was he and some friends built one of the first wearable computers, maybe the first wearable computer, computer in a shoe and they developed some associated theory to help them beat the roulette table in Las Vegas and managed to escape without any broken kneecaps. That's a hell of a good story. Actually, I remember first time I came out to Santa Fe Institute, I was reading your book about the whole deal. That was edimonia pie or some such thing, right? And uh it was like, whoa, this guy's definitely a dude.\n\nAnyway, today we're going to talk about Don's book. I think it came out last year called Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World. Let's start with defining some terms that you use in the book, which we'll probably be referring to lots of times. The first is chaos. It's a core idea in the book. You used it 139 times. One of the fun things I do is try to pull out some of the key terms and then see how many times they're used. So, let's start and talk about this very important idea. And it's one that's kind of interesting. I did not ever get exposed to it in my education. Probably because my education happened before you guys formalized it. And I didn't really get exposed to the idea till like till about 1999. And I must say it's one of the most important things I've added to my intellectual toolkit as I've grown. So for the audience, if you could describe what we mean when we're talking about deterministic chaos. So deterministic chaos is when a dynamical system, one of the rules that we use to predict the future like Newton's laws, when the dynamics are such that nearby points diverge exponentially away from each other. And this happens because in a sense the action of the system is to tangle everything up. It's like it folds it over and over again. And so you can make a measurement and one time, you know, at some future time get one answer and at a different time you get a different answer because of tiny variations in what the measurement actually is. And and the other thing about chaos that's very important in the book is that it generates what we call endogenous motion. Motion from within the system. So even though the equations may not say anything explicitly about it, the solutions move and they move by themselves and a significant amount. The great example of chaos being weather where as we all know it can be difficult to predict and and it's always changing and it changes endogenously. There's nobody up in the skies or telling it what to do other than seasonality and a few other things. Yeah. And of course, the original discoverer, at least the one that's given credit for, Lorentz, and his very simple system of equations, which generated a pattern with what are called strange attractors, which don't always turn up in in chaotic systems. But maybe you can talk a little bit about attractors. Well, an attractor is, as its name implies, something that everything gets attracted to. Where does stuff end up in the long run. And so the simplest kind of attractor is just a fix point. Something moves and it comes to rest. And if you knock it, it will go back to that same rest point. So that would be a fixed point attractor. Next most complicated kind of attractor is called a limit cycle. meaning that there's a periodic oscillation like a grandfather clock. You set it in motion and it just makes the same periodic motion again and again and again. So as long as you keep the clock wound, it's always going to go to that same motion. And then chaotic attractors are more interesting because chaotic attractors go all over the place in ways that are difficult to understand and predict and are not periodic. There are regular and many things in the world like I argue business cycles can be described by chaotic attractors or strange attractors those are synonyms really and as I said once I got that concept my whole view of reality actually changed and I started to realize that almost everything that's actually interesting about the world has at least an aspect of strange attractor to it and I found that to be an amazingly powerful lens and I'd contrast that with I would call what most of us 14-year-old nerds adopted which is naive Newtonism right that uh you could take Newton's equations of motion which any good nerd knew by the time they were 14 and apply it forever. Leplace famously said if an intellect knew the positions velocities of all particles in the universe it could predict the future with certainty right well in theory that is correct when you add in deterministic chaos even with no stochasticity at the base level, let's assume a totally deterministic universe, you're still you still can't actually do the calculation practically. And that is it's a subtle idea, but it's hugely important. I want the audience to really focus in on how central this is to the complexity lens of understanding reality that we often talk about on the show.\n\nYeah, maybe just to add an aside remark, I just finished writing up some stuff for the program of a museum exhibit on time in Barcelona that will run starting next year. And one of the main points I make, starting with the quote you just made by Lelass, is that chaos actually makes time possible. Lelass is saying if we could predict everything, we could predict the future. We could see into the past, the present would be just like the past and the future just like the present. And the reason we can't do that is because of chaos. So in a sense, chaos makes time possible. I have to read that. It's interesting. I've been uh talking to people about theories of time recently, including uh Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker. It is that interesting conversation. Might have you back. We'll talk about your theory of time. Sure. No. And I also wrote an essay on the era of time that I'll send I'll send you. Yeah, do that. That'd be good. That's a topic I'm very interested in. Very timely. All right, let's go on to our next topic, which is bounded rationality. Uh, which appeared 62 times in the book, uh, which is pretty high for a biogram. Another hugely important concept and one that turns the economics that we were taught in school more or less on its head, which we'll get to later. So, don't do that. But just say, what do you mean by bounded rationality? Maybe give a little history of the idea. Yeah. No, it's a very simple idea which is that we're not infinitely smart. And so since we're not infinitely smart, there's a lot of things we can't calculate or can't easily understand and certainly can't predict. And so the argument is that an economic theory needs to take that into account. And the first person to really push this idea was Herb Simon who uh came out with it back in the 60s and talked about rather he felt that rather than couching economic theories in terms of optimality, we should couch them in terms of satisfiability. We come up with ways to do things that are good enough and or as good as we can do. And so bounded rationality though it's an interesting if we're playing tic-tac-toe boundedly rationally. I mean as a 10-year-old I figured out that there was a a strategy O could play and still always get a draw. So actually I was being rational as a child when I figured that out because I understood the game well enough to see through it and come up with an optimal strategy. So if you could do that, that's what economists mean by rationality. But if you can't do that, it's bounded rationality. And when I give talks, I sometimes show a picture of Bobby Fiser and rationality. And then later on, I say, well, actually, when he's playing chess, Bobby Fischer is not rational. He he's a good chess player, maybe a little more rational, certainly more rational than I am in that respect, but he's not he's not fully rational because he can't calculate the optimal solution. So it just means you're stupid enough that you can't do the task that you're given at hand perfectly and so you use some other ways of getting reasonable answers. And of course that is the reality of essentially everything we do. Right? If we had to figure out how to move our our legs while we climb the stairs, we'd fall on our face every time, right? We have a whole series of hierarchical heruristics that essentially allow us to do that almost all the time. But every once in a while we do fall on our face because we aren't actually doing it by a calculation. And again, another hugely important lens that our educational system has done a disservice in some ways by not making clear to people making again this is very closely related to to this naive Newtonism that we can figure everything out. Well, one you can't in principle because of deterministic well in principle practically can't because deterministic chaos and then practically you can't do it because we're too stupid, right? And uh that explains an awful lot particularly of our contemporary politics. Let's go on to the third one which is equilibrium. And we mean in that sense in the economic sense which appeared 123 times in the book. So again the uh uh central idea. Well equilibrium's a slippery one to pin down because economists mean different things by that term in different places. But I would say there's two basic meanings. One is just supply equals demand, which allows you to write down an equation that often is essential for getting the solution. But the other is relating back to what I said a moment ago. It's a strategic notion of equilibrium. If we're playing a game like tic-tac-toe, have we really thought it through? Do we really understand it well enough to to play it like a rational player would? So equilibrium in that sense means that we both settled on strategies that we aren't going to change. We found the best possible strategies given the situation and we've settled in to a fixed point to use the attractor nomenclature that I said before because everything's settled down. It's not moving anymore. We've settled into that fixed point attractor in the strategy space. And so often times economists really mean that when they say talk about equilibrium and uh closely related to the concept of Nash equilibrium. No Nash equilibrium is when you've found a solution that you cannot find a better solution as as long as your opponent or opponents don't change their strategies. There is no better solution than the one you're playing. And uh and I would also add to to bind our three uh defined terms together, chaos, bounded rationality, and equilibrium that deterministic chaos plus bounded rationality make it seem damn unlikely that you'd actually get equilibrium from actual humans playing the game of economics. I talk about a paper we did in I had a series I think five papers and talk about them in I think chapter seven, but I could be misremembering the chapter numbers. We actually have really kind of boiled that down. We took a class of games called normal form games. That's a pretty big class. And we actually were able to show that boundedly rational players will give rise to chaotic behavior in the strategy space if the game is both competitive and complicated. And where competitive means that if I win, you lose. And or some version of that. If I win, you tend to lose. And complicated means just that there's a lot of possible moves in the game. And so the strategies can be very potentially complicated. And and so we've studied that shitload and shown that chaos is the norm when that occurs. Which means if you're talking about something like the stock market or or you know competing firms in in the world or most of economics, we shouldn't expect that we're going to find good equilibrium solutions. Yeah, that uh again when I started to learn about this stuff in the late 90s and then when I came out to SFI hugely powerful learning right that this is really the right way to think about social systems in general that they are you can't the other kind of leelas on one side Harry Seldon on the other from the Azimoff foundation theories that there's some kind again every 14-year-old nerd who read Foundation says oh yeah psycho history we can figure out history even at the at a higher green level than lelass but nope sorry people it's computational incompressibility the only way we can find out what happens in the real world is to watch it happen though we can make predictions to a degree which we'll talk about later now let's talk about your perception of the need for a new lens in economics uh what are some examples of failures of the traditional approach to economics yeah well one of the classic examples was the crisis of 2008 where everybody was way overleveraged and mortgage back securities were all over the world and economists were in denial about the possibility of a housing crash. A few people got that one right, Bob Schiller. But what nobody really got right was that the consequences for the global economy were going to be enormous. And the reason they were enormous was because banks throughout the world held mortgage back securities which turned into garbage. And so suddenly everybody's balance sheet was hit which meant banks stopped lending money which meant the whole economy crown to a halt. I open with an anecdote about somebody who was highly high up at the New York Fed saying in 2006 saying ran the furbus the best model that the Fed has and they asked it what happens if the housing market crashes and it came back and said oh not much a little blip and they were off by a factor 20 with a so they were doing their job you know they perceptively realized we were in a danger dangerous point but when they asked the model they had it came back and gave them completely the wrong answer. Yeah, that was quite astounding actually and there was al so many moving parts that they didn't get right. I my one of\n\n\nMy own pet theories is that in reality, the size of the economic loss to the banks was manageable, right over a long period of time. It was, you know, under a bill, under a trillion dollars if you scaled it up after inflation, not much bigger than the SNL crisis, actually, maybe 2x something like that. But there were other parts of the system, and my own favorite is that the rehypothecation of collateral had produced a pseudo liquidity of huge scale in the banking system, somewhere between 6 and 10 trillion dollars, where treasury bills and other high-quality securities could be lent out by the people who had them to produce. It's complicated. You'd read about it. But uh, anyway, after the initial Lehman event, the uh pseudo liquidity from 6 to 10 trillion dollars of rehypothecation of securities overnight and up to 30 days imploded, disappeared within two weeks. And so there was a giant shock wave that came from the inner dynamics of the system, which my guess at least is what turned into a medium-size economic mistake until a major financial crisis. Does that make any sense to you?\n\nYeah, totally. Very interesting, too. I mean, I was part of the group that worked to form what now became the Office of Financial Research, whose original intent was to keep track of what's going on in the economy. So, we understand stuff like that. Unfortunately, the original vision was never acted on. So, we still don't have that, but we could, we could have a tool.\n\nYeah. It's funny, I was actually proposed as director of that office and and that was turned down because I didn't have a PhD in economics, and I laid out a plan of how to build the data and how to tax the institutions that created the data to get the data and how to do some of the things like you're talking about later in the book. And uh, and apparently also I scared them because they knew I was not a very tractable person. I thought that would have been funny. But I, I had an inside advocate there, which was kind of fun. But anyway, another, another story for another day.\n\nOkay. Now, let's uh talk a little bit about standard economic theory so we can contrast it with your vision. Then we give the audience the three-minute version of econ 101 and 102. Well, so this is standard for how theories work. So theories and economics were all built on the same template. You assign all the agents, anybody who's making a decision, you give them a utility function, and then you give them a model of the world. Rational expectations is the most common one, but it doesn't need to be that. It could be some more cloudy lens. And and then you assume equilibrium. Supply equals demand. You write those equations down. You solve them, and you deduce the optimal decisions that each agent should make in order to maximize their utility, subject to the fact that they know that all the other agents are doing the same thing. So very powerful, very hard to do, and hence models are kept pretty simple. I took some economics, but I actually took macro from Samuel Sin himself in a class of 15 students, a little seminar. You know, my take was this sounds like fairly obscure actually. Uh, and decided not to pursue a career in economics based on that course. And one of the things I, I would now say looking back is the sociology of economics is very bound up in closed form solutions, i.e., mathematical equations, systems of differential equations, etc., that can in theory be solved or at least with uh, you know, Wolfram Mathematica or something, and yet that's probably a peculiar lens to restrict the exploration of a complex system like our economy. Maybe talk about that a little bit and then transition to the complexity view.\n\nYeah. Well, I totally agree with what you just said. It's uh losing track of the real purpose of what you're doing. My view is if I'm given a problem, I go, what tool should I use to solve this problem? And I look around and try and find the best tool, whatever it is. And the problem is most, many problems at least, if not most in economics, are complicated, and the formalism I just said, just you can't get the solution. If you can find it, it would take a computer, you know, in infinite time. And so you have to do something more practical, which is what we're focusing on, namely to simulate the economy.\n\nYeah. I liked uh, I think you used it in the book, a description of comparing as if versus as is. Maybe you could expand on that a little bit.\n\nSure. Economists frequently justify what they're doing. They recognize that real people don't say, \"Oh, this is my utility function. Ah, I'm going to do a calculation to see what I should do that would maximize the utility. Okay, it's this. I'll do that.\" People don't really do that. And so, but economists will argue, well, it's as if people did it because if you could get the right answer, that's all you need. And the problem is it's hard to tell generally in economics whether you're getting the right answers. And the data is always very limited for testing things. And in any case, I'm much more comfortable with an answer that matches the way things really work, which I call the principle of verisimilitude. You want your model to reflect the things in the real world that you care about in a way that makes sense and reflects how the real world works. So I call that as is rather than as if.\n\nYeah, I like that. Quite a powerful way of thinking about it, you know, and it, you know, it allows us to examine behaviors that we know exist in the economic world. Like for instance, why do 50% of people who have credit cards maintain balances near their limit and pay 22% to some thieving bank company? Very few of the standard economic theories would explain that behavior. But when you bring in some behavioral lenses and uh, and particularly very bounded rationality, then it starts to make sense, and and the fact that we know that to be an empirical fact, why wouldn't we build that into our models of reality?\n\nYeah. Well, it's hard to write down an equation that describes that.\n\nYeah. And again, that's the sociology of economics. And I think, I think you actually quoted the old story, which is I use all the time for various scientific failures, the guy looking for his keys and he's uh under the street light and someone comes by. What are you doing? Looking for your keys. And did you lose them there? No, I lost them over there, but the light's better here. Right. So, the idea that you, you become so in love with your methodology rather than trying to get to the truth. I heard that story originally in the context of nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear behavior from Stan Ulam, who was saying we spent, we collectively have spent our entire scientific careers up until the advent of the computer looking under the lamp post, and now finally the computer frees us to go look where we want to look. Which then gets us to some of the principles of your complexity economics. You uh mentioned one, verisimilitude.\n\nVerisimilitude.\n\nI had to look up how to pronounce that. I'm not sure I've ever said that word before. Well, I knew what it meant, but I don't, that's one of, you've seen it in a book, but you don't exactly use it too often. Right. Two of the other ideas, uh, core principles from complexity economics that seem to pop out of the book. First and foremost, heterogeneity and dynamics. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit.\n\nHeterogeneity uh is something I often point out when we talk about social systems. Some people want to collapse everything to, you know, pingpong balls or the, you know, the famous stereotype of a physicist. Let's model a cow. Let's assume it's a sphere. Right? So talk about heterogeneity and dynamics, then we'll go on to the next piece. I mean, heterogeneity is just the fact that we're all different, and people live in different houses. They make different incomes. They have different ages, and that means it's very dangerous to do what economists often do, which is to reduce things to what they call representative agents. Some of the most famous, most of the models that were actually used in economics reduce the entire, all the households of the world, all eight billion of them, down to one household. Sometimes that can work if everything's linear, but when things are nonlinear, that's dramatically different. And they give some examples in the book. So now it's true that economists are working very hard to tackle heterogeneity, but they haven't been very successful, and it really ties up this formalism into knots because it's just too intractable to put it in there. They have some solutions, but their hands are really tied ultimately, whereas with what we do, we just simulate the world. We simulate as many individuals as we need to simulate. They can be arbitrarily different. Now let's get to the third part of complexity economics, which is the core tool of agent-based modeling. So agent-based model is just a simulation, a digital twin, making a replica of something inside the computer and trying to render it as faithfully as you need to to understand the system you're trying to understand. So if it's the economy and you're trying to build a model of the whole economy, you put in a software object called a household that has individuals inside it, and they have ages. You can list their ages, and you know, you know something about, you ideally want to have that module understand their consumption behavior and their savings behavior and what availability they have to work in what kind of jobs. And so that would be your housing sector. You have a firm sector. We have firms that make goods. And uh, that need workers, that need capital. You have banks that lend out the capital that could fail. You have the government that's setting short-term interest rates. So you have, or central bank, I should say, the government setting fiscal policy, how much you're going to spend. And so you, you just make a digital twin that has all the basic elements in it, and you endow them with as much verisimilitude as you need in order to get a good model. And of course, the heterogeneity, right? There's no reason that they're all the same, right? Though they can be in some cases. Sometimes this very simple, stupid model, as we learned way back yonder, zero intelligence model can actually show some interesting results. But you basically layer them in. Now on the flip side, there are some critiques of agent-based models with respect to uh, I remember when I showed up to Santa Fe Institute as a naive uh, baby researcher and showed somebody my wonderful social simulation with 47 parameters. You know, they slap me on the hand and say, \"Boy, 47 parameters, you can produce any result you want. See if you can cook that down to three. Two would be better. One would be best.\" What about this critique that agent-based modeling is kind of like uh, startup business spreadsheeting, that you can get any answer that you want by tweaking a zillion parameters and adding new parameters when necessary?\n\nWell, there's a, that's a danger that needs to be taken seriously. It's a valid criticism of much of the work that's been done. But agent-based modeling is going through a transition right now, at least in economics, actually in other fields as well, to becoming a more quantitative science or a tool that you can use for quantitative purposes, which means that you have to have data sets that tell you how the world works, that you can match your model up to, and most importantly, you have to have a way of testing the model to see whether it's producing reliable predictions. So that's something we've worked on quite hard over the last decade. We have better algorithms for setting parameters of agent-based models from data. We have ways of understanding, well, okay, you have 40 parameters in a model, but what's really going on? It turns out that usually there's only about three independent directions in the parameter space that control 99% of what happens. So if you understand those three directions, then you're in good shape. So we built, we've sort of come up with ways of constructing models that that have verisimilitude and in an and have it in a quantitative way where we can really, I mean, my rule of thumb is test everything in sight. Anything you can measure and match your model up to, test it and see whether it's right so that you can look down inside the model ideally, and if it's not doing the right thing, see what's wrong and make it do that part better. It's a big enterprise to build a large-scale quantitative model, not something you're going to do in your spare time in your kitchen, but it can be, it's quite doable, just requires a lot of work and good judgment.\n\nIt's been a while since I've dipped into the literature of agent-based models. Uh, have to refresh my knowledge on these uh, newer theories and how to build really quantifiably verified models and probably something like machine learning approaches where you can use large data sets in a intelligent unsupervised fashion. I suspect uh, would be relevant also.\n\nVery relevant. These days I usually don't start designing a model until I understand the data that I'm going to use the model with.\n\nYeah. One of the big insights of recent movement in towards a more data-based approach to science, which some people disagree with, right, say, oh, we, we can't forget about theory. Theory is also important, but we've probably been overindexed on theory in some domains, particularly social science, where theory is just some stuff some dudes made up. Mostly, all right, well, now let's move on to what new perspectives does complexity economics give us, and I think let's start with what is the actual nature feature of complexity. What is it about complexity that you know, you, I, lots of other people find so interesting? What is the core driver of it?\n\nYeah. So I opt for a definition that really is not a full definition, which is that complex systems exhibit emergent phenomena. So okay, what's an emergent phenomena? An emergent phenomena is something that you couldn't have easily anticipated, no matter how smart you are. So chaos is a nice example of a simple emergent phenomenon. You show me some equations. General, even the best mathematicians can't just tell you whether it's going to be chaotic or not. To find out, you really have to simulate it and see what it does. Even if those equations are very, very simple to write down, that that's in a way when complexity becomes most dramatic. When you see something that's simple generate very complex behavior, the classic example of a complex system I like to quote is a, is a human brain. You take 85 billion neurons, wire them up in some complicated way, and how would you have predicted you would be able to get that if all you were doing was looking at a single neuron? And from the understanding of a single neuron, it would be hard to predict that you could get a person. And the economy is a maybe a simpler public system to understand, but it's very much has an, has emergent phenomena. I do a estimate in the book, and I think I calculate that if we didn't have the economy, the world would have to be, we'd have\n\n\nTo have about a factor of 100,000 less people, because if we were all just Robinson Crusos out there operating independently of everybody else, plowing our fields and shooting animals or whatever we were doing, we probably wouldn't be shooting because how would we manufacture guns? The capacity to support human beings on Earth would be way, way smaller, and that's because the economy is a remarkable amplifier of our effort. I find it shocking as I thought about this more, how just specializing and sharing ideas and commerce, what a powerful thing that is. What a huge amplification it gives us. I had that a similar insight when my daughter bought her first car. I helped her negotiate the deals. I love to negotiate car deals. One of those perverse people that actually likes to screw with car salesman. Her first car was about $25,000. It was a Nissan Juke. And as I step back a bit, it's amazing. $25,000, which was about six months salary for a starting graphic artist. Six months. Six months of a person fresh out of college. How long would an artisan take to build a car? And it had automatic transmission, AWD, air conditioning. And I looked at it, looked at it, I said, you know, a skilled artisan with a metal shop and a forge in six months might be able to make the driver's seat if he was good and knew other things like how to stretch hides and how to sew and all this stuff. And I go, damn, this thing has a motor and transmission and tires and complicated electronics, and it didn't yet have a computer screen and stuff. But how in the world did our work get so optimized that things from all over the world could come together to be able to produce this artifact that could be paid for in six months worth of work by a entry-level person? Quite remarkable. And you know, Adam Smith hits on this with his, uh, some of his early examples of the pin factory, for instance, right, uh, which is kind of, kind of interesting.\n\nAll right, so let's move on a little deeper into complexity, and that is the distinction between endogenous and exogenous change and how that relates to the economy. So endogenous change is when it comes from within. So the 2008 crisis was a good example. It wasn't, didn't happen because a comet hit the earth or something like that. The opposite would be the COVID recession, which happened due to a disease that's exogenous in the sense that no economist would have been able to foresee that was going to happen outside of that domain. And both are important for the economy, but mainstream economics is really set up to deal with exogenous changes and not set up to deal with endogenous changes. Yeah, indeed. Uh, a lot of traditional economics oddly assumes that everything is exogenous because otherwise you'd have equilibrium, right? When I was a young entrepreneur, I would sometimes say, \"Wait a minute. Now, if the economists are correct, why would anybody be an entrepreneur?\" Because nothing ever changes, right? And yet, we know it does. So, go ahead and be an entrepreneur. All right. One final, uh, sort of basic building block is one of the things that differentiates the economy and other social sciences from, say, the physics of chaotic systems and complex systems is the agentic nature of the players. Talk about that a little bit. Well, people make decisions. We think, and one of the biggest debates we already touched on with bounded rationality is how do we model thinking? Classic economics way to model thinking is assume everybody's perfectly rational. And problem is that's too powerful a model and too hard to solve. So then you're back to understanding how do you put thinking into the agents that you have in your simulation and your model. And that's maybe the most challenging problem of all other than finding data. Yeah. Fortunately, we now have some actual help from the behavioral economics folks. Yeah. And you know, one of the things you find is, well, first of all, people make a lot of decisions using heuristics, rules of thumb. Imitate the best. You know, look around, see who's doing it. Oh, they seem to be good at it. I'm just going to mimic what they're doing. Or trial and error. Try something. If it works, keep doing it. If it doesn't work, try something else. If you're a financial investor, buy undervalued assets. I mean, in a model that, that's a heuristic that works great for many purposes. You don't need to know exactly what they're doing in most cases to get good ideas about how agents are behaving in financial markets because there's always a substantial body of agents following that rule. You know, you also make strategic decisions trying to think ahead. If you're playing chess, for example, you start with some heuristics like control the middle. You want to swap a queen for a rook if you can or vice versa. I mean, you, you want to get the queen. You rather kill if you can kill somebody's queen with your rook and they kill your rook. That's a great trade. So, so you have heuristics, but at the same time, you're trying to look ahead, but you can only look ahead a few moves. So, you have bounded rationality. Very often it's easy to put these things into models where you use just that kind of logic. Yep. That and, uh, adds a whole another level to the problem essentially, right? As opposed to particles bouncing off each other, which can also produce complex adapted systems. It's a different class of system. All right. Well, now let's go on. Why does this matter? You have actually quite interesting, uh, section in the book on understanding the metabolism of a civilization. And then maybe just pop up one higher level on, you know, why is this important? What is it that the economy is actually do for us? As a complex system scientist, we're always fascinated by analogies that you see, and if you make analogy to a living system. The economy is the part of society that, you know, makes our food. It produces stuff that allows things to run. It takes, and I think more to state a more concise definition, it combines natural resources with human labor to make goods and services that we need or at least think we need or at least want. Whereas, if you look at what is a metabolism, metabolism is the thing that breaks down food and produces energy and allows a organism to reproduce. Metabolism takes in raw material in the form of food of some kind, breaks it down and reformulates it to power the organism. So it's very, very analogous function, basically has resulted in this amazing stack of things that we have out here. Some of them useful, some of them not so useful. You know, that's the problem of the endogenous, uh, system that optimizes for short-term money-money return. It doesn't necessarily maximize for real human well-being. Yeah, we get that the conversation another day. So now let's take the next step. We have this metabolism, which is essentially the engine that has created the 100,000x intensification of humanity. How does agent-based modeling help us understand this? Well, it helps us understand it because, um, it allows us to create a replica and make use it to make predictions or use it to analyze policies or strategies and see where they lead us. I mean, a good example, I start the book off with describing the work we did to build an economic model of the impact of COVID on the United Kingdom, and we were able to lay out several different scenarios for how the government could come out of the first lockdown and analyze their economic consequences and find a least bad, uh, policy, which was for them to keep upstream industries open like mining, forestry, etc., but close the downstream customer-facing industries where the infections are really happening most, but where you can actually get by pretty well without crippling the whole economy. And so maybe that's sort of, uh, intuitively obvious, but and maybe that's part of why we tested it, but we could test it and say, look, this is what the economic impact will be if you do that. If you do these other strategies, you'll have these other impacts. Well, they took the choice. We, we favored, and and we were, as you can imagine, tickled as we could be when a year later when the government finally gathered the statistics, it turns out we hit everything bang on the head. And as we did postmort postmortem on our model, we could see that we actually we were a little bit lucky in places, but mostly we did it, we got a good answer because our model had a lot of verilitude. It really did mimic the way the economy was shutting down. And we had things in there like realistic production functions that actually gave the correct formula for what a given industry absolutely needs to keep operating, and so we were able to show that was essential to getting a good result. We talked earlier about the fact that the nature of the complex is emergence. Can you do you have some good examples of emergent phenomena that have come out of your, uh, agent-based models? Yeah, I do. I talk in the in the finance part of the book about a model we made for leverage cycles.\n\nAnd how did we get that model? Well, we were building a model of the economy, sort of a generic model where we were very focused on the financial system in this model. So we had lots of banks and, you know, we had firms and households, but but we initially didn't impose any risk control on the banks. So we said, well, obviously we need risk control, and so we impose the Basel 2 method of risk control, which is called value at risk. So you try and anticipate how much risk you have and adjust your leverage, that is, how much you're borrowing to be appropriate. If things are more volatile in the future, more uncertain, you use less leverage. Things are fairly certain, you can use more leverage. So, it's a strategy that makes plenty of sense to an individual. But anyway, what we did, we we imposed it and we saw the whole economy just started oscillating. You know, there would be a 15-year slow runup like the Great Moderation and then a big crash and then it would happen again. And so we took the model apart, simplified it down to the absolute bare bones to see what was causing this. And we discovered that it was really built into that situation. Because when large numbers of people use the Basel rule, value at risk to manage their risk, then the problem is that they can make matters worse because if you're leveraged and your bank asks you if if there's a downward price movement for whatever reason, then your leverage goes up. So now you're over your leverage threshold. So the bank that lend you the money says, \"No, you need to pay some of that money back because we've got to hold you at your leverage threshold.\" So how do you do that? You sell assets. And if it's triggered by the market falling and now people start to sell assets to get their leverage back in balance, then they make even bigger price moves and you can set off a cascade and cause a whole economy to come down. So that's what was happening in our model, and it just took about a 15-year buildup to reach the point where the economy got so highly leveraged that it went to that place. That was an example of an emergent phenomenon. It certainly surprised us when we saw it, and, um, I think it surprised everybody in 2008 when we experienced it. Absolutely. And, uh, one of the things that people describe 2008 as the mother of all correlations, right? Even my, uh, part of my portfolio that I designed to be bulletproof took a small hit in 2008 because the correlations that were so unexpected by traditional statistical measures occurred and make you make a very good point that some of the policy prescriptions may well have been forcing these correlations, right? Behaviors that otherwise would have been more heterogeneous. We're all forced into a single behavior. Everybody trying to go through the same door. And we know what happens in a, uh, uh, in a, you know, in a live market when everybody's trying to sell. Boom. Down it goes. Yeah. A little aside here. I didn't really intend to cover this, but we'll talk about it anyway. Uh, which is the flash crash of, uh, 1987, I believe it was. Uh, you do talk about that a little bit as another example. I mentioned it, you know, my colleague Jean Flee Bushau has been studying this extensively, and it turns out there's flash crashes going on all the time that just happened to be a particularly big one, and the origin of those flash crashes is not completely clear. He's been working on a theory for them. We contributed some something to that, the what this theory is about in the work I did at the Santa Fe Institute when you were around Jim. Basically, you have a combination of a lack of liquidity and feedback mechanism that causes things to temporarily spiral out of control, and that's inherent to market making. Those a combination of simple things like that, it seems, can just cause an instability to pop up. But we're still trying to properly understand that. Yeah, I saw that in my own stuff when I was working with your group where I built this little simple ecosystem of noise traders plus bookshaped traders, market makers and trend followers. Uh, you would see that you'd see this then boom, boom for no good reason. It's the endogenous interaction of strategies. Uh, and again, another interesting example of emergent, uh, emergent results. So now let's kick up one level higher, and that is the thinking that you laid out in the book about the nature of business cycles. First, maybe define for the audience what a business cycle is and why they're important and what your, uh, what your emerging insights are on business cycles with respect to complexity economics. So business cycles are just reflect the fact that the economy is changing all the time. GDP goes up, GDP goes down. We see fluctuations. We have recessions. We recover from the recessions. So any of the lines you would draw are all wiggly, and they're wiggly. The question is why? And in traditional models, the assumption is there's noise from things like us becoming more impatient or less impatient as a group and various external causes that get amplified and turn into business cycles. Whereas many of us, including many traditional economists, think many business cycles are endogenous. The 2008 crisis certainly seems endogenous. And yet, so we need a way to model it, and hence chaos, which is a conceptual mechanism that generates business cycles. We also have extensively studied examples of this in game theory. And one of our main motivations for building a accurate agent-based model of the whole economy is to understand the drivers of business cycles. Big problem, surprising that it's still not answered in economics. It's one of the big questions that's sitting there for for macroeconomist, probably certainly one of the top five questions in macroeconomics, and we don't know the answer. I remember when I was a student, one of the theories that was put forth was due to imperfect information flows in the hard economy, inventories would tend to build up and, uh, and that they were a significant thought to be back in the 70s when\n\n\nI was a lad who thought to be a major driver of business cycles. But then with better information systems and better logistics systems and the computerization of everything, companies got way better at controlling their inventories. And that may have had something to do with the great moderation, but business cycles, as we discovered, did not disappear. So there's many other things going on. And, but I argue in the book that the key element is that we're boundedly rational. So we can't look ahead and see what everything implies. Uh, I was once giving a talk at the OECD in Paris, and there was a discussant who was from the Bank of International Settlements, people that bring us the Basel rules. And we presented the model that I just mentioned a bit ago about leverage cycles. And he said, \"Well, but a rational investor would see that these were going to occur and behave in a way to keep them from happening.\" And I said, \"Yes, but where were those rational investors when this happened? I viewed that as a strength of the model rather than a flaw of the model. Uh, I think many economists are coming to concede this point. Now let me just go back to the bigger point. The bigger point is that if we collectively can't accurately see the future, we're going to overshoot and undershoot, and our expectations go backwards and forwards, and we're collectively hurting, and all kinds of things are happening that are going to make the economy oscillate around the right answer. Gotcha. And that's what we actually see. It's, you know, amazing that, uh, you know, the economists, you know, well, here's this elephant in the room, this happens, right? And their normal set of tools don't really predict it. So let's move on, uh, to the next thing you talk about in the book. You know, an important part of the economy in some sense is the financial system, and maybe we can start out with the story, your story, your personal story of the Prediction Company, which actually gave you some important insights into all this. Yeah, it certainly did. In a sense, this goes all the way back to doing roulette because what roulette made me realize is it's really fun to try to find something that people say you can't predict and then figure out how to predict it. And so that's become a theme in my life. And in the 80s, we developed some methods for making good forecasts. So somebody would hand us data. It might be ice ages or sunspots. And we would run our procedure and make predictions, and we could beat the standard models that people were using at the time. And whenever I would talk about this, somebody in the crowd would raise their hand and say, \"Have you tried applying this to the stock market?\" And I would have to say no. And finally, I was um approaching 10 years at Los Alamos, and I was, they were going to give me a ceremonial nut dish. So I decided I had to get out of there. And so we just spun off and started a company to predict markets, not knowing much about what was going on. We realized we needed to find a partner who really understood finance and could help us raise capital and so on. So we, we did manage to do that. We found a very good partner, and we then, you know, got our heads down and really worked and figured out how to beat the market. So we had a team of about 20 people. We built a very good computing system, languages. We wrote languages for processing the data and and built a system that allowed us to make fully automated trades and finally came up with a pretty good method that made steady profits. One thing that I found very interesting in your description here was the the days when you were, you, some, you put on a suit and tie. I want to see pictures of that J. Doyne Farmer in a suit and tie and made the rounds of uh trading houses. And I thought the fact that you had discovered heuristics even at these that were being applied at even at these top-of-the-food-chain trading companies was hugely interesting. Maybe you could tell that story a little bit. Yeah. Well, as, as you said, I, uh, we actually had a debate in the company. We realized we needed to go to New York. They expect you to wear a suit. So, I didn't own the suit, and so we had a company debate about whether the company should pay for it or I should pay for it. Decided I would pay for it and actually went to this little shop in downtown Santa Fe where kind of a gay guy helped me get the right clothes to go to New York. I had the right kind of tie and the right kind of shoes and everything. The thing I saw that that fascinated me was the diversity even within the financial business of the anthropology. There are different kinds of financial firms. People in different firms speak differently, dress differently, and follow different strategies. And even in the same building, remember, you know, one floor of Bank of America, this was actually in San Francisco, they said, \"Oh, we just follow technical trading rules. That's the only thing that makes any sense.\" And the floor below them said, \"We only follow the fundamentals. Those technical trader guys are crazy.\" And so I was just surprised at the diversity of beliefs that vast sums of money were being traded on in the market and also became aware that a lot of this was fairly bogus back then. I think it's much tighter now that quants are more in control of the system. I had to actually edit a few things out of the book where I named specific companies and specific clowns I met in man ridiculous strategies they were following. Yeah, it was, it was quite remarkable to me when I, I did business on the other side selling tools to Wall Street through a lot of my career, and I'd scratch my head going, \"These suckers are making millions of dollars doing technical analysis. What the fuck?\" Right? I think I would be just as good off to go talk to an astrologer, tell you the truth. They might even give you a better reading and, but the, that people on Wall Street believe this stuff, and of course, one of the things that we discovered and we were doing the work in your group was that, uh, having these beliefs actually has impact in the market, right? Which you describe in the book, what I think is a very, again, another very useful lens is, uh, thinking about finance as an ecology and ongoing evolution. Maybe talk about that a little bit. Yeah, during my time at Prediction Company, we started reading the finance, financial economics literature because, uh, we used, we get a little thing from our partner, Okconor and Associates. You'd check off the ones you wanted. This is before the internet, and they would just send us a pile of papers to read every month. And so I became familiar with the financial economics literature was useful because there were a lot of papers along the lines of um what were called stock anomalies, weird things that appeared to make money. So we, we implemented and tested every single one we could find and found that half of them we couldn't reproduce, period. The other half we could reproduce the result on the data they were using. But when we used other data, we couldn't reproduce it. And then the remaining quarter actually was useful. So we built a lot of our portfolio out of those. But as I was thinking about it, I realized that in this financial economics literature, they typically assume you have these rational investors and you have some tiny perturbation away from perfection. Whereas what I had deduced is people don't have any real idea what's going on in the market. Everybody's strategy is highly inaccurate, and, and you know, one of the calculations you can do is if you can beat the market, if you can make the right decision 55% of the time and you do daily trades, you, you make a ton of money. So even a very noisy strategy can work extremely well as long as it's actually true. What I realized is, no, the market, you have all these different specialists. You've got the guys on one floor who are doing technical trading, the guys on the next floor that follow fundamentals, the guys on the floor below that are market makers, the guys on the floor below that who are option traders. And they're all doing very different things. And the market efficiency just doesn't come automatically in so far as the market is remotely efficient because all of these different strategies combine together to make some profits even though they're all quite inaccurate and nudge the market a little bit towards efficiency. I'm a fan of Fisher Price's statement. Yes, I believe in market efficiency. The market's within a factor of two of fundamental values 90% of the time. I think he actually probably has the numbers about right. Yeah, it is amazing how much this even S&P any given S&P 500 stock oscillates in a given year. It's a, it's a big number, way bigger than the econ than the economic value could actually be changing. Right. Exactly. That there's no way all that financial volatility is coming from fundamentals, as Bob Schiller pointed out. But if you have a market ecology where each agent is implementing a strategy that has some useful bounded rationality in it, typically though there are people who trade with what really is equivalent to astrology, 'cause we found some of the technical trading rules actually work not super well, and you know, they may have years of not working, and they'll have a few years where they work, but you have this big ecology of different strategies groping its way towards setting prices at some reasonable values. But fluctuations up and down are huge and often well off the mark. In your work at Prediction Company, did you explicitly model ecosystems of traders or were you more brute force statistics? We were brute force statistics. It was only later that I started making models with different kinds of agents to see how they would work and so on. Yeah. In retrospect, I wish I'd taken my work that I did with your group. Well, actually, I made a conscious decision not to trade it, right? I was so burned out in the business world after busting my ass for 25 years. Last thing I wanted to do was tra, I actually had a guy come and offer me half a million dollars to put it to work, and I just said no. I think it would have worked at the time, but it was, uh, yeah, spec specifically the, uh, the, the book shape stuff, uh, back testing, and it seemed pretty powerful, but, uh, no doubt that's people have made money doing that, Jim. I know people, these, these firms, these high-frequency firms, they do that in a major way nowadays and have been for a while, and of course we know that the opportunity keeps shrinking. You do talk about that over time, that inevitably the sharks find the food, right, and eat, eat, eat it all, and then they eat too much and start losing money, and then somebody figures out how to take advantage of that behavior, which is the evolutionary part of totally right. And I think you're right that if, if you'd done what you said back in the 90s, that would have been a big money maker, or in this, my case, it was early double, but even then it would have been a big bunny, big money maker. There was still time to do it back then. In retrospect, I'm glad I st, I, I stayed away from that because it would have been a tarpit. And we all know what some of those finance guys are like in terms of a moral ecosystem. Not all of you guys out there in finance are bad, but there's a fair number of, uh, sick sociopaths to not put too sharp an edge on. Yeah. All right, let's move on again a higher level to another, uh, an area where Don has made some serious contributions, and and it actually ties together in an interesting way, and that is climate economics, and let's actually start with the, the interesting analogy to where you're going with complexity economics, which is the development of weather forecasting. Well, I just found fascinating. I read a, a really good book called *A Vast Machine* that chronicles how weather forecasting got developed. And the obvious question you ask is why not do the same in economics? And, and the answer to that is a sociological one, but you know, just review how they forecast weather. You know, you make measurements all over the world. You throw them into a big computer that simulates the entire atmosphere of the planet, and you try and do that with as much fidelity as you can. And on one hand, it's an easier problem because laws of physics are known and agreed upon. On the other hand, there's a lot of things like clouds and heat transfer between land masses that are actually not well understood. So even there they have to do a lot of heruristic reasoning to make things work right, and plus it's a good story because it involves van is whites and jewel charney and people working around the clock to build the first forecast, which, you know, forecast took 24 hours to make, and it was a 24-hour ahead forecast. Anyway, very interesting history, but the point is we could do that with economics, but we don't. Why? Because the dominant paradigm that we discuss is not well suited. You could give them all that data, they wouldn't have any idea what to do with it. And whereas if you're taking our approach of simulating the economy, we're doing pretty much what the weather forecasters are doing. We build a simulator, and we want the best data we can to feed into it. And I'm pretty convinced it can do a lot better than what we have. You know, key fact, weather forecast maintained almost the same accuracy for a century, and then finally in the 1980s with the help of Ed Lorent and many others, the physical weather forecasting broke through. But it took them 30 years from 1950 to 1980 before they could do that. Now we have the advantage that computers are a billion times more powerful. Actually going back to the 50s, probably 10 or 100 billion times more powerful than we have vastly more data. It's much more possible to do this now than it was then. So I think we have a big jump on weather forecasting because the economy doesn't have as many moving parts as the weather. Many, many orders of magnitude less. And even if we don't really have laws of economics like we have laws of physics, we still know enough about the way people behave and the way institutions function to build a simulator that should be able to make predictions that are a lot better than the ones we make now. Yeah. You quote in the book, I don't remember the number off the top of my head, the amount of money that's spent on, uh, weather forecasting, it's significant. Yeah. My recollection is that we spend five billion a year on weather forecasting, and people have estimated it has 30 billion a year in financial value. Kind of surprising it's only 30 billion actually. You think about things like agriculture and things that it might be more, but, uh, yeah, but it's certainly sign. Yeah. Well, I guess the question is how much can they, how much value can they extract from knowing if, if you're growing crops well because they can't look ahead a year. That's one of the problems. They can't tell you this is going to be a dry year, a good year to grow corn, right? They can tell you 3 days from now it's likely to rain. I have a farm and we lease out the land to\n\n\nA local farmer to take care of. And the current guy is good, but his father was even better. In all the years he made hay in our place, he never had his hay rained on even once. He knew when to cut hay. He knew when he had three days of good weather. I do believe he, uh, in the later days, was using the CNS satellite data feed that was coming in with the agriculturally oriented weather forecast. Quite interesting. Let's now take that analogy that society gets benefit from spending $5 billion a year from building a detailed model, always more detailed and always more processing every year. I think, I believe it was in your book, you quoted that our weather forecasts are getting better at about the rate of one day per decade. That's right. Your forecast after 10 years for two days is as good as your forecast was for one day ahead 10 years earlier. Yeah. And that, that's pretty impressive, right? I mean, that's a significant rate of change in the systems as inherently complex as weather. So if we took this analogy and applied it to the building economic models, uh, what would be your prescription? How, what should we be thinking about? What should we be doing as a society? And maybe give us some guesstimate on how valuable this could be? Well, I mean, first of all, we're actually starting to do this now. We, I'd moved forward since the book was written. We don't have nearly the resources we would like to have. You know how one would approach this is to really say, okay, what does an economy consist of? Households, what, how do households make decisions, and you really plunge in and look at how do different kinds of people make the decisions they make about what to consume or how much education to get or where to work. Uh, similarly, you do the same for firms, you do the same for banks. You do the same for all the major institutions, and there aren't that many. And then you put all your knowledge into the computer and simulate it. Now, we're doing this now on a couple of levels. We have a simulator that can simulate a country. We're getting close to being able to simulate the whole world, but we can at least simulate countries. We've simulated 38 different countries and shown we're making decent forecasts now. And, and we're just simulating all the details. You, we have a couple of million individuals organized into the order of 800,000 houses and 50,000 representative companies, and we, we do a simulation. Now, you asked what value could come from it. So there, I could do, you know, a little back of the envelope calculation. We lost the order of 10 trillion dollars from the 2008 crisis, maybe 20 or 30, but at least 10. And so if we could avert that crisis, obviously that would be hugely valuable. So if you had a $100 million project that could avert a $10 trillion crisis, I think, if I'm doing the numbers right, that's a factor of 10 to the five payoff. Now, of course, that's over optimistic because it might not work. So let's say it only has a one in a 100 chance of working. All right, that's still a factor of a thousand payoff. And let's suppose that we don't actually get rid of the crisis, but we ameliorate it so that it's a, we make it 99% is of what it was. We, we knock off 1% of the harm. We're still giving a factor of 10 payoffs. Seems valuable to me. And it seems like, given that nobody's done this or even come close to doing it, it's worth doing. So I'm pushing that. Spending a lot of my time these days trying to convince people to put some money behind doing that. In the meantime, we're doing something else that's even more concrete and more feasible. We're building a model of energy investment. And we're doing it by building a model at one:one scale, a literal model. So there's 30,000 energy generating companies in the world. All 30,000 of those companies are in our model. Those companies own 160,000 assets. All of those assets are in our model. And at least in the initial condition. And every year we look at, we simulate the energy system, we figure out how much energy each company supplies and at what price, and therefore we can estimate their revenues. We can estimate by other means their costs. Therefore, we can estimate their profits. So that's already pretty extreme, potentially extremely valuable. But, but then we can also simulate their investment strategy because companies make decisions in a fairly transparent way. I, not always, but you know, they look around at possible projects. They look at the returns on the investments, and that will determine whether to decide to build a solar farm or another gas-fired plant. And, and so we think we could also simulate that and then use that as a guide to help us go through the energy transition. And the thing I love about this project is we have all the micro data we need. We have 25 years of data where we've got, we get to see each firm adding each asset as it goes along. We have the data about each asset to figure out how much it's going to participate in the electricity system, and we can see all the investment decisions that got made. We have more than 100,000 investment decisions in the data set, and we have a cazillion decisions about electricity and oil and gas in the data set in terms of the day-to-day operation. So I'm quite optimistic this is going to work at the end of the day. And if you think about the macro model I mentioned earlier, we can build out from this in that direction, cuz for this model, we're really putting in a lot of domain details about how industries work. What's the difference between, uh, uh, gas industry and, and, uh, the oil industry and the hydro power and so on. And so there's just a lot more embedded knowledge in this model by orders of magnitude than any economic model. Let's drill into this climate thing a bit because if we step back and look at the history of humanity, how we manage the transition to stopping using the atmosphere as a dump for greenhouse gases, it's probably the question for humanity, assuming we don't do something really stupid with nuclear weapons or biotechnology or AI. But a lot of ways we could whack ourselves, but the one that's going to crush us in the end if the other ones don't is, uh, climate change, right? And finding the right road to climate change that doesn't bankrupt us on one side or take too long on the other is ought to be, though it's not for despicable reasons, it ought to be at the very top of our political agenda. How does your work potentially address choosing the trajectory for humanity? So we did another body of work, not necessarily even complexity economics, which is just to collect a lot of data about technological change, you know, how fast do things improve, how fast costs come down. We all, we're all familiar with Moore's laws and Moore's law and computers, but it turns out lots of other technologies satisfy something like that, although rarely at such a rapid rate. Similarly, technologies follow S-curves in their deployment, which have a very universal shape. So we've been gathering data to understand both of those, and, and you know, used that approach back in 2010. I used that approach to predict what the price of solar PV energy would be in 2020 and said, well, it's going to be as cheap as coal-fired electricity in 2020. And everybody said I was nuts, and that was right. Why was it right? Because I was just smart enough to plot the data on log scale and draw a line through it. It was not a brilliant act, but they just weren't doing that. And, and so I think one of the things you see is that it's the results of all this research are that solar energy in particular is likely to get very cheap in the future. We predict the median cost of solar energy in 2050 will be $3 a megawatt hour, and so makes it more than a factor of 10 cheaper than than it is now and will make electricity cheaper than it's ever been. We see batteries coming down quite rapidly. Uh, and then there is solid state energy storage hanging out in the wigs. So, you know, I think, I think it's going to happen faster than most people think. And, and we're just damn lucky that we have the technologies that we need coming along right when we desperately need them. I mean, we're still going to have at least two degrees of warming. So, dramatic change to the earth, but, but hopefully not runaway, uh, outgassing of the tundra. We'll see. Yeah, it is, uh, very optimistic. Because I read, read that, I go, hm, it actually means, I appears that our politics is just utterly broken on climate change. Nobody has the guts to do anything. Uh, even though the a clear solution is pretty obvious, which I talk about from time to time, which would be a escalating carbon tax or greenhouse gas tax at the source, you at the production of the fuels, which is then refundable per capita, which would give everybody an incentive to reduce their own consumption because of the signal at the pump, but at the same time would be net-neutral with respect to the flow of economics and actually would have an egalitarian purpose because rich people burn a shitload more fuel than poor people do. So like 70% of people will be, would make, make money off of this deal. But yet even this obvious, simple, uh, solution, which been endorsed by hundreds of economists, uh, no politician will even mention it today, right? Uh, but anyway, to rant off my, rant off about, uh, the, the ridiculousness of ignoring climate as a, as a policy, but perhaps your findings would indicate that that's right, that the market will take care of the problem. Well, the market's not going to take care of the whole thing. Market's helping a lot. We've got the wind at our back finally, but we really need to get better power storage, and most of all, we need better grid. And grid requires governments to build. So you have to have some willingness to support really rolling out the grid. You know, we actually estimate in net present value terms as a net savings of money by transitioning quickly of the order of 11 trillion. But we do need government to allow us to really increase the grid and do more things with electricity and, uh, change the economy in that regard. Of course, a lot of the changes need to be done on the grid are not actually government spending per se as regulatory reforms. I mean, it's almost impossible to build a power line today in the United States without a, a zillion nimbies coming out and saying, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; That's right. And we need to, we need to fix that. The US may end up, I think the US is going to be the big boozer on this and many other things that are building these days because, well, as we all know, the Chinese are taking over these technologies, and these are the technologies of the future. Fortunately, uh, learning curves these days are relatively transportable across, uh, boundaries, so even if we're just a couple years behind the Chinese in the technology of solar cells, big deal, probably, right? That's one big difference between now and the past where these artisanal skills would take a generation to propagate. Now, uh, two years, we see, buy one of theirs, take it apart, build our own, right? We can be fast followers, and that will be just fine. I'm not too worried about that aspect of it. All right. Well, that's interesting. So now let's go on to the kind of the conclusion of the book, uh, which is if we take these ideas and extend them further, uh, and to creating a essentially a huge model of our society and our economy and becoming what you called a conscious civilization. Let's talk about that a little bit. Well, so the idea of conscious civilization goes back to building, making analogies like if the economy is the metabolism. I argue that the financial system is your gut brain. You know, you actually have a brain. You have neurons the size of the cap in your gut that help you digest. Well, we do other things too, like we built scientific models, and we already have used those to help us think about danger, whether it be an asteroid whose trajectory we can calculate or and telescopes allow us to see them or climate change. Right? I, I, it's a pretty amazing tribute to science that we can look 100 years ahead and see that we're headed for this train wreck, even if we can't, we have a hard time acting on it as a society. But increasingly, so far that, that's better understanding of the physical world. Our collective understanding of the physical world brings us a lot of benefit. But, but maybe we can even start to collectively understand ourselves. And if we could make better economic predictions that could then guide us to make better decisions about things like which technologies to invest in or how to run the economy, then we are starting to become aware of ourselves. And why do I call it consciousness? Well, I have a very simple view of consciousness. Consciousness is a model of oneself. And so the thing that makes me conscious is I know I exist and I can model what I do and how I relate, how I alter the behavior of other people. And, and so similarly, if we can understand ourselves that way, then we can become more conscious as a civilization. That would be huge. That would be great. And you know, to your point earlier, the expense is relatively modest, right? If we spent 5 billion a year, we'd make some serious progress. Oh, no kidding. I, I'd settle for a budget much lower than that. And I can tell you with, you know, I, the more I do this, the more convinced I am that pumping money into this is going to pay off big time. And as you pointed out earlier, fortunately, there are some probably harvestable things that the, the market can actually fund the development of, right? I mean, you would think that my strategy for making this happen now is to do it through the private sector by building a money cow that can, uh, we can just expand and expand and hopefully meanwhile give this technology away to the people who really need it. You know, we're just, we want to make our tools available for governments at a low price, but for companies at a much higher price. And I, I don't want to get stuck in a situation like I was at Prediction Company where we have to keep everything secret, locked up, and just make profits for some Swiss bankers. Well, thank you for this very interesting conversation and this compelling vision for the future. Really a pretty optimistic vision if we can avoid gross stupidity. But talking about J. Doyne Farmer's book, Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World. And I should add, even though the topics seem pretty obstruuse, it's actually a very nicely written book, very accessible. You don't need to be a complexity scientist. You don't need to know calculus. Anybody who's listening to this podcast could benefit from reading this book, and I really recommend it highly. I'd like to thank Don for coming on here and talking about it. Welcome, Jim. All righty.\n[Music]\nAudio production and editing by Andrew Blevens Productions.
