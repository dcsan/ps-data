  "cleanText": "That is the stupidest thing you can ever do. What is the most important thing for someone who's just trying to grow their money? So, I learned this from my mother, and I actually built a whole company around it. Yeah, there she is. So, I haven't seen that picture in a while. Damn. I mean, what she did, the performance was extraordinary. And with that, she put my brother and I through college. She took care of her family when they fell on hard times. When I saw the results, I said, \"That's it. That's how I'm going to invest for the rest of my life.\"\n\nSo, talk me through this. I want as much detail as possible. Okay, let's start with this. Kevin O'Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, is the self-made millionaire and investor who's built and sold companies for billions. There's a lot of people don't like me for my blindness. I don't care because there's people that don't think ahead and find themselves mired in debt but then pissing away money spending $28 for lunch. I mean, that's just stupid.\n\nWhat about a house? The mistake that people make is they buy too much house. Never let the mortgage and the cost of maintaining the house be more than 1/3 of your income.\n\nNow how much does the person that you fall in love with have an impact? You kidding? It's everything. And I did some research, and most marriages can survive infidelity. They can't survive financial stress. But if everybody that's listening does this one thing, you will have over a million and a half dollars.\n\nKevin, can anybody be an entrepreneur? No. Only a third of people can become successful entrepreneurs because there's a couple of things that you must achieve to be successful. First,\n\n[Music]\n\nKevin, I'm going to ask you to do something which is quite difficult because I'd find it quite hard if someone asked me to do this. But before we get into the detail, can you give me a 30,000-foot view on your entrepreneurship and investing career? Just the just the three bullet points that are most pertinent before we dig into those specifics.\n\nEvery entrepreneur I've ever talked to, um, that finds himself where I am today, has a defining moment where they are pushed into this path. It's something they can remember, and they remember it in perpetuity. And I'll remember my moment getting fired in an Ice Cream Store. That simple. First day on the job, asked to serve and scoop ice cream. And um, I did that all day. But when people sample ice cream, they get a taster, and they take their gum out and they throw it on the floor. Somebody's got to scrape the gum off the floor at the end of the day. I only took that job because I was very interested in a girl who's working in the shoe store, and I figured I could, you know, hang out with her afterwards. And uh, I saw her waiting for me, and the woman who owned the store said, \"You've got a scrape to come off the floor.\" And I didn't want her to see me on my knees with a scraper. Bad for my brand. I was in high school. And uh, she said, \"No, no, you have to do it.\" And I said, \"You know, you hired me as a scooper, not a scraper.\" She said, \"Um, how about you're fired?\" And I didn't know what that meant. And it was the defining moment for me because I realized there's two kinds of people in the world. There's people that own the store, and there's people that scrape the [ __ ] off the floor, and you have to decide who you are. And I'm not saying being an employee is a bad thing. Not at all. But for me, um, it hit me. It just hit me.\n\nKevin, there's a present for you. We give a present to all of our guests. Really? Underneath that black Can I open it? You can open it. I just take this off. Oh, look at that. You've heard the story. That is exactly how it looked, except it was black gum, and that was exactly the tile. It was just like that Mexican tile. That's really freaking me out.\n\nSo you were asked to scrape gum off a Mexican tile just like that. And in order to do that, you got to get down on your knees and do it. And um, I just couldn't do it. And I and I and then you know the rest of the story. I eventually could afford to bulldoze the whole mall if I went to. When we went back to meet her and thank her for her pushing you off the treadmill into that direction, and she was gone, and there was a bodega there instead.\n\nYou said there that you realize that there's kind of two people in life. There's the entrepreneurs, the person that owns the ice cream parlor, and there's the person that scrapes it off the floor. Yeah. That provoked a question in me, which is, do you think anybody can own the ice cream parlor? I do you think anybody can be an entrepreneur?\n\nNo. I've tried to teach it. Um, and I mentor out it all the time to the CEOs that I work with. Uh, there are some attributes of people that can do this. A certain element of risk tolerance, uh, a certain element of focus. And then the other element which I've really started to believe in of late is karma, luck. You need to be lucky. You need It's like Napoleon was once asked, \"Who are your favorite generals?\" and he said, \"My favorite generals are lucky generals. My lucky generals.\" And I'm starting to think that in life, um, particular entrepreneurship, you look at the difference, the path of success and failure, and I nobody's exposed to it more than I am in terms of how many investments I may have made over the decades.\n\nI think if you want a percentage, you know, I teach these cohorts at Harvard. I'm an executive fellow there. I'm very proud of that work. You get a class of 120 people in a room, two-thirds of them want to become consultants. That's why they're there. And lead a life of mediocrity and never make a decision of consequence in their lives. And after 24 months, they are tainted with that disease forever. They'll always be good consultants, but they will never achieve greatness in any way. In life, only a third of people can become successful entrepreneurs. That's it. And the rest can be very successful employees. And there's nothing wrong with that. You can have a fantastic life. You won't be shackled to the, you know, the the ups and downs of entrepreneurship, the challenge of it, how hard it is, but you'll never be free. And that's the debate. That's it right there. Do you want personal freedom? It's the only path. That's it. It's the only path.\n\nIt is the only path. I mean, you can't I I've always said it's not about the pursuit of money. It's not about the pursuit of greed. You will fail if you do that. It's it's the undying love of freedom.\n\nSo that one-third of people that you say will be successful, they'll pursue their their dreams, they'll build a business, whatever it might be. Yeah. Do you think it's possible for us in this conversation to increase the probability of their success? You said you don't think you can you can make someone an entrepreneur, but is there things you can do to increase their probability of success?\n\nYes, there are a couple of things that you must achieve to be successful. And let me explain what they would be. And this is not some academic study. This is real data from real situations of real CEOs I've worked with and learned from because I used to work for guys like Steve Jobs and others in my career.\n\nLet me um let me give you one that I think is very important. We'll start with this one. I used to work for Steve Jobs in the early 90s making all of his educational software. I mean it was just Oh, there they are. My goodness, you guys do good research. Those are the kind of things that we did for him, you know. Yeah. Yeah. All of that. It's hard to find. Those are senior realms. But, you know, in developing that software, we used to go quarterly. Um, Heidi Rosen was there in the room. She's still a a very famous venture capitalist. And I would say, Steve, you know, we got to do some market research on Oregon Trail. I mean, it's a huge title. It's in 110,000 school buildings. We got to do an update. It's going to cost you 12, 15 million bucks. We want to find out what the students want. We want to find out what the teachers want. Want to find out what the parents want. Steve would say, by the way, not a nice guy. Not a nice guy. He would say to a room full of people, Kevin, I don't give a [ __ ] what the students want or the parents think or anybody thinks. It's what I want. They don't know what they want till I tell them what they want. And I said, \"Steve, you sound like such an [ __ ] You have no idea what that sounds like.\" He says, \"No, no, that's how it is, Kevin. Now, are you making money with me? Are we Are you Am I your fastest growing OEM? Have we not been wildly successful and continue to be?\" I said, \"Yes, Steve, that's true.\" He said, \"Then [ __ ] shut up and do what I say.\"\n\nThat's how he would talk to you. 100%. And here's what I learned. Look how wildly successful he was. But here's why. There's a concept that he understood that very few people focused on back then in the early 90s of signal to noise ratio. What was so brilliant about Jobs that I tell every CEO now, and I don't care if you're an S&P 500 CEO or you're just starting a business. His vision of Signal was the top three to five things you have to get done in the next 18 hours. Not your vision for the business next week or next month or next year. Just the next 18 hours you're awake. You're going to get those three things or those five things done that you have deemed critical for your mission. They must get done today. Anything that stops you from doing that is the noise. So this signal to noise ratio to be successful for Steve Jobs was 80/20. 80 signal, 20 noise. And I knew that to be true with him because he would email me at 2:30 in the morning expect me to get back to him because back then we didn't have texts. It was all email.\n\nHe was right. He was right. And the only other person that I've seen that has a higher ratio than that is Elon Musk. He has no noise. He does not deal with noise. He is 100% signal. 24 seconds of, you know, every cycle. I mean, the guy is just 60 seconds of every minute, 60 minutes of every hour. The 18 hours he's awake, it's all signal. And look what he's achieved. Now, it's very awkward for him socially. Because noise is dealing with your family sometimes or noise is saying hi to a friend or noise is is is listening to some doom scrolling on you know some social media app that just takes your mind or maybe playing your guitar but very few people on earth and if you go back in history you're going to find out that the geniuses of their time we're close to 100% signal and so I can really sort of summarize this for my audience signal is the most urgent thing you should be focused on right now and noise is bas basically everything.\n\nNo. The goals you set for that the the weight the that you were awake if you're going to be awake 18 hours. Yeah. And you've determined that there's three things you have to get done. You're going to get those done. No matter what it takes, you're going to get those done. And you're not going to let anything distract you from those three to five things. If you're a CEO and you achieve that and you can get those done with 80% of your time based on that, you're extraordinarily successful. You are absolutely and you're Steve Jobs or you're an Elon Musk or you're somebody if you if you even talk to Bezos I don't know him personally but I've heard in many interviews like I knew you know I've I've met Elon just a few times I spent a lot of time with Jobs but they say the same thing Bezos will not make a decision after 1:00 in the afternoon because he felt that the noise was too high the signal for him was in the morning hours it this is a crucial aspect of success that that I now understand to be the ability of of of it defines an entrepreneur. A man or woman that understands a signal noise ratio that focuses on that, they'll be successful. The ones that can't that get down to a 50/50 signal noise, they'll fail. It's that simple. And it's a very simple concept.\n\nYou know, you made one of your things today this interview. You're going to get it done. You're going to all these people around and everything else. This is one of the three to five things you're going to get done. I have five things today. I'm going to get them done. I'll do the same thing tomorrow and the day after that. And you have to decide how much signal you need to get those three to five things done. And for jobs it was 80%.\n\nWhat's the opposite of that? Sometimes looking at the opposite helps us to understand something. So the opposite of having you know I hire managers and CEOs that have a balance in life between the discipline the binary aspect of business which is I make money I lose money and the chaos of the arts or some other pursuit dance painting photography collecting crystals whatever it is that that they that they have that balance you you need you need the ying and yang in your mind to make correct decisions. It doesn't mean it takes you off the signal. The signal is you got to get stuff done. But how do you live your life? And so I spend a fair amount of my time practicing my guitar or working with my photography or my my watch, you know, up tonight, very late tonight, I will meet a master watch maker and we will deal with the design of a new piece unique he's going to make for me and I'm going to love that moment. That's going to be something completely different to what I did all day long. And we'll start our journey together over the next two years to make this piece unique. And that's something that just takes me\n\n\nAway from all the [ __ ] I'm going to be dealing with today.\nAnd I also tell successful entrepreneurs, in the same day, you will get a, and this happened to me today.\nIt happens every day.\nYou're going to get a call from some aspect of your, what you call it, your empire, whatever you want, where your this company's going bankrupt.\nIt's just going to go bankrupt, and you're going to lose, I don't know, 10 million bucks on that deal.\nAnd that's a piece of information you're dealing with.\nHalf an hour later, this actually happened to me today.\nOne of my companies going public.\nIt's a 450x for me.\nThe stock will get unlocked sometime in the fall.\nBut how can, how do you, how do you fit that together?\nUtter catastrophe, destruction, woe, loss, utter euphoria, half an hour later.\nThat's what my life is like.\nThat's entrepreneurship, obviously, on a different scale for most founders.\nWell, the founders deal with the same thing.\nThey get disastrous news.\nThey lose an account like a Costco or something if it's consumer goods or service, and they get something else.\nThe, the, the ebb and flow is, is the management of expectations, and your ability emotionally to navigate those ups and downs is part of what entrepreneurship is.\nBut it goes back to the signal.\nIt can't take you off the signal.\nThis is what Steve Jobs taught me.\nYes, it's great news.\nYes, it's bad news.\nBut focus on the signal, Kevin O'Leary.\nFocus on the signal.\nThat's it.\nWhere does this analogy come from of signal and noise?\nIt was his genius of making it so simple.\nWhat are the three things you got to get done today?\nWhat are they?\nHow do you know what they are?\nThey will make themselves apparent.\nThey will definitely make themselves apparent.\nThey will make themselves apparent, and you will realize, I have to deal with that.\nYou may have them set up from the day before.\nI actually still use sticky notes on my mirror.\nGot to get these three things done, and or five, whatever it is.\nBut then something else will hit.\nThat's the skill of understanding is that noise hitting me or is that signal?\nThere is the essence of the great entrepreneur, the great manager, the great leader.\nIs that signal or is that noise?\nWhat is it?\nThat's what you're looking for.\nYou're hiring somebody that can actually distinguish signal and noise because it could be noise.\nIt could be irrelevant.\nYou have to determine, only you makes that decision.\nThat's the key right there.\nThis is what I teach entrepreneurs and engineers, and this is the most important thing.\nIt's that judgment of prioritization, but then the sort of force of execution to get it done.\nCan you interpret signal and noise, and can you keep the noise away from the things you got to get done?\nThat's one.\nThe other, which is something that I've learned over the last 5 years, and this, uh, you might find this interesting, but most of my, particularly the nascent startups, and you're, you're involved in the same format I am.\nYou're Dragon's Den in England.\nI'm a Shark Tank in the US.\nI, you know, you put up 500,000 or a million bucks into somebody's business, eight out of 10 is going to fail, maybe six out of 10, depend, you just don't know.\nAnd I love it when people tell me, oh, I, I know when I make an investment, it's going to work.\nSo full of [ __ ] they have.\nI'm talking about startups, they have no idea what's going to work, and you won't know for 5 to seven years, which is why you need diversification in the portfolio.\nBut I would go as far to say now, you know, when I meet um, venture capital firms and young analysts that work there, and they think they're so damn smart, they've never operated a business, they know nothing.\nThey have no idea what they're doing.\nThey're going to hope that one or two of their portfolio uh, is going to work out in seven years and pay for all the other mistakes.\nBut the serendipitous nature of success in entrepreneurship is brutal.\nIt is.\nSo that does that mean though that it's, I guess I was going to say, does that not mean that it's highly luck?\nInvesting is highly like entrepreneurship must be, well, I said karma, you know, I call it karma, but you need executional skills, but here's another skill that I think we should talk about um, when you look at, at least my experience over decades of making these uh, nascent, these early stage investments, these around investments, remarkably, and I've done them in all 11 sectors of the the economy, the majority of the successes, five to seven years later, are companies run by women.\nWhy is that?\nWhy is that?\nAnd so they don't know each other.\nThey're in different sectors.\nThey never meet each other.\nWhy is that?\nAnd I have come to the conclusion um, two things.\nThey set goals that they can achieve, so that in the early stage of their businesses, they put growth rate targets like 15, 16% versus men at 30%.\nVery often men hit their targets 65% of the time, at least my portfolio, and women 90 [ __ ] plus percent of the time, and that keeps the, the, the team very sticky.\nThey want to be part of a, so they don't have a lot of attrition when they're small.\nThey don't lose the head of financing and marketing that that works, but they have another attribute, and this was pointed out to me by one of my female CEOs a few years ago to me.\nShe said, you know, Kevin, you talk too much.\nYou talk too much.\nUm, you talk two/3s, you listen one third.\nWhy don't you try reversing the ratio?\nShe said that to you.\nYeah.\nYeah.\n[Laughter]\nI'm very thankful, actually, because I tried it, and um, she's right.\nIf you don't talk and you listen, you become far more effective as a manager or an investor in my case by getting information that you weren't going to get by talking.\nAnd so if you go into a room, I just did this a few minutes ago before I came here.\nI'm involved in a litigation, and we decided to attempt settlement talks, which is why I was a few minutes late, and um, you know, we knew we were going in there to settle, and it, it's long protruded, you know, long, it's a long, long, long uh, litigation, and I remembered her as we sat at the table like this, there were other people in the room, but the two uh, you know, were across from each other.\nI just looked at him.\nI understand for a long time, a long time.\nAnd it gets uncomfortable, and no one else is talking, you know, just looking.\nAnd um, maybe after 90 seconds, he blurted out something he shouldn't have said.\nAnd I knew exactly what the price was right there.\nThat was the end of it.\nYou learned that as a podcaster.\nYou learned that there's actually something going on in the silence.\nThere is something going on in silence.\nAnd it's, it's, it's the number that he was going to settle at.\nHe showed his hand.\nSo, we saved ourselves two hours.\nYou know, it's a, it's an attribute that many people can't do because they can't stand the social uncomfort of it.\nI have no problem with it.\nI could sit here and look at you for 10 minutes, it wouldn't matter to me.\nAnd I've actually found it to be a very useful piece of information.\nIt's not just a negotiating, but to listen to employees, listen to investors, listen to financeers, listen to alternative ideas to yours and become more powerful from it.\nYou're in the very business of people selling to you and pitching to you.\nWe both sit on a similar show where people come in and pitch to us.\nYou're seeing at times 10 to 12 pitches a day.\nSo you've developed this muscle over the last couple of decades now, almost this instinctive spidey sense of when an entrepreneur will be successful, at least in the context of securing investment.\nWhat have you come to learn about the, the attributes of the ones that are successful?\nIs there, is there anything one can take from that in the moment when that entrepreneur comes out onto the carpet in the context of Shark Tank or Dragon's Den even?\nThey need the setup shot of the product with the entrepreneur, and they have a, in our case, a steady cam or a jib that comes down and shoots it.\nSo the, the stage director, Eric, uh, is his name.\nI've worked with him for years.\nSays to the entrepreneurs I've never met, usually it's a team or it's a family or it's whatever.\nThree or four, two people, whatever.\nHold.\nHold.\nDon't speak.\nHold.\nHold.\nDon't mind the camera coming into your face.\nHold.\nHold.\nMaybe for two minutes.\nAnd I'm right there in front of them.\nI'm 12 feet from them.\nAnd I just look at them.\nNot smiling, not blinking, not frowning, just looking at them.\nAnd before they say a single word, I know if they're winners or losers.\nJust like that.\nAnd why is that?\nWhy is that?\nWhen?\nAnd I'm right probably 99% of the time.\nMaybe I get it wrong one out of a hundred.\nI doubt it though.\nYou walk in a room, even though you've practiced, you know, you in the context of of Shark Tank, 20 plus cameras, a billion plus dollars in in the five chairs there.\nYou've been practicing for months your pitch, but it wasn't the real deal.\nHere you are, cameras are rolling, tape is running, you know, you've only got so many minutes.\nThis is your moment.\nAnd you're on national television.\n100 plus million people will see you in syndication.\nIt's all in your mind.\nIt's all in your mind.\nIt's going through your head.\nCan you project who you are with your eyes and the way you're standing?\nCan you project your confidence?\nAre you looking at the ground?\nAre you looking away from me because you can't stand me looking at you directly without saying anything to you?\nOr do you push back?\nOr did you say, &quot;I'm gonna, I'm gonna stake my aura.\nI'm gonna stake my ground here.\nI'm gonna show you I'm ready.&quot;\nYou see what I'm getting at?\nYeah.\nAnd I can feel it.\nI can see that they're ready to do battle.\nThey're ready to answer.\nThey're ready to present.\nThey're ready.\nReady.\nReady.\nReady.\nOr they're not.\nAnd I've taken that out of the Shark Tank.\nI see that every day in life.\nI see it.\nSo you have to learn how to project yourself in front of your peers or who's who you want to you want to lead or teach, or if you're a general or a preacher, that is maybe an innate something you're born with, or maybe you can learn that, I don't know, I don't care, but if you don't have it, you're going to fail, and you're just, that's before a word is spoken, before the first word is spoken.\nAnd so then what has to happen?\nThen Eric says, &quot;Go.\nYou're on.&quot;\nAnd everybody's just sitting there looking at you.\nCan you articulate your idea in 90 seconds or less?\nCan you, whatever props you have or whatever you're going to say, can I get the big idea right away?\nThe ones that had that aura generally get there.\n30 seconds later, I get it.\nI get what they're here for.\nI understand their product.\nOkay, that's good.\nUnfortunately, great ideas are a dime a dozen.\nI mean, there's millions of them.\nThe next phase begins.\nThis is after 90 seconds.\nCan you explain why you're the right person to execute on this idea and create a business from it?\nBecause you know something about this space?\nYou worked for a competitor.\nYou've tried three times before and failed.\nYou figured out what you did wrong.\nWhat is it about you or your team that can take this idea and make it happen?\nNow, when you get those two things together, you can feel the aura of the room.\nThe isotope is sizzling because you've derisked a great idea.\nYou got an operator in, and they, but then the third thing, this is the killer.\nThis is the killer.\nI've seen it so many times in real life and Shark Tanks real life, it is.\nIt.\nYou got to know your numbers.\nHow big is the market?\nHow fast is it growing?\nWhat's the gross margin?\nI mean, I've said this a million times to people.\nI teach this every day.\nHow many competitors are there?\nWhen are you going to break even?\nWhat month?\nIf you get the first two right and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell.\nAnd I'll put you there myself.\nI mean, you wasted an opportunity for an entrepreneur that did know their numbers that could have been in that spot that I could have invested in.\nYou don't know your numbers.\nI take you out behind the barn and shoot you.\nYou should have brought somebody that understands the language of business because those three together are the definition of leadership right there.\nI've never heard someone talk about aura in entrepreneurship quite like that.\nAnd I was, I was just trying to, for the people listening that are either trying to figure out if they have an aura or to grow that aura, what does it, what does it look and feel like?\nIs it physically?\nIs it shoulders back?\nIs it, you said it's eye contact?\nOr is it indescribable?\nAnd do you think you could take someone who doesn't have that aura in business and teach them it?\nDoes business give you that aura?\nI think you can teach it.\nI certainly try and teach it to my children.\nUm, I try and teach it to my students.\nAnd the best way to do it is to look at yourself in the mirror sometime.\nYou know, just what do you look like to yourself?\nYou know, if you're going to go make a presentation to take down a million-dollar line of credit or something, you want to dress the part, obviously, but you're going to walk in a room with, you know, a loan officer and maybe an assistant, maybe one other, depending on the size of the deal, and they'll have never met you probably, and you're going to have to project yourself in those seconds as you're walking up to shake their hands.\nWhat does that take?\nIt takes an aura of confidence.\nAnd it's in the eyes.\nIt's in the way you're, you're standing.\nIt's in how the way you're dressed.\nIt's, it's not a joke to be dressed for success, you know.\nIt's, it's um, it's, but it's, it's something about presenting yourself and keeping your eyes focused on who's talking to you so that they know that you're absorbing the information, that you respect the information, that you're about to get into a narrative with them of respect, even though that there may be disagreements.\nAll of this is happening in the first 60 seconds.\nAnd it's setting up for the rest of your life with that person.\nIt could be who you're going to marry.\nIt could be\n\n\nWho you're going to work with. It could be your partner in business. It could be your banker. It could be anybody. It could be a soldier that's going to give up their life for you. It's sort of who are you? That's it.\n\nJust closing off on the point you made about women being your most successful investments and the companies that have given you the greatest returns tend to be led by women. Does that mean that you focus on hiring women into executive roles?\n\nYeah, I'm practically all women. Um, particularly Asian women. I am a uh, you know, this whole thing about DEI and all this stuff. I've always had diversity because I only hire on merit. I don't care if what sex you are or what you call yourself or where you came from or the color of your skin or what planet you were born on. I couldn't give a [ __ ]. Can you execute? And the way I hire people, and that's why I have such a diverse staff in my operating company, I don't hire you. I say, \"Look, you sound good, and you look great on paper, but that doesn't mean anything if you can't work within the team. So, I know you want a job and you want benefits and all that stuff, but I'm not going to do that. If you want to be part of my universe, you're going to work for four to six months as a contractor at a much higher salary because you're not going to get any stock options, you're not going to get any uh benefits. But I just want to see what it's like for you to work with all of the people that we deal with every day. All the lawyers, all the bankers, all of the, you know, the CEOs that we have investments in and and your co-workers because I don't do 9 to 5 anymore. I do project-based work. I don't care where you live. We have people working in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, uh England. I mean, everywhere. Everywhere and and you know we meet we try and find an hour every week where we can see each other but we're just constantly communicating using modern day tools today but you know can you actually be given a mandate and execute on it? That's it. I don't care when you do it. If you have to get the financials out, let's say you're running in finance, you got to get them out the 15th for taxes. I don't care when you do it, but if you miss the 15th, I care. So I I need to find out if those people can fit into that kind of an environment. Some of them make it, some of them don't. Sometimes we know right away after 90 days, let's hire them, bring them in the team, and you know, let's give them the whole package. And sometimes after a month, we say, \"No, it's not going to work. Here's like, you know, that's it.\" I think I think more companies should do that. Actually, it's more like the Swiss apprentice system. They bring you into a lot like, you know, my stepfather's Swiss. I've been going to Switzerland for 50 years. So if you're a giant company like a Fiser or a Nestle, you pull them out of high school at 14. You give them a job in the afternoon. They become an apprentice. They want to learn. They want to work. They want to understand what it's like and then you find the the winners at while they're still in high school. Then you give them summer jobs and then you bring them into the company. That's where I got the idea from. The Swiss are genius that way because you're sort of mitigating the risk. I guess you're taking less of a a risk on. No, but you're also finding out if their their DNA is going to fit with your. I mean, I want my team to make a ton of money. I I just I want them to be successful. I want every person to be proud to work with the other and and just we're almost invincible. We're so damn good at what we do. You have the same thing here. You you don't have people that don't work for you. Well, you get rid of them. You whack them. I'm more just formal about it. Boom. You're gone.\n\nWith the investments that you've made, how many investments? How many offers have you done on Shark Tank now? Probably like 800.\n\nWe know we don't even count it anymore. We look at the portfolio rolling over a 5 to seven-year period.\n\nA lot, like a lot. And and the thing is, the thing what I've learned is you get a you get an exit like uh base pause from five years ago or something.\n\nRemarkable woman.\n\nThat was the the cat DNA thing.\n\nThe cat DNA thing. I mean, nobody saw that coming. I thought the thing was a joke. Um, I was so wrong. I mean, that's the whole point. And and she had the highest IRA, I think, in the whole format's history. Nobody's made her. She was around for 36 months and taken out at such an extreme number in all cash that there was an NDA signed between Sony and the the pharmaceutical company. I can't even tell you what it was. It was extraordinary. It was extraordinary.\n\nWas it nine figures?\n\nBelieve me, it's a tough NDA because and I understand why they did it. They didn't buy it for the cat DNA testing. They bought it for the data.\n\nWith AI didn't really wasn't emerging then. It existed, but it wasn't with the data they have now. They can develop products for animals that are extraordinary in terms of feeds and medicines.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd nobody had that much data on the 110 million cats in America because she got it all during the pandemic. Thousands and thousands and thousands of of of you know, it was it was never about it was it was a data company. It's like my son telling me when he got his internship at Tesla, \"Hey dad, it's not a car company. It's a data company.\"\n\nBuy the stock. I said, \"I'm never buying the stock. It's a joke. It's so expensive.\" He said, \"You're an idiot. It's not a car company.\" So I bought the stock and he was right. It became my most successful investment. I I had to keep selling it down to 5%. My cost base is zero on Tesla now.\n\n[ __ ] hell.\n\nYeah. Before it split and he worked there for 5 years.\n\nOne of the personas that I have that watches this show a lot are young people, not always young, but that are on the sofa thinking about being an entrepreneur and they talk about it a lot. You know, they they come up to me in the street.\n\nTwothirds will never do it.\n\nTwothirds will never do it.\n\nThat you you might as well do it when you have less burdensome risk like a mortgage in a family. You might as well do it in your 20s. You're going to fail the first time, maybe the second, maybe the third. You only need one success.\n\nYou I had plenty of failures and I I still have failures. I mean, it's just, you know, that one I talked about this morning. It's, you know, when I I you know, I I said to the largest shareholders as was I was in the car and your assistant was, you know, at looking at me in the limo. I was telling the other two shareholders, \"Listen, guys, it's it's a binary decision. As soon as I get out of this interview, we're going to make a decision. This company's going bankrupt.\" Oh, on the bankrupt company.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And so if we want to save it, everybody's going to have to pony up x million. And um we're going to own the whole thing. We're just going to own it all. We're going to we're just going to do a cram down round at a fraction of a cent. We're going to own the whole thing. You want to do that or you want to let it go bankrupt? You guys choose. I'm onethird of it. So it's going to have to be, you know, two against one. And I'll do whatever they want because that's how I am. But it's, you know, you want to get yourself in a position in life. I think most CEOs understand this.\n\nYou are going to have bad outcomes. There are going to be bad outcomes. But never put yourself in a situation where one bad outcome defines who you are. I mean, for those shareholders, they're going to be unhappy. But then I got the call on the IPO. Those shareholders be very happy. They're going to make 400 400x. So it and that was one of my deals. And so it's sort of like learn to live with the idea that you're going to fail. You're going to lose money by taking risk.\n\nWill it change relationships permanently? Maybe. But if there if you're respected and you're honest and you're transparent, probably not. I think there's a lot of people don't like me for my bluntness. I don't care. I think a lot of people respect me for my blindness. They may not like me and you know it's sort of um it doesn't matter because the only people that really matter to me are probably my 20iest closest friends in my family.\n\nDo you think if you hadn't worked with or known Steve Jobs you would be a different person?\n\n100%. Steve changed my life. There's no question.\n\nI didn't like him. But I feel so bad that he he didn't have to die that way.\n\nHe just wouldn't go with the modern medicine at the time is my view. Guy was a freaking genius.\n\nHe was so smart in terms of keeping on track to get getting stuff done and look what he achieved. But he was difficult.\n\nDifficult because he wasn't always right. But he was right so much that the mistakes just didn't matter.\n\nAnd I thought, you know, the people that spent enough time with him know what I'm talking about. Um, you know, it occurred to me because I know Waznjak too, not as well as Jobs, but they really needed each other. They really needed each other because W understood he was he understood what the let me draw an analogy here for you. I think it's a good one.\n\nTake the situation going on right now with Nvidia, AMD, to a certain extent Intel, um maybe Broadcom, where policymakers in Washington have decided that we can't sell those chips to countries like China or Russia or whatever the list is of adversaries. That's bad policy.\n\nAnd here's why. What I learned from from Jobs was the the computer, the chip is the queen bee. It's it's the it's the queen bee. But it has no value without the honeybees, which are the programmers around it that form a community that spend all of their energy writing code that works with the queen bee, which is the chip that pushes out its influence. Because every coder that becomes familiar with that firmware, that Bosnjak computer, writes to that platform, is part of the honeybees.\n\nJobs understood that. He said, \"I've got to get every honeybee writing for the Mac, writing for the OS of Apple.\"\n\nIt's the same with the Nvidia chip.\n\nWe need to sell it to everybody. Every even adversaries because within that country of Russia or China is some genius kid. You don't know who he is or she is that's going to write the next piece of firmware or advanced AI from the queen bee, the chip, the American queen bee. The minute you shut down a market and you don't, your adversary sends their queen bee in, which is Huawei.\n\nWe can't let that happen because I don't think the lawmakers understand what Jobs understood. You create the hive with the queen in the middle. That's the chip. You convince every bee around to make the honey, which is the software, and that is the AI in this in this case. You make it off that chip. And when you advance the chip, again, everybody knows how to take that set and stay within the American chip that you're advancing. Maybe you keep them one generation behind. Maybe maybe that's the policy. But you don't ever let an adversary put their queen bee in the middle of the hive. You see what I'm saying?\n\nOf course. I mean, and that is what Jobs did. That was the war between Gates and Jobs on the OS, on the operating system.\n\nYeah. I was thinking about the app store and yeah, it's the same thing. It's exactly the same thing. And so, so when I see this policy now, I go out of my mind. I mean, the first thing I do is get on a plane, go to Washington because AI is so important for all the investments I've made. I do not want to be putting Chinese honey into my companies at all. It's that simple. So for that person that's stewing over their ideas now, if they had just a couple of minutes with you and they and they asked you the question, Kevin, I'm about to start this business. I'm about to go on this journey of trying to go from zero to something in my life. Is there anything else that I need to know as I set upon this sort of next 10 years of my life? I'm 21 years old. What what are because I think every entrepreneur has like their principles. You you talked about one which is the signal versus noise thing. Are there any other foundational principles that you think are conducive with success that you might have learned?\n\nYeah, I mean I what I'm telling 20 21 year olds now is look, go work for 24 months in a sector you love that you're passionate about. Even if they don't pay you, go in there and be an apprentice. Um, if you're that passionate, you're going to be able to convince some manager to go work for free in there. You're just they're going to recognize your passion and they're going to bring you in. Do that first. Most young entrepreneurs say, \"Nah, nah, I don't want to work for anybody.\" I said, \"Yeah, you do actually. You you do want to work for somebody. You want to just understand how all the cogs move. Just 24 months and after that launch. The first one will probably fail. You're going to start with your parents giving you 10,000 bucks or whatever it is, friends and family. But you will have the baseline knowledge of your industry. You will know who the participants are. You will understand how it works and you'll have a much higher probability of success. But the key is to launch sort of in your in your mid to early 20s because you need to burn a few years failing and and that that matters.\n\nOn the point of how to lead people, when people hear about Jobs's approach, they sometimes assume that you also have to be an [ __ ]. And this is the this is the conflicting thing because the world has changed since Jobs was in a leadership position.\n\n\nThings have gone a little bit more soft, shall one say. Have you seen all types of leadership win out in that regard? The direct, you know, signal-focused kind of brash approach, but also the kind approach.\n\nI don't think kind works. I think respect works. I, I, the same number of [ __ ] are out there being successful now as they were back in the 90s. Um, it doesn't matter, um, whether you're an [ __ ] or whether people like you or not. I mean, people get so stuck on this stuff. It, it's the team you're building are not your friends. They are the team you're building to execute on a mandate. Your customers come first. They're more important. And then, of course, the employees and how are they respected or not. There are people that work for me I don't like. It doesn't matter. I respect them. I respect their ability to execute. And that above all is the most important thing. If you start getting into interpersonal relationships, you will fail because you may have to fire that person one day. People that hire family take huge risk. Nepotism is a horrible disease. It's, it's, uh, some of the greatest, uh, private companies on earth never let the kids run them. They just put them on the board and they hire professional management. That's how they keep wealth multigenerational.\n\nThink about a Tetrapac, for example. People may not know that name, but it's a massive successful company. IKEA, I mean, you know, it's sort of you have to learn those lessons. It's, it's, um, it's about respect in both directions. It's not about likability or softness or some social metric. It, it really isn't. And trying to redefine leadership that way because it's on trend, it's not going to work.\n\nI started my first business at 12 years old and I started more businesses at 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. And at that time, what I didn't realize is that being a founder with no money meant that I also had to be the marketeer, the sales rep, the finance team, customer service, and the recruiter. But if you're starting a business today, thankfully, there's a tool that wears all of those hats for you, our sponsor today, which is Shopify. Because of all of its AI integrations, using Shopify feels a bit like you've hired an entire growth team from day one, taking care of writing product descriptions, your website design, and enhancing your products images. Not to mention the bits you'd expect Shopify to handle, like the shipping, like the taxes, like the inventory. And if you're looking to get your business started, go to shopify.com/bartlet and sign up for a $1 per month trial. That's shopify.com/bartlet.\n\nWhat about finding the definition of the word company is group of people? So in terms of finding great people, is there anything that you can offer to entrepreneurs that are listening about how you've done that and what you've learned over time, the mistakes you've made with assembling your group of people?\n\nYeah. Hiring them without testing them first. I've made that mistake.\n\nSo, so you now test them first. Just because someone says they can execute doesn't mean they can. I mean, it's of course you're in an interview. They're not going to say I can't execute. You know, you're looking at their past. You're saying this looks terrific. Looks like you can fit in, but it's on a piece of paper. They haven't been road tested. They haven't been put in a situation where they have to make individual decisions that that have consequence. The people you want are able to make decisions that have consequence. Good, bad, good consequence, bad consequence. You don't know yet. But they have to have be able to make that decision on their own without calling you up because you gave them that mandate. Maybe you put a set of parameter, you could spend a million bucks, no more without calling me. But whatever it is, I don't want to hear from them. I just want the outcome.\n\nWhat about resilience and hard work? How much does that matter to you? Cuz I know you said they can work when you know they as long as they get the job done. But are you trying to figure out if they are a bit of a psychopath in terms of hard work, if they're possessed, obsessed?\n\nI don't find the ones that are psychopaths hard work are actually the most successful. It's not the case. I find the ones that are eclectic people that have other pursuits that are nothing to do with the business they're in that do crazy stuff. You know, maybe it's riding motorcycles in the desert. I don't know. You know, these are the examples I'm just using because I'm living with them.\n\nAnd say, \"Look, I've got to go and ride a bicycle across the desert.\" Okay. How many days you going to be gone? I don't know. Maybe three. Okay. Is there anything that is immediate? That tells me that if you look at if you look at the years outcome from that person, you're going to find that they probably outperformed. You, you, you want the eclectic ones. You want the ones that are not just robots working. It, it's going to be cheaper to get a robot if you want a robot. I'm going to buy those too when they come available. But I want people that have creative and unusual solutions that you know, just think outside of the box.\n\nIt's, it's really interesting that way. The other thing that, um, everybody wants to hear from you about is how to keep and grow your wealth because you know, making wealth. I kind of understand through the lens of entrepreneurship, take a big bet, um, hopefully have an exit or you know, draw a dividend or make profit from a company you've started. But in terms of what you did and your relationship with your money, what is the most important things for someone to understand who's just trying to grow their money?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Know I learned this from my mother and I actually built a whole indexing company around it when I was very young. I found out something, uh, that, um, so she, um, was fiercely independent. She's one of three daughters, uh, of Lebanese descent. Myth's father, my, my father, my original father, biological father was Irish. She didn't, Yeah, there she is. Geette. So, I haven't seen that picture in a while. Okay.\n\nShe was very independent and she never ever wanted a man to control her life. So she started at an early age when she was working for her father. They paid the girls. The family all worked there and she worked in the accounting department and billing, but she got paid cash and so she would take 20% of that cash each week and she would put it into two asset classes. Stocks that paid dividends, large cap stocks and telco bonds. 7-year Telco bonds paid about 6 and a half to 8% back then. She bought the long bonds and she had that portfolio for 55 years.\n\nWow.\n\nUm, she never spent any of the principal, only the dividends and the interest. She put my brother and I through college, you know, she took care of her family and her sisters when they fell on hard times. But her rule is very simple. No more than 5% in any one stock or bond of the portfolio and no more than 20% in any one sector ever. Ever. So when a stock ran up past five, she'd sell it down. This is not genius. This is just diversification.\n\nAnd when she passed and I, I was the older brother and I saw the portfolio cuz the lawyer said, \"Listen, you got to come down here. You're the executive of Will.\" And I said, \"Yeah, but you know, my mother was middle class.\" He said, \"No, you got to come down here.\" Um, she kept her account secret from both of her husbands. She wanted her own independent money and back then you could do that and, um, damn, I mean, what that portfolio did, the performance was extraordinary. It was beyond any hedge fund guy or anything, 55 years.\n\nWhen I saw the results I said that's it. That's how I'm going to invest for the rest of my life. Exactly the way Geette did. No more than 5% in any one stock ever. No ma, no matter what it is and no more than 20% in any one sector with the exception of real estate, which is a very large part of what I have in net worth and I, it's a, it's a third. So that's broken the rule, but there's reasons for that and I'm very happy with that portfolio. But, um, that if she, if, if everybody that's listening to this does that, they will maintain and grow their wealth. But it's people bet. They make big bets. They just, they think they're so damn right. They put half their net worth into one sector or one stock and they get wiped out. That's what happens.\n\nSo would your mother pick the stocks herself or would she invest in an index fund or, she indexed? She used Okay. So you can even back then, you know, they didn't have ETFs, but they had mutual funds that said their own, the only stock in this mutual fund is it doesn't have any debt and it pays dividends, you know, whatever, they were very rudimentary back then, they were just collections of stocks. I think she had like 28 names or something like that in the portfolio, but if you looked at them, they were really boring large cap names, but they were sectorally diverse. There wasn't 10 sectors back then, there was only, there, there, there wasn't 11, there was 10. So, they didn't have real estate as a sector. So, but you know, I looked at it saying, \"Wow, at least they're really boring.\"\n\nYou learned a lot about money from your early upbringing, right? From your that early context.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause what she said to me was, \"Look, you know, I, I even do this today with wealthy people call me up all the time and say, \"Look, um, you know, they get divorced. This really, this a very wealthy woman got divorced recently and she said, look, I, you know, divorcing and she was a billionaire, she was divorcing, she was more multi-billionaire and so she said, look, I, I'm getting everybody's calling me up, um, to be my advisor because I'm separating from my husband, it's all his guys that did all the management of our family wealth, would you be my adviser? I said, no, I don't do that, um, but you know, I can, I can just give you some basic advice and you and hire people that stick on the mandate. And I gave her Georgette strategy, but she, I, I had her do something else, too. I said, \"Let's get a piece of paper. You're a billionaire. Let's put everything on this piece of paper on the last 90 days that you've spent on whatever the hell it is. I don't care. And let's put on no computer, no spreadsheet on this. Let's look at all the income that you've made off your portfolio as it stands now, whether it's gold you have or land or stocks or bonds. Let's just do a a gut check on do you outspend yourself.\n\nShe said, \"Why would I give a shit?\" I said, \"Wouldn't you like to know how much money you're burning living your lifestyle the way you live it just out of interest? Maybe you have enough for the rest of your life, but maybe you want to give some of it to your family one day or give it to charity. Wouldn't you like to know?\" Because one of my rules is never outspend yourself on any 30 or 60 day cycle ever.\n\nJust ever. I don't have any debt. So, so I'm very careful about that. And we went through this little thing. She freaked out. She was pissing away money. Just bleeding hundreds of thousands of dollars a week. I mean, I don't care how rich you are, you don't want to be stupid. And I said, \"Does that shock you? One of two things has to happen. I mean, you're, you're losing millions of dollars a quarter. Like, why? Why? Like you don't, you, you've had nobody restrict what you do with your money because you're going to have to sell stocks at some point or sell gold or sell land to keep this up and are you really that happy? Like what do you, what's all this [ __ ] you're buying? Like what is all this crap that you don't need? It was a eye opener for her. So I'm my point is most people don't do that exercise. I don't care if you're only making 56,000 a year or 68, the average salary.\n\nSo, are you in the camp that you shouldn't spend money on the small things like the coffee? If you don't need it, you should make the coffee at home. Is that kind of, I, I just, I can't stand it when I see kids that are making 70 grand a year spending $28 for lunch. I mean, that's just stupid. It's just think about that in the context of that being put into an index and making 8 to 8 to 10% a year for the next 50 years.\n\nWhat's an index for someone that doesn't, So, okay. I mean, you know, I even have it. I even built an app for this purpose just so I could. There's many apps out there. You don't have to use mine. Mine's called Bean Stocks, but you just allocate 15% of your salary and it automatically puts it into two buckets. Some stocks and some bonds. The stocks are ETFs, exchange traded funds that just track the S&P 500. Very simply, mine's a little, The S&P 500 is the top 500 stocks.\n\nYeah. So, it's just, you know, people tell me, \"Oh, I can beat the S&P. I can pick stocks.\" They're so full of crap. Not over the long period they can. So, it's better you might as well just own ETFs. I have a version of the S&P that I designed with other people that strips out all the crappy balance sheets. But that's just me. You can just buy the index that you want. You know, the ETF and then you pay low fees and then over time it appreciates and then if you buy some treasury bills or what fixed income you get that you should have less of those when you're young and more of them when you're older. That's just diversification. But you, you know, the best test I do with my kids' friends too. Go into a closet. Go into your closet and look at how much [ __ ] you have you don't wear because you either bought it because you thought you were going to wear it and never wore it or wore it once and you end up wearing 20% of your portfolio all of the time and 80% you\n\n\nYou pissed away. I mean, that's really stupid. And so for a young person, a young woman or man, don't do that. Start putting and just buy the minimum stuff. And another thing I learned from my mother, this is interesting because I saw it happen at her death. She, you know, would buy two Chanel jackets a year, really expensive Chanel jackets, handmade Chanel jackets. I do business with Chanel because of, you know, the legacy of my mother and the whole Coco Chanel thing and watches. I love those guys. And her theory was this will never get old. And it never did. A classic vintage Chanel jacket from the 50s that's well-kept is worth a fortune today. The classic, it still wears beautifully. They're so well made. So, she wouldn't buy crap. She'd buy really good stuff, but a little, just small amounts of it. And over the years, she'd built up this portfolio of amazing clothing. And when she died, the women in our family had a cat fight over her portfolio. Unbelievable.\n\nIs that in part why you have so many watches? I've noticed you have a watch on either wrist right now.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty big in watches. I mean, but watches to me, every piece I have marks something in my life that was important. A deal, a child, graduation, um, you know, something. Every piece. I've got a lot of watches.\n\nHow many have you got?\n\nI, I don't even say anymore because of the insurance policy I have. I got a lot.\n\nDo you invest in... You're talking about your mother's investing strategy, and one of the things you said is she invested in dividend stocks.\n\nYes. What is a dividend stock and should I be investing in dividend stocks?\n\nYeah, I mean, you know, a company if it's profitable and it's operating, its business plan is working, and it's growing market share at some point says, \"I'm going to distribute some of the success of our profits to our shareholders.\" That's a dividend. And so they send that cash to you and you can either redeploy it in other ways or live off it or whatever. Many tech stocks until recently did not pay dividends. But now the behemoth tech stocks do pay dividends because the demand of an aging population is, \"I need to eat,\" and so I like to own the stock for growth, but I also want to get some of the profits, and so dividend-paying stocks, uh, used to be utilities, uh, but not so today. Every sector has dividend-paying stocks. So I prefer to own dividend-paying stocks, div payers, and then I also own fixed income products. I also own crypto now, and I own alternative assets like gold and watches. My watch collection's actually done quite well, even though there's been a correction. There's volatility, but I have some watches that have, you know, I bought for $200,000 that are worth over a million today.\n\nCrypto. So, are you still bullish on crypto as an investment?\n\nYeah, I am actually, but people get crypto confused with its real potential. Um, uh, let's talk about digital payment systems because what's about to pass, first, we're days away from this happening, is the Genius Act, which is actually the Stablecoin Act. It was just passed by the Senate 48 hours ago. It's going back to the House. I, I actually worked on that bill two years ago. So, if that bill passes, it's really nothing to do with speculating on crypto. It's a new form of payment. So, if I wanted to order a watch in, uh, from Simone Brit, who's somebody I buy watches from. He's a master watchmaker. Right now, I have to take US dollars, I've got to get through a know your client prerogative. Um, I'm treated like a criminal by transferring $100,000 over. Turn it into Swiss Franks. Takes about a week. I get screwed for about 200 basis points in the whole thing. If I, if he accepted USDC, which is actually a stable coin back with the US dollar, just went public, very successful IPO. I was a shareholder in that company, too. That's one of my best IPOs in the last two years. The transaction would happen in less than a second and the fees would be a hundredth of what the costs are right now. So it's a digital payment system. The price doesn't... it's not... it's no speculation on it's backed by the US dollar treasury bills. So it's sort of a new form of digital payment. That's different than Bitcoin, which is a speculation. It's if you believe in Bitcoin, you think it's a digital gold and you live through the volatility. I believe in both. I believe that that crypto will be the 12th sector of the S&P in some period of time because it provides productivity to all 11 other sectors. So the way I own it is I own the exchanges. My exchange in one called Wonderfy up in Canada just got acquired last week or two weeks ago by Robin Hood. I'm happy because I think Vlad who runs Robin Hood's great and now he's got a million plus accounts in Canada and market that he never participated in. But the point is this is never going away. It's going to stay forever. So how do you participate? You can buy some Bitcoin just like you can buy gold, buy it in an ETF or actually own it yourself. You can buy the exchanges. You can use, um, you know, you can buy Circle stock now, it's public. You can Circle makes USDC. You can buy USDC in an account and make 4.1% interest on it right now. So, there's a lot of ways to participate, but yes, I'm here to stay, but I've grown up. I was around during the period where the crypto cowboys lived and and I survived that all and I even testified in front of the Senate and the House and whatever else the testimonies were during the tumultuous period and most of those guys went to jail.\n\nYour portfolio in terms of Bitcoin allocation or crypto allocation, what is it now?\n\nIt's at about all in. Uh, we, we marked to market last month, it was 19.1%.\n\n19.1%.\n\nYeah. We have to keep it under 20. It's a sector. So but remember in that is the cryptos itself, Bitcoin, the USDC and the shares of the infrastructure companies like Circle and everything else. I've got, you know, it was a very successful IPO. One of the first things most people do when they get a bit of money, usually from their job, is they get a mortgage on a house because we're kind of taught as we grow up that the best way to make or the, the not maybe the best, but the most obvious way to create wealth is to buy your first home.\n\nYeah, there's a very basic rule for that and I understand it and I did the same thing. But what I made sure again from my mother was never let the mortgage and the cost of maintaining the house be more than one-third of your income. One-third of your income. If it's more than one-third, you bought too much house. So it's better to buy a house that's maybe it's only going to be 1,900 square feet to start in a neighborhood that you may not want to stay for the rest of your life, but start to accrue the benefit of real estate from that point of view. Learn how to manage it. Maybe you rent part of it out or whatever, but it can't be more than a third of your income. The mistake that people made, and they're starting to suffer from it now, is when money was so cheap, mortgage mortgage rates were under 4%, they were 3.2% some of them, they bought massive houses. And now they're running into having to refinance those houses at much higher rates, more than 7%. And it's becoming 60, 70, 80% of their income. They're screwed. They bought too much house. So, it's about making sure that you can manage that. And also you want some diversification. Yes, a mortgage is okay, particularly if you're having a family because you're going to pay rent or you're gonna pay a mortgage, one of the two. But you want some diversification in starting to build up that investment account for when you retire so that you have something to live off. If you only put aside 15% if you're you're making 70,000 a year and you put 15% aside from when you're 25, you'll have over a million and a half dollars if you just invested it in the stock index in the S&P 500. That's what that's what history has told you.\n\nIn what time frame?\n\nYour whole career. I mean, you're going to be 65, you're 25, 65. You just stick with that protocol and you'll watch it grow. You'll watch it grow. You go up and down as the market goes up and down. Some years it'll go flat, whatever. But it's the people that don't even think ahead and find themselves at 45 mired in debt, including a mortgage. You want to get rid of your mortgage in your 40s.\n\nMost people's primary investment asset is the house they buy.\n\nIs that...\n\nYes, it is. But it's also the debt they own. It's a primary asset. How much debt does it have on it? It's only the equity value is the asset. So, if you're buying a house that's too big and it's you've only put down 10% and it's 90% mortgage, what do you really own? You really own the 10% at whatever price it is. Sometimes housing goes flat for a while. It's it's okay, but it's not okay if it's too much house.\n\nIf you're a 25-year-old and you're on that 70k that you talked about, and your objective was to make money, you don't have kids, you don't you're not in a relationship, would you buy a house?\n\nNo. No, I wouldn't because why do I need a house if I'm only unless I'm renting as an income property? I'm buying a house because I'm getting married. I'm going to raise a family. I need a house. I mean,\n\nIs that the use case for buying a house? You think?\n\nI think it is. People, but it's not. There are many people that say, \"I love real estate. I'm going to buy three houses. I'm going to rent them out.\" That's a different business. And I know people in their 20s that do that. In fact, they're successful. That's all they do. And so, that their job is to find houses, buy them, fix them up, and rent them. And they manage that geographically tight portfolio. It happens a lot in student housing. For example, got a good friend who's involved in student housing. He's very successful. He just focuses on one aspect, buildings that rent to students and he manages it and he, you know, raises a family. He's successful, but that's one thing he does. That's not the same as saying, \"I'm going to buy a house cuz I'm I just got married and I'm going to raise I'm going to have a child in the next 24 months.\" Then you should have a house. But if you're you said to me, \"I'm single. I want to make money.\" I wouldn't buy a house. That's not the number one asset class. I think I'd get a diversified portfolio and just ride the pony with that for a while until I meet that special person I'm going to, you know, raise a family with and then I have a little nest egg I can work with.\n\nI mean, wealth creation comes down to one word, discipline. That's it. The ability to look at something and say, \"I'm not going to buy that. I'm going to keep that money working for me.\" Not many people have that discipline. Wealthy people have that discipline. You meet them later in life, you realize when they were young and had nothing, even the ones that were employees their whole lives that are now financially free had the discipline to say no. There's so much stuff you don't need. And you should never buy a watch unless you can afford it. Ever go on debt for a watch because people hear this stuff say, \"I'm going to buy watches like with red bands.\" No, you're not. That's why I wear watches now that cost under $500 to show kids you want to get into horology. You don't have to spend, you know, $50,000. Here's a here's a Timex for $265. It looks beautiful. Get that.\n\nYou said, uh, you know, don't buy the house until you meet your partner, etc. How much does the person that you fall in love with have an impact on your finances, your money, your chance of success in your view?\n\nIt's everything. Are you kidding? I mean, it's it's everything. If you read... I mean, think about this. You you need to find somebody if you're an entrepreneur. So that's for the... we're talking about the third now that want to go on the rocket ship ride. You better find somebody that's willing to tolerate the fact that you're never home for the first 10 years. They're going to raise a family by themselves because there's no balance in life. That that idea of balance is complete [ __ ] I mean, it's just [ __ ] You have to work so hard to compete globally these days in every sector. You're going to work your ass off and it's not going to happen over... I mean, Anna Sky did it in three years, but she had worked much harder previously. It was not her first deal, but she was just lucky. I mean, she... was this the cat DNA cat thing? I mean, she's she... but she's, you know, she's she's working again, she's back, she wants to work. I mean, that's what happens, you never stop working, but the thing is that partnership... and this is what people don't get about marriage... marriage. Marriage is a business. I know people go nuts when I say that, but it's a business. And the first child you're going to have is money. It's going to be the first child, and it's going to sit at the table with you every day. It's it's there sitting there. If you don't have money, you don't have a marriage. I mean, the reason people get married is to form a form of financial stability so that they can afford a family. And you have to figure out, you know, I'm I'm I've been with my wife a long time and we've been separated for a couple of years, but you know, family is very important to me. So, I... we got back together again. We, you know, our daughter got us back together. I'm very happy we did it. But it's... we make financial decisions together. We we always check in, you know, anything that's material, you know, if we're going to do a renovation...\n\n\nor something.\n\nAnd I respect her for that.\nI have a lot of respect for her because she doesn't just spend money.\nWe didn't have any money when we started.\nWe had nothing.\nAnd so that's why a great marriage can work because you build it together.\nYou really care about it.\nYou care about your family.\nYou also care about what you've created in wealth.\nAnd I consider my money her money.\nYou like because she was the family that let me go and do this stuff.\nNow I don't have the same relationship with our kids that she does because she raised them.\nBut that's the thing you give up and you have to give something up.\nThat's it.\nYou can be a great father, a great provider, but you're never going to have the closest that she had reading them stories when they were young.\nI wasn't there.\nBut, you know, the outcome has been good.\nI think everybody looks at that and says, \"All right, that's great.\"\n\nBut my mother never believed in entitlement.\nAnd so, I don't believe in it either.\nI'm not gifting my kids a ton of money.\nYou know, I want them to launch, and they've done that successfully.\nThey got to work.\nYou know, they got to do their thing.\nI've heard you say before that the most important financial decision you'll ever make is who you'll marry.\nYes.\nWhy?\nBecause think of the geometric loss of wealth.\nEvery time you get divorced, you pay the woman that you divorced or man and you pay the government a third often through capital gains and liquidation because you can't separate all the assets without liquidating them sometimes.\nSo, you've got the government sitting there.\nYou've got the other spouse sitting there.\nThis is the stupidest thing you can ever do.\nIt took your whole life to actually create this nest egg.\nCould be, you know, you're 45 or whatever.\nYou've got a comfortable life and all of a sudden you don't like your wife or husband.\nThink about that for a while because you are going to wipe out up to two-thirds of your wealth.\nYou better really like somebody else a lot.\nAnd frankly, sometimes it's not the other person that you're divorcing.\nIt's you.\nYou're the problem.\nIf you're getting married for the third time, you're a guy or woman.\nIt's not them.\nIt's you.\nThere's something wrong with you.\nAnd you should probably not get into another economic union.\nYou should probably just date till you drop dead because it's stupid.\nMarriages are tough.\nI mean, they're tough.\nAnybody who's been married for more than 20 years knows exactly what I'm talking about.\nBut they have they accrue more benefit than than you know anything.\nSo if as long if you're happy 51% of the day with your wife, stay with him or her husband or wife.\nYou that's very important.\nHow often do you think divorces are a result of money issues?\nWell, you may be shocked at this.\nI wrote a book um about this and I decided uh men and women of money a long time ago, 10 years plus.\nRight there it is.\nAnd I did some research and I I uh went to meet some of the top um divorce lawyers in North America, in New York, in Boston, and other cities.\nAnd I said, \"Look, I I want to kind of do a pie chart of reasons for divorce that seemed 50% seem to end divorce within 5 to seven years.\"\nEvery one of them, they didn't know each other, said, \"It's not infidelity.\nNothing to do with it.\nMost marriages can survive infidelity.\nThey can't survive financial stress.\nAnd so what happens invariably is you fall in love, but you didn't do any due diligence on that person's spending habits or their financial history because La More is so wonderful in the early days.\nYou didn't do any diligence on their family or them or their brother or bankruptcy in the past or whatever it is.\nAnd then you get married and you know the euphoria starts to wear off and you notice that the other is outspending you just buying a lot of stuff beyond your means.\nAnd that starts the first friction.\nAnd then that credit card comes in with $100,000 on it at 23% interest and another purse was bought or whatever the hell it is.\nAnd you're you're starting to sink because you may have married somebody who can't stop spending.\nThis is just a typical there are people that can't have no discipline.\nThey just can't.\nThey got to have the boat.\nThey got to have this.\nThey got to have that.\nAnd they pressure their other to say, \"Look, I want to keep up with the Joneses next door, even though they may only each have a salary of 100 grand each.\nCan't do it.\"\nAnd they have kids and they're trying to put them through college.\nThat's divorce.\nThat's why almost 90% of of unions break up is is is that classic financial pressure and divorce gets them out of that mess because they can no longer spend on your credit card anymore.\nBut it's a horrible way to go.\nSo I, you know, I'm an investor in a company called Hello Prenup that does divorces for does um uh prenups for women and prenups forced during the euphoric period diligence.\nIt's that simple.\nYou're going to find out if that person has a financial problem going into the marriage.\nThey have to disclose their financial background.\nSo, you talk about these five love languages of money.\nThe mooch, someone who won't pay for anything, right?\nShould I date someone like that?\nIt's a warning signal.\nIt's a problem.\nIt's a problem.\nSo, or they don't really want you for companionship.\nThey just want you for financial support.\nThe spender holic.\nSomeone who always offers to pay for everything to appear popular and successful.\nBad morning sign.\nHuge.\nI mean that isn't that is insecurity measurable by cash outlay.\nThe loafer.\nSomeone who has no ambition and drive for money.\nA void with extreme prejudice.\nThe thief.\nSomeone who steals.\nYou can have no tolerance for that.\nAnd the meanie.\nA balanced spender who lives within their means.\nLove that.\nMarry a meanie.\nThat's it.\nThat's the Those are the marriages that last an entire life.\nThat's it.\nThat's what you're looking for.\nThat's great advice right there.\nWhatever the book costs, that's that's the best value right there.\nAnd then ask yourself, am I dating one of these or not?\nYou know, you know, you should talk about money on the third date.\nThink about a date.\nThink about dating.\nFirst date, oh my goodness, this is a really interesting person.\nUm or not, then there's never a second date.\nSecond date.\nI want to learn more.\nI'm really interested.\nYou're going into a third date.\nThere's something going on.\nThere's something going on.\nYou both want to meet again.\nThat's the first time you should say, \"Look, I know this is crazy, but we're here together a third time because something's going on here, and I'm just wondering what are your long-term goals?\nI mean, it's not about our marriage or anything else other than we're having a great time, but what are your ambitions?\nI'm really interested in you.\nI'd like to know what you think.\nAnd the maybe the woman says or the guy says, \"What are you checking me out?\"\nYou say, \"Yeah, yeah, I'm really interested in you.\"\nIt's a form of finding out if the connection, you know, I I should be a marriage counselor.\nThat's what I think.\nI mean, it's it's really dating is is the is the dance, but it should involve exploring where we're going financially.\nFor many years, you've probably seen this iPad sat in front of me.\nYou've probably wondered what's on it.\nAnd I'm going to tell you today because they're now our show sponsor thankfully.\nIt's an app called GoodNotes and it's where I store all of my research, all of my information, but also where I take notes in real time when the guest is speaking to me.\nI love this app because it's so dynamic, but also because of this new feature which is called Ask Goodnotes.\nIt's basically my AI companion.\nI can search the 200 pages sometimes of notes and information that I have in front of me in just seconds.\nI can type into the ask goodnotes feature, what was the name of Kevin's mother?\nI'm speaking to Kevin O'Leary on the podcast.\nHe starts talking about his mother.\nI have a couple of seconds to figure out what she's called so I can ask him a question about her in a polite way.\nAsk GoodNotes looks through all of my notes, responds back to me in seconds.\nIf you're someone that loves taking notes, but your notes are a mess and you can't read your own handwriting, i.e. me, I think GoodNotes might be the solution for you.\nAnd ask GoodNotes, which is their new AI feature, might just be the tool that turns you into an organized person.\nThat's certainly how it feels for me.\nSo, I asked GoodNotes if they would give my listeners a 30-day free trial to try it out.\nAnd they've given us one on iOS and Mac.\nSo, if you want to use that 30-day free trial, go to goodnotes.com/doac or sign up now for your yearly subscription for just $9.99 per year.\nThat's $9.99 per year.\nGo to goodnotes.com/doac.\nI've built companies from scratch and backed many more.\nAnd there's a blind spot that I keep seeing in early stage founders.\nThey spend very little time thinking about HR.\nAnd it's not because they're reckless or they don't care.\nIt's because they're obsessed with building their companies, and I can't fault them for that.\nAt that stage, you're thinking about the product.\nHow to attract new customers, how to grow your team, really, how to survive.\nAnd HR slips down the list because it doesn't feel urgent, but sooner or later it is.\nAnd when things get messy, tools like our sponsor today, Justworks, go from being a nice to have to being a necessity.\nSomething goes sideways, and you find yourself having conversations you did not see coming.\nThis is when you learn that HR really is the infrastructure of your company, and without it, things wobble.\nAnd Just Work stops you learning this the hard way.\nIt takes care of the stuff that would otherwise drain your energy and your time, automating payroll, health insurance benefits, and it gives your team human support at any hour.\nIt grows with your small business from startup through growth, even when you start hiring team members abroad.\nSo, if you want HR support that's there through the exciting times and the challenging times, head to justworks.com now.\nThat's just.com.\nOne of the big uh protagonists in the story of many things we've discussed, money, investing, building businesses now is this thing called artificial intelligence which you mentioned earlier.\nYes.\nIt's like entered the room.\nYes.\nAnd it's changing lots of these equations in a really profound way.\nAgain, for that person who is maybe at the start of their career or even, you know, they're they're a lawyer right now.\nHow are you thinking about AI?\nWhat should they be thinking about?\nBecause I don't think we've seen something quite like this.\nNot certainly not in my lifetime.\nI've not seen disruption of this scale.\nI wasn't around for the com boom.\nI was too when I was 10 or something.\nI was eight.\nYeah.\nSo, so how should we be thinking about this moment?\nIs it a huge opportunity for wealth creation or\nYeah, it's immense.\nIt's bigger than the internet.\nAnd I'll tell you why.\nI want to keep it down to earth.\nUh because um I'm actually using it now in use cases.\nThere's every sector of the economy, every aspect of research, every aspect of business has a huge opportunity here.\nBut let's just take use cases that you would understand, everybody listening would understand.\nIn today's post pandemic world, most businesses have developed large and small direct to consumer strategies where they try and build relationships with customers and sell them product direct.\nYeah, they still use retail.\nSay you're Nike or something.\nAnd um you you were 27% uh you know direct to consumer before the pandemic.\nYou're now 50%.\nAnd direct to consumer gets you higher margins, but it also gets you data.\nGets you information about the preferences of your customer base.\nWhat they like, what they don't like, the flavors, and what they buy, when they buy, where they buy it, all that stuff.\nAnd it's very interesting that data.\nAnd let me give you an example.\nWine business.\nIf you think about the wine business, the challenge of a thousand-y old business, you don't know what the weather's going to be like.\nYou don't know what varietals to to to grow because you don't know what the preference of the customer is because you're selling it through multiple tiers of distribution.\nDuring the pandemic, 43 states in America opened up direct to consumer sales from the wineries in the West Coast.\nFor the first time ever, the wineries found out, what people buy, where they buy it, when they buy it, what they drink, what varietals.\nAnd I'm in the wine business.\nI sell three million bottles a year of wine.\nOne of my companies, actually, a Shark Tank company.\nUm, and we partner with a company called uh QVC.\nWe sell online and and so I can tell you today, this month, this week, the number one varietal in Southern Florida for women ages 44 to 64 is Mosscato, a sweet wine.\nI think it tastes like [ __ ] I don't care what I think.\nIt's the number one wine right now.\nAnd I knew that to to make that varietal available six months ago so that I would be able to ship it and put the inventory, the capex in the right place at the right time to support that demand for the rest of this summer.\nA sweet cold Mosscato wine.\nThat means I spent a lot less money, a lot less risk.\nI don't have any varietals they don't want this summer.\nI have exactly what they want.\nThat was AI.\nIt cost me virtually nothing to get that data.\nFive, 10 years ago, it would have cost me a million bucks to go do all the market research.\nI got that for $18,000.\nSo that's using an AI tool.\nHere's another example.\nSo do I use that tool?\n100%.\nAnd there's many tools.\nYou don't have to just use chat.\nThere's many different competing platforms.\nSo we use them all.\nWe check the assumptions by checking it all on all of them.\nSee the little variances.\nNumber\n\n\nTwo, I have to shoot an ad. I have to shoot a commercial.\n\nI'm going to shoot it here in LA. I'm going to do it in a studio like this with a green screen. And um, I'm going to spend, you know, $250,000 for a 30, you know, 15, a 30, and a 60 out of the same shoot. And I'm then going to go into post with the green screen, and I'm going to spend more money in post. I'm going to add whatever I need, whatever background I'm going to need.\n\nOr I could fly to Dubai where they have a giant studio with a 6K digital wall where AI links up your script to the background. There is no post-production. You basically shoot the commercial in 4 hours, and it's done. The background's perfect. The imagery is perfect. Your script is perfect. And I did that two weeks ago for the first time. I'd never seen that before. We did it for a fraction of the cost of what it would have cost to do it in the old way in post-production.\n\nBut then I'll tell you what freaked me out. They reshot the commercial without me there using an AI view. I wasn't even there, and just to show that they could produce a new commercial with the same background for $9,000 that would have cost 400,000 from scratch. So there's going to be a lot of job disruption then because as you said, you don't say, but on the other hand, I've now got content for that particular business I was shooting that, you know, I've got content for that particular business I was going to shoot that commercial for, and I said, \"Guys, let's tweak it and shoot it again.\" He said, \"Yeah, we'll do it in two seconds. We'll send you the 15 seconds back.\" I said, \"I, I, I don't like what I said there. Can I change what I said?\" \"Yeah. Well, do you want it in Spanish? You want it in Japanese? You want it in Arabic?\"\n\nThat's the power. The productivity that we're going to get, we're going to our budgets for producing content are going to drop dramatically over the next and software and everything else, right? Creating everything is going to get.\n\nNow, full circle to your thing about the chips that all came from Nvidia chips that, not that's not from Chinese chips. Whoever controls the chip and the honeybees, that the honeybees are those guys are all Indians and Pakistanis. They're genius mathematicians. That's the team over there running off that platform. If we had let, anyways, I don't want to, I'm just freaked out that we got to control that. We, we need democracy to control that.\n\nYour children, what are you saying to them though about their professional ambitions in a world where creating stuff like that, and you know, whether it's who do you want to do your taxes, an accountant or an AI? Who do you want to do your legal documents? Who do you want to do your any sort of like white-collar job, your make your videos, edit your videos? I, I tell them, you know, everybody's got a lot of angst with AI. I, I tell them, \"Listen, everybody chillax. It's a tool. You know, it's the same classic thing where radio was going to be displaced by television. Radio's bigger than it ever has been. It, it just, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThe one thing I concern myself with with AI is warfare. And I think the country that has the best AI and data centers and the most advanced chip technology will win the wars of the future, which will be fought by drones and robots. I know that sounds kind of crazy.\n\nNo, it doesn't sound crazy. That's where it's happening now. That's where it's going to go. So, so when I when I solicit the ear of a senator, I try and explain to them my honeybee analogy saying this is about defense. I don't want to live under authoritarian. You know, I know we debate the whole political environment these days, but I don't want to live around Chinese honey. I just don't. And those are going to be the two superpowers. You both, you're in one vertical. Either you let the Chinese make the honey on AI, or we make the honey and let the Chinese buy some honey from us. I know where I want to live. I know what I want to do. And I think I can convince a lot of senators the same idea because you got to understand the Wnjak jobs analogy that we that you brought out earlier. That was the genius of Jobs. Make the honey but know who the queen bee is.\n\nThe genius of Jobs brings me to a question I've wanted to ask someone like you for a long, long time, which is, do you think Apple is dead?\n\nNo.\n\nNo, you don't.\n\nNo. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. You know, it's so interesting. Uh, people don't understand the genius of Apple because this is again came from Jobs, you know, he used to say to my team over and over again, and I mentioned it earlier, \"They don't know what they want until I tell them,\" and I always just, just as close as you and I are right now, you're Steve, say, \"Steve, how the [ __ ] do you know that? How do you know that? You don't know that. You don't know what you don't.\" No. He said, \"Show me where I'm wrong. Show me one instance of us working together. I'm wrong.\" I said, \"It hasn't happened yet, Steve. Doesn't mean it won't. Get back to work. Don't worry about it. I'll worry about it. You make the software. I have the chips. Make the software. Go make the honey. I have the queen bee. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nAnd that is pretty interesting because you got to prove it that he was wrong. Let's take, let's accelerate. He's dead now. But the philosophy of Apple, and I'll give you the the way you win at, you look at it. I can go buy a $330 laptop right here with the same processing power of this $1,800 Mac laptop. Why would I been spend 1,800 when I could buy this for 300? Why brand? I want to be part of this universe. This honey right over here, the Apple Care, the fact that the OS works on all the platforms and the messages are shown on all platforms simultaneously, all the OS, all the honey, that platform is the power of brand. It's I'm not leaving this universe, and Apple is one of the world's largest companies. And you may say, \"Oh, an innovation is going to make everybody leave that platform.\" I don't think so. They let other people sometimes bring in a new market, and then they take it over. And I saw Steve do that multiple times. He did it um with the phone. I was around for that. That was crazy. I mean, he had the vision that we would someday run our software on the phone. I said, \"You're out of your mind. The screen's too small.\" He said, \"No, you're going to go vertical. You're going to rewrite all this crap vertically.\"\n\nI mean, I can't fault him on anything. Although I kept telling him, \"You're going to get it wrong one day. You're not going to be right all the time.\" I can't find when he wasn't right. That, that's that's the frustration because I teach this, you know, to a har bunch of really smart kids at Harvard, of which by the way, a third are international students, and they say, \"Well, when did you catch him?\" I said, \"He didn't.\"\n\nWhat was he doing? Was did he have a practice or or principles that allowed him to see around the corner? He spent a lot of time at night um, you know, even studying fonts and looking at art and um, focusing on the signal. I think his wife talked about that a lot. He, I mean, she spent more time with him than anybody else. Although W talks about a lot because those guys spent countless hours together, and but but Jobs defined, he would take instances from nature into his head or from Japanese, you know, scripture or text or imagery and redefine it into technology in a way that no one else was doing. And that's the idea of the honey and the bee and the queen and all that stuff. It kind of comes from his view of the world. And I don't know if you can understand this, but because it was so, it came from nature, it was easy for people to assimilate it. It wasn't foreign. When they looked at the imagery and the design, he he tried to pull from from pleasing images from nature, like the fonts on the first Max. I remember when we were writing the code for that saying, \"Steve, this is not what people are used to seeing on a computer screen.\" He said, \"No, it isn't. That's why it's going to work.\" He, if you think about the very first scalable fonts, I saw that first. And I said, \"See, this is this is almost foreign.\" He said, \"Well, how's it make you feel?\" I said, \"Makes me feel pretty good. This looks like it's on a piece of paper. If you, I don't, you weren't even born when this stuff was happening, but it was, it, he was so far ahead, and this is the same way Elon is redefining whether it's, you know, SpaceX or whether it's what he's doing in neurosurgery or Tesla or, you know, all of these initiatives, uh, you know, his satellite technologies, they are the same, those guys, except, you know, Elon's 100% signal, I said that earlier, they are the same, and they should be their treasures, their national treasures. It doesn't matter if you like them. It doesn't matter what their politics are is irrelevant, the contributions they're making to society and to America, frankly, and the competitive competitive nature of of of countries. That's why I thought it was so important that Trump make up with Elon. The the most powerful man on earth should have a a very good relationship with the most, the richest man on earth because he's the largest industrialist on earth. Maybe there's like an inherent inability by way of them being who you just said they are, the most powerful.\n\nBut they know they're smart enough to know. It's the same way I felt about Jobs. I'm getting back on the plane this quarter. I know he's going to beat me up, but it doesn't matter. It, it's the greater good is that we get this software out there advancing math and reading scores.\n\nWas he happy, Steve?\n\nI don't know the answer to that question.\n\nDo you think he was a happy person?\n\nI don't know. He, I've never, I never saw him happy. He was always barking at me. I never saw him happy. I don't think I ever saw him laugh. I don't, he may not have been, you know, that, I mean, that's probably something his wife would know, but he looked like a tortured guy to me, but um, you know, that may have been his curse. I, you know, some, some, do you love him?\n\nYeah, I can see it in your face 100%. I saw a lot of emotion in your face the first time you spoke about him, and I thought that's surprising for someone that barked at you.\n\nWell, he respected me, that's for sure. He wouldn't execute on my ideas. He expected me to execute on his, but he was never wrong.\n\nWhere did the emotions stem from?\n\nOh, you know, it brings me back into that room with Heidi Rosen and all the crazy crap. I mean, it was just nuts. And you know, the, you know, I'd have to spend a lot of time. The only, the only meeting I really remember um, the, the one that's really sticks in my mind when we were in Certino, and we were just, I think, I don't know, we were going after him for 18 million or something, and Heidi was there.\n\nWho's Heidi?\n\nHeidi Rosen. Um, she's a famous um, venture capitalist, but she was also kind of the muse, the person that could actually deal with Jobs all day long at Apple and bring him back to Earth when he was out of his mind. I'll give you an example of how that would work. And I've seen her since, you know, it's, it's, it's, I don't even know if she remembers this particular. Anyways, we leave. He's barking at me. He's, and he's got one of my product managers in tears because she wanted to do the market research, and he said, \"No way. I, we're just going to do what I say.\" And she just felt like her job was useless. And, and for him it was. I mean, he just didn't give a [ __ ] what she thought. Although she ran the universe of the Oregon Trail or something. It's a massive title, like a huge multi-million dollar title on the Mac in every 110,000 schools in America. And he, he was so pissed that, you know, in these old buildings, they have the little window where you have a little knob, and it only opens up four inches so you can't jump out of it in a hotel or something. So we were, we had a Herz rental, and we're the whole team's going out. I'm going to drive the car back to San Francisco. I'm going to fly back to Boston, and he, he undoes the window, and he's got his head stuck, and there's yelling at me from, from, I'm looking up at him saying, you know, what the [ __ ] like, what? Like, what, what more can we, we, you already kicked us out, you know? And then on the way, we had these old brick, the earliest cell phones, these brick phones. Heidi calls me, says, \"Okay, he'll do it for 12 million.\" I said, \"Heidi, why do we have to go through all that [ __ ]? Like, why do we even have to get abused?\" She said, \"Why is the sky blue?\" you know, just get back on the plane and go do it. It was a huge hit. Like it just, you know, it's a huge hit. Like it's just the guy was, if you looked at it like, uh, he, he could, he could write the hit songs. That's what he did. He write the hit songs. So you don't even if you hate the producer, you want the the guy that can do the hit songs, right? If you're an artist, you put up with a crazy producer.\n\nCould he not have been nice? Do you think?\n\nNot in his DNA.\n\nNo. Do you think if he, he was a nice person, he wouldn't, you know what he would say about that, that's noise, he gives a [ __ ]. Yeah, he doesn't give a [ __ ]. Noise being nice is noise that for him. I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about him, but I.\n\n\nI think there's a lot of lessons learned from him that I think managers today, parents today, certainly CEOs today, uh, you know, you're, you're about this show is about CEOs.\n\nI wish every CEO had spent the time, the minimal time that I spent with Steve Jobs had such an impact on me.\nI mean, it, it, I, I owe a lot of my success to him because I think I always think, what would Steve have done?\nAnd I make decisions like that.\nIt's amazing.\nThe guy's still around.\nI bet you if you talk to, you know, any of the management at Apple, they, they have that ghost in those rooms for sure, including the current CEO, who I think was doing a phenomenal job.\nHe, he spent so many hours with Jobs.\nHe knows exactly what I'm talking about.\nNobody spent more time in business than that guy for sure.\n\nI asked you a second ago if Steve Jobs was happy, but are you happy?\nI get happier the older I get because, um, I've, I'm very comfortable.\nI found a place, um, you know, uh, that I'm, and I, this may be just what aging does.\nI mean, it just, you know, in, and when I was in my 30s, I had a lot of trauma and turmoil and, and just, you know, um, hard time to find, trying to figure out who I was.\nAnd I also suffered from dyslexia, which I've come to think of as a superpower now, not an affliction, but it, it was kind of like, it's hard to know what journey you're going to be on until you find it.\nAnd then I found it, and then I started on a new journey.\nAnd, and, you know, it's, um, it's something where, you know, you ask yourself every day goes by, and you know, this, the noise and signal thing, and how much of this day was I happy doing the things that I wanted to do?\nAnd I am very happy if, if I measure it by, is there anything that I spend my time doing that I don't want to do today?\nThe answer is no because I don't have to do, and so I don't waste my time.\nI do, you know, even coming here to spend two hours with you.\nWhen I first, you know, heard about it, I went online and said, \"Oh, yeah.\nThis guy, this guy's great.\nI'd love to work with him.\"\nYou know, that kind of thing.\nYou, you allocate your time.\nThis is, this is, I'm happy to do this.\nI want to be here.\nAnd I think, you know, we had a very interesting couple hours together.\nBut that's the definition of happiness.\nWhat concerns me, and my wife often says to me, \"We don't need any more money.\nWhy are, why are you flying 300 hours a year on an airplane?\nWhat are you doing?\"\nI said, \"I'm happy.\"\nLike, you know, I'm, I'm happy doing this.\nI want to do this stuff.\nYou know, I sometimes I do five cities in a day.\nIt's freaking crazy.\nAnd it's the wonderful thing about, you know, air travel today.\nYou can do that.\nBut it's, it's sport for you.\nIt's, it's, it's so interesting.\nI get so many interesting opportunities.\nI can't turn them down.\nThey're just such, you know.\n\nAre you driven or are you dragged?\nYou know, you use the word trauma there.\nAnd I often ask myself that question because I, I came from a all-white area.\nI was the black kid with the strange hair and the strange family.\nI was insecure.\nAnd I think that resulted in this, this force of will to try and correct the insecurity or to prove something to myself, which then resulted in success.\nI, I think there is no drag.\nThere's only driven.\nI don't understand being dragged.\nDragged insinuates that you don't care about performance.\nYou don't care whether you succeed or not.\nYou're just being sucked into the void of success.\nYou might be able to say that for a rock star that gets a hit song, but, um, most of them doesn't last.\nI, you need massive amounts of, of drive.\nAnd I love the most, the most exciting thing I like to do is when someone tells me, you can't do that, like watch insurance.\nYou will never launch a watch insurance company.\nIt, you will never do that.\nYou will never get around the compliance state by state.\nYou will never launch in the Middle East.\nYou'll never launch in England.\n[ __ ] That's exactly what I did.\nI found the right team.\nI found the right partners.\nI figured it out.\nI, I was passionate about it.\nAnd I think I'm going to kick ass.\nI think I'm, I think in two or three years from now you won't be able to catch up with me.\nThat's what I think.\n\nI'm 32 years old.\nWhat, what is the advice that you wish you got at 32 years old?\nKevin, what I have learned, and this is something that you should really think about for yourself.\nYour real value, your real brand are your followers, this army of people that have decided to invest their time in you.\nYou know, you've cut across a, a vast swath of people.\nSo you influence very successful managers, CEOs, and a lot of young entrepreneurs want to hear what you have to say because they, they're expecting you to deliver valuable information across multiple sectors, and you also have your own data, but men and women.\nAnd so where do you take that?\nBecause you know, it's, do you want to launch a clothing line?\nDo you want to sell burgers?\nDo you want to do consulting?\nYou know, it's, it's, you have all those opportunities, but what fits your brand?\nAnd so, I have, and you'll get to do this.\nYou'll get to do this.\nYou'll be approached by a lot of people that want to ride that network you've built.\nAnd my advice to you is, because this has really worked for me, is, is this a product or service that I personally would use, that I would actually use?\nBecause you'll get offered a lot of money to talk about one brand or another brand.\nThey will.\nAnd you may be weak and take it.\nBut the minute anybody in your network, in your community thinks you're not authentic, you're [ __ ].\nAnd you know that.\nYeah.\nAnd so you better be authentic.\nYou better be transparent.\nYou better be honest.\nEven when turmoil hits, whatever it's going to be, I found that saved my ass so many times by just saying, \"Here's what I know.\nHere's what happened.\"\nAnd that actually bonds them even closer to you.\nAnd, and that's, that's the difficulty you're going to have is how much do you want to take, because you're going to have that opportunity.\nBut if you stay authentic and say, I'm going to do, I'm going to support this brand because I use it.\nEvery single brand or commission I have in supporting a business, I use myself.\nI'm a shareholder in it, and I believe in it, and I use the product, or, you know, whatever, like the wines I make myself with my wife, we drink them at our family, and everybody knows that.\nSo you, if it's, I wouldn't drink it if it's [ __ ] wine.\nYeah.\nSo it's, it's sort of like, that's my advice to you because I meet a lot of people, but you're very rare.\nYou, what you've built, maybe by happenstance that it occurred.\nWhatever alchemy occurred, you have it now.\nIt's yours to lose.\nDon't [ __ ] it up.\nNo, everything you said is so true.\nAnd, um, obviously the things that I, uh, the things that we talk about in the show in terms of brands that I promote, pretty much all of them I've invested my own money into.\nYeah.\nAnd this is like super important.\nSo I talked about my Whoop.\nYeah.\nUm, if you look at the investments I have and the things I talk about, there's a really clear through line through them.\nSo, there's a really clear through, and it's actually reflective of just where I am in my life.\nThere's actually a sponsor I used to have on the show that I was very big on.\nAnd I just stopped, um, I stopped consuming the product.\nThey offered me £6 million, which is about what $8 million to continue for another year and a half.\nAnd I said, like, it just wouldn't, I'm about to basically start, um, talking about and investing in the antithesis of what you do.\nYeah.\nSo, I had to turn down that $7 million, which is a lot of money for anybody.\nYeah.\nBut it's because my life shifted, and I shifted in a different direction.\nPeople don't see those things.\nThey, they don't see that the, this foreign government comes along and offers you $4 million to go and talk about their country or to go do the dario in their country.\nThey don't see those decisions that you make.\nBut I think hopefully if you listen to me long enough, you'll see a through line between the things that are authentic to me.\nYeah.\nAnd I think that, so you've already figured it out.\nAnd the other thing that I would do, and say anybody your age, and because I wish I'd done it, is start focusing on longevity in your 30s.\nStart thinking about what you eat and what you drink and how much sleep you do and how much exercise you have.\nYou're, you could live to 120 years old.\nI mean, crazy, you know, it's sort of, if, if you understand, if you're wearing a Whoop, you know what I'm talking about.\nIt's sort of, I am very, very, uh, focused on what I do and exercise and what I eat and all that.\nUm, but, uh, that makes you feel healthier and more, and just better about the, your day as you go through it.\nBut the fact that you figured that out at your age, because most people your age would have taken the 7 million pounds or whatever it was, that would have been a huge mistake because now the next product that you do endorse, I will know with certainty that you use it because you told me this.\n\nWe have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest, not knowing who they're leaving it for.\nAnd the question that was left for you, funnily enough, I feel like I might have asked it, is where do you believe happiness really comes from?\nYou know, I think the answer is very simple.\nConsistently achieving your goals because happiness is not a destination.\nIt's a journey.\nThat's what it is.\nSo you have to set those goals, whether it's noise to signal going full circle, talked about, or long-term, whatever it is, it's consistently achieving those goals, you will be happy.\nConsistently not achieving them, you'll be unhappy because it is not a destination.\nHappiness is not a destination ever.\nIt's a mistake that's so elusive.\nI mean, it's just not a destination.\nIt's a journey.\nThat's it.\nThis is one of the great things you've taught me today and reaffirmed for me today is this idea of like signal and noise and radical prioritization because kind of dovetailing into what we were just talking about.\nWhen you have a lot of opportunity, it gets even harder, I think, to know which ones should be taking your 18 hours a day.\nThis is something I struggle with.\nYou should feel it.\nYou know, you're, you're kind of a weird dude because you're like a 70-year-old man in a 30-year-old body.\nLike you've got, you've got the intellect of, of experience, which most people don't have at your age.\nBut deals, there's a certain feeling that you, if, if you should feel that it's a good deal.\nIt should, it should be in your gut.\nAnd I've learned this.\nThere's many deals that sound great that when I just do the gut check, I don't participate in.\nThey just don't give me, and that came from experience.\nBut you seem to have that in some weird way to avoid that one we just talked about.\nThat's it.\nIt's, it's, it's an intuitive feeling that you generally get by having a lot of winners and losers over time.\nBut you seem to have accelerated that somehow.\nIt's an intuitive nature of where you want to get to and what it's going to take to get there.\nAnd there's going to be sacrifice along the way.\nIt's never about the money.\nNever.\nIt's not about the money.\nIt's, you know, it's, do I want to achieve that goal?\nYou know, I'm having a, it's, it's just a weird thing because I, I had a similar situation just a couple of days ago, you know, when somebody approached me and said, \"Look, can you get behind this and, and back it, and I'll pay you a ton, like just a crazy amount of money.\"\nAnd I thought, \"Do I actually want to spend one hour pursuing that?\"\nAnd I went back and said, \"Look, um, no.\nI, I just, it's just not interesting.\nI, I just, I don't, I can't see my, I can't see myself getting involved in that narrative, which was, it was a complicated situation, but, and then he said, \"Look, how about I give you two and a half% of the company?\"\nI said, \"No, I, I just don't want to be associated.\"\nI, you know, it's just, it's the same idea.\nIt would intuitively, it was noise.\nYeah.\nAnd what that would do is some opportunity you don't know about down the future that you, you, you, you pursued some goal that somehow tainted your brand, and that opportunity never comes to you.\nYou, you're the, you're the captain of your brand.\nYou got to, you have to define yourself right through the journey.\nIt's hard.\nIt's really hard, you know.\nIt's, it's, uh, it's really hard.\nAnd that, and that, if, if there's going to be a downfall for you, you will have chosen unwisely somewhere.\nBut it better not be from money.\nThat's, there should never be an amount that you would take because if your gut says no, it doesn't matter what the money is.\nNot after what you've achieved.\nI mean, you don't need to buy a guarantee anymore.\nYou got it.\nI'm assuming you've put some away.\nI mean, it's very simple.\nIf you've got five million bucks in the bank, you can do whatever you want.\nNow, I mean, it's may sound, I want more, but that is enough under cat.\nAlways have, always I have an account that just sits there with 5 million bucks in it in T bills.\nI never touch it.\nThat's my nest egg.\nKevin, thank you.\nYou got it.\nListen to my regular listeners.\nI know you don't like it when I ask you to subscribe at the start of these conversations.\nI don't like saying, I don't like it being in there.\nNone of us like it.\nIt's frustrating.\nDo you know what's also frustrating?\nIt's also\n\n\nIt's frustrating when I go into the back end\nof the YouTube channel and I see that\n56% of you that listen frequently to\nthis podcast haven't yet subscribed.
