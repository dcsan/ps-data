  "cleanText": "He was literally two days away from dying. So, this is a story where a 15-year-old boy was diagnosed with blood cancer, but he developed a flesh-eating infection in his lung. He wasn't going to make it. So, he has one request. He wants to go outside. And that's exactly what they do. And this was actually mind-blowing to me. After the second day, the infection is probably 60-70% gone. And it became clear to me that sunlight has so many important benefits. For instance, if you're the bed closer to the window, you get discharged from the hospital faster.\n\nSo, I want you to give me any information you have as it relates to light health. For example, do you recommend these kinds of things?\n\nDr. Roger Seheult is a board-certified critical care physician who breaks down complex science into clear life-saving advice. I see people at the very end of their lives, so I know what prevents them from getting this ill and how to extend life. So, let's distill it down into eight pillars. The first thing that exercise it reduces stroke. It reduces depression. Next, sunlight. Did you know that Infrared Light from the sun is able to penetrate up to about 8 mm and stimulate and upregulate melatonins which prevent a lot of diseases like Dementia, cardiovascular disease, diabetes?\n\nWhat if you live in a cloudy country? There's some very actionable things that you can do and we'll talk about that. Next one, water. For instance, people who use sauna are more likely to have less death from cardiovascular disease. Next, air. There are studies that show that just going out one day a week can elevate our immune system and make us more relaxed. And then there's but finally trust. This is something that can't be ignored because studies have shown that people who have a good faith and trust in God hard.\n\nI see messages all the time in the comments section that some of you didn't realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel, that would be tremendously appreciated. It's the simple, it's the free thing that anybody that watches this show frequently can do to help us here to keep everything going in this show in the trajectory it's on. So, please do double check if you've subscribed and uh thank you so much because in a strange way you are you're part of our history and you're on this journey with us and I appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank you\n\n[Music]\n\nDr. Roger Seheult, with the work that you do. What is it that you're aiming to accomplish?\n\nOutside of my clinical duties, uh, and maybe even part of that, I would like to clearly explain very easily graspable tools that can be implemented to make people live their best life. And it's specifically in terms of their health and their well-being. And as we dig down into health and wellbeing, because that's quite a broad basket, what is it within health and well-being that you've spent your career, your life focusing on?\n\nSo, I'm a board-certified internal medicine specialist. Then, I did an extra three years of training uh here in the United States on pulmonary and critical care. So, I deal with all of the issues that are related to the lungs and the critical care aspect. So, if you are uh if you are admitted to hospital and you're critically ill, you go to the intensive care unit, I'm the doctor that you see. So, I'm putting in, you know, the lines, putting them on vasopressors, intubating them. I worked in the clinic this morning.\n\nAnd what are some of the unappreciated things that most people don't think of? Because we think of, you know, don't eat processed food and, right, exercise, but is there things outside of that that you don't think the average person appreciates enough?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nWhat are those things? So if we look at those things that extend life and are beneficial, we could put them into what I call eight pillars of health. If you can imagine your life is a chain with a bunch of links, okay? And I'm talking medically. Each one of those links is an organ system. So your heart is a link, your lungs are a link, your liver is a link, your kidneys, etc., etc.\n\nAs you go through life, imagine those links starting to erode. So that at some point in your life, you're going to get some sort of a disease or a diagnosis that focuses on one organ system of your life. For many here in the United States and in the UK, it's the heart. And as that link gets more eroded, we can see very clearly that this is going to be the link that's going to break first. And therefore, attention is paid to that link. For many that diagnosis comes with medications. So here here is one of the first truisms that I would say going forward. All medications have side effects. And what the aim is to do in modern medicine is to utilize the knowledge of those medicines and their effect on the human body so that we leverage the other links to protect that weakest link. So, I could go through a bunch of medications that I give all the time to patients in the intensive care unit where I'm focused on saving their life because I can clearly see which link is the weakest, but I'm doing it knowing that there's side effects because I'm trying to save that link to save that life and I'm leveraging those other things. For instance, somebody comes in with a stroke and uh they have they've they've lost weakness on the on the right side of their body or the left side, whichever side, I can give them a medication immediately that will break up all of the clots in their body. It's called TPA or TNK. And it will restore blood flow to the brain and it will reverse many of their symptoms. If they come in soon enough, we can do this.\n\nWhat's what's amazing is that that medication has an effect that can do that, but it also has a pretty significant side effect and that it could break up clots somewhere else and cause bleeding. So, we have to be careful about what it is that we're doing. Clearly there what we're doing is we're saving one link at the expense of other links. But that's what you have to do in an emergency situation. But if after that I simply send that patient home without telling them why they had that stroke and what they need to do to prevent themselves from getting that stroke again and what are the lifestyle factors that cause that to happen. I haven't done my job. So what is what are the interventions that we can do hopefully early on in life so that we don't have those links eroding so that all of the links are strong and as we get older we can continue to strengthen all of the links. Here are the eight. So nutrition that's that's nutrition. Uh basically you know we know there are studies that have done that show that that depending on what we put into our bodies as food can have a dramatic impact in terms of our well-being. Okay so that's nutrition. Exercise as I was saying exercise not only I mean drugs and things have side effects. Exercise have side benefits. So exercise obviously is going to make you more fit. It's going to make you have better endurance. But did you know that it reduces stroke? Did you know that it improves uh um well-being? It reduces depression. There's so many benefits. So, all of these links are actually improving. There's no leveraging here. And exercise is incredible. Water. So, this may sound obvious, right? Like you drink because you're thirsty. Where I would like to go today is to talk a little bit about what the effect of water externally on your body can do. And you're talking there about like hot and cold.\n\nExactly.\n\nUsage.\n\nExactly. in terms of showers or cold plunges, saunas, that kind of thing.\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd we'll get into the actual evidence for this.\n\nWe'll get into it later. But what is thisffects your immune system which changes your probability of diseases and things like that.\n\nAbsolutely. Especially in the acute setting, especially so not only in the acute setting, but we also have pretty good data from Finland where they have more saunas than almost than people uh where they've actually done the research and and shown with dose response curves that this is actually very beneficial. We won't get into too much of that, but what I want to focus a little bit more on because of my job in the intensive care unit and what we're seeing right now with viruses and mutations in the innate immune system, why something like this may actually be very important uh as we look forward. Interestingly, as we look forward to future things, pandemics, we can look backward and see what we had done in the past. And we've got some really actually really good information on that. Let's go to sunlight. This is something that um I've really become more and more involved with because of some of the benefits that this can do. A very big misconception that people have is that sunlight equals Vitamin D. And therefore, if you take a Vitamin D supplement, you don't need to go in the sun. This is really something that's now um being debunked. Sunlight has far more benefits than just Vitamin D. Not saying that Vitamin D is is not something that you want to supplement with. I supplement with Vitamin D. I think it's there's a benefit to supplementing with Vitamin D. No question. But sunlight has so many important things. And I and I really would like to spend the bulk or the line share of the time talking about this because this is really important.\n\nUm this is a this is this is amazing. Uh and it really made me think about sunlight. So, this is a story by a lady by the name of Amy Hanmeer. Her 15-year-old boy was diagnosed with lymphablastic leukemia. Went into uh the hospital actually started chemotherapy for it which is blood cancer.\n\nIt's a blood cancer. Yeah. And so this the treatment for blood cancer is chemotherapy which he started. The side effect of chemotherapy is suppressing the immune system. And unfortunately, he didn't realize it, but he developed uh he didn't realize it immediately, but he developed a a fungus flesh-eating infection in his lung and went into the hospital in June of 2024.\n\nUh this was in Minnesota, tertiary care hospital. and he got worse and got worse and got worse to the point where the only way that they could control this infection was to actually remove his left lung, which they did. So, this is a 15-year-old boy. He is without his left lung. He only has a right lung and he starts to decline even after that. They do a CT scan and it shows that now the infection has moved to the his remaining right lung. They have a family conference and as Amy is telling me this story, I could hear her choking up. She's telling me this on the phone. She's saying that he's 15. He's completely awake. He's completely alert. He knows everything that's going on around him. He's on a ventilator, like a machine that they use for for sleep apnea. It's like a BiPAP machine that's breathing for him. It's not intubation, but it's on his on his mouth. And the doctors, you know, have done everything they possibly can and they say, \"Look, he's getting worse. We can't take obviously we can't take the right lung out. We can't put him on a heart lung machine because there's no sort of destination to where he's going. U we recommend not intubating him and making him what they call DNR. Do not resuscitate.\n\nSo they're like, \"Wow, they were not expecting this coming.\" So they have a big conference somebody they they call in help to like how do you explain to a 15-year-old boy that you're dying and how how is that going to feel?\n\nSo they ask the doctors how how much time does he have? They say two days.\n\nSo in this in this situation, they ask this boy, okay, you're going to die. What do you want to do with your life in the in the next two days? What do you want to do? And surprisingly, he says, I want to go outside.\n\nI just want to go outside. This this guy grew up probably on a farm or something, and he spend his time outside. So, he wants to go outside. So, you know how I mean, I don't know if you know this, but like if you're a nurse or you're a doctor and you've done everything you can and this and you're just completely horrified at the fact that this 15-year-old is going to die and he has one request. You're going to move heaven and earth to fulfill that one request. And that's exactly what they do. They get this boy the hospital bed outside. He's on a BPA machine the respiratory therapists have put together. So this guy is outside and they're not putting him outside to get better. He's just This is his dying wish. They also use this thing called a Firefly. It's like a light device that they were using. I to I'll be honest, I don't know which did it.\n\nThe Firefly. What's that?\n\nIt's a It's a light device that gives off light at different wavelengths and they would use that for about three times a day for five minutes.\n\nThis guy does not die.\n\nAfter the first day, his white count starts to come down. That's like a measure of the infection that's going on in the lung. And and by the way, they do a CT scan of his lung before this all starts. And and it's just the the remaining lung on the right is just filled with infection. It's horrible. By the by the second day, the white count comes down even more. And there, by the way, they haven't changed any of the other treatment. He's been in by this point he's been in for 6 weeks. He has not seen the light of day. And and he's still getting the powerful antifungal medication amphoterin B and posiconazol. All of these things are are really high powered drugs that that just completely fight fungus, but it's not working. He's getting worse. But now he's out for the second day. The white count's coming down, which is good. Not it's a good sign. His oxygen requirement is coming down. That's a good sign. He's requiring less and less oxygen. By the time he gets to day five, okay, we're already past 2 days. He's off the BPAP. He's on regular just nasal canula oxygen that you see people wearing on their nose. The doctors are scratching their head. They're like, \"We we should get a CT scan to see what's going on.\" So, so Amy tells me that they they get a CT scan of this guy and they're in the room and some some even like swear under their breath like they they're completely amazed because on\n\n\nThe CT scan, obviously, the left lung is still gone, but the right lung, the disease is probably 60-70% gone, and he's still alive. He goes home. There's no sign of the disease after treatment. And he, he, uh, I, I just, she just, uh, communicated with me to tell me that he just got his Make-A-Wish, uh, thing for his cancer. He's continuing treatment, and she just can't believe that he was literally two days away from dying. They changed nothing. They changed none of his treatments. The only thing that they did was they took him outside, and they were using this Firefly before inside, but they were using it more consistently when he got outside. Maybe hospitals should be outside.\n\nThis is exactly what... Okay, so if you wanted to know what my drive was, what it is, my purpose that I'm doing right now, I'm working at three different hospitals, and I'm trying to work in each of those three different hospitals to try to get patients outside. The biggest barrier that we have is staff taking those patients outside. That's the thing that's the hardest. But this is what we used to do, Steven. This is what we used when we built hospitals at the turn of the century. We had hospital rooms where beds could be taken out onto the veranda, and people could get sunlight. I would love to see a time where we could go back to that type of, uh, effect. There's studies that have been done. People in a two-bed room, if you're the bed closer to the window, you get discharged from the hospital faster on average.\n\nReally?\n\nYes.\n\nI need to swap sides of the bed with my girlfriend. She's on the sunny side.\n\nThere, there's so much evidence for this. People who are in hospitals that are, have bigger windows, they give better surveys. And hospitals, uh, reimbursement is tied to the surveys that they get from patients. So, it's literally a win-win-win. If hospitals started to, I believe, get patients outside, and, and they're already doing this there. I don't want to say that this isn't happening. There are hospitals that are, have programs to get patients outside. Um, I think we just ought to be doing it a lot more.\n\nUm, temperance.\n\nTemperance. What does that mean?\n\nIt's an old term, isn't it? It really means moderation. And, and I, I would say in this sense, temperance really means to, uh, avoid toxins in the body. Um, as somebody who is a pulmonologist, who is... what's a pulmonologist?\n\nPulmonologist is someone who takes care of the lungs. And so, as a result of that, I see a lot of issues, uh, with lung cancer related to smoking. Um, I see in the intensive care unit people with liver failure as a result of alcohol abuse. I also see people, uh, on amphetamines here in Southern California, where I, uh, reside and where I work. We, we have quite a bit of that, and, uh, temperance. If, if you want to live a long and wholesome life, there are some toxins that you want to avoid. And, uh, and, and understanding that is really important. So this is something that if you stop some of those things that we're talking about, all of those links are going to be improved.\n\nAir seems kind of obvious. Early on, I used to think that that what this meant was getting pure air with absolutely nothing in it except for just nitrogen and oxygen. That's not true anymore. We now understand that for you to have the best type of air, it actually has to come with some things in it. Just like our, our gut has a microflora that you may have heard about, so too does the air that we breathe also must have that. And, um, the best type of air that you can have is actually outside.\n\nRest. This is really interesting because we just mentioned that exercise was a pillar, but rest also is. How can rest and exercise at the same time be pillars of health? And it really comes down to knowing when to do what? Sleep, which is also part of rest. So we're not just talking about a daily rest when you go to sleep. And, and as a sleep physician, I can tell you, uh, quite a bit. We have lots of information about how long we should sleep, the quality of sleep, some of the diseases that prevent us from sleeping. Sleep is so important. I can't, I, I couldn't overexpress it enough. Not just a, a daily rest, but, um, I would also say, and venture out. We can talk more about this. A weekly rest.\n\nA weekly rest.\n\nA weekly rest.\n\nWhat do you mean, weekend? Like...\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. How many times do we, uh, even on the weekend, do we put down our, our phone?\n\nNever.\n\nOr we stop reading emails and we take the time out to do things that we would never be able to do. Finally, trust. So, this is something that really just can't be ignored. And, and I'll say this upfront that, um, in the world of research and science, there is a, there is a silo of science, and there is a silo of faith. But what's, what we can't ignore is the growing body of evidence from the scientific world that's peeking over and looking at faith, that people who have faith and people who have faith in God, uh, whether that is, uh, their God in, in that particular denomination, are better apt and able to deal with stress and depression and anxiety. So this is something scientifically that has been shown. Now, if you, you may have noticed that I, I did these in a particular order. Um, and if you go through them, you've got nutrition, you've got exercise, you've got water, you've got sunlight, you've got temperance, you have air, you have rest, and finally, you have trust. You put that together, and it spells out NEW START. So, interestingly, these, these particular topics are not copyrighted, but there is a, um, there is a university in Northern California called Weimore University that is actually put these together in that very pattern as called it NEW START. They actually have a NEW START program, um, and so this is something that, uh, that is actually being used, uh, internationally. So, of these subjects that you just went through there for this NEW START, um, framework, where do you want to start?\n\nI think actually sunlight is, is one of those things where I'm excited about all of those, but I think sunlight is, is really where we have, it's the, let's put it this way, it's the lowest hanging fruit.\n\nOkay. Explain to me why sunlight is the, the place where your focus is at the moment.\n\nIt's a long trip that has gotten me to that. Um, and I, and I think part of it has goes through right through COVID. So, as a critical care intensivist, when I heard that there was this virus that was coming, they all told us that it was going to be people with respiratory illnesses, which I was certainly comfortable with, but that's not what it turned out to be. We certainly saw people with respiratory illnesses, but what we saw in the intensive care unit, the people that were dying around me were people with obesity, people with heart disease, people with kidney disease, people with Dementia, people with chronic diseases. And it made me think, why was that the case? All of those things have one thing in common, and many other things, too, but specifically, they're rooted in something called mitochondrial dysfunction. So, let me unpack that for you. And, and this has to do with longevity. This has to do with aging. This is a huge topic that is now just emerging. And we're, we're now finding more about this. So, when we were, when I was in high school biology, when I was in college, uh, we all learned about this little organelle in all of our cells except for red blood cells called the mitochondria. And, and I have to say it, what is the mitochondria? It's the powerhouse of the cell, right? So, it's the thing that makes energy. What we didn't know at the time is that as we get older, the output from these batteries in our cells drops by about 70%.\n\nDamn.\n\nCan you imagine running your house on 70% less energy? How fundamentally that would change, change what happens in your house? Like you could not run the laundry the same way. You could not run the microwave and the laundry at the same time.\n\nAnd what does that look like in terms of symptoms?\n\nExcellent question. Because what it looks like is, depending on the cell type that we're talking about, that's going to have the issue. So, if we're talking about the liver, the liver is going to get more fatty. If we're talking about the heart, the heart's going to, is going to become more congested. If we're talking about the brain, it's going to have more Dementia.\n\nAnd so, what's, what's happening here is that as we get older, the batteries in our cells are not working the same way as they used to. Metabolism is slowing down. And, and so, these are, these are huge issues. And all of these diseases that I just talked about, all the ones that we saw in COVID, if you look in a lot of these diseases, they are rooted in mitochondrial dysfunction. So the question is, is why is that the case, and what can we do about it? So there was a paper that came out in 2019 that fundamentally changed the way I saw this. It was written by, um, Russell Writer, who is the, uh, executive editor of Melatonin Research. It's a, he's out of University of Texas, and Scott Zimmerman, who's a light engineer, and what they set forth was to show that basically sunlight is made up of so many different types of wavelengths. You've got ultraviolet on one end, which, of course, makes Vitamin D, and it's very beneficial. It, it's the type of light from the, from the sun that is very shortwave, and but cannot penetrate very deeply. Let me, let me back up a little bit and explain. You pull up to a stop sign, and somebody pulls up next to you, and they're playing the latest hip-hop music. How does that sound to you in your car? It's very boom, boom, right?\n\nYeah. And muffled.\n\nIt's muffled. And the reason why is because low wave frequency has the ability to travel very far. Go to the Grand Canyon, and there's a thunderstorm at the other end of it. What do you hear? It's like a rumbling. And then as it gets closer, you hear the higher pitch sounds. This is a fundamental physics, uh, principle. And so when the sun is, is shining, there's very short wavelengths, ultraviolet B, involved in Vitamin D. But at the other end, there's this Infrared Light, which we'll talk about, or red light. It's very long wavelength, and it can penetrate very, very deeply. That's very important because what we're talking about is the human body. And if the sun is going to have an effect on the human body, it's got to be more than just the skin. So that's exactly what, what this paper showed is that basically Infrared Light from the sun is able to penetrate probably up to about 8 centimeters, according to Scott Zimmerman in this article. And it fundamentally interacts with specifically the mitochondria. And what does it do to the mitochondria? So let's, let's back up and talk about the mitochondria because this is central. The mitochondria to the cell is like the engine in your car. The engine produces locomotion that causes this, the wheels to spin. But in the process of doing it, it causes heat to, uh, surround the engine. And if you don't deal with that heat, it will shut down the engine. It will make it more inefficient, and eventually it will shut it down. So what do all internal combustion engines have? They have a cooling system. They have a radiator. They have a, an oil pan. They have a water pump, and that's exactly what the cell has to have for the mitochondria. It's not heat in the mitochondria. It's called oxidative stress, and it's specifically oxidative stress that causes destruction and, uh, and, um, yeah, destruction of the mitochondria and leads to these types of diseases. So oxidative stress causes the mitochondria not to work well. This leads to diabetes. Oxidative stress makes the mitochondria not work so well. This leads to Dementia. So there's this has already been laid out. This is not that controversial. The controversial part is what do we do about it? So what these guys in this paper showed was that, and, and not just them, but look reviewing the literature, is that the mitochondria makes its own cooling system, and that cooling system is melatonin.\n\nNow you might be thinking, wait a minute, melatonin, isn't that the, isn't that the stuff that we take that our brain makes right before we go to sleep? Yeah, that, you're, it's absolutely correct, that's what happens. The problem is, is that this is not melatonin that's made in the brain. This is not melatonin that goes through the blood supply and goes, goes through our blood and tells us it's time to go to sleep. This is melatonin that's made in the cell in the mitochondria, and it's a powerful antioxidant that basically prevents the oxidative stress from occurring.\n\nWhat Scott Zimmerman and Russell Writer showed and proposed in this was that basically the infrared radiation that's coming in to the body is able to stimulate and upregulate melatonin and a number of other factors that keep the mitochondria cool and can actually improve the energy output of the mitochondria. So, this is, this was actually mind-blowing to me. And I'll tell you why I resonated with this as a critical care physician because there was two things that bothered me the most. Number one, SARS-CoV-2 virus, when it comes into the body, it interacts with something called the ACE2 receptor. You may have heard about the ACE2 receptor. Okay, this is where the, the virus actually latches on to the cell and gets internalized. So, what is this ACE2 receptor? Is this, was this there for all of humanity just to be a receptor, or does it actually have a role? It turns out it actually has a role, and mind-blowingly, the ACE2 receptor is involved in mitigating oxidative stress. So, in other words, it's another part of the cell's cooling system for the mitochondria. What, what's happening is that the, the virus when it attaches to the cell is basically eliminating that action. And so imagine you have a bunch of people with various different engines running at different temperatures. In other words, you've got some people with chronic disease, and we know their engines are running hot. We have other people who are completely healthy, and they're doing quite well. Their engines are nice and cool. They have no problems at all. Now imagine COVID comes, and SARS-CoV-2 is infecting everybody. What that tendency is to do is because it's knocking out everybody's ACE2 receptor, which has the ability to cool down the engine, if, in other words, it's causing everybody's engine to run hot. Right? So, but in somebody, so in other words, picture this way, you're, you're, you're driving along in your car, and your thermometer is there, and all of a sudden, there's this big hill that you have to climb called COVID-19. Who's going to make it over that hill, and who's not going to make it over?\n\n\nThat hill. The people that make it over the hill are those with great cooling engines whose temperatures are running great. The ones that don't make it over that hill are the ones that have the thermometer on their engine running hot. Those are the ones that poop out at the top and can't make it. And they're the ones pulled over to the side of the road with the hood up and the steam coming out of the engine. Do you understand what I'm saying? Of course. So, this makes perfect sense to me why I wasn't seeing what they were predicting, which is these respiratory patients coming into the ICU. Who was I seeing in the ICU? I was seeing people with dementia, as we talked about, diabetes, kidney disease. These are the ones that were sick. The other thing that really hit me and resonated with this was, and this was not even controversial. We knew early on in the pandemic that people who came into the hospital and had higher levels of Vitamin D did really well. They didn't die. They didn't have the same chances of dying. People who had low Vitamin D levels, they had much higher chances of dying. So, we would check these Vitamin D levels. And so, think about this. You're there at ground zero and you're taking care of these patients and you see this data over and over and over again that Vitamin D is very predictive of who's going to die. Obviously, what are you going to do? Even though this is an associative study, that association doesn't mean causation. You're going to be giving people Vitamin D and try to get those levels up. The problem is is that we gave Vitamin D and it really didn't have much of an effect. So you gave it in supplement type. Yeah. When people would come into the hospital like this. Exactly. Exactly. Just like that. In fact, I was supplementing myself. I mean, what have you got to lose, right? I already took my Vitamin D tablet this morning. I don't, there's not, that's very hard to overdose, but it's possible. So, you noticed that it was hard to treat people with Vitamin D, but giving them a tablet didn't really do much. That's correct. Why? Well, this is what I believe is the fact is we saw that people with high levels of Vitamin D or normal levels of Vitamin D did better than those that had low levels. I believe that that was a marker of something else. In other words, people who had higher levels of Vitamin D meant that they were out in the sun more. They were outside more than those that people that had very low Vitamin D levels. The people with low Vitamin D levels were telling me these are people that were not getting outside into the sun. And so what's the real factor here? What's doing the heavy lifting? And I would propose, and Scott Zimmerman and Russell Ryder would propose, and I can tell you a number of other scientists that would agree with me on this, is that Infrared Light from the sun is causing an effect at the mitochondrial level in terms of oxidative stress and that Vitamin D was just the marker of who was getting the infrared light and who was not. Who was going outside and who was not going outside. So when the sun is shining, for the most part, you're getting infrared light. You're getting the entire biological spectrum from the sun. We can go to the longest wavelength, which is far infrared, all the way to the shortest wavelength, which is ultraviolet B, okay? Which makes Vitamin D. So in other words, when you are outside in a natural environment, you're getting a very broad spectrum of light. And so because of that, if you're getting infrared light, you're also going to be making Vitamin D. Yeah, you're getting both. Um, now that can change because in the wintertime when the sun is lower in the sky, especially, you know, in England, this is a special issue at that latitude. When the sun is low in the sky, it's got the light has to penetrate through obliquely through the atmosphere. And because of that, shortwave radiation from the sun like ultraviolet B does not make it very well. So there's times of the year where you're not getting enough ultraviolet B or maybe even no ultraviolet B from the sun, which makes the Vitamin D, which makes the Vitamin D and that you're going to be deficient. You need to supplement. However, during that same period of time when you're not getting enough Vitamin D because there's no ultraviolet B radiation, that sun is low, but that's it's still enough to allow that long wavelength penetrating infrared light to still come through. So, is the longwave infrared light the type of thing that we see these gadgets doing? Absolutely. And, and uh, I would say just to be specific is because you can see that as red light there, that's not infrared light because you can see it. So infrared light technically is completely invisible. But this, these do give out infrared light, but you just can't see it. Exactly. So it's toward that red end of the spectrum. And people like Glenn Jeffrey out of UCL is actually doing research at 670 nanometers of red light and has shown in randomized control trials that that type of light right there at 670, the type that you can even see actually does improve mitochondrial efficiency. He's shown this in a number of randomized control trials. It improves eyesight and and you have to realize that the retina at the back of your eye is very rich in mitochondria. He's shown this in terms of managing glucose and and output from mitochondria. And and the reason why these things uh work so well is because what's going on here is as you get older, your skin starts to become more saggy because the the fibroblast or the cells in your skin, they're designed to make collagen and collagen is the skeleton that makes your skin soft and subtle. Yeah. Don't mind me, please. No, no. So this is this is exactly my wife uses the same thing. This is a Bon Charge one. So what what's going on right now is that red light which can penetrate very deeply down is going into the skin and it is activating the mitochondria in your fibroblast to produce more energy which those cells need to deposit collagen. And so when you deposit collagen that's going to give the skin a more tight uh feel because as you get older that collagen deposition is going to get less and less and less. So, this is going to help keep me looking young. That's the whole point of it. And you're saying that the the light in these penetrates what six or seven centimeters or is it infrared does about 8 cm? Uh, this red light would be a little bit less because this light light obviously you can see it. So, it is a little bit shorter wavelength, but yes, this light, the red light can penetrate deeper than for instance yellow light or blue light. And it's this light particularly that interacts with the mitochondria to increase that. So, should we be putting this all over our body? Because okay, it's good for my skin, but if it's penetrating deeper, presumably there's other parts of my body that would benefit from that, another mitochondria. It's interesting you say that. Um, the the study that I'm referring to with Glenn Jeffrey out of University College London, he took uh young people in this study, he gave them a a bunch of glucose and everybody who gets a bunch of glucose should have a spike in their blood sugar in he randomized them on their backs to see what would happen when he shined red lights uh on their backs. And the people that got the red light had lower spikes. In other words, it seemed as though the mitochondria were metabolizing faster, which caused less of a spike of the glucose in their blood. The way he confirmed that is looking for the byproducts of the mitochondrial metabolism, which is carbon dioxide. So, when we breathe, when we metabolize, we're breathing out carbon dioxide, which is the result of of a mitochondrial um metabolism. And in fact, in those people that had the light on, it showed a higher level of carbon dioxide in the exhaled uh breath. The whole point of that is to get back to your question is whether we should be putting this all over your body. He was able to get that effect systemically with just putting the light on the back. Um that was a that was a systemic uh ability. But we don't understand everything about the mitochondria, but what we do seem to understand is that they can communicate with each other and that you don't need to have this all over the body to have systemic effects. In this particular case though, if you want to have the skin here to be more uh you know younger looking, then it makes sense that this is where you need to have it. If you want to have a particular other part of your body to look younger, then then perhaps that that's where the light needs to go. So interesting. How long did it take in those studies to see the effect of red light therapy like this? Well, that's a very good question. If you talk to Glenn Jeffrey, which I have, he noticed an improvement in 15 minutes. 15 15 minutes. What did he notice in 15 minutes? He said he has studied the mitochondria in fruit flies, in mosquitoes and bees, and in human beings. And it's the same every time. He says after about 15 to 20 minutes of this type of light in that type of setting there is a switch that turns on and and you and you don't need further stimulation. Further stimulation doesn't do anything more. It's a it's a very bizarre thing. You would think that the more light that you gave the more the effect would be. It's not. After about 15 minutes it it there's something that changes in the mitochondria. There are certain theories about where this might be. This might be in the electron transport chain uh uh complex 4. Uh these are very technical things. There's a lot of studies that are actually there's a number of groups that are actually looking at this. Uh there's a whole area of science called photobiomodulation which is looking at this. But 15 minutes is really what it takes. So we're not we're not talking about a long period of time. This is really really interesting. So getting back to my experience in the intensive care unit, the Vitamin D wasn't working. These patients were dying and it became clear to me that COVID was a metabolic uh issue for these patients. By the time I had realized this, the s I mean the pandemic arguably is still going on because people are still becoming infected, but the rush to come into the hospital and and the number of bodies that we were seeing circulating through the intensive care unit had dropped dramatically. And at that point, I was able to see that potentially infrared light may be very very beneficial in these patients with COVID-19. Now, there was a study in Brazil. They took COVID patients that were that were sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, but not too sick to be intubated in an intensive care unit. And they did something tremendous. They actually manufactured a jacket that they could put on patients. And on the inside of this jacket were these LED bulbs that gave off infrared radiation at exactly 940 nanometers. They put the jackets on and they randomly randomized the sign which jacket was turned on and which jacket was turned off. It was blinded because the light coming from this jacket could not be seen by the human eye. It wasn't even enough to produce enough heat. And so they they did this on 30 subjects and they randomized them. 15 did it 50 all 15 or all 30 had the jackets on. 15 had it turned on. 15 did not have it turned on and they watched them. What happens to these patients? Every single endpoint that they looked at was statistically significant. And what does that mean? It means that the differences between these two groups could not have been from chance. There was a real difference. The group that had the jacket turned on had improvement in their oxygen saturation, had could take breaths in more deeply and stronger, had improvements in their blood, white blood cells. Um, and not only that, had improvements in their heart rate, their respiratory rate, all of these statistically significant, but the most important and mind-blowing statistic was the length of stay in the hospital. So, they had these jackets on for 15 minutes once a day for 7 days. In the group that did not have the jacket turned on, their average length of stay was 12 days in the hospital. For those that had the jacket turned on, it was 8 days. That was a 4 day difference. That's tremendous when you realize that it costs thousands of dollars to hospitalize patients. It's it's a huge amount when you think about the fact that there are certain drugs that get FDA approved for influenza, for instance, by just cutting short the symptoms for 24 hours. This is not just 24 hours, 40. people were discharged from the hospital 4 days faster. When I saw that study, that was enough for me to convince me. I mean, obviously, it was 30 subjects, right? We should do a bigger study. We should do a hund a couple hundred, right? That would be that would be ideal to do. But the fact that with just 30 patients, they could show statistical significance. That was enough for me to say every patient from now on that I see that comes in with COVID-19 that's hospitalized that they're asking me to go intubate to bring to my ICU, these patients are going to get outside. I don't have that jacket that they made in Brazil. I I I don't even know how I would make that jacket. They made it for the study and it's not commercially available. There's no 940 nmter light, which is what they did in the study. But I do know this. I do know that sunlight has 940 nanometers in it and if I could just take these patients outside maybe they could improve. So I had I got my wish. I had a patient on the floor. He was on 35 L a minute 100% oxygen through his high flow through his nose through his nose barely barely saturating because he had COVID-19. And uh I was asked to go see him because he was potentially needing to be intubated or brought to the intensive care unit. I could not believe it because I had not seen one of these in months. So I went down, walked into the room, opened the door. It was in isolation. I had a mask on. The whole nine yards. The room was completely dark. The blind was closed. His daughter was there and the first words out of his mouth to me was, \"Doc, how much time have I got?\" I mean, it was a catastrophe. Like there was no light, no circadian rhythm. This guy was depressed. I immediately called my respiratory therapist, immediately called the charge nurse. We got everybody together and I said, \"We need to get this guy outside.\" It was a bright and sunny day. How are we going to get this guy outside? 35 L, 100%. We, my respiratory\n\n\nTherapist Kim managed to put a couple of oxygen tanks together, and we were able to get this guy into a wheelchair, and we wheeled him outside. And, uh, he told me this, uh, weeks later, but he says, \"You know, that first day that you got me outside in the sun,\" 'cause we did this for like seven days in a row. He said, \"That felt so good.\" Um, he, after just one day, dropped down from 35 L to 15 L of oxygen, and then down to 12, and then down to eight the next day, and then down to five. 5 days, the amount of oxygen he was inhaling to keep him alive.\n\nCorrect. So, in other words, we were titrating down the amount of oxygen that we had to give him to maintain a saturation in the '9s. In 5 days, he was discharged home without oxygen. Now, obviously, that's an anecdote, right? That's not a study, but I'm looking at the risks of getting people out in the sun for 15, 20 minutes. There's not a lot of risk to that. And if there's a benefit, I thought it was worthwhile doing. We need to have larger randomized control trials. But it got me down the road to looking to see what was it about sunlight that was affecting this change. And you know what? There was, there's ample data there. There was a study actually that was done in Europe where they looked, they said, \"Okay, here's CO CO's going up. When does CO go up? Is it because of temperature that changes? Is it because of humidity?\" And the answers to both of those were no. Do you know what predicted when countries were to have their first surge in the autumn of 2020? There was a study that was actually done on this. It was latitude. It started in Finland and then really went down the entire continent. The last country in the autumn of 2020 to have a COVID surge was Greece. So, as the sun is literally pulling down into the southern hemisphere, as the shadow starts to go over Europe, that's when we start to see CO surges one by one by one. There was, yeah.\n\nIs that because CO and the sun aren't friends? So, if I, it makes it harder to spread because, you know, if I put CO on this table and then I put sunlight on the table, the CO is going to die. Yeah, it it's possible. Uh, although we now know that CO probably doesn't spread too much through contact. It's more of an airborne thing. So, there was a study that was done out of University of Edinburgh, and they looked at this very question that we had talked about earlier about Vitamin D. They looked at the United States in the wintertime. So, and they eliminated the southern part of the United States because in the southern part of the United States, you can actually get some Vitamin D in the wintertime. So, they just looked at the sort of the northern portion of the United States, and they were able to show that the more sunlight there was in particular areas, the lower the mortality from COVID-19. So, they said, \"This is interesting.\" What about in England? So, they did the exact same study in England, and, and sure enough, of course, they didn't have to eliminate any part of England because the whole country doesn't get any Vitamin D in the wintertime. What they showed was that, again, certain parts of the country in England, as you know, get more sunlight than other parts. Well, those areas that got more sunlight had lower mortality from COVID-19. Then they took the same, they predicated the same, uh, study, and they looked in Italy, exactly the same finding, and they published this, and they said in their study, and this is what really amazed me. They said the fact, if this is causal, they say, they said that, um, this might actually show a possible public health intervention. The fact that it is completely independent of Vitamin D means that there's something else going on.\n\nThere was a study in 2011 in Sweden. Yes. Is that linked to this? No, this is a completely different study. But that, that's also a very important study. So, the Swedish study is, is groundbreaking. Um, this was a study where they asked 20,000, 20 to 30,000 Swedish women about their habits in sunlight. And they divided these women into three categories: those women that did not get a lot of sun, those that got a moderate amount of sun, and those that got a lot of sun. And they followed them for 20 years. And they, they kept a track of each one that died and what they died of. And when they were done with that, they were astonished because what they found was that the women who had spent most, spent the large amount of their time outside or that spent the most amount of time outside had the least amount of mortality from cancer, from cardiovascular disease, and non-cardiovascular disease. And those that spent the least amount of time outside had the highest levels of that. The magnitude difference between those two was so much that they were able to show that women who in Sweden who spent the most amount of time outside and smoked had the same mortality as those women that did not spend as much time outside and did not smoke. They were equal. They were equal. In other words, being in that category of not spending much time outside in the sun was the same risk factor for death as smoking.\n\nHow do they know it wasn't linked to exercise? How are they able to establish causation? Because that's a, you're absolutely, that's an excellent question. So, the, the difference here as you go up is this is a, this is an association study. Okay. So, the question is, is how can you get causation from association? You can't. But if you look at the Bradford Hill criteria, there is a way that you can potentially make a strong argument for causation if there's something called a dose response curve. In other words, if you can show you're not just comparing two things, but you're comparing three or more. If you can show that as you increase the variable that there is a change in the the output, that is strongly suggestive of potentially causation. By the way, this is exactly what we did to show that smoking causes lung cancer. Obviously, we can't do a randomized control trial here. You get to smoke, you don't get to smoke, we'll follow up in 20 years to see who has lung cancer. This is exactly what we did. We showed that that there was such a strong association with cancer risk with smoking that we were able to say through association that smoking causes lung cancer. By the way, Richard Weller, who's a dermatologist in England, uh, did just last year a very similar study as to the Swedish study, except it was 10 times bigger, and he did it with both men and women. He found the same results. It was a UK Biobank study.\n\nWhat did he discover? He discovered that either from solariums or from, um, or being outside using solar radiation data, uh, he was able to show both on their questionnaire and also where they lived that the more light that they had, the lower their risk of, of, of, um, mortality, uh, and, um, and cancer mortality. So, the question was, does it increase melanoma? What's melanoma? Melanoma is a skin cancer. So, that's the big risk. That's the big risk that everybody's concerned about. You go out into the sun and you're going to get skin cancer. And he was able to show in that study, this was like three, three, 400,000 people in this study, UK Biobank study, Richard Weller. He was able to show that there was no increased, there's no statistical increased risk of melanoma incidents, but there was a reduction in non-skin cancer mortality.\n\nOkay. So, so here's the trade-off. If you want to go out into the sun in England, okay, the benefits are you're going to have a reduction in non-skin cancer mortality. So, everything other than skin cancer. Correct. On the other hand, there's no increase in melanoma incidents. So, that caused him to write an op-ed and publish it. And actually, you can look up this op-ed. It's a great op-ed, uh, published in a, um, in the journal of investigative dermatology called Sunlight, Time for a Rethink, where he goes through the arguments, and he's actually shown, and, and there's been a number of changes that people have around the globe. So, public health, uh, uh, organizations that are saying now, you know, before we have said that, you know, the, the sun is a deadly laser, and you should avoid it at all costs. We may need to rethink that.\n\nSo, are you telling me that essentially 15 minutes in the sun every day turns on a switch in my body that improves my mitochondrial function, which is going to impact a variety of different parts of my health? Is that essentially what you're saying? Essentially. Yes. Uh, and, and, and we're, we're looking, and this is in an environment where, where we are spending less and less and less time. To give, to give you, to put in perspective, if we were on a British ship 300 years ago, and I came to you and I said, \"Do you see this little yellow fruit? Just by eating a little bit of this yellow fruit, all of this disease that you're seeing around you with your fellow shipmates is going to go away,\" that, that would seem almost incredulous, right? But that's exactly the case. We, we are the scurvy of the 21st century is the lack of sunlight. Everything is inside. Uh, we, we avoid the outside. We avoid discomfort. We avoid high temperatures. We avoid low temperatures. We are, we used to go out and play sports. We now are playing virtual sports on pads. We have windows that are specifically designed, especially here in Southern California, to eliminate infrared light because why? Infrared light comes in and it heats up. One of the interesting things, we didn't mention this about infrared light, is the way that we interact with infrared light. You can, you can tell this on your own. You go outside and close your eyes. You can tell which side of your body the sun is on. And the reason is is because that infrared light not only can penetrate through your body, it's also penetrating through clothes very easily. And you can feel that, that, that heat that you're feeling is the infrared light going through the, going through the clothes, going through the skin and interacting with your heat receptors that are well below the surface. Um, so all of this, right, guys, going to go get Steve. The guest is here.\n\nReady? Come in. Oh my god. Steve, what are you doing? This is, uh, the Bon Charge face mask. It's good for blemishes, wrinkles, uh, clears up the skin. It's red light. Have you not used it before? No, tried this before. It's, um, it's really, really good.

Uh, I think the Brits spend a little bit more time outside than Americans. The, the, the last number for Americans was 93%. And, uh, Brits is 92%. Were we born to be outside? I think so. You'd think our ancestors probably spent a huge amount of time outside. Yeah. And if you think about when I say outside, that also brings into play a number of other of the new start letters that we haven't talked about. Uh, exercise, you're much more likely to do good exercise outside. You're much more likely to get air. That's that's the right type of air outside. The other aspect about infrared light briefly is that trees are highly reflective of infrared light. In other words, if you're in an environment where there are trees are present, you're going to get much more of this beneficial infrared light than if you're in a concrete jungle. So, so, so plants like this, in fact, the way that we measure the the forestation of the Amazon is through satellite imaging that looks at infrared light because it reflects infrared light back. So, the best thing, best situation to be in is to be outside on a green, on a day where where there's lots of green trees. We, we've known for, we've known for decades that people who live in green spaces do much better in terms of diabetes, do much better in terms of hypertension, mortality, all of these things. Depression, depression, all of these things. Yeah. And, and when you think about this, um, you, you bring up a point in terms of of of correlation. How do we know it's not depression? We used to say, well, people who live in green spaces have more money. The people have, they have more access to things. Maybe that's what we're seeing. I just have to tell you the study. There was something called the Green Heart Study in South Louisville, Kentucky. They did an amazing thing. They took this four square mile area in South Louisville, Kentucky, urbanized, uh, area, and they measured everybody's, uh, HSCP. What is HSCP? Highly sensitive C-reactive protein. It's a marker of inflammation, and it's been correlated to bad things like stroke and heart attack. So, if you have high levels of of CRP, that's not good. So, they measured every, they measured about 700 people. And then they did something extraordinary. They purchased 8,000 mature trees.\n\n\nDug holes and planted 8,000 trees into a four square mile area. And these are trees with leaves on them. Two years later, they come back and they measure all 700 people in their study. The HRCP dropped by 13 to 20%, which correlated to about a 10 to 15% reduction in strokes. These people didn't change their socioeconomic status. They didn't institute an exercise program. And so, really, it kind of shoots in the heart the idea that the advantage that we see with green spaces has to do with something else that we're not measuring. I actually believe that we'll talk about fresh air too, that things like these plants, but much bigger. This is kind of like a bonsai plant, but trees outside, they actually have a benefit, and what they represent again is these things that don't leverage the other parts of your body in terms of the chains, uh, that make all of the chains bigger because they're having a benefit. You can't get the benefit of this if you're inside a house.\n\nSo, what should we do about this in terms of how, what changes should I make in my life to capitalize on this? Um, this brand here is called Bon Charge. They do these red light devices. They do like red light saunas, blankets, um, masks. They're actually a sponsor of mine because I started wearing this, and I think they found out, and I started wearing it because of my girlfriend.\n\nYeah. She was wearing it every day, and I got curious, and so I, as I always do, I'm always super skeptical.\n\nSure.\n\nSo, I went online and started looking at some of the research, and I was shocked.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt made no intuitive sense to me that a red light mask or any red light device could have a profound, like what I see as a profound impact on my health. Like I didn't believe it. Yes. To start with. It was like woo woo stuff. To me, I couldn't disprove it. Right. All the studies, many of which you've referenced, um, supported that it was having a profound impact. And as I've said on this podcast before, my girlfriend's always right. She's like always ahead of the curve, always right. So, I started wearing her mask, and now I have my own from Bon Charge.\n\nYeah. Do you recommend these kinds of things? I, I think it's reasonable to do. I will say this. Um, if you are getting enough Infrared Light from the sun, what we find in studies, not particularly with the mass, but we find in other things is that these other areas don't have as much efficacy. It's almost to say if you're on a ship with a bunch of people with scurvy and you already have a diet that's rich in vegetables and fruits, eating an extra lemon is not going to be that beneficial.\n\nSo, what do you do?\n\nLike a lot of doctors do, we have shifts that go from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. So, you're in the hospital, you're not going to get outside. So, at lunch, I try to get outside as much as I possibly can into the sun for my 15 minutes.\n\nWhat if you live in a cloudy country?\n\nSo, that's a good point. Uh, clouds, because they are water molecules, will absorb a lot of the Infrared Light. And the problem is that that's the exactly the type of light that you want to get. However, even on a cloudy day, being outside, you're going to get more Infrared Light than if you were inside.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay. So, I still get the light I need when it's cloudy, but I just don't get a lot.\n\nYes, exactly. Is there anything I can do to get if it's super cloudy and I know I'm going to be indoors, what do I do then?\n\nYeah. So, the light, the type of lights that we have inside, like these ones, like these, uh, and and actually, I think the UK and the United States are very similar in this regard, is that we really can't get the old incandescent bulbs where on LED or or fluorescent. And if you think about what they've done in terms of these bulbs, the old incandescent bulbs used to give you a very broad uh spectrum. So, all the way from, you know, just near blue all the way down into the infrared. The way that they've made the bulbs more efficient, they said, \"Hey, let's stop using energy to give off this light that we can't see and give a very narrow spectrum of light that we can see.\" So, think about what they've done. They have, for the first time in the history of humanity, they are now, we are now being exposed to light in a very narrow spectrum without anything else. Whenever in the history of humankind, when we'd light a candle, when we would go outside into the Sunlight, when we would have a kerosene lamp, we were getting full spectrum. In other words, we were never getting blue light without red light. Now, we're starting to get blue light without red light. So,\n\nso do I change my bulbs? It's difficult to do that because you can't pick up in uh these incandescent bulbs. Which brings me to, I mean, at least in the United States, we have laws now that outlaw the regular selling of incandescent bulbs because of energy efficiency. Oh yeah. I'm on Google now, and I've typed in incandescent bulb. So, there's something called a general service lamp, which is what the type of bulbs that you could plug in. But if you decide you want to get a bulb that you put into your microwave or a bulb that you would do into a type of chandelier, that's a special type of chandelier, those are still available. You can still get incandescent bulbs for those.\n\nWhat about these kinds of bulbs? Is that an incandescent bulb?\n\nThat's a, uh, that is an incandescent bulb. Again, for these special types of lights, but I'm I'm talking about the light like the like the good old-fashioned A90, I think it's called, or light bulb that you just screw in. Those are the 120 watts. Those are getting more difficult. You, it's harder to find. You can't go down to your Home Depot and and find them there. So, Glenn Jeffrey, um, and this is a preprint that he is he's done. He actually took people with that were working in this environment with LED bulbs. He's actually, uh, it's not peer-reviewed. It's not published yet, but it's a pre-print. It's available on the internet, so I'm not speaking out of class. And what he did with 22 people is he switched out these LED bulbs and put in uh incandescent bulbs. And there was a there was a 25% improvement in color differentiation in his study.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThey were able to distinguish colors 25% better than they were when they were exposed to LED LED. When I say LED bulbs, these are the bulbs that are high on the blue end.\n\nUm, so why would that be? The retina, which is the back of your eye, where the light is coming in, there's these cones that are tremendously metabolically active. They're constantly updating, sending neuro signals to the brain. And there's a, it's the, it's the one tissue in your body with the most amount of mitochondria. And it's because they have to supply a lot of energy. As somebody gets older, that mitochondria is not producing the same amount of energy. And so the ability of the energy that those cones have to draw on to do their work is less. And so they're not going to do the job as well. If you can perhaps increase the the uh the amount of output of energy from those mitochondria, you could improve the the the be ability to visually perceive. And and and uh Glenn Jeffy's done this study already where he, for just three minutes, 670 nanometer light, very similar to that mask in the eye, only in the morning, improved those people's ability to to to visualize and actually see.\n\nAnd what does that mean for the broader picture of our house?\n\nThey, they would be able to distinguish colors better and actually improve their vision. That's basically what it means. Um, and so the question goes back to the first question that you had at the very beginning of the podcast, which is, what is the effect of low energy output from the mitochondria? Well, it depends on what tissue the mitochondria is in. And so, if it's in the eye, then it's going to be better visual perception. If it's in the brain, it's Dementia. If it's, you see, you see what I'm saying? So, what we start to see is, we start to see that a myriad of different diseases are affected by the sun. I, I challenge anyone to do this. If you look at a publication in the United States, I've seen it where they map out the amount of deaths per in a calendar day, cardiac disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, uh pneumonia, um, all sorts of diseases, infectious diseases, non-infectious diseases, you will see a very clear pattern. The maximum amount of deaths every year occurs within a month after the shortest day of the year. So, we're talking December, January. We see the most amount of influenza deaths at that time. We see the most amount of cardiac deaths at that time. We see the most amount of kidney deaths at that time. So, you might ask, well, that that's because uh that's because people get together at Christmas time and they spread the germs around more, and we have Thanksgiving in late November here in the United States, and and and and that's what's going on. The problem is, is if you look at Australia, which is on the other end. So, when is their longest day of the year? Their longest day of the year is in December. And that's when they have the least amount of deaths, despite the fact that they're all getting together for Christmas in December. So, that doesn't fly. It's exactly the opposite. The most amount of deaths occur in Australia in the southern hemisphere in June to July. That's their winter. And so, what you see is deaths are correlated to the length of the day. This is the reason why whenever they have to, whenever they show you deaths in the year, they always have to seasonally adjust it. And the length of the day is a proxy for the amount of Sunlight.\n\nAbsolutely. You're much more, you're much more likely to get Sunlight on the longest day of the year than the shortest day of the year. Especially when, and and this is well known there. There are some months, especially in people who are doing shift work, like 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. There's literally, like December and January, you will not see the sun because you are going off to work before the sun gets up, and you're you're coming home after the sun is long set. So, you're not, you're not able to see the sun, and so you could go literally weeks without seeing the sun at all.\n\nIs there an optimal time of day to get Sunlight?\n\nYes. So, optimal time of day to get Sunlight would be for those that are concerned about getting damage from ultraviolet radiation. As we talked about, when the sun is low in the sky, that's going to be beneficial because the ultraviolet cannot penetrate obliquely through the atmosphere as well as long wavelength radiation. So, when the sun is coming up, so in the mornings, in the mornings, and when the sun is going down in the evenings, that's going to be the time where you're going to get proportionally more Infrared Light and the least amount of ultraviolet light. Now, when the sun is directly overhead at noon, you're going to be getting the most amount of Infrared Light at that time, but you're also going to be getting a lot of ultraviolet radiation. And so, if you're not someone that's gone out into the sun a lot, you may want to avoid this period of time. Or, as we talked about, put on a broad rim hat, put on clothes, I mean, more clothes, because, as we said, ultraviolet light does not penetrate through clothes very well, but Infrared Light can. Does it matter where the sun is hitting on my body?\n\nShouldn't.\n\nSo, if I go outside and I'm wearing a big hat, it's obviously going to cover my eyes, my face. Yes, it'll be hitting my legs.\n\nFor the purposes of what we're talking about with the mitochondria, it will not matter. However, if we're talking about circadian rhythm, if we're talking about uh getting the circadian rhythm, that pathway is through the eyes. So, you want to maximize light through the eyes.\n\nYeah. So, so this type of a light is called the satellite. So, your question has to do with what part of the body does it need to touch? So, or need to be uh touching. So, for the effect of the mitochondria and and the metabolic effects, it it should not matter. Okay. For this type of a light, though, what we're looking at is circadian rhythm. And that's a, that's a completely different system that we're talking about. That's not mitochondrial. That has to do with the internal clock that's in your brain that is regulating when all of these things in your body happens. And this light is about 10,000 lux. Lux is a way of measuring the brightness of light. And what studies have shown is that when you shine this type of a light into your eyes, it had, it's the way of of adjusting your circadian rhythm, you know, if you if you have a clock and it's not set to the right time, there's a little thing at the back that you can pull out and you can change the time.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat pulling out and and changing the time about when things happen in your body is affected most by light. And light can actually shift it one way or the other, depending on when you're shining that light. If you're shining the light in the morning time, and this is what a lot of people do, is they'll use these, these what they call SAD lights. SAD stands for Seasonal Affective Disorder. These lights, especially in the morning, have a way of of not only setting your circadian rhythm and making sure it's on track, but also reducing depression. There's a, there's a portion in your brain that receives light information. It's called the perihabenular nucleus. It's a long name, but it's it's it's back there. And if it doesn't get stimulated, it can cause depression. And so, so for people who live at high latitudes, uh, further away, closer to the poles, where the sun is getting up very late in the morning, they're already off at work inside, this can actually be very beneficial. So, what I would recommend doing, you can pick these up pretty cheaply on Amazon for about 20 bucks, but they should generally be about 11 to 16 in from your face. And, uh, what people should be getting is about 3,000 lux hours. Uh, and what I mean by lux hours is you multiply the lux times the amount of hours that you're wearing it. So, 3,000 is\n\n\nWhere you ought to be. Because this is 10,000 lux, you only have to look at it for about a third of an hour or 20 minutes, and that should be enough. So, is this a replacement for going outside?\n\nIt's a replacement for going outside because of the fact that you're living at a very high latitude and the sun is not up and because of the job that you have, it's going to uh it's going to have that effect. But realize that this will not replace the effect that the sun has on your mitochondria. This is only to affect the effect that lack of sunlight has on depression.\n\nOkay? So, what if I'm looking at the sun out of a window?\n\nIt depends on the window. So you're not still; the window is going to be reducing the amount of luck. So I would not recommend, if you can, I would not recommend, I would not say that staying inside looking out the window is the same as going outside. That's number one. The other thing that you have to understand is a lot of these windows, especially if they're modern windows, will be specifically designed to reduce infrared light.\n\nI want you to give me some information you have as it relates to light health.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat will improve my life. Things that I can actionably do tomorrow.\n\nObviously, one of them is that I'm going to go outside and make sure I get some sunlight, ideally in the morning.\n\nYes, we talked about this SAD lamp for people, especially that live in certain countries which have less sunlight. Correct. To set their circadian rhythm and to help with things like mental health. Is there anything else I should be thinking about or can do or change?\n\nYes. So, just like we had in our pneumonic of NEW START, rest and exercise both at the same time, and yet they're sort of like opposite of each other, it's important to have darkness.\n\nOkay?\n\nIt's important to have darkness. And this is a real issue. This is one of the biggest issues is the fact there was a study that was published recently and the title was \"Dark Days and Bright Nights,\" and that correlated with uh increased mortality.\n\nThat's how most of us live.\n\nThat's the problem. We have dark days and we have bright nights. And what we really should be having is bright days and dark nights. So, just as important as it is to have bright sunlight and getting outside in the middle of the day, we also need to start working on getting darker nights as well.\n\nAnd how do we do that?\n\nTurning things off. Uh getting these screens away from our eyes. Um these are really important because the screens have a lot of light and the light, what's going on here, this is the reason why it's important. There's two reasons actually: is the light that's going into our eyes is is doing two things at night. Number one, it is shutting down melatonin production from the pineal gland. And as we just talked about, melatonin is a very powerful antioxidant that's very beneficial.\n\nThe second thing that it's doing is it's confusing your circadian rhythm. You see, your circadian rhythm is designed to see light as day. If your eyes are seeing light, your brain thinks it's the day. So, if it's 10:00 at night and your eyes are seeing light, your circadian rhythm is saying, \"I must have made a mistake. I thought it was 10:00. It must not be 10:00 because look, there is light.\" And so, what it's going to do is it's going to adjust itself and delay everything because it's saying, \"Well, it can't be 10:00 at night. It must be 6:00.\" And so therefore, when you would normally feel tired and sleepy at 10:00 at night, after a number of days of doing this, you're not going to feel sleepy until 1:00 in the morning.\n\nThese devices we have, they spit out a lot of blue light, right?\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a way to like turn that off effectively? Well, actually a lot of these come with uh with with uh tied to the clock where after a certain time of night, it will shift its its uh spectrum to a more red spectrum. So, it's giving you less blue light. The problem is is that while the sensor in your eyes are tuned more to blue light, it's not just blue light. So, really the solution, the best solution is to turn off the light. The next best solution is to have more of a red shift where, you know, put these glasses on at night. So, these are blue blockers. They're trying to eliminate blue, but I'm I'm still getting light in. And that's enough light to shut down melatonin production.\n\nSo, even with those on?\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nBut you're telling me these help?\n\nThey're better than not turning off the light.\n\nAnd you're saying I still get light in because there's light coming over the top. Even even that light there is still going to bleed and uh it's going to bleed into that part of the spectrum and cause melatonin to be shut down. Yeah.\n\nSo it's just the eyes are the sort of the barometer for correct what time of day it is.\n\nCorrect. And and the problem is is that even when you close your lids, light can still get through the lids.\n\nWhat do you think of these sleep masks?\n\nI think they're I think they're great uh in terms of the fact that we now know that closing your eyelids still can allow some light to go in. So, if you're in if you're sleeping in an environment where, you know, light is out of your control, if you're living in the city and you can close your blinds, but there's still light that's coming in, these things could actually be uh very beneficial. I don't recommend nightlights in bedrooms.\n\nYou don't recommend?\n\nI do not. Even even clock radios or air conditioners with LED displays on them. That's that's just like total light pollution to your bedroom. Your bedroom should be as dark as possible.\n\nWhat if I have those lamps that don't have blue light in them? Cuz I think my girlfriend's put some of those by the bed.\n\nYeah.\n\nDo they are they still not great?\n\nAgain, the best thing is no light. The second best thing is light with no blue light in it. And then the worst is, you know, blue light. What about candlelight?\n\nThat's interesting. Um, there was a study that was done where they compared someone reading at night with a book with a light bulb shining on it versus the LED uh, you know, like a Kindle or whatever. Okay. What they found was that there was a lot more light coming out of the Kindle than there was just reading the book with the with the lamp.\n\nAnd it read and it delayed sleep onset.\n\nSo, which delayed sleep onset?\n\nThe Kindle. the Kindle.\n\nYeah, it delayed sleep enough to actually shut down actually delay the circadian rhythm and shut down melatonin production. So the answer to your question is, is candlelight great? The only thing I'd be concerned about is just the fire risk.\n\nYeah, because you fall asleep with that thing.\n\nExactly.\n\nSo the adjacent topic there was vitamin D, which we we touched on a little bit. Do vitamin D supplements work?\n\nOh yeah, certainly they do work and they've tested them.\n\nYeah, there's a number of studies that have come out. Martino uh actually published in the British Medical Journal. This was back before 2020. Uh it was a metaanalysis of randomized control trials showed that people who supplement every day with vitamin D had lower risks of acute chest syndrome. The other uh one there was a recent study that came out that showed that people who supplemented with 2,000 international units a daily of vitamin D had a lower risk of all cause autoimmune conditions. We're talking rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, you name it.\n\nUh that that was a a study that came out that we actually reviewed that on our on our MedCram channel because I've heard before in the past that a lot of vitamin supplements we take don't even get into our bloodstream and into our bodies.\n\nYeah. So so vitamin D is very interesting. Uh it is a supplement and it is a vitamin, but it's also a hormone.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's it's it actually manipulates um um DNA production. So it's it is quite interesting, but these these are well-described randomized control trials. So if you're looking at uh the autoimmune condition, this was actually a study that was designed looking at cardiac disease. They actually had two arms, one with uh omega fatty acids and in vitamin D, and they showed that in the vitamin D group there was a statistically reduction, statistically significant reduction in autoimmune conditions.\n\nI supplement with vitamin D. And just here's the the the here's the concern I have is if you are going to supplement with vitamin D, make sure that you get your levels checked.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe reason is is because it is a fat-soluble vitamin and it is possible to take too much.\n\nWhat happens if you take too much?\n\nIt can affect uh calcium metabolism and you can have issues with calcium uh too high levels of calcium. It's very rare. Um, but it can happen. And I don't mean to say that in a sense that I would I dissuade people from supplementing because I think supplementation can be good. But at at some point, you want to get a level checked to see where you are. The other reason is is because uh based on your body habitus, based on your skin color, because uh people with darker skin, it's harder for them to make their own vitamin D. They need to be more time outside, especially if they're at high latitudes.\n\nSo like me living in the UK.\n\nExactly. I need to be outside more.\n\nIt's going to be harder for you to make as much vitamin D as as somebody who, for instance, if you were living at a lower latitude or if you had lighter skin.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat is vitamin D doing in my body?\n\nOh, good question. Lots of things. So, vitamin D, if you were to look at the the structure of vitamin D, actually I actually did research on this uh interestingly in college. I used to make starting material for the graduate students. It's it's a lipid-soluble molecule. And because it's lipid soluble, it's able to go right through into the nucleus and actually go onto the DNA and uh combine with proteins that actually affect the transcription of your DNA. So in other words, depending on which cell type we're talking about, it can cause a lot of interesting changes. So it affects calcium metabolism. There's vitamin D receptors on your immune system.\n\nSo it affects your immune system, affects calcium metabolism, a whole host of things.\n\nMy team did some research and found that approximately 1 billion people globally have a vitamin D deficiency and about 50% of the global population has insufficient levels of vitamin D.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So the the issue is is that as the world becomes more industrialized, as the world becomes more well-off, they're able to create dwellings and they're able to air condition those dwellings. And we as human beings tend to avoid extremes. We don't like things too hot. We don't like things too cold. Well, I let's face it, in our cars, we have something called climate control. We can set the we can set the temperature and that's what the temperature is going to be. There's there's other implications which we can talk about in terms of hydrotherapy perhaps if we get to that. But um the issue is is we don't like those extremes. We don't like going out into the sun and when we don't do that we uh we suffer the consequences.\n\nIs there a way for me to get vitamin D without supplementation and without going into the sun?\n\nYes. Yeah. It's in certain foods as well. Mushrooms, for instance, uh certain types of fish, they're um they they have vitamin D in them as well.\n\nThis is a strange question, but do you think our body knows which foods we're deficient in? And really what I'm saying there is if I'm vitamin D deficient, do you think there's a part of my body that knows that I I need to eat mushrooms?\n\nIt's a good question.\n\nAnd that makes me hungry for mushrooms.\n\nI don't know about that particularly. I can say this though. In people who don't get enough sleep, we tend to have a predilection to eating more carbohydrate-rich foods. That one we do know. Okay. And and we can and this is the reason why people who this is the reason why many scientists believe that people who don't get enough sleep tend to have food choices that tend to put weight on.\n\nEvery single one of you watching this right now has something to offer, whether it's knowledge or skills or experience.

So, tell me what you mean by water because people will think, \"Yeah, I drink enough water.\"\n\nWell, first of all, we I don't think we do drink enough water. But I what what everyone talks about, you know, the internal use of water and it makes sense, but as I was talking about before, the the external use of water can actually be very impressive and it has to do with body temperature and it has to do with the immune system. So we'll talk about water, but let's sort of set the framework for that conversation. Your immune system is broken up into two fa into two types. There's the innate immune system and the adaptive. We've become very familiar with the adaptive immune system during COVID because all of the talk was about antibodies and antigens and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 was mutating and would the vaccines that made antibodies against them be uh still functional. All of that where we have like where we literally have a key with a keyhole that it fits into and turns the lock and these antibodies and they fit. That's all the adaptive immune system. It's very important, but\n\n\nIt completely, uh, eliminates or removes from discussion the innate immune system.\nThe innate immune system is really the body's first defense.\nAnd what's happening there is there's these cells that are circulating, cells like monocytes and natural killer cells and a number of other cells which scour the body always looking for something that looks foreign to it.\nAnd it can tell based on the molecular patterns of these, uh, invaders that they're not supposed to be there and they should be eaten up.\nThe major effector of this innate immune system is something called interferon.\nInterferon is a very important molecule in the body, and it is effective.\nIt is so effective at preventing viral infections that just about every single viral infection that plagues the human body today has a defense mechanism against interferon.\nIt is a prerequisite.\nThere's no self-respecting virus that can think that it's can infect the human body without dealing with the issue of interferon.\nPeriod.\nThink about interferon as the security guard at the bank.\nAnd if you are want to rob a bank, you've got to have a plan for how you're going to deal with the security guard.\nOtherwise, you're not getting the money.\nDoes that make sense?\nYeah.\nSo there was actually an article that was published a couple years ago where they talked about this battle between interferon and emerging viruses and what viruses are doing to try to get around interferon.\nYou may recall that back in 2002, we had an outbreak of something called SARS, which especially was pretty bad in China, but also in Canada.\nThe reason why we were able to secure that outbreak was because that everybody who came down with SARS developed a fever, and so it was easy to tell who those people were, and we were able to hospitalize and isolate them.\nThe issue with COVID-19 and indeed many infections like the common cold is that you don't necessarily get a fever.\nAnd fever is really important.\nAnd you're like, what does this have to do with water?\nWe're going to talk about this.\nInterferon production goes up with temperature.\nAnd in fact, the body's fever mechanism is one of the ways that it tells the body that it needs to increase interferon to deal with the viral infection.\nIs that why you feel hot?\nYou feel hot.\nYou may actually feel cold.\nAnd the reason why you might feel cold and even have chills is because the way you feel is a product of what your temperature is and what your thermostat in your body is set to.\nSo if your body in your if your body's thermostat is saying, okay, here we are at 98.6, or I guess in terms of Celsius, 37°, and you develop an infection, the body's going to say, whoa, we have an infection and we need to increase the body temperature.\nWe're going from 37° or 98.6 up to 38° or or 100.4, because your actual body temperature is below where your body wants it to be, you're going to feel cold.\nYou're going to shiver to try to increase that temperature.\nSo, you go up with that.\nNow, once the fever is done and the infection is done and it comes down, you're going to have, you're going to break a sweat.\nSo, that's why when someone, oh, he's sweating, that means the fever is breaking.\nThat means your temperature is coming down.\nSo you typically, you'll feel cold.\nYou'll feel like you're shivering.\nYou'll want to get into bed and and and put the covers on, and that's when your temperature goes up.\nThat and and that's for a reason, because what happens when the temperature goes up in your body is that creates an environment where the virus that can't replicate very well.\nAll viruses really cannot replicate very well at high temperatures, including COVID-19.\nIt's also a signal to your body to produce more interferon.\nSo there was a study that was published, uh, last year where they looked in mice, which by the way, have the same body temperature as we do, and they found that there was like five different regulatory proteins, all of which led to one endpoint, and that was to produce this thing called interferon.\nAll of them jumped in production when your body went from 37 degrees to 38 degrees.\nThat's basically right below a fever, right?\nSo, the point, the take-home point that I got from all of that was that we should not really be treating fevers unless they're so high that there's other complications that could occur, like, you know, uh, racing heart rates or or um or having seizures.\nBut we do this all the time.\nWe treat fevers because it feel makes us feel bad, and we think that by treating the fever, we'll feel better.\nBut what we're actually doing is we're we're cutting the legs out from our immune system, because part of the immune system response is to generate a fever, and the and the fever generates interferon.\nNow I I don't want to overstate this, but let's compare the innate immune system to the adaptive immune system.\nThe adaptive immune system is pretty specific for a particular variant of a virus.\nAnd for a virus that mutates very rapidly like COVID-19, the immunization may be very good in terms of binding, but if that that virus mutates, that binding is going to be affected in some way.\nIt may not affect hospitalization, but maybe in terms of of preventing infection, you you understand what I'm saying.\nSo the different variants, we had the alpha variant, then we had the the delta variant, then we had omicron, etc.\nThose are material changes for the adaptive of the immune system.\nFor the innate immune system, for interferon, it doesn't matter.\nInterferon is just as effective against alpha as it was for delta as it would be for omocrron.\nSo, so let's set this up again.\nWater.\nWe said that water has a very high specific heat, which means that if I apply hot water onto the human body, it's able to transfer heat.\nThis is why people can get burned with boiling.\nWe don't obviously want to burn anybody, but if we're able to put them into a sauna, if we're able to put them into a spa, if we're able to use hot towels and apply to the human body to heat up their body to cause a sweat, in other words, if we're able to induce artificial fevers in patients who have these infections, there seems to be evidence that the interferon response will be will be better.\nUh, there was a study that was done looking at lymphosytes and taking them out of the human body and at different temperatures, once it hit about 38, 39 degrees, there was off the charts, uh, 10, 10-fold increase in interferon, which is exactly what you would want to have.\nNow how do I know that interferon levels are so important in things like co 19?\nWell, there was a study that was done that showed that high levels of interferon correlated with more mild, uh, uh, COVID-19 infections, and that people that had low interferon levels had very severe COVID-19 infections.\nSo, you suggesting that we should be in the sauna more often?\nYes.\nAnd it's based on data that is has been well documented in in the Finnish sauna, uh, um, uh, realm.\nSo people who use sauna four, five, six, seven times a week are more likely to have less, uh, death from cardiovascular disease than people who use sauna once a week.\nAnd and in Finland, once a week is kind of the standard.\nAnd why do they say to do hot and cold therapy together?\nSo they would, uh, I I would argue that, uh, the reason why it has been argued to do this, and this goes back to, uh, a number of papers that have been written back over 100 years ago, is what you're doing when you're doing hot for a long period of time, let's say 20 minutes in the sauna, and what you're doing is you're heating up the body and, uh, and and the whole purpose of that is to increase the body temperature.\nWhat the what the cold at the end does is it does two things they believe.\nThe first thing that it does is it causes vasoc constriction.\nSo you put a brief amount of cold onto the body, it's going to cause vasoc constriction superficially so that when you're done, you're not going to lose as much heat through those blood vessels, and so you're going to keep the core body temperature higher for long, which is exactly what you want to do.\nThe other thing that cold water does again is the vasoc constriction.\nWhen you, it's well known that when you take a cold shower, your blood vessels constrict.\nAnd when when you look at a blood vessel on end in in a person who's living and circulating, there are a number of white blood cells that are latched on to the inside surface of that blood vessel.\nWhen that blood vessel contracts, a lot of those white blood cells that were stuck get kicked off into circulation and they go off and they do whatever it is that they're going to do.\nIt's called dearenation.\nSo, two things for cold right at the end.\nDoesn't have to be very long, maybe just a minute.\nIt causes, uh, actually to keep your body temperature higher for longer, ironically.\nAnd number two, demargination.\nSo that's water, which is the W.\nUm, of these, which one do you want to pick next?\nWhich one do you find most compelling?\nLet's talk about air.\nOkay.\nUh, real briefly.\nSo we said that air is not just the lack of toxins, but actually benefits.\nSo first of all, we want to have good oxygen.\nWe want to get rid of carbon dioxide, especially in buildings when there's no ventilation.\nThat's not good.\nBut there's been actually a number of studies looking at plants and trees and the fact that they can give off things like phitonides.\nWhat's that?\nThese are aromatic compounds that the tree actually gives off.\nAnd when we look to see the effect of these compounds on the human body, they're actually very beneficial.\nThey interact with our immune system and elevate our immune system, and it actually can make us more relaxed.\nThere's there's a lot of data in the Japanese literature on on this in the what they call the hanoki cypress forests where they looked at um these CEOs.\nThere's a podcast about CEOs.\nThere's these CEOs in Japan, and they took them from their their jobs and basically took them up into the mountains of the Hanoki Cyprus and had them walk around, took blood tests, and they found that the natural killer cells, which are so important in terms of immunity, were not only increased in number, but they were also the the um the the enzymes within them that break down diseases and viruses was also increased.\nSo when they brought them back down to, uh, the city in Japan, they put them up in hotels and they infused some of these, uh, these chemicals, these um naturally produced phitonides, they're called, and they had almost exactly the same effects in in these uh in these uh subjects.\nSo you think plants and being out in nature could actually be giving us much more than just clean air.\nIt's giving us chemicals which help us fight disease.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, so again, here's this dichotomy inside versus outside.\nWhat do you get when you're outside?\nWe've already talked about exercise.\nWe've already talked about uh sunlight, and now we're adding to it fresh air.\nNot just the fact that you have uh low pollutants, which is certainly very important, but the fact that when you're around green plants, when you're around green trees, there could actually be a benefit.\nBy the way, the benefit that they found lasted for about 7 days.\nSo just going out one day a week um can actually have that benefit.\nI think a lot about carbon dioxide because obviously because I I spend a lot of time sat in the studio recording and um this is our big LA studio, but uh in the UK, it started in a really small room.\nYes.\nAnd there wasn't air conditioning, and obviously I sit here sometimes for several hours with a guest and we're recycling CO2 at that point.\nYes.\nAnd then I read a couple of studies that showed the impact that would have on my cognitive performance and that's all true.\nWe actually had on our on our channel uh with MedCram, we had Dr. Joseph Allen out of the Harvard uh public school of health.\nUm, and he he showed us, I mean, he literally had the the CO2 meter and just by cracking the window uh just a little bit allowed carbon dioxide to escape and brought down those carbon dioxide levels.\nSo very important.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd for people that work in offices or, you know, travel in hotel rooms or are inside a lot, what should they be thinking about and how can they go about making sure that the air quality is optimal?\nWell, uh, the surrogate for that is carbon dioxide as we mentioned.\nSo, cracking open a window if they're able to, if there's a door that they can, uh, open up safely without, you know, compromising security.\nThese are all things that, uh, would be very, very beneficial.\nEven rolling down the window uh in in uh in in the car and and maybe taking making sure that we're taking the uh the recirculation button off when we're when we're driving.\nI've got friends that won't won't stay in certain hotel rooms unless the window opens, cuz you know in a lot of hotel rooms, especially ones that are high up, you can't open the windows.\nAnd there's also a bunch of devices that we um in our UK studio, which is smaller, we found on Amazon for, you know, not super expensive that we just sometimes put on the floor in the studio just to see how we're doing.\nI'll link some of that stuff on screen if anyone's interested in getting seeing what the uh CO2 levels are in whatever room you're working in.\nYeah.\nWhat is uh what's next on your list then here?\nWell, we've talked about, I mean, exercise, nutrition, temperance.\nThese are things that a lot of people talk about.\nNot many people talk about trust.\nWhen you say trust, you really mean religious faith and religious faith, uh, something that would give you a way of of dealing with uh stress and and anxiety.\nThat's really where this comes down.\nThere's been actually a number of studies that have looked at that.\nSo, yeah, basically the Bible, um, or it doesn't have to be uh the Bible as well.\nThere's there's other faith um denominations that that look into this as well.\nA number of studies that have looked at trust in God and how that relates to anxiety.\nSo a number of studies have shown that people who have a good faith and trust in a god that is uh or or in a religion that is supportive and not nonsupportive can they have less anxiety, less depression, have a faith community that they can um engage with and and be supportive.\nUm, and I think that that's that the literature is uh where whereas you have this the science behind that is not as strict as it would be for like a randomized placebo control trial.\nThere's a lot of associations that you have to say here.\nUm, that it certainly is one of those pillars that I believe helps with all of those links.\nWhat do you think's going on there?\nSo you're telling me that from what the literature is saying, people who have a faith in a\n\n\nGod.\nYes.\nAre insulated from depression and anxiety in some interesting ways?\nYeah.\nThat's a question that a lot of people have tried to answer, and they believe that it comes down to if you have a trust in God that is looking out for you and is there on your side, then that type of a relationship does lead, let's say, I shouldn't say does lead to because that implies causation.\nLet's say it's associated with a reduction in depression, a reduction in anxiety, particularly.\nUm, there are some studies that have been done, particularly in Christianity, where there was a study that was published, this is Krauss, and out of, I believe, University of Texas, where he did a survey, and he asked people how they forgive, and he basically divided them into two different groups.\nThere were people that would forgive conditionally and people that would forgive unconditionally.\nLet me put it into practical terms.\nSomeone does something to you, and you say, \"That's okay, I forgive you.\"\nThe question is, would you forgive that?\nThere are some people that would only forgive if that person came back and, you know, did some sort of act of contrition, like, \"Okay, I'll forgive that person, they came back and apologized,\" or, \"I'll forgive that person, they came back and they did, you know, whatever it is,\" that would be considered conditional forgiveness.\nThe other type is unconditional forgiveness.\nSo, in other words, someone does something to you, you don't see them again, or they've never expressed any kind of, you know, being apologetic for what they did, they still get forgiven.\nSo, that's unconditional forgiveness.\nWhat they found in this study when they divided that is that the people that forgave unconditionally had less depression.\nThey had less feelings of inadequacy.\nThey had less anxiety regarding end of life.\nThey had all of these, they had more, the people that forgave conditionally had more somatization of depression.\nSo, these were real medical, you know, things that they could actually diagnose with surveys and tests that are well validated, and what would decide between these two was how they forgave.\nSo, they were puzzled by this.\nThey said, \"Well, then what determines whether or not someone is going to forgive conditionally versus unconditionally?\"\nSo, they looked at a bunch of factors, and none of them stood out except for one, and the odds ratio on this was like 2.5, and it boiled down to this one question: \"Do you believe that God has forgiven you?\"\nThat was the major thing.\nIf somebody believed that the God that they had faith in had forgiven them, they were two and a half times more likely to forgive somebody unconditionally, which then meant, which then was associated with all of these other things being low, like less depression, less anxiety.\nSo, to me, that's fascinating that that in their minds, this is what's actually happening.\nAnd so, there have been randomized control trials where they have, when people are doing therapy, like you say, have you have anxiety, there is cognitive behavioral therapy that we can do for those people.\nBut what has been shown in a randomized placebo-controlled fashion is that if somebody is of a faith, and you inject into that cognitive behavioral therapy aspects of that faith, the cognitive behavioral therapy is even more effective.\nSo, I guess I should preface this by saying, I don't believe that any of this stuff should be placed on people without their permission.\nSo, I'm working, I work in a healthcare environment.\nSo, do I go and pray for people who don't believe?\nNo.\nThis is something that always has to be done, has to be asked permission.\nDo you think people who believe in God are healthier generally?\nAll other factors, it would seem the data would indicate that people who have a healthy relationship with their church, who have a healthy relationship in God, are associated with less disease.\nBecause from a causation point of view, you could say, well, causation.\nYeah.\nSo, this is what we don't, we, they probably have more friends.\nThey probably have.\nYeah.\nSo, the question is, is whether or not people who are healthier and have more friends are more likely to be religious, or is it the other way around?\nAnd sometimes it's difficult to tell those things.\nBut I imagine there's a great calming force that comes from believing in a higher power.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd the other thing that's interesting about all of these, like, new start stuff, is when you look at other particular religions, how a lot of these things are actually incorporated in this, like, for instance, the Hindus are very famous for getting up in the morning and welcoming the sun, and we just talked about the benefits of sunlight.\nWe didn't talk too much about nutrition, but fasting is an important part of that, and Muslims are obviously, um, part of their religion is actually doing fasting during Ramadan.\nReligions have hot and cold practices as well, don't they?\nYes.\nYeah.\nAt least through history.\nAnd on the flip side of that, I would say that it's also shown that if you have an unhealthy relationship, like if you have, if you believe in a god who is vindictive or who's out to get you or who's going to do something to you unless you do something else, that has also been shown to be negatively impactful.\nSo, it depends on the relationship that you've got.\nWhat do you see in your practice?\nBecause you said something earlier that you, you're often there at the end of people's lives.\nYeah.\nSome, unfortunately, sometimes I'm the last person they see, and it's, you start to realize that you cannot, I mean, that death is inevitable, and all we do in medicine is delay the inevitable.\nSo, what we try to do, and, um, and I have a colleague who's very philosophical about this, is we try to make sure that when these things happen, that they happen with dignity, and we celebrate the person's life, and making sure that it's done in the way that they would want to have it done.\nWhat do people say as they're about to die?\nPeople become very, it's very different for different people, but they can become very circumspect, and I've seen such contrasts.\nPeople are ready to go, people feel like they've done what they've come to do, and they don't want anything further to do, like, we're there to, to, to delay death, right?\nWe're there to put them on a ventilator or to give them this medication, and you would be surprised, people who are, look, you know, relatively healthy, but something is happening that we could easily correct, they're like, \"No, I, I, I don't want that.\nI choose not to have that.\"\nAnd we have to respect, obviously, what they choose.\nObviously, we have to educate them to make sure that they're making the right choice.\nBut once they have given all the information, ultimately, they're the one that makes the decision.\nSo, you see people choose death.\nWhen we can intervene in artificial ways, they would rather not have that, and they would choose death.\nYes.\nAre there any particular cases that changed you?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThere was, there was a case that changed me, but not in the way that we've just been talking about, where was horrible.\nThis is actually a miracle.\nI've actually seen a miracle happen.\nAnd for me, it happened early in my training.\nSo, it made me think twice about being a prognosticating physician.\nA prognosticating physician.\nYeah.\nSaying, \"Oh, you're never going to walk again,\" or, \"You've only got two years to live.\"\nI must have missed that day in med school.\nI just didn't show up that day.\nThis was a young guy.\nHe was, he had, he had, um, testicular cancer, and he went to the operation.\nThe testicular cancer surgery was a success.\nUnfortunately, during the operation, something happened.\nHe didn't get enough oxygen to the brain, and he came out of the operation with an anoxic injury of the brain.\nUh, this guy must have been in his 20s, and he had a young wife.\nUm, and I had come on to the rotation as a, as a, as a resident, and we had attendings, and you have to realize in medicine, you have attendings above you, and what they say is just, you know, that's the word, that's what happens.\nAnd the ICU attendant, we were the ones that were sort of taking care of the patient because he was on a ventilator, but there was the neuro neurologist who looked at everything and says, \"Look, this guy is not waking up.\nHe has severe anoxic brain injury.\nWe've looked at the scans.\nThis is what's going to him.\"\nAnd so, um, every day we'd run on this guy, and he was just, he was just a shaking mess.\nHe was just there, and he was just kind of shaking.\nHis eyes were rolling.\nNo response, nothing.\nAnd every day his wife would come in, young wife, and she, she just didn't believe that this guy was going to be like this for the rest of his life.\nHe was going to wake up eventually.\nAnd so, she, he would, she would be at his bedside, like, attending to him and making sure this, that, and the other, and even asking us to put, you know, some special concoction that she made at home into his tube feeding so that this could go and help him, make him better.\nAnd we would, we would go along with her, but I was looking into my attendings, and they're like, \"She doesn't understand what's going on.\nShe doesn't understand that he's never going to wake up.\"\nSo, this is what I'm seeing.\nUh, one day she came in, and she, and she just had this smile on her face.\nShe was just so at peace and a smile, and they were Hispanic couples.\nSo, we had to ask a translator what was going on.\nAnd she told us, she said, \"Um, I had a dream last night.\nI had a dream that he was going to come home.\"\nAnd she was convinced, just absolutely happy, beaming.\nAnd we're like, \"Man, this lady is crazy.\nShe doesn't understand what's going on.\"\nWell, days went on, weeks went on, and one day, and where I was rounding, it was, it's just in this round, nursing, the nursing station's in the middle, and the doors to the rooms are all around in a periphery.\nAnd we were going around the circle, rounding on the patients, and I could look in, and I saw him, and he was kind of shaking, but he was kind of opening his eyes, and I said, \"He seems to be focusing a little bit.\nHis eyes seem to be focusing a little bit more than they would be.\"\nAnd he kind of, I, I just said, I just kind of put my hand up like this, and I just kind of, and sure enough, he put his hand up like this, shaking, and he put it back down again.\nI'm like, \"What?\"\nHe waved at you.\nYeah.\n\"What?\"\nAnd I said, \"Let's go check this out again.\"\nLong story short, took months, but that guy walked out of that hospital.\nSix months later, he and his wife came back, walked onto the unit like, like there was nothing wrong with the guy.\nAnd he gave us a big basket of flowers to thank that unit for what they had done for him.\nIn my mind, I knew that for most of that staff, for most of that time, they people were just going through the motions, keeping him alive because that's what she wanted.\nObviously, when there were signs that this guy was recovering, it was a complete shift.\nPeople were amazed.\nAnd so, what that did to me in my career was it made me think twice, like, what, why did this guy get better?\nNow, he was 22.\nHe was young, and typically, if something like that is going to happen, it's going to happen in someone who's very young, whose mind is plastic, who can, who can survive that type of a situation.\nBut it really, it was a miracle.\nI can't, I can't say anything else.\nI mean, it's not something that we would, nor, all of the experts said that this wasn't going to happen, but it happened.\nWhat do you think happened?\nI think he had a loving wife who believed in him, and something happened outside of the physical and the mental.\nMaybe the spiritual, I don't know.\nIt happens.\nIt's very rare.\nAnd when it does happen, it happens in young people.\nThat would be what the medical part of my brain would say.\nBut the other part of my brain says, \"You know what?\nI only know about 10%, maybe 5% of the world's, know, world's knowledge, 1% of the world's knowledge, maybe I have 5 to 10% of all of the medical knowledge in this world, and I would say probably the explanation is somewhere in that other 80 to 90% that I just don't know.\"\nI think what it taught me was that we have to be humble about what it is that we know.\nThere's things that we know we know, and there's things that we don't know that we don't know.\nWe talked a little bit about this chemical earlier on, melatonin.\nYeah.\nI just wanted to close off because I had a question on it.\nUm, a lot of people take melatonin supplements at nighttime to help them sleep.\nYes.\nGood, bad, and different.\nI think it's good in certain situations.\nSo, if you're having difficulty falling asleep, a little tiny dose of melatonin, no more than five milligrams, can be actually very beneficial.\nIf you're wanting to shift your circadian rhythm back, instead of it being pushed back, but you want it to be advanced forward, melatonin can be very beneficial.\nIt's very beneficial for jet lag.\nIt's also beneficial for a few sleep diseases, but I would not recommend routinely, for no other reason, taking large doses of melatonin.\nWhat's the trade?\nYou said earlier on that everything has side effects, right?\nAnd it impacts another part of, so taking high doses of melatonin can actually make you more irritable and irritable.\nIrritable.\nYeah.\nIn what regard?\nJust mentally irritable.\nYeah.\nWhat does that look like?\nThings set you off, um, more easily.\nSo, like a mood disorder.\nAbsolutely.\nAnything else with melatonin that you're aware of?\nNot that we have studies for.\nPeople have concerns that sometimes taking too much melatonin may actually affect the melatonin secretion from the pineal gland itself.\nI don't have evidence of that as yet to see if that's actually the case.\nDr. Roger, is there anything else that we haven't discussed that we should have discussed?\nWe've discussed a lot.\nUm, I think, I think putting it all together is again the links, and if we have those links, medications have their place, but the way that they work is by breaking down other parts of the chain to strengthen the weak chain that can have an effect, especially at the end of life, if you want to sustain life.\nBut if you're interested in longevity, if you're interested in making and living the best life, then you want to strengthen all of those chains.\nAnd I believe the key to doing that is something called new start.\nWe have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last\n\n\nGuest leaves a question for the next guest, not knowing who they're leaving it for. And the question that was left for you is, what is the area of your focus that you are most dying to talk about, which you are almost never asked about?\n\nThis book, the Bible, uh, which is my, uh, which is my tradition, evidence for science in the Bible.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThis, we, what we've been talking about is the body and the health in the body. Um, I like to put to the test some of the statements in the Bibles to see if they work scientifically, like turning water into wine.\n\nNo. Well, potentially. Uh, that's a miracle. What I was referring to is this. And, and this is what I've actually done, and it's actually quite interesting is, uh, you know, Paul, who is one of the New Testament writers in the Bible, wrote to the Corinthians, \"Don't you, don't you understand that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?\"\n\nI said, \"That's, that's a really interesting statement.\" How would he come to that conclusion? Like, what does that mean, \"the temple of the Holy Spirit?\" So, the only temple at that time was the temple in Jerusalem, where they would have the sacrifices and things. So, what I did was, I went back, and this is, and this is answering the question, is I'm looking for evidence of scientific truth, probably unknowingly, by some of the writers in the Bible, to see whether or not there is truth. Does, does that make sense what I'm saying? So, if you look, and most of Exodus 25 through 30 is this painstakingly detailed description of the sanctuary that Moses built in the wilderness that he supposedly he got from God. This is what he says. So, here's a great way to see whether or not this, this all fleshes out. Moses is saying, \"Here's the description of the pattern that I got for the temple.\" And Paul is saying, \"Your body is a temple.\" So, here's my hypothesis. If we look at the pattern in the temple, should it match the human body that they had no understanding of at the time that Paul wrote this? Like, we didn't know about cells until Van Leuen Hook in the 1600s. We didn't know about the circulation of the heart until the 1600s with, um, with William Harvey. Okay.\n\nYet, if you look in the human body, you have the blood system. You have blood circulating around in the vascular system, and then it, and then it goes into the interstatial fluid, and then the interstitial fluid then goes to the cell, which is there's a, there's a plasma membrane on the cell that you can't penetrate through, but unless you actually have the proteins to go, and then it goes into the cell, which is a compartment with two compartments within it. Right? You got the cell and the nucleus. Right? This is exactly the same structure that Moses was given in, in the wilderness. And, and by the way, uh, Hindu temples are actually similarly designed. There's sort of this three-part situation. So, you have this altar of sacrifice, which is where the blood is. That's, that's the blood in the human body. Next, you move to the labor, which is this container full of water, and that's the interstitial space. After you go from the blood into the interstitial space, any pharmacologist will know that this is exactly the pattern that you move to. The next thing that comes is this structure that has a veil that you can't penetrate through unless you, you go through it. That's the cell, 'cause this the structure is the building, and it's got a room within a room. And that's exactly what the cell is. The cell is this nucleus surrounded by the cytoplasm. Well, in this room that you go into at first, there's pieces of furniture in there that are very similar to the types of organelles that you see in the, in, in the cytoplasm of the cell. For instance, there's this seven-branch candlestick that's in there that's burning olive oil and producing energy. That's like beta oxidation producing energy. That's exactly what you see in the mitochondria. But the final thing is you move into the nucleus. And this temple has something called the most holy place, where there's this altar of, where, where there's this arc of the covenant. You've seen Indiana Jones, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and the first, uh, Raiders of the Lost Ark, there's this ark, and you open it up, and this is where the two tablets of stone, the ten commandments rested. So, in that area, you have two tablets of stone written by the hand of God, the code of life, and according to Jewish and, and Christian belief, that this is the law, and if you break the law, that's how sin is, and the consequences of sin is disease and death. Well, when we get to the nucleus of the human body, you have two strands of DNA. And on the strands of DNA is the code, the nucleotides of which is the code of life. If you manipulate that code, that leads to mutations, which leads to disease and death. None of this was known until 1950 when they discovered DNA. And yet we have Paul who's making this jump and saying, \"Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.\" I just, I just find that fascinating. Nobody ever asked me about that. But that's what, as soon as you ask that question, that's the first thing that pops up. There's, by the way, there's so many other places in, in, in the scriptures where I see that alluded to. Um, it's fascinating. Paul, Paul talks about the body of Christ and how it's one body, but it's made up of parts. There's the hand, the foot. He didn't know about cells, but that's exactly what the human body is. The human body is one body made up of many parts. Van Leuenhook didn't discover that until the 1600s. We didn't have cell theory until the 1800s. So, this is, it's interesting to me how statements are made in ancient texts which have scientific relevance far below the surface. I just find that interesting.\n\nThank you so much, and I hope to speak to you again very, very soon. Thank you for all the work you're doing, because you've made, uh, some of these difficult scientific subjects so unbelievably accessible. You have a real art for simplifying, and simplifying in a way that means that millions of people, uh, you've got millions of subscribers on your YouTube channel. Millions of people can access this information, which is often confined within the walls of some academic study. So, thank you for the work you're doing, because it's gonna, it's, I'm sure it's already had a profound impact on many, many millions of people's lives, and I'm sure my audience are deeply appreciative. So, thank you so much, Roger. I appreciate you.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Thank you for having me on and having this opportunity.\n\nMake sure you keep what I'm about to say to yourself. I'm inviting 10,000 of you to come even deeper into the D of a CEO. Welcome to my inner circle. This is a brand new private community that I'm launching to the world. We have so many incredible things that happen that you are never shown. We have the briefs that are on my iPad when I'm recording the conversation. We have clips we've never released. We have behind-the-scenes conversations with the guests and also the episodes that we've never ever released and so much more. In the circle, you'll have direct access to me. You can tell us what you want this show to be, who you want us to interview, and the types of conversations you would love us to have. But remember, for now, we're only inviting the first 10,000 people that join before it closes. So, if you want to join our private closed community, head to the link in the description below or go to daccircle.com. I will speak to you then.\n\nI see messages all the time in the comments section that some of you didn't realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel, that would be tremendously appreciated.
