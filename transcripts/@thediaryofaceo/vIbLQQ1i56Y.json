  "cleanText": "We're all at the mercy of our own minds. But the problem is that in modern life, we're constantly made to feel we're not good enough. Something's always missing, and I will be happy or unhappy if this or that happens to me. So, we become prisoners of life. And you learn this the hard way. Yes. When I was in a long retreat, cut off from the world for four years, and memories were coming up from the past, it would build into horrific amounts of depression, anxiety, pain. And I jumped over the wall and tried to escape because of what happened to me when I was 14. Are you comfortable talking about this? Gelong Thubten is a Buddhist monk who spent over 30 years helping Hollywood stars, CEOs, and corporations stay in control within a world overloaded with stress, addiction, anxiety, and burnout. Here we go. I became controlled by distraction, controlled by negative thinking. What is life going to do to me next? How will I handle it? And things only changed when I hit rock bottom. I had spent so much effort trying to push that suffering away because it's so disgusting and so shameful, but it was just making it worse. So many of us run away from pain though. But the reality is you can run to the end of the earth and that thing that has been tormenting you will always trip you up. And so I went back into that retreat knowing the methods are there. I just need to know how to use them and I could learn to conquer this. And that's where meditation comes in. Do you think you can teach me? Because I very much feel like I'm on the receiving end of life. First of all, chuck all those things away. There's a lot of spiritual tat, isn't there? I mean, I said it. I actually hated meditation when I first did it because there's a lot of misconceptions and actually all you're doing is these three things to be less controlled by negative thinking. And the beauty of this is that they can show in brain scans. There'll be visible changes in your brain. So, let's try this.\n\nListen to my regular listeners. I know you don't like it when I ask you to subscribe at the start of these conversations. I don't like saying it. I don't like it being in there. None of us like it. It's frustrating. Do you know what's also frustrating? It's also frustrating when I go into the back end of the YouTube channel and I see that 56% of you that listen frequently to this podcast haven't yet subscribed. And so many of you don't even know that you haven't subscribed because I see in the comment section you say to me, you go, \"I didn't even realize I didn't subscribe.\" And that actually fuels the show. It's basically like you're making a donation to the show. So that's why I ask all the time because it enables us to build and build and build and build and we're going for the long term here. So all I'd ask you is if you've seen this show before and you like it, help me, help my team here. Hit the subscribe button and we'll continue to build this show for you. That's my promise. Thank you to all of you guys that do subscribe. Means the world to me. Let's get on with the show.\n\nGelong Thubten, why is your work more important now than ever before? Why is your message more important now than ever before? I think, uh, because we're now living in times where we need meditation more than ever because of the speeding up of life, obviously with technology and the way we live, and also I think because meditation has become more widespread, there are loads of misconceptions about it. So I do try to put some effort into kind of clarifying some of those misconceptions. When you look out into the world and you perform your sort of own analysis on what the world, the Western world is getting right and getting wrong, what are some of your sort of big picture feelings, thoughts, and concerns? Well, the way we are all buried in our phones is quite something, isn't it? And the way we interact with information has changed so much. So we are kind of bombarded or invaded by a constant flow of information which has a lot of persuasive undercurrents to it. And this is affecting our stress levels and also affecting our confidence levels. We're constantly made to feel we're something's missing. Something's always missing. We're not good enough. If you get this, you'll be okay. If and when this happens to you, then and only then can you be happy. So we've kind of lost our power. We talked a little bit about the word purpose as well. What is your perspective on the state of human purposefulness?\n\nSo I think, um, this issue around purpose, I think it is connected to the breakdown of religion in that I would say, well, I think we'd all say that religion used to be very much the center of the table and it sort of gave everybody their a sense of their place in the universe and the question of purpose was never such an issue because everything was in context according to one's religious belief, and of course now we're in a post-religious culture and it's much more about the individual and there are good things about that, of course, but what happens then is we become very obsessed with our purpose and the word purpose itself suggests I want something, I want what do I want, and in Buddhism we look at that wanting mind and see how insatiable it is and how the more you want, the more you're going to want, and so from a Buddhist perspective, we're all looking for purpose, but maybe externally because we get what we want and then want something else. And maybe what we're actually looking for is something deeper within, but we don't know how to access it. So, is it wrong then to be in search of purpose? Is it a misguided pursuit?\n\nNo, I wouldn't say that. But I would say what's misguided for us is that we are obsessed with the idea that happiness comes from the outside and on the other side of the coin, suffering too. So I will be happy if I get this or get that or this situation or that situation, and I will be unhappy if this or that happens to me. So we become at the sort of receiving end of life. What life is going to do to me next, how will I handle it? So, so there's not much strength there. And I think the message of meditation is that you become your own purpose and you become the generator of your own experiences because you learn how to take hold of your own mind. In this conversation, do you think you can teach me how to do that? Because I very much feel like in my life I'm on the receiving end of life. Well, I'd love to show you how or maybe help you to see that meditation is easier than you thought or more applicable to daily situations than you thought. When we think about the state of well-being in the Western world, everybody knows these stats around suicidality. Um, if we look at the US for example, they've slipped further in the unhappiness rankings than ever before. The US fell to 24th place in 2025 in global happiness rankings. In 2011, the US had been 11th place and now they're 24th. And the UK followed the same pattern. The UK dropped to 23rd in global happiness rankings, which is its lowest position in a long time. But then more sort of horrifically, the suicide numbers in the UK, the US are tremendously alarming. In the UK, suicide has reached its highest level in many, many decades.\n\nSomething is going on here. Absolutely. So, so we we have developed the most, you know, materially comfortable culture in history. We are materially more comfortable than ever and yet emotionally more uncomfortable. So, something hasn't added up. You know, we've created a comfortable to a certain extent outer world for ourselves and we can achieve high levels of material comfort and somehow the more of that we have, the more emotionally uncomfortable, and I think this is all to do with the mechanisms of desire. So, so when we are in a culture that is constantly promising us the next piece of enjoyment, the next hit, the next bars, the next thing, we're caught in a sort of cycle of wanting more. I was described this, the search for happiness, that the problem in that is the search itself because searching is a habit that will lead to more searching. So we're always looking for the next thing. So we get what we want. Not always, but sometimes. And then very soon we want something else. So the more we're wanting, the more we're feeling we don't have. So we end up possibly with a lot but feeling quite empty inside. And then we're back to this question. What is my purpose? What's it all for? I've I've reached the the I've reached the the goal I wanted to reach, but I still feel empty. I still feel something is missing. We're told something is missing all the time. Because to keep a consumer message going, you have to tell people they're lacking in something. And the insistency with which that message is fed to us through our phones basically and through the media that we consume is going to affect us. I think 90% of people listening right now would say that their meaning in life comes from the pursuit of something, the journey towards something. It might not come from the attainment of it, being successful, being on the podium, but they would say that the meaning they experience, the joy, the thing that gets them out of bed is in the pursuit of something, whether it's building a business or, I don't know, becoming an athlete or building a charity.\n\nAre they misguided in that thought? No, it's just that we we we could look deeper into our own internal psychology and see how well the word pursuit is everything. So, we're always in pursuit of something. And the the the the chemistry of our body in the state of pursuit is that chemical dopamine. The interesting thing about dopamine is it falls away just before you get what you want. So, so the chase is much more exciting than the having or the getting. And so we're in locked into this constant chase and what is the next thing? When will I get the next thing? And I think the reason why we feel so sort of empty or disappointed is because what we get is never enough. And meditation comes into this conversation to to show us that actually what we were looking for was already there inside. That's the key point. What were we looking for? We were looking for freedom. If you think about how it feels when you get what you want, you know, there's the chasing, the wanting, and then there's the getting. There's a kind of relief, isn't there? It it's it's a feeling of, oh, the wanting's gone away. It's like hunger. You feel hungry, you eat a sandwich, the hunger's gone away. I mean that's a metaphor for everything and that you when you get what you want there's this relief, the the the the wanting, the the the the needy feeling, the oh when will I get it has gone and there's a relief, so actually what what we're well momentarily and then it kicks in again, we're looking for the next thing, but what we're looking for is the absence of wanting. That's the happiness we achieve when we get what we want is a kind of freedom from wanting. So the problem is is that we're caught in a cycle where we then just want something else.\n\nSo, I'm not suggesting let's all go and sit on a mountaintop and meditate and not have lives and not have careers. Not at all. I'm simply suggesting that we've put our focus very strongly on material things. And I think there needs to be also a focus on the mind and I think that's how we can learn to free ourselves. You learned this the hard way through your own experiences. Can you talk to me about how you learned these lessons? Well, I definitely became a monk through extreme suffering. I wouldn't describe myself as having been a kind of, you know, a spiritual seeker and I went to a monastery with a kind of open glowing heart wanting to find the answers. I went to a monastery in a completely broken state because I had been living in this kind of ambition cycle, wanting, wanting, wanting and and really not looking after myself. I had a very self-loathing and unhappy mind, a lot of depression, a lot of anxiety. And I was, um, I went to that monastery feeling completely at rock bottom. And I I didn't go to a monastery to live there forever. I just kind of dipped my toe in. But you know, I stayed. If I was a fly on the wall in your life on that day when you showed up at that monastery, what would I have seen?\n\nSo I was very ill and I arrived at the monastery, um, really needing help. So I was I was living in London and New York. I was trying to become an actor. My mother's an actor so I sort of wanted to follow in her footsteps. And I got into a really kind of dangerous kind of party lifestyle, really wild and burning the candle at both ends. I basically made myself ill. I had a very, very dramatic burnout living in Brooklyn and waking up one morning in my apartment thinking I was having a heart attack. Um, I went to I had didn't have medical insurance, but I managed to find some kind of like cheap ECG place and they checked my heart out and they said, \"You you have a heart condition. What have you been doing?\" And you know, I really was had to stop in my tracks and I was very, very ill after that for a few months. What age was this? 21. Wow. And during that time of being horrendously ill, I had to question everything I was doing with my life. But that illness is a symptom. It's a symptom of of unhealthy living, but also an unhealthy relationship with my own mind. And where did that unhealthy relationship with your own mind stem from?\n\nSo I think things that that happened in my early life, uh, traumatic things, difficult things, uh, and then me not knowing how to deal with those and just bottling them up and pushing through, pushing forward and not looking at myself. I had this very sort of escapist way about myself. I think that's what all the partying was about to kind of get out of my head. And so, so when I had that burnout, I think it was a combination of physical stress and mental stress that just exploded very, very suddenly, literally overnight. Did you have an abusive childhood? Because I was I was reading some of the things that you had said and it suggested to me that there was things that happened when you were young that left imprints on you that you had to work through. Yeah. Yeah. I I would say things happened in my teens that were troubling. You know, when I was, uh, when I was quite like 13, 14, I started to run with a much older crowd. So, I had a kind of double life. I was I was at school and very studious and very quiet. And then outside school,\n\n\nI was in a rock band with much older people. Um, when I was 14, I started to actually work as a jazz pianist in wine bars across London, pretending I was 21. And the people I was running with at that time were much, much older than me. And um, yeah, there were some situations where the relationships turned, I would say, abusive. And I would say I was a victim of, at the time, maybe I thought I knew what I was doing, but looking back, definitely not. And I think that left imprints, and I think it made me um, frightened of myself and frightened of other people.\n\nAre you comfortable talking about this?\n\nYeah.\n\nWas this sexual abuse?\n\nYeah.\n\nFrom, from uh, from one of the people I was in a band with. Yeah.\n\nAnd when you think, when you sort of trace the steps of the behavior that you then saw in your early 20s, the sort of escapist behavior, the sort of self-medicating behavior, is, is that the cont, is that where that originated from, the sort of processing of that and the dealing with those?\n\nIt's really hard to make a very specific direct connection, isn't it? And that's what we always want to do. We want to say this happened because of this, and there's this, you know, this happened and therefore I went off the rails. In a way, that's too easy because I think there's a mixture of many, many elements that can send one off the rails. You know, my parents are incredibly loving people. I mean, they really loved me and brought me up very well, but they split up very, very suddenly when I was 17. My dad literally ran off with one of my mom's friends, and it was a very huge explosion in the family, and we were all very broken by it. And so there are many, many things, many factors that came together in my teenage years that I think sent me off the rails. I got into uh, Oxford University, and that was a big prestigious thing, but I fell apart in Oxford. I started to get horrendously depressed, and I actually got expelled.\n\nIt's actually quite hard to get expelled from Oxford. I didn't, I've never met anyone that got expelled.\n\nExactly. My mother was delighted. She said, \"Oh, that's like Lord Byron, Shel, those are, you know, very hard to get thrown out of Oxford. You have to, you know, do something pretty horrendous.\" But I think in my case, they threw me out because I was just not functional. And that then just led to my demise. And then on the one hand, I was started acting and being in plays and and having this kind of um, almost like a glamorous persona, and on the other hand, crumbling inside. I had this incredibly persistent monologue of self-disgust, you know, like, like a voice in the head that says, \"You are disgusting. You are no good. You are a failure.\" I used to call it my devil voice, but it, it, it's obviously part of me. And and that's something that later on when I started to do retreats became incredibly loud in my head. And I had to work hard on meditation to help not to get rid of that, but to integrate it and and learn to be at peace with it. It's definitely, you know, it's gone away now.\n\nWhere does that voice originate from? You're not the first person that I've sat with here who's talked to me about a similar voice in their mind. And I'm wondering, is that a, is that something from we inherit from our environment? Uh, something that happens, a culmination of things that happen? Is it genetic, or is it all of the above?\n\nIt's many things because that's very specific. It's many things. And it's, I think in my case, it was because I became very good at suppressing my suffering because I became very proficient at pushing things down and just going to as many parties as possible and and trying not to suffer. I think the, when you push something down, the kind of volcano effect happens, and then this sort of angry voice comes up. This, this, this uh, pressure leads to a kind of backlash inside yourself, and it's an internalized um, anger that also is, is fed to us from our environment. Absolutely.\n\nSo you arrive at the monastery.\n\nYeah.\n\nWho told you to go to a monastery?\n\nSo, my oldest childhood friend, Tara, uh, we grew up together, and um, when I was completely falling apart with this heart condition at 21, she basically scooped me up and took me to the monastery. She's the one who told me. She said, \"Oh, there's a monastery in Scotland, which it's called Samuel Ling. It's a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, and for the first time ever, they've opened their doors to people who wanting to be monks for a year.\n\nOne year, and so she, she said, \"Let's go and do it. This could, she wanted to do it too, but she said, \"This could really help you,\" so she basically pretty much carried me there.\n\nWhat were you saying to her when she asked you how you were doing or what your symptoms were?\n\nI was lying in bed with with horrendous heart palpitations, and any move I made, my body would be bathed in sweat. I mean, on, we were in California because I got sick in New York. I managed to get to California where my mother was living, and Tara was there, and they looked after me. And then literally flying back to the UK, I had to lie down on the plane. She was almost carrying me. It was really, really heavy. But she, she said, \"Look, this place could help you. It's just a year. It's just a year out of your life.\" I, I, I thought, \"Okay, I'm going to do that, and then I'll go back to New York.\" I almost sublet my apartment in New York, but I didn't in the end. But there, there definitely was a feeling in me of, \"Okay, I'm going to go to this Buddhist retreat, get myself straightened out, and then go back to what I was doing before.\"\n\nSo, it didn't feel too outrageous because it was only a year. Of course, it wasn't a year. This is 30 years later. I'm still there. Wow.\n\nAnd to give people like me who don't understand what happens in a monastery a picture into the, what I would describe as incredible dedication and sacrifice that you've gone through over those 30 years. Can you, can you share some of the practical things that you've done in those 30 years that most people would think of as being just outrageous?\n\nBut do you know what? You say sacrifice, but to me, it didn't feel like a sacrifice. It felt like immediate relief because I...\n\nYes. When you become a monk, you, you take vows to give up things, certain things, but the things I was giving up were the things that made me ill. So you, you know, you're giving up uh, intoxicants, and you become celibate, and you uh, I mean, the, there are also kind of moral vows such as you give up telling lies and stealing and harming others. These are all, you know, good principles to follow. But I suppose the two major things are no intoxicants and celibacy. And to me, that was such a relief to, to just kind of give all of that up and be in almost like kind of like a rehab situation. And but I, I have to emphasize, it didn't feel too heavy because I thought it was only going to be for a year.\n\nSo celibacy is sex, giving them sex.\n\nYes. Yeah. And and what I found is that you actually develop stronger relationships. So people often think monks must be very lonely. But what I found was that then you were in a community of people where the, the sexual um, chemistry is off the agenda. So you start having friendships that really are so heart-based, and you meet lots of people who are on the same path as you. So I didn't feel lonely at all.\n\nWhat is it about sex that is maybe a distraction, but what is it that puts on the list?\n\nIt's not, it's not to say that that sex is wrong or evil or bad. It's not a sort of uh, weird sort of moralistic anti-ex thing at all. It's simply about where you're putting your focus. So when you're, when you're a monk, you're giving up family life, you're giving up sexual relationships, you're giving up romance, you're giving up all of that so that you can focus very intent intensely on meditation practice with the purpose that you can eventually help others. It's not a selfish thing, is you're doing this so that you can be of more benefit to others. But you want no distractions. And also you, you at a deeper level, you want to start to experiment with what happens when you don't immediately run after a desire. You start to experiment with trying to not suppress your desire because that's incredibly unhealthy, but watch your desire and observe it and find out that you are more than your desire. And so celibacy is an amazing environment to start doing that work. And that also means no masturbation and those kinds of things.\n\nYeah. I mean, it's, it's really about working with desire, rather than just, when I say working with, I mean, ex, observing it and learning ways to transform it, rather than just giving into it or suppressing it. And I wouldn't say celibacy is for everybody, but it suits a certain type of person.\n\nMhm. And you know, in Buddhism in general, there are, in, in in the UK or America, there's, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of Buddhists, but maybe a small handful of monks who become celibate. It's a very specific, particular way to practice Buddhism. It's not the only way.\n\nI'm inquiring about this subject because it's actually because of a conversation I was having with a really good friend of mine over New Year's who's had some troubles in his life. Um, has struggled in relationships, has struggled professionally, has also struggled a little bit with purpose and meaning, and has now sort of started to investigate religion. And one of the things he said to me, because there's a particular stranglehold that his sexual desires has over him, is that he was thinking about abstaining from masturbation and sex just for a short period of time. And I think actually the reason for that is kind of what you've described there, which is just to try and separate, get back control from desire.\n\nHe'll need to meditate because just abstaining from the thing you want to, the thing you're desperate to do, and you're abstaining, almost like locking yourself in a cage and saying, \"I won't, I won't do that thing,\" then what are you replacing it with? Or so, so for example, when I work in, you know, I often teach meditation in drug rehab centers, I talk a lot about how, okay, yes, you've had to give up the drug that was making you ill. But that's not the whole story. The, the rest of the story is what are you going to do about the mind that is addicted to that substance, and how are you going to resolve that? How are you going to fill the, the hole inside that was craving something? Okay. So, with the meditation, you're not just giving up something. You're learning to fill your, fill your own spirit with something more positive for yourself, almost to heal from the thing that was had the desire.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Desire is such an interesting thing because it's, we think we want something. But what's going on under the desire is a feeling of lack, a feeling of hopelessness, a feeling, \"I don't have.\" There's something missing. And so meditation is about filling that with, with light and with, with love. You know, the deepest addiction we all have is the addiction to our own thoughts. That, that's the, that's really the root of it all, is that a wanting thought arises in the my mind, and then I jump on it, and I want to get something to kind of alleviate that. But it's that internal attachment. Buddhism talks a lot about non-attachment, and I think this is widely misunderstood. People think it means you're supposed to be, you know, detached and have no friends and be unattached. It doesn't mean that at all. It means how we're so attached to our thoughts and our emotions, and they get into the driving seat and send our life in all kinds of directions we don't want it to go in. How do we learn to transform that inner attachment to the thought itself? And that's obviously where meditation comes in.\n\nLet's talk about Buddhism then. So I said to you before we started recording that in the last sort of 12 months or so, I've got really interested in Buddhism. I uh, started reading some books about Buddhism, and I find it to be, most aligned with, this sounds like a strange thing to say, but I'm gonna say it anyway, with almost like the medication that I need. And I know it's not a medication, but but it is a deep medicine. It's a medicine. It's a science to me. It's not so much a religion. It is more of a medicine or a science. Yeah. I've struggled with the religions. I, I was Christian growing up, but I've struggled with like deities and gods and these kinds of things because there's like 5,000 different gods that through history, so I don't really know which one's real, and there's lots of books, and I'm still on that journey, but when I found Buddhism, it wasn't framed like the other religions. I thought it was much more compelling.\n\nWhat is Buddhism? Can you tell me where it's come from? Is it a religion? Is there a god? Do I have to worship? Do I go to hell, heaven?\n\nThere's, there's nothing to worship at all. Buddhism is a path to, to um, inner, internal understanding. The word Buddha means awake. And yes, Buddhism has a his history in that there was somebody called the Buddha in India 2,500 years ago who attained awakening and gave teachings, and Buddhism, you could call it that, has come from there. But actually, this word Buddhism is a modern word, ism. It's a modern word. Well, in the original languages of Buddhism, such as Sanskrit and Tibetan, you find terms that are so different from religion. You find terms such as the science of awareness or the, the um, the examination of awakening, the inner, inner awareness. It's a path of mental discovery. It's a science. So, it's not a religion per se. Technically, it is. If you define a religion as a group spiritual purpose, and there are monasteries, there are organizationals within Buddhism. But it also defies most categorizations around religion because it doesn't believe in a creator. It doesn't believe in somebody to worship. It, it's really about the power of your own mind.\n\nAnd is there a hell and a heaven in Buddhism?\n\nThey talk about hell and heaven as um, uh, states of mind. They talk about everything as a state of mind. They say, \"This is a state of mind.\" Buddhism is very much about exploring the, the fabric of reality. Th, this table, this body, this, this so-called self, ideas of hell, heaven, they say these are all mental experiences. Everything is mind according to Buddhism.\n\nSo you get to the monastery.\n\nYeah.\n\nTalk to me about your journey of healing.\n\nSo I...\n\n\nI was quite ill for a while in the monastery, and they kind of left me alone.\nThey let me rest a lot.\nI did little bits of light work around the monastery.\nStarted to meditate.\nUm, you know, I actually hated meditation when I first did it.\nThis was a problem.\nYou know, I believed in it.\nI grew up in a Buddhist family.\nThere's been this kind of faith in Buddhism as I grew up, but I never actually did anything.\nI never meditated.\nThen I get to a monastery, I become a monk and read the small print.\nYou know, you got to meditate, and I hated it.\nI really, really hated it.\nAnd I thought, \"Oh, what am I going to do?\nI really don't enjoy this at all.\nI find it an enormous struggle.\"\nSo I struggled a lot with meditation in those early days, weeks, months even.\nWhy did you hate it?\nI hated it because I was doing it in a way that was making me more stressed.\nI would sit down.\nI thought that meditation is about clearing the mind.\nI'd heard this phrase, \"clear your mind.\"\nI thought that's what you do.\nSo, I sat there trying to clear my mind, and the more I tried to clear my mind, the louder it was shouting.\nAnd that particularly, that negative voice I told you about, that \"you are no good, you're rubbish, you're awful, you'll fail,\" that became louder and louder.\nAnd so the meditation became incredibly stressful because I thought, \"I can't do this.\nI can't get rid of my thoughts.\"\nOf course, now, since now I've discovered it's nothing to do with clearing the mind.\nBut because I thought it was, I struggled enormously.\nWhat is it then?\nIt's nothing to do with clearing the mind.\nIt's not about putting yourself in an unconscious state at all.\nIt's about working with your mind.\nSo, it's about learning how to be less controlled by your mind, but it's not about getting rid of the thoughts.\nIn fact, the thoughts are quite helpful.\nYou know, they actually help you to meditate.\nYou see, what I was doing in those early days was I thought, \"Okay, just sit down and just push everything away and go into the kind of zen state.\"\nAnd of course, that's just like suppression, isn't it?\nYou're just trying to suppress.\nYou're trying to push.\nIt's like trying to get a small child to sit still in their high chair while you're feeding them.\nThey're going to, you know, they're going to want to move around.\nSo, it's not about that pushing away of thoughts.\nI mean, you've got to ask yourself if that was the aim, well, why would it be the aim?\nImagine if you could clear your mind.\nSo, what?\nYou have 10 minutes of just being blank and then you carry on with your day.\nWhere's the journey?\nWhat journey is that?\nYou just passed out on the floor for 10 minutes.\nMight as well sleep or something.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I can fully understand that if you're really stirred up and miserable and stressed, the idea of 10 minutes of switching it off would be great, but it's not the solution.\nIt doesn't work.\nWhat is the solution?\nSo, it is definitely about changing your relationship with your thoughts.\nSo, okay.\nSo, a typical meditation practice is you sit and you focus on your breathing.\nIt's different from breath work.\nYou're not breathing in a particular way.\nYou're not trying to breathe slowly, deeply, or anything.\nYou're just breathing normally.\nYou know, just let the breath do its own thing and you're focused on it.\nSo on paper that sounds really clear and clean and simple: focus on your breath.\nThe reality is it's really messy because you focus on your breath and within a few seconds you're thinking about shopping lists or food or sex or anything.\nYou know, the mind just goes.\nThat's when the work starts because at some point you realize your mind has wandered.\nOkay.\nThat's when many people think they failed.\nYou know, they were meditating, and they were with the breath, and then they realize they're thinking about emails they need to write or shopping or whatever, and then they think, \"Oh, I'm a failure.\"\nAnd they very angrily bring themselves back to the breath.\nThat's just going to make you more stressed because you're actually training in feeling like a failure.\nYou know what I mean?\nSo, so you can relate.\nI mean, it takes me 7 seconds to drift off when I'm trying to meditate.\nSo, it's not that at all.\nIt's that you're with the breath and then your mind wanders.\nIt's not even that you see your mind wandering.\nYou kind of find out afterwards, don't you?\nIt's not, \"I'm with the breath and I can see my mind step away from the breath and then go to a thought.\"\nIt's more that I'm with my breath.\nI pass out and I wake up the other side of town.\nYeah, that is the meditation.\nWaking up inside your thoughts.\nThat is the definition of meditation.\nSo, you haven't failed at all.\nYou are meditating because what happened was you were with the breath, you got lost, you lost your mind, and then you found your mind again because you're back, you suddenly realize, \"Oh, where was I?\nI am supposed to be meditating.\"\nSo that is meditation: you're back with your awareness, and then you gently bring yourself back to the breath, and actually all you're doing is those three things throughout the session: either you're with the breath, or you're noticing that you got lost, or you're returning, and it's that returning that makes you strong.\nEvery time you return to the breath, you are making a very powerful decision.\nThat's the attachment or the addiction to the thoughts.\nThe mind was lost in those thoughts, and you are recapturing your attention and bringing it back.\nSo, you are choosing where to send your mind.\nAnd if you do this like an exercise, almost like going to the gym and getting strong day after day, week after week, you're teaching yourself how to choose to be happy and how to choose not to suffer.\nSo it's such a simple technique on paper, you know, focus on your breath, come back when you get lost, is actually profoundly transformative psychologically because I think most people listening to this assume that they're kind of strapped to their thoughts and their thoughts are the car driving wherever it wants to go, and we're just strapped to the back of it, our ankles tied to the back of it with a piece of rope.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd we just kind of suffer consequences, hijacked by our thoughts.\nYeah.\nHijacked is a great, great, you know, it stormed the like pilot's cabin and it's flying us.\nExactly.\nWherever it wants to go.\nExactly.\nThat's kind of the experience we have.\nSo then meditation puts you behind the wheel of the car.\nMost people haven't had the experience you've had training yourself to sort of disassociate or realize that you're not your thoughts.\nSo, as someone that's on the other side of this practice, how can you persuade me that my life will be better if I listen to this?\nLike, what's the before and after, I guess, for you?\nSo, I don't think everybody has to join a monastery and do extreme retreats and the kind of things I do.\nIt maybe that's my extreme nature.\nI have so many friends who meditate while they have families and busy jobs, and they do 15 minutes a day or twice a day or whatever.\nIt can absolutely be done in anybody's lifestyle.\nBut the whole point is that you are learning to find your own inner freedom.\nYou're learning to how to discover that you are bigger than the pain and suffering that seems to drive your life.\nBecause what I described earlier with the coming back to the breath is that first stage of learning to gain a bit more power around what your mind is doing.\nAnd then what is so interesting is when you start to think about, okay, when I'm unhappy or when I'm angry or whatever, if I am observing myself being unhappy, is the observer unhappy?\nIs the observer angry?\nAnd if I feel angry and I know I'm angry, the part of my mind that's looking at the anger cannot be angry because it's seeing the anger.\nSo, so in Buddhism, they use a metaphor to describe this, which is the sky and the clouds.\nThe clouds can be heavy and rainy and all of that, but the sky is always bigger than the clouds.\nSo our awareness of our minds, that's where we can find our freedom.\nAnd when we talk about seeking purpose and seeking what are we looking for in life, I think that's what we're looking for all the time in everything we do.\nWhether it be big life goals or, you know, drinking a cup of coffee or water, small moments, in every moment, we're looking for release or freedom.\nWe think we're looking to feel happy or we think we're looking for love or sex or whatever it is.\nBut I think what we're really looking for is to free ourselves from suffering and to free ourselves from need and to be free to be more in touch with who we really are.\nI think that's what we're looking for.\nAnd when you meditate and you step back and look at your mind, that observational aspect is key to become the sky.\nYeah.\nTo become the sky rather than the clouds.\nAnd then I think it can change your life because, you know, when I first met my teacher, he was quite a straight-talking person.\nHe wouldn't, you know, say much, and what he said was often could be sound, sound a little bit harsh, but he said it with love.\nAnd when I first met him, I'd go on about all the stuff that was happening with me or had happened with me or to me.\nAnd he just says, \"Stop taking yourself so seriously.\"\nAnd initially that could sound like a slap in the face.\nI mean, imagine if you went to a therapist and they said, \"What you've been through is peanuts.\nYou know, stop taking yourself seriously.\"\nBut he didn't mean it like that.\nWhat he meant was stop clinging to a kind of solidity.\nStop making your thoughts and feelings and your past and make it so solid.\nMake try to be the sky instead of the clouds.\nTry to step back and be less solid about everything.\nBuddhism is very much into this notion that they call emptiness, which isn't emptiness in terms of a kind of vacuous void, but more that things are illusory, things aren't as real and solid and heavy as we think they are.\nAnd I think meditation can help us to think more in that way and find more happiness, real happiness, not the happiness that depends on \"I will be happy if,\" \"I will be happy when,\" \"I can only be happy because,\" that's a very limited happiness, but imagine if you could be happy no matter what.\nIs that what Buddhism helps us to do?\nI think Buddhism is about freedom, and I think freedom is happy no matter what, and I think, but more than that, I think it's also about compassion.\nI, the way I'm describing it could sound like this is all just about one's own personal development and freeing oneself and becoming happier.\nBut the key point is we're living in a connection, a world of connection.\nAnd how can we genuinely help others?\nI think through freeing our minds and helping others to do the same.\nCan I be in that state of mind where I am the sky while also being incredibly effective in my job as a CEO?\nYeah, I think this is possibly one of the misconceptions.\nYou know, this is something I came across quite early on in when I was teaching meditation.\nI started to give talks about meditation in the workplace like 25 years ago, so before it became very popular.\nYou know, mindfulness is everywhere in the corporate world, but when I started it was quite unusual.\nAnd I did come across a lot of misconceptions.\nThe funniest one was before I went into a boardroom to talk to the people in there about meditation, their CEO took me to side and he said, \"Um, please don't make them too relaxed.\"\nI said, \"What do you mean?\"\nHe said, \"Well, I like what you do, but I don't want them to become too relaxed.\"\nI said, \"I'm not, I'm not some kind of like stage hypnotist.\nI'm not going to walk into there and sort of, you know, put everyone into a trance.\nThat's not what I do.\"\nBut it was such an interesting conversation because it made me see that his view of meditation is that you would become this kind of spaced out, happy with everything, don't care, and you'd lose your drive.\nAnd it's absolutely not that at all because it's about precision.\nIt's about being present.\nIt's about being less controlled by distraction, be less controlled by negative thinking.\nAnd if you can do that, you can achieve more.\nSo if you are a CEO, if you are trying to achieve something in your work and you meditate, it can make you can work much, much harder and get less tired.\nAnd then also you can start to think more deeply about why am I doing the things I'm doing and what am I really trying to achieve here?\nSome of the most famous CEOs in the world talk about their meditation practice, and this is why I've also been slightly compelled into it.\nI think for me, I'm the type of person that's very influenced by other people that I kind of look up to, and so someone like Steve Jobs, who I think had a deep sort of spiritual practice which involved meditation, which I also think he cites as being much of the reason he was able to see around the corner and be more of a visionary, um, was one of the big points of inspiration for me to get more curious about Buddhism and meditation.\nDo you have any examples of like very high productive, very successful people that have had tremendous benefits from meditation as it relates to them being more successful in their missions, their professional missions?\nI mean, I can't, I can't think of specific individual names, but it's just generally very well known that if you meditate, it makes you more effective in your life because you are becoming your own boss.\nI mean, we talk about being your own boss, but how many of us are really, really our own boss?\nYou know, we can be the boss of other people.\nWe can be the boss of our environment to a certain extent, but to be the CEO of your own mind, very, very difficult.\nAnd so people who can do that definitely become more effective in the world.\nBut I think what also happens is they start to think about how they could be really successful and then do some good with that success because they start to think about, well, is it all just about the success?\n\n\nAnd the wealth or\nis there something I could do with that?\nSuccess and wealth because meditation\nmakes you more compassionate. Meditation\nmakes you more ethical. It makes you and\nnot ethical in a kind of, you know, the\nword ethics sounds so kind of Victorian\nand so kind of restrictive, but I mean,\ntrying to make the world a better place,\nand I think there are many examples of\npeople who've become enormously\nsuccessful and used that success for the\ngood of the world, and I think meditation\nis something key in their success. I was\njust looking for a couple of examples,\nand Ray Dalio, who a lot of people\nknow, is one of the best investors in\nthe world, who wrote the book *Principles*,\nsaid, \"Meditation more than anything in my\nlife is the biggest ingredient of\nwhatever success I've had.\" And Mark\nBenioff, who's the CEO of Salesforce, a\ntremendously large company, said,\n\"Meditation is the most important thing I\ndo each day.\" Oprah Winfrey, Jack Dorsey,\nlet's say, who's the co-founder of\nTwitter and Square, said, \"There's nothing\nmore impactful on my work than\nmeditation.\" And Steve Jobs said, \"If you\njust sit and observe, you will see how\nrestless your mind is. If you try to\ncalm it, it only makes it worse. But\nover time, it does calm.\" And he\npracticed Zen Buddhism and was a regular\nmeditator. And he says that his\nminimalist design philosophy and focus\nwere strongly influenced by his\nspiritual and meditative practices.\nYou see, I think the thing that trips\npeople up when they think about how\nmeditation could make you more effective\nis the word calm.\nMhm. Because they think, \"Oh, well, if I\nbecome calm, I'm going to be, I'm going\nto miss, I'm not going to be a\nworkaholic. I'm going to drop the ball.\"\nYeah. If I'm too calm,\nbut I don't think of calm in that way at\nall, as almost like a tranquilized calm.\nI think of calm as being able to keep a\ncool head under fire\nand be really precise and really on the\nfocus on in the now and really\nhold on to your purpose and know why\nyou're doing what you're doing and be\nless influenced by the areas of your\npsychology that trip you up. I'm hearing\nlike clarity and emotional control.\nYeah. Optimizing your how your brain\nperforms. I started my first business at\n12 years old, and then I started more\nbusinesses at 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. And\nat that time, what I didn't realize is\nthat being a founder with no money meant\nthat I also had to be the marketeer,\nthe sales rep, the finance team,\ncustomer service, and the recruiter. But\nif you're starting a business today,\nthankfully there's a tool that wears all\nof those hats for you, our sponsor\ntoday, which is Shopify. Because of all\nof its AI integrations, using Shopify\nfeels a bit like you've hired an entire\ngrowth team from day one, taking care of\nwriting product descriptions, your\nwebsite design, and enhancing your\nproducts images, not to mention the bits\nyou'd expect Shopify to handle, like the\nshipping, like the taxes, like the\ninventory.

When Dr. Daniel Lieberman\ncame on the *DOAC*, he explained how modern\nshoes with their cushioning and support\nare making our feet weaker and less\ncapable of doing what nature intended\nthem to do. We've lost the natural\nstrength and mobility in our feet, and\nthis is leading to issues like back pain\nand knee pain. I'd already purchased a\npair of Vivobarefoot shoes. So, I\nshowed them to Daniel Lieberman, and he\ntold me that they were exactly the type\nof shoe that would help me restore\nnatural foot movement and rebuild my\nstrength. But, I think it was\nplantar fasciitis that I had, where suddenly my\nfeet started hurting all the time. And\nafter that, I decided to start\nstrengthening my own foot by using the\nVivobarefoot. And research from\nLiverpool University has backed this up.\nThey've shown that wearing Vivobarefoot\nshoes for 6 months can increase foot\nstrength by up to 60%.

Earlier on you said that in\nBuddhism they talk about an emptiness\nwhich is kind of this realizing that\nlife isn't so solid and your identity is\na mirage and all these kinds of things.\nIt almost sounded like that's the\nopposite of like victimhood\nbecause when we think about victimhood,\nit is I create an identity for myself\nand then I create a story around that\nidentity which has suffered some kind of\ninjustice and then I kind of live out\nthat injustice. How does Buddhism think\nabout victimhood and identity and trauma,\nI guess? So of course we identify\nincredibly strongly with our past, and we\nin so many ways are prisoners of what\nhas happened to us in our past, and it's\ntotally understandable, of course, but\nBuddhism brings in a whole fresh\nperspective, which is that you are not\nyour past. I mean, even on a physical\nlevel, every cell in your body has\nchanged, and your mind has changed. You\nare, you are right now in the present.\nThe past is is an illusion, as is the\nfuture.\nAnd we spend so much time in the past\nand future or trying to manipulate the\npresent. Whereas with meditation,\nyou're learning to be in the now and\nnot be. It doesn't mean you don't plan\nor don't remember, but you're learning\nto be, to cling less to the past and\nfuture. And you're learning to cling\nless to or hold less to the idea that\nthings are really as solid as you think\nthey are. I mean, it's very scientific\nthat there's a Buddhist meditation which\nliterally is about a table, like, you know, here we are with\nthis table, and they say if you, if you\ntake apart this table, you'll find it\ndoesn't exist because the table as it\nseems right now is a top with legs. You\ntake the bits apart, and now where is your notion of table?\nYou've got these bits of wood or metal\nor whatever it is, and you start kind of\ndissecting that further and further and\nfurther. Uh, this is where Buddhism and\nand particle physics become, you know,\ntalking a lot. There's a lot of\nconversation there in that the smaller\nand smaller you go into these wood\nshavings and then particles, and can you\nfind the smallest part that\nmakes up all of reality? And Buddhists\nwould say no, because if it's a part, it\nhas parts.\nThere is no such thing as the partless\nparticle because if it's a particle, it\ncan be further subdivided. So,\nwe can't find the smallest base that\nmakes up all of matter. What we're\nexperiencing is more like a dream or an\nillusion. And the reality we live in,\nof course, it feels very solid. You\nknow, if I throw this cup at\nsomebody, it's going to hit their head\nand hurt them. There's no point saying,\n\"Well, it's all empty. Don't worry about\nit.\" But the idea behind this philosophy\nof understanding things not to be as\nsolid as they are is that we can learn\nto suffer less because we spend so much\nof our energy constantly reacting to\nthings as if they're really solid and\nreally real, and there's nothing that can\nbe done about them, whether that be\npeople or objects in the world around us\nor our mind itself.\nAnd if we can desolidify some of that, we\ncould become more free. We all carry so\nmany burdens in this regard. You know,\nit could be grief, it could be\nheartbreak, it could be a colleague at\nwork that doesn't dislike us, a comment\nin our Instagram page of someone,\nsomething someone said about us. How\ndoes one go about\nalleviating ourselves from this kind of\nburden? Yeah. So, for me, it's very\nmuch about dropping the story\nand looking at the feeling. Okay.\nExplain that to me.\nSo\nfor me, this became\nvery, uh, very\nimportant practice for me when I was in\na long retreat.\nSo I went into a very long retreat for\nfour years. I became a monk for a year,\nand I stayed a bit longer, stayed a bit\nlonger. It was after about four years\nthat I decided to do this for life, and\nI took lifelong vows, and then I knew\nabout these long, I did some short\nretreats, but I knew about these long\nretreats, but it wasn't until 12 years\nlater that the opportunity came up to go\ninto a long retreat\nuh, four years long, where you are really\njust cut off from the world for that\nlength of time. No, no, nobody goes in\nor out. And you are meditating many,\nmany hours a day. And it was the most\nfrightening experience of my life\nbecause I, I was in there alone with my\nown thoughts and emotions. It's not a\ncompletely solitary retreat. There are\nother monks there, all doing their own\nmeditation in their rooms. So there is a\nkind of group, but you are very much\nalone as well.\nAnd for me, the whole thing was, for the\nfirst two years, was just horrific\namounts of depression, misery, pain,\nanguish, anxiety that would build into\npanic attacks. I, I was really, really\nshocked by what happened to me in there\nbecause I, I, I think I thought I'd, you\nknow, I'd been a monk for 12 years, and\nI'd already started to, you know, give a\nfew talks about meditation, and and\nmaybe I thought I was quite sorted, but I\nI wasn't, and I got in there and really\nfell apart. But it was an amazing thing\nthat happened to me because that falling\napart forced me after a while to learn\nhow to engage with what I'm\ntalking about, which is looking at the\nsuffering and working with that with\nmeditation,\nlooking at the suffering. So for me,\nduring those first two years of the\nretreat,\nI was completely obsessed with the story\nbecause I, I was experiencing these\nhorrendous feelings of heartbreak\nand feelings of depression, uh, anxiety,\njust kind of a whole\nmass of suffering inside myself, and I\nwas, I was trying to almost do therapy on\nmyself and think, okay, let's, you know,\nthinking memories were coming up from\nthe past and thinking about things that\nhad happened in my past, and is this why\nI'm suffering now, and how do I resolve\nthat? And the more I went down that\nroad, the worse it got. And I found\nmyself really disconnected from\nBuddhism. And it was a really\nfrightening experience because I, I'm\nthere in a 4-year retreat. I'm a monk,\nand I'm, I was feeling completely\nalienated from the whole thing. I, I kind\nof wanted to just get away from it. I\nwanted to run away. And things only\nchanged when I\nhit rock bottom, like hugely, in that I\nactually\nI climbed over the wall of the retreat\nto run away. I couldn't take it anymore.\nI, I, at one morning, I had the most\nimmense panic attack I've ever had, and I\njust like saw red and just ran, I legged\nit out of the retreat, which is un, it's\nunthinkable. You know, in a four-year\nretreat, you're not supposed to leave.\nBut I jumped over the wall and tried to\nescape. I say tried to escape as if I\nwas in some kind of, you know, prison or\ncult. It's not like that. People do\nleave retreats, but for me, it was this\nkind of dramatic get out of there and\nrun away. And\nI remember, um, like freaking out and\nrunning and running and running down\nthis road in the rain. This was on a\nvery, you know, remote area of a\nScottish island, and then just stopping\nand thinking, \"What are you doing?\nWhat, what has happened to you?\" And I\njust stopped and then went back, and I\nasked the leaders of the retreat if I\ncould be let back in. And they said,\n\"Well, no, you've left.\" But I really\nbegged them because I, I had such clarity\nin that moment. I wanted to go back in.\nAnd they said, \"Okay, the abbot of my\nmonastery said, \"Okay, stay, stay in a\nlittle caravan on the edge of the\nretreat boundary for a week, for seven\ndays, and think about what you're doing,\nand then we'll see if you will let you\nback in.\nAnd during that time, I\nI thought really deeply, and I re, I\nreally knew I wanted to go back in\nbecause there was at that moment a\nthought of, shall I give up being a monk?\nShall I give up the whole thing? I, I\ncan't do this. It's made me so\nmiserable. But I, I really knew in that\nmoment what, what my purpose was. I knew\nI wanted to go back in and carry on. But\nI also knew I'd been\ntormenting myself with my past and that\nI hadn't worked out how to\nhow to heal myself. I, I, I'd been sinking\nso badly, and I, if I was to go back in\nthere, I would have to try a completely\nnew approach.\nWhy did you choose to go back in?\nBecause I, I really strongly believed\nthat it was what I want to do with my\nlife. And a part of me thought, don't\ngive something up when you're freaking\nout because you will regret it. If\nyou're going to give this thing up, give\nit up from a place of clarity, knowing\nthat there's something better for you\nout there. Don't give up because you're\nhaving a panic attack and you can't take\nit. That's the wrong kind of timing to\nmake a life change because I do, I, I\nreally do believe in what I'm doing. I, I,\nthis is the life I've chosen for\nmyself, and I want to do it. But it got\nso difficult, I couldn't take it anymore.\nWhy did you want to do it? If something\nis painful and causing you anxiety\nbecause I felt that this, this pain I'm\ngoing through\nI've the, the meth, the methods are there.\nI just need to know how to use them, and\nI could learn to conquer this. I, I, this\npain could be the breakthrough. Most\npeople in their lives, when they think\nabout the things that give them anxiety\nor pain or fear, you know, we live as\nsort of discomfort-avoiding humans. So\nwe try and run to, run to comfort or\npleasure. Exactly. So life is hard.\nLet's run from it. Let's get on a plane,\nfly to another country, and try and just\nset up a new life somewhere else. It\ndoesn't work because you go to your new\nlife, and the thing that has been\nhaunting you like a shadow goes with\nyou. You can't run from yourself.\nYou can, you can run to the end of the\nearth, and that thing that has been\ntormenting you is part of you. And until\nyou learn to integrate that, it will\nalways trip you up. And so I went back\ninto that retreat knowing, okay, this is\nyour last chance.\nIf you don't, if, if you mess this up\nagain, that, that's it, you know, forget\nit. So it was a real, like, make or\nbreak situation. And I went back in, and\nI, I, I, um,\neverything changed\nbecause I found, I, I had to find a new, a\ndifferent way of dealing with that suff\n\n\nOkay. So, I'm back in there, and it's coming up again. The depression, the anxiety, the pain that to me, it felt like it felt like some something like that was piercing me. It felt like a It felt like there was like a knife constantly twisting, twisting and turning in my heart or like in the middle of me. It was really painful. And what I'd been doing up until that point was just trying to get that knife out. And also thinking, why is it there? Is it because of what happened to me when I was 14? Is it what happened to me when I was 17? Is it this? Is it that? Is it my my family? What is it? That's the story. I say story. I'm not I'm I'm not belittling people's stories. I'm just saying it's the narrative, isn't it?\n\nSo, I I decided to to use the knife as the meditation to to actually meditate on it. And and uh the the whole thing starts to change when you do that because until that point you've been if until that point you've been trying to get rid of your suffering or get rid of your pain. But if you turn your pain into your meditation, you're moving towards it. And how can it hurt you if you've decided to move towards it? You you you've made that choice. So what I started to do was just focus on the pain but try to bypass the judgments. I don't like this. This is so terrible. Why am I depressed? Why am I anxious? And just feel the feeling. And it's a sensation in the body. Because one of the key um instructions in meditation is when you focus your mind, you focus it with less judgment. This is good. This is bad. You just focus. So you're focusing on that feeling without pushing it away, without saying why do I feel like this, but just the feeling and it you start it starts to change. It starts to change because you're accepting it. My my teachers had always said to me, they'd always go on and on about acceptance, and I just I just wanted to hit them when they said it cuz it sounded so grim. You know, you've got to accept yourself or you've got to accept your suffering. To me, that sounded like you were going to for the rest of your life be dragging this bag of rocks up a hill. You know, acceptance is so miserable and so boring. I didn't realize that what they meant was was compassion and self-acceptance at a very very deep level. So, so I was I'm I'm focusing on that feeling in my body and trying not to go into the stories about it or the hatred of it and just move towards it and and kind of become become one with that pain, and then you relax, and something kind of releases. And I mean, I think it works on a chemical level cuz basically when you're when you're trying to push pain away, you're creating enormous amounts of uh cortisol in your body, the stress hormone. When you relax, the endorphins arise, you start to feel happy. I mean, it's quite bizarre that the thing that has hurt you so much starts to turn into a kind of joyful feeling, and you start to think, \"Oh, wow. Okay, so happiness is nothing to do with somebody being nice to me or this object or that thing.\" And happiness is about being okay with your suffering and and and not just being okay with it, but actually sending love into the place in yourself that you hated so much. So for for me um that what started to change was from from from having a feeling like a knife twisting inside me and hurting me and wanting to get rid of it, I found ways to hold that with with love. And I I started to have this image in my head of as if I had found a like a frightened rabbit or a bird with a broken wing, and I'm holding that in my hand with tenderness. I'd never been able to do that for myself. I had never ever been able to be kind to myself. Everything in my life until up until that point had been so harsh and so self self-hating, and and I think you know in my teenage years when I was trying to become a a successful actor, I think that was the drive was I I hate myself, so I better get loads of people to love me instead cuz I can't do it. I'm not saying all actors are like that by no means, but there is a kind of actor who is like that. We know that, and that was me. And then, you know, even as a as a as a monk, and you become celibate, and you you're you know, having this kind of more like looking after yourself lifestyle, I developed all these incredibly strong attachments with friends where I'd want them to be nice to me, and I didn't want to be alone with myself. I couldn't spend time alone with myself. And then in the first two years of that retreat, I'm hating myself and hating my pain and jumping over the wall and anything to kind of jump out of my own skin. And when I learned how to do this kind of practice with sending compassion into that part of myself that I'd hated so much, it it it was really transformative.\n\nYou said it felt like holding a scared rabbit or a bird with a broken wing. How did you come to feel about that bird?\n\nI felt um I felt love for that part of myself. And for me, that's only possible when you stop getting so distracted by all the history and the the the the details of your past, but you're just relating to the feeling in your body right now. And I don't know if it's like this for everybody, but for me, feeling it in the body is a really easy way to start because yeah, it's depression, it's anxiety, it's trauma, whatever it is that's quite kind of nebulous. How do you find it? And for me it was so physical. It was like this twisting of a knife in the heart or a sinking feeling in the in the chest. And just to relate to that sensation with kindness taught me how to love myself, but in an accepting way, you know, not it's not about you know, becoming an egoomaniac like I love myself. It's more have kindness for yourself. How does this translate to things like grief? Because grief is one of the the hardest things to get to acceptance on the sort of finality of life, losing someone you love. You've been through this yourself. You you had a I think a best friend of yours who was Well, my teacher. Oh, your teacher. Well, he was my best friend as well as my teacher. He he he was murdered. He was in so 11 years ago. My teacher, Gelong Thubten, who had been my everything for all those years, you know, he he was my teacher, my closest friend. He I also I spent a lot of time with him. I became his kind of assistant. So when he would travel, I was with him all the time. So we were very close. He was Tibetan, and he was in charge of our monastery in Scotland. And part of his his work was he would run a charity called Rockpa which has um oh that's him. um he would go to Tibet every year and um look after projects there, feeding orphans, looking after schools, hospitals, etc. He was on his way to Tibet one year, and he was in Changdu in China, and he was um basically ambushed and stabbed, killed. And I mean this completely rocked the Buddhist world. It's like, you know, horrendous news. But on a personal level for me, I was one of the first people who found out. I I've been on the phone to him every day until then. I was his assistant and very working very closely with him. So it complet my it completely like blew me apart. I mean it blew me to pieces. I cannot describe how badly it blew me to pieces. But the meditation I've described to you saw me through because I at some point during that grieving process I remembered what to do. At first I didn't because you know when you're really in it in in it you you can't think, but then so there was the whole aftermath, you know, he was killed, and it was in all the press, and then as his assistant, I was the one dealing with the media, and in a way that you stay busy when you're grieving, it kind of helps you to you know, stay focused, but then the nights the nights was nighttime was when it started to hurt because at night I would just be tossing and turning turning and feeling like feeling like I was on fire because I had a mixture of grief, anger, despair. It was a whole mixture of things. We knew the killer. The person who murdered him had been a monk, a Tibetan. He had been a monk in our monastery. We knew him. He actually had the same name as me, and we knew him quite well. So there was all of that mixed in with what on earth happened to this person that he did this thing. And so all of that is consuming me at night, and I'm just tossing and turning feeling like I'm in flames. And then at some point it kicked in the the meditation. It just had it just happened because I'd done it in retreat. It had seen me through. It had really really helped me. And at some point I just had to lie there and send love into the flames in me. You know, I had to send send that kindness into the place I was in despair. I'm not saying that I then just became all right. No, but it absolutely calmed things. Absolutely. And it it is it is it is all about love. It really is. You are sending love into the pain you are experiencing. And this helped me through the grief. It helped me also with forgiveness with the the guy we knew who did it. It helped me on so many levels. And I'm not saying that it, you know, it's it's all okay, but I have I I've made peace with his death. And I mean, he taught me this practice. He taught me how to do that. And then he died, and I had to do it. That I I think of it as his last gift to me. And um I'm you know I I I I'm will be forever grateful.\n\nWhen you talk about sending love into the flames, what is the the actual practice there? Is it certain sentences you're saying?\n\nNo, it's thinking. Yeah, I'm glad you asked this because it it is so much about going beyond the words and going into an experience of oneness. So, so to make it really practical, you know, you're feeling you're feeling incredible trauma in your body for finding it physically is the easiest way to do it. Like you your body's in flames or you've got like a feeling of a knife twisting in your heart, whatever it is, there's this feeling in the body, and first of all, you just focus on that feeling. So, anybody who who meditates knows how to focus on their breathing. It's the same thing. It's just where you're focusing. So, you're feeling the feeling, and you're trying to bypass the thoughts of this is uncomfortable. I want this to go away. Why did he die? What happened? You're just feeling the feeling. And then you pay attention to that feeling in a loving way. You you flood it with love. And the reason this is possible, I mean this is touching upon a major a major belief in Buddhist philosophy, which is that our minds are naturally compassionate. We are not these fight or flight killing machines that some people like to think the human being is. We are our natural state is to be kind. It is who we are naturally deep down. So when you clear away all the the words and the the ideas and you just sit with the feeling and you send love into that feeling with your mind, you're just loving that feeling, holding it with compassion as if you were with a friend who was grieving. You know, if you if you were sitting with a friend who was freaking out or grieving or whatever, you you you're not going to slap them around the face and say snap out of it. You will hold their hand, and we all know how to do that. The question is, can you do it for yourself? And for me, that was a huge challenge because I hated myself so much for so many years. I was my worst enemy. So to hold my own hand internally in that sense, that's what I mean by sending love into the feeling. And what happens then is the feeling starts to change. It starts to melt. The sharpness, the sharp edge of it, edges of it start to melt. And you start to be okay with being not okay. And it's almost as if a kind of happiness starts to arise, but it's not like a it's a kind of happiness you haven't tasted before. It's a happiness of I can be okay with this. It makes you immensely strong.\n\nYou talked about forgiveness. Did you forgive the man that murdered your friend and teacher?\n\nYes. Quite quickly. it I mean in a way it was made easier because it became really clear that he was psychotic, and of course that's no excuse or condoning or anything like that, but somebody who is really unable to control themselves, I mean how can you hate them or whatever, you know, it's that's an extreme case, but there are the practice of forgiveness is a hard one, isn't it, because we we've all got people in our lives that we think might have wronged us or done which has caused us pain, and almost the way that we create our own perception of justice is by holding the grudge. Yeah. Now, now why do we do that? That's my that's the question is do we think do we think that if we let go of the grudge we have let the other person get away with it? That's how it kind of feels, right? Wouldn't you say that by holding the grudge they've got away with it? because you're the one suffering. They've really won. They're winning in each moment because you're holding on to that. In Buddhism, there's a a teaching that says it's like holding on to a piece of hot metal or holding a hot coal in your hand, and it's just burning you. So, if I'm holding the grudge, they have absolutely got away with it because they are the thing they did which was one thing maybe I am now constantly hurting, and they are absolutely the winner. So for I I wonder if we we assume I think we do assume that forgiveness is a kind of giving up, even the word forgive, the give in the word. So it sounds like we're taking a weaker position. We're giving up. We're sort of surrendering, but I think forgiveness is a strength or a power, and it's actually nothing to do with the other person. They might you're not going to necessarily write them a letter and say I've forgiven you. But you're freeing yourself. You're dropping your burden because that rage is toxic and that hurt is toxic. It's so hard to let go of it. And people can say, \"Let go and you just want to sl\n\n\nAp them in the face because what?\n\nOkay, is it that easy? I'm just going to let go.&quot; You know, it's not that easy. It's bloody hard.\n\nBut meditation gives you the tools. Partly because meditation anyway is helping to loosen up that kind of glue that we have in our minds where we're glued into those feelings. It even just a simple meditation like coming back to the breath is helping you to be less glued into those thoughts and reactions and feelings. So the feeling of rage can start to be less heavy for you. You've been through several sort of traumatic incidents. You talked about being 14, being 17, sexual abuse, parental divorce, a little bit of neglect, it sounds like, as well. Have you forgiven all of those people in your life?\n\nI don't know. I don't know if forgiveness is a big huge massive moment or if it's a process. I'm friends with all those people, very close friends with all those people. And I think here's what I think. I think I've learned how to forgive the feelings that those incidents gave rise to. Mhm. That to me is much more important than forgiving the people. Mhm.\n\nAnd I think what's also happened to me is I've started to find that the suffering that I experience has some use because it is the thing that you're using for your mental transformation.\n\nRimpache always used to say um suffering is like compost. Compost is made of rotten vegetables. People chuck it away or they know how to make the field grow and I I think it's like that.\n\nSo with forgiveness um I would say yeah meditation but I would say also thinking deeply about about the situation.\n\nYou know what's really helped me with with my dad and with other people is to think about the suffering they were going through that kind of like propelled them to behave the way they've behaved. There's always something isn't there in somebody that has made them behave the way they behave. And there's a part of us that gets very indignant and thinks how dare they they should know better. Whereas the Buddhist's answer would be well what what do you mean they should know better? They know what they know there. They are they are driven by their own confusion and their own pain. Why do you think they were out to get you? Why do you think they were deliberately out to maliciously get you? Weren't they just caught in their own suffering and you you were there? But it's not so much about you.\n\nAnd I think that starts to lighten the burden a bit when you start to think about, you know, there's a meditation I sometimes do where you you swap places with the other person in your mind. You sit and you think about being them and looking at the world out of their eyes. The person that hurt you. Yeah. So many people will be thinking about that person in their life as you speak and they'll be the challenge I guess they'll face is they'll continually come back to this idea that this person is an Yeah. They you know it almost we all are though. We are too. We all are. I am. We're all because we're all just confused. We're all at the mercy of our own minds.\n\nIf you meditate regularly, you realize how out of control you are because you're trying to sit there with your breathing and all you're thinking about is shopping lists and you think, &quot;Wow, the human mind is really pretty messed up. We can't make it do anything we want it to do.&quot; So this person that you think they're so evil and so terrible and how dare they do the thing they've done. I'm not saying that we're condoning it and saying, &quot;Yeah, you can do what you want.&quot; I'm just saying lighten up a bit because people are just doing their best and sometimes their best is really bad. Then that doesn't have to become your problem. It's not really about you.\n\nWe we we obviously take things personally. If something is done to you, of course you're going to take it personally.\n\nBut meditation helps you look at the 360° view of a situation rather than just from your perspective. And very important here that we don't get into that kind of victim shaming reality where you think, &quot;Oh, it's all about me and poor them.&quot; It's it's not that at all. It's simply that you think we're all we're all messed up in various ways and and that's the human condition.\n\nMake sure you keep what I'm about to say to yourself. I'm inviting 10,000 of you to come even deeper into the diary of a CEO. Welcome to my inner circle. This is a brand new private community that I'm launching to the world. We have so many incredible things that happen that you are never shown. We have the briefs that are on my iPad when I'm recording the conversation. We have clips we've never released. We have behind the scenes conversations with the guest and also the episodes that we've never ever released and so much more. In the circle, you'll have direct access to me. You can tell us what you want this show to be, who you want us to interview, and the types of conversations you would love us to have. But remember, for now, we're only inviting the first 10,000 people that join before it closes. So, if you want to join our private closed community, head to the link in the description below or go to daccircle.com.\n\nI will speak to you then. I'm going to let you in to a little bit of a secret. You're probably going to think me and my team are a little bit weird, but I can still remember to this day when Jamaima from my team posted on Slack that she changed the scent in this studio. And right after she posted it, the entire office clapped in our Slack channel. And this might sound crazy, but at the DOAC, this is the type of 1% improvement we make on our show. And that is why the show is the way it is. By understanding the power of compounding 1%, you can absolutely change your outcomes in your life. It isn't about drastic transformations or quick wins. It's about the small consistent actions that have a lasting change in your outcomes.\n\nSo two years ago, we started the process of creating this beautiful diary and it's truly beautiful. Inside there's lots of pictures, lots of inspiration and motivation as well, some interactive elements. And the purpose of this diary is to help you identify, stay focused on, develop consistency with the 1%s that will ultimately change your life. So if you want one for yourself or for a friend or for a colleague or for your team, then head to the diary.com right now. I'll link it below.\n\nMany of us live trapped in the life we have. I guess maybe the word trapped isn't the right word, but held back in many ways because of fear. And I wondered what Buddhism teaches us about fear in terms of fear of taking risks or you know going and becoming a Buddhist teacher or starting a business or pursuing a passion or moving to Bali. Many of us have these these dreams, these callings, but we're trapped in fear. And would you also agree that the fear can be about those bigger things, but also it's a moment-to-moment subtle anxiety that just like pervades everything? Yeah, it's both.\n\nTo me this became hugely um like obvious when I came out of that four-year retreat because I I came out that retreat was 2005 to 2009. When I came out of that retreat, everybody had smartphones. During those four years, the whole landscape of technology changed dramatically. Smartphones, social media, the whole thing happened during that time. And you hadn't been on the internet those that No, no, we had nothing. Before my retreat, some people had Blackberries and then that was it. And then suddenly it's all different. And I arrived in London and everybody's walking around with their face buried in phones and I I'm walk, you know, going up the escalator and the and the tube in London and the little billboards are moving images. Mhm. That made me feel dizzy.\n\nBut where I'm going with this is is I I I'm maybe because I've been in this unusual environment and now I'm back in normal reality. I see it with more of a shock. And I started to think, how much are we being made to feel afraid all the time?\n\nWhen news media becomes digitalized and monetized and then you have to keep the person reading, we know the tricks that people have to do. We know we all know about clickbait. We all know about how the the headline of an article has to be shocking enough to make you read the article and then you see the ads. You don't actually find out the information until two/ird way down. We know, we know that and we're all wise to that on one level and on the other level we are completely influenced by it. So we're now walking around in a world where we're constantly being told we are in danger. I'm not I'm not here to, you know, I'm not anti-technology. It's great. It can do so many good things, but it's like food. You got to eat it in the right way. If you if you overeat, you get sick. If you not discerning about what you eat, you're going to get ill. It's the same with technology.\n\nAnd so yeah, fear is now used in every every walk of life. Fear is used more than ever in politics to to make us afraid so that we vote for people because of fear. Fear is used so much now to make us go shopping, hurry up while stocks last. So what do we do about that when we live in a world that is commercially driven or driven by power dynamics that mean that fear is just a great motivator and a great way to influence? I think we we have to protect our minds with meditation. Does this mean like throw your phone away and don't go outside? What does it mean? No. Don't throw your phone away. Don't don't go and run away to the mountains. Learn to face the fear. Learn to be fearless in a frightened world. And I think this is something very practical because I I do this through practicing microscopic moments of meditation in busy situations. What does that mean? So, I might be standing in a queue and I'll feel the ground under my feet. I might be in an airport queuing up and instead of going into that impatience thing and the stressy mode or or checking my phone, I'll I'll do a mo moment of meditation. Something that's very important to me is to meditate every day, sitting down and doing it kind of formally, but also these micro moments throughout the day. Tiny moments where you just become aware of yourself, become aware of the ground under your feet, become aware of your shoulders, drop your shoulders, be aware of them, become aware of your breathing. And I find this if you do this in cues and traffic jams, it changes your entire reality because what are you doing? You're re you're rew you're rewiring your own brain.\n\nYou you know how whenever we're in a stuck situation like a queue or a traffic jam, we are wired to respond with tension and impatience. But if you do a mic micro moment of mindfulness, you're changing the wiring. You're teaching yourself that you can meet stress in a calm way. You can be okay with being stuck in in the traffic. So what that does is it then makes you more fearless because you're almost like looking forward to the next traffic jam whereas most of us are just reacting to situations instead of reacting you're thinking bring it on.\n\nThere is a gap isn't there between what happens and how we react. That's the crucial gap. the gap between impulse and action because so much is reaction. So so much of I think we spend so much of our lives just reacting in in in the I feel hungry so I eat somebody says hello I say hello but even on a moment-to-moment basis how much are we consciously living and how much are we just reacting and so when we can find that gap between the impulse and the action and make a different choice I think it's almost like in every moment we're we're standing at a fork in the road In every moment, what one road is the road of reaction and the other road is the road of response.\n\nMeditation helps you pause and see you could make a choice. I don't have to get stressed out in traffic. I could instead be mindful or I don't have to get I don't have to my colleague at work is grumpy. I don't have to bite their head off and then regret it. I could I could hold back.\n\nSo you say meditation is the solution to many of the things we've talked about today including the response versus reaction fork in the road. Yeah. So if you were making a plan for me from this day onwards on how to implement meditation in my life. Yeah. Um what would that plan look like? First of all, chuck all those things away. Okay. All of this stuff on the desk. Paraphernalia. Okay. So on the desk I have like a sound healing bowl, some incense, some rings, some little I don't even know what these are. Yeah. So, we're going to chuck all the paraphernalia away in the bin. Okay, we're going to bin all of it. Okay, let me You know, you don't need any equipment.\n\nThere's a lot of spiritual tat, isn't there? I mean, I said it. You know, it's about you and your mind. It's not about having little symbols and incense and you don't need it. And okay, what is the plan? The plan is to start with 10 minutes a day. Okay. 10 minutes a day. When? Ideally morning. Okay. Simply because you're starting your day, right? And your cortisol level is highest in the morning. When you wake up, there's a spike of cortisol. Bring it down with meditation. So, I get up, I check my emails, check my WhatsApp, then meditate. I'm joking. If you want. No, no. Tell me the the optimal way. You're going to be my Get up straight away and meditate. Okay. Get up straight away and meditate because you're starting your day, right? And 10 minutes is enough to start with. And the beauty of this is that you know they can show in brain scans that 10 minutes a day after 4 days there'll be visible changes in your brain. So knowing that keeps you going because you think okay this literally is like weight training. I'm going to get muscle. And what do I do? So I sit down somewhere. You sit down and you're going to focus on your breathing. But what I find really crucial is that you are not just launching yourself into it. you are introducing a bit of compassion into the process and this is what elevates the meditation from being just a kind of brain gym into being something that takes you to a much more kind of like spiritual realm of it and\n\n\nAnd it connects in with what we were\ntalking about earlier about learning to\nbe more compassionate to yourself and\nothers. So you start with that\nintention.\nSo you start by just settling and\nsitting. You know, some people sit\ncross-legged on the floor, but it's also\nokay on a chair. But on the chair, there\nshould be some sense of posture. So\nyou're sitting up straight. And you\nwould start with setting the intention.\nAnd I don't mean an intention such as,\noh, today I want this or want that. It's\nthe bigger intention. Why am I\nmeditating? I am meditating for not only\nmyself, but for all living beings. I'm\ndoing this for me and the world. And I'm\nnot I'm not not trying to fool myself by\nthinking if I do my meditation somehow\nwars will end or whatever. No, it's more\nthat if I do this this will help me\nbecome more effective in the world and\nspread more love and compassion. So\nthat's the reason. So you're setting\nthat intention with your thinking for a\nfew moments and then you're going to\nstart to be aware of yourself.\nSo okay. So let's just try this.\nSo take a moment to set the intention of\ncompassion\nmaking the intention that you're doing\nthe practice for yourself and others.\nAnd now just become aware of your hands.\nMaybe your hands are resting on your\nknees or your legs.\nAnd feel that there's a lot of nerve\nendings in the fingers. So, it's easy to\nstart here where you just feel the\ncontact between your skin and your\nclothing.\nYou're aware of your hands resting on\nyour legs.\nBring the focus up to your shoulders.\nMost of us have tense shoulders because\nwe're on our phone or behind a desk. So,\nas you're aware of your shoulders, the\ntension can just drop away.\nBring your focus to the front of your\nbody.\nStart to notice your breathing.\nThe trick here is not to try to breathe\nor go into deep breathing, but just let\nyour breath be natural\nand focus on the rising and falling of\nyour chest or your belly with each\nbreath.\nAnd when you realize your mind has\nwandered, gently come back to the\nbreath.\nNow you can make the focus more precise\nby feeling the air in your nose or your\nmouth. If you can breathe through your\nnose, then do that,\notherwise the mouth. And you're sensing\nthe air as it comes in and out of your\nnostrils or your lips.\nYou can feel the air brushing against\nthe skin at the edge of your nose or\nyour mouth.\nAnd then you'll realize your mind has\ngone somewhere and you gently bring it\nback.\nOkay. And to end the session, we'll just\ndo a short one for now. Take another\nmoment to think about compassion.\nYou're dedicating your practice to\nfreedom, compassion, and happiness for\nyourself and all beings.\nAnd stop there.\nI mean, that was short, but it gives you\nan idea of the process. And one major\nwarning\nis you trip yourself up if you try and\nthink, well, did it go well?\nPartly because of the culture we're in\nand how everything is about sensation. I\nthink we only think something's working\nif it makes us feel something. Mhm. And\nmeditation is very different. You\nknow, when I start when I first started\nmeditating, I described how I really\nhated it and found it, you know, really\nstressful. One thing I remember that\nhappened to me was I started to do quite\na lot of it cuz I thought, okay, I'm\ngoing to get into this thing and do it\nand become like a a pro and I was doing\nloads of it and finding it was making me\nfeel more unhappy and I was feeling this\nkind of sense of like sinking feeling in\nmy chest and I thought, you know, I' I'd\nstruggled with Depression anyway. I\nthought this making me more depressed\nand I went to Gelong Thubten, my teacher\nand I\nsaid medit I'm doing loads of it it's\nmaking me depressed he said it's nothing\nto do with the meditation it's it's how\nyou are\nhe said you're a junkie\nyou're using your meditation like a drug\nI said what do you mean he said well I\nthink you're sitting there waiting for\nit to to kind of like come on you're\nwaiting for it to give you a high and\nit's so true because I realized I'd been\nsitting\nor like getting addicted to it and\nthinking, okay, I'm going to do my\nmeditation,\nright? I've done 5 minutes. Where's\nwhere's the bliss? When am I going to\nfeel good?\nAnd what he was trying to tell me is\nthat if I'm trying to make myself feel\ngood, I'm already coming from a place of\nlack.\nYou know what I mean? I'm already saying\nto myself, I don't feel good. So, I'm\nactually promoting\na sense of lack. So how do we perceive\nthe meditation then? If it's not at some\njust give up judgment. Just do it. Just\ndo it. Just do it. And it's not going\nwell, going badly. I like it. I don't\nlike it. You just do it. And try to let\ngo of quality control.\nI really need to start doing it. My\npartner, she's so great. She does it\nevery morning for like 20 20 30 minutes.\nSo why didn't you sit next to her? She\nsaid this to me. What stops you? What\nstops me?\nHm.\nI mean, it's there on tap. She's doing\nit every morning. What's stopping you s\nsitting next to her?\nI think\nI think one of the things that comes to\nmind is how uncomfortable I feel in\nsilence and\nthe idea of like silence and being\nbecause she's there. Would you be okay\nbetter on your own then? No, it's just\nlike silence with my own thoughts. I\nspend a lot of time trying to kind of\nnot I spend a lot of time trying to\ndistract myself.\nDon't we all? That's Welcome to the\nmodern world. I'm pretty extreme. Are\nyou? Yeah, I'm pretty extreme. So like\nif I go into the shower, I have to have\nsomething playing something talking. A\npodcast. It could be the news. It could\nbe YouTube. If I'm no matter where I am,\nI always even when I go to sleep, I have\nto be listening to something. So my I've\nlike almost wired my brain in the\nopposite way where it's there's always\nsomething. Yeah. I went through a phase\nwhere I couldn't eat unless I was also\nwatching something. I mean, yeah. I\nmean, I do that. I can't unless there's\nsomething playing. But that's why\nmeditation's perfect for you. Yeah, I\nknow. Tell me about it. This is giving\nyou a way to find a different way to\nexperience yourself. M\nYeah. I mean, you know, you I'm sure you\nexercise. Yeah. So, you go to the gym.\nYeah. And you That's challenging. Yeah.\nAnd you you're you're pushing your\nmuscles and there's a kind of like\nthere's an effort required. Do you know\nwhat it is? Same thing. Same thing with\nthe gym. I know that if I go, my muscles\nare going to grow. I'm going to be\nstronger. I'm going to be health\nhealthier, happier. All those things.\nAnd because I've never done meditation,\nI don't actually have evidence of the\nupside. Just have a brain scan after 4\ndays and you'll see. That's why I ask\nyou the question about you before and\nyou after. Yeah. What is the difference?\nAnd if whoever's listening to this right\nnow,\ncan you give them a before and after\npicture of how their life will will be\npractically different if they implement\njust 10 minutes a day meditating. Okay.\nSo, so I find it really inspiring to\nknow that there there are visible\nchanges in the brain scan after 4 days.\nYou don't necessarily feel those\nchanges, but knowing that gives you\nfaith and confidence just like you know\nif you eat healthy food your your you\nknow your body will improve your health\nwill improve. So knowing that is a good\nthing in terms of seeing the results.\nEverybody's different. There's no you\ncan't draw a graph. You can't say if you\ndo x amount of days you will reach this\nlevel of calm or focus. But what happens\nis as you start to meditate after a few\ndays or weeks you just start to feel you\ncan handle stuff better. So for me um\nthe the p my main practice is is very\nmuch connected what I was talking about\nbefore with uh trying to sit with\ndiscomfort and stop pushing it away. And\nthat's a total revolution in my life. I\nwas always on the run always. I think we\nfailed to realize that actually our\nentire\nhuman experience is just in our minds.\nThat does that make sense what I'm\ntrying to say there? Because I'm there\nasking you about like what's the upside\nof this whatever but it's it's falling\ninto the trap of not realizing that\neverything I I will experience today is\nactually formed in my own mind. That's\nthe whole reason for meditation is to\nknow that everything is dependent on\nyour mind. The good and the bad.\neverything. So instead of being so\nobsessed with the details of what's\ngoing on, go to the source.\nYeah. Go to the source, the the\nprojector rather than the movie.\nGo to the source and and change that and\ntransform that and work on that. So how\nhas your projector changed in the last\n30 years? I I'm definitely a happier\nperson. I'm I'm definitely um more at\npeace with myself. that that negative\nvoice doesn't come up, you know, that\nthat self-hatred has has really kind of\nlike what's the word? Kind of like uh\nyeah, gone away. And um I'm happier. And\nI've got I I feel so so lucky to have\ntools that I know I can use when I'm\nsuffering.\nYou know, for the last few years, I've\nI've suffered with quite a lot of ill\nhealth because I had really really\nsevere COVID right at the start of the\npandemic, and it did something to my\nheart and my lungs. And since then, I've\nhad you could call it long COVID, you\ncould call it heart, lung damage,\nwhatever. So, I I live with kind of\nlevels of illness that are hard to deal\nwith. But this practice is something I\ncan do. I can I can sit there with an\nill body and send love into that body\nand feel kind of okay. So, it's made me\nstronger and I can I can function better\nthan before. But, you know, the other\nthing is I don't really care. I don't\nreally care whether it's working or not\nbecause I I trust it and I'm just going\nto keep going and I I'm in for the long\ngame. I'm just going to keep going. You\nsigned a lifelong vow. I did. I'm I'm\nI'm I have I have taken vows to to be a\nmonk for my life. Why? When I put the\nrobes on, I felt every I felt every cell\nin my body\nclick. I mean, it sounds a bit weird,\nbut it just felt like that. I felt all\nmy cells fall into place. I just felt\nreally this is\nthis is this is really right for me. I\nthink it's what I'd been looking for all\nalong when I is is a way of working with\nmy mind. I'm I'm not really interested\nin religion. I'm not really interested\nin faith, but I'm really interested in\nthe mind. And being a monk has given me\nthis opportunity to work on my mind but\nalso an opportunity to to be of some use\nin the world like some help to others.\nSo, okay, let me challenge this a little\nbit in terms of how I imagine someone\nlistening might might respond. They go,\n\"Okay, so you went through this process.\nYou worked on your mind. Now you've\nworked on your mind.\" No, no, working.\nIt's not over. Okay. It total work in\nprogress. And this is the this is part\nof the misconception is someone will\nlisten and say, \"Well, you've worked on\nyour mind now, so go live now.\" No, it's\nan ongoing process. I'm still a mess.\nI'm still a mess, but I'm okay with\nbeing a mess. That is a huge difference\nis that I I still get stressed. I still\nget upset, but I'm really gentle with\nmyself in a way that I never knew how to\nbe. I was always, \"You're so disgusting.\nWhat's wrong with you? You should be\nashamed of yourself.\" That's gone. Now\nI'm okay with with myself. And that\nthat's such that that is happiness that\nreally has made me happier. So it's for\nme it's not about, oh, you've done it\nand now it's it's a it's ongoing.\nWhat is the most important thing we\ndidn't talk about that we should have\ntalked about as it relates to the\nsuffering that my viewers are probably\nexperiencing in their own life? You know\nwhat's missing always is we can talk\nabout this stuff but are we going to do\nit? And what's really missing for\nso many people is they will listen to\nthis episode or they will read a book\nabout meditation or see a video and it\nall sounds great but then we get busy\nand forget to do it. What's missing for\neverybody is the doing it. How how do we\njump from being interested in something\nto actually doing it? I mean there's\nthere's a a joke which is the definition\nof a Buddhist is somebody who's either\nmeditating or feeling bad that they're\nnot meditating. And that is it, isn't\nit? It's a bit like exercise. We know we\nshould be doing it. So for me the the\nthe missing link is\npeople try and force themselves to\nmeditate because they know it's good for\nthem and then it's it's a hopeless\nprocess. They won't do it because it\nbecomes another should\non the to-do list. I think the only way\nto become really enthusiastic about\ndoing it every day is to really think\nabout it and realize that it will give\nyou what you were looking for anyway\nfrom the coffee, the drugs, the alcohol,\nthe sex, the whatever it is you're into,\nwhatever we're looking for out there.\nMeditation it was happiness. It was\nfreedom. It was release. The only place\nyou can find that is in your mind\nbecause going down those roads is just\ntaking you further into needing more.\nSo, so I think that the the thinking\nprocess that helps people meditate every\nday is to think about how it will give\nyou what you were looking for anyway\nand then you want to do it then then you\nfeel like oh okay the we have no sense\nof exhaustion when it comes to chasing\nour addictions do we? So imagine if we\ncould meditate with that kind of energy.\nI often often think I often think maybe\nI need to go do some kind of um\nmeditation retreat as well just to get\nme sort of started and just uh have\nsomeone there with me who can\nhelp me think through some of these\nthings that can be a good thing just to\njust to get started. It doesn't have to\nbe four years like no like a weekend, 3\ndays, 5 days, 2 days. That can be a good\nthing. And that's why Buddhist centers\nare good places because they offer that.\nAnd there's never a kind of you got to\nsign along the dotted line and say, \"I'm\nnow a Buddhist.\" We're\n\n\nSo not interested\nin converting people to Buddhism. But\nyeah, go to a retreat. Is Buddhism\ngrowing? Yeah, I imagine it is. In the\nworld, you know why it's growing? It's\nbecause it doesn't try to attract\nfollowers and because of that, it grows.\nInteresting and also because of\neverything else that's just going on in\nthe world at the moment, um, with you know\npeople feeling more isolated, lonely,\npurposeless, Depression, suicidality,\nall of these things. We're seeing a lot\nespecially in young men as well. The\nstats around young men and their\nsuicidal ideation and their feelings of\npurposelessness and their loneliness\nstats are worse than women's as well.\nBut I think yes, the way the world is\nwith all of these challenges and\nnegative things, at the same time, what's\nhugely growing in modern culture is\npeople getting more interested in their\nown minds. There are more and more\npeople going for psychotherapy,\ncounseling, meditation, any kind of\ndiscipline that helps us to understand\nour minds better. That interest is\ngrowing. So, we're in a really\nexciting phase in history where people\nare wanting to transform their minds,\nwanting to take control of\nconsciousness. It's because we've had\nsomething fail us. We maybe we're waking\nup to realizing that the system hasn't\nworked for us. We've created a kind of\ngilded cage for ourselves. This\nbeautiful material world that is also\nrunning out of resources. So, it's not\ngoing to be able to serve us much longer\nif we carry on abusing the planet. So,\nwe have created our own prison and now\nwe're looking for the way out.\nTurns out it wasn't the individualism\nand the materialism\num after all.\nMaybe it was always there inside us.\nThat's Buddhism would say that we are\nwe are Buddha within. We all have a\nsleeping Buddha within us and we we have\npotential. We have great capacity for\nawakening, great capacity to help\nothers. It's just like a crystal covered\nin layers and layers and layers of mud.\nAnd we need to clear the mud away. We\nhave a closing tradition on this podcast\nwhere the last guest leaves a question\nfor the next guest, not knowing who\nthey've left it for. And the question\nthat has been left for you,\nwhat are the ways that you express your\nlove and appreciation for the people who\nmatter to you in your personal or\nprofessional life?\nI\ndon't do this very well all the time,\nbut I try to be there for them when\nthey're going through a hard time. I\nbecause I used to find it really scary\nand I'd run away and I'd close down. I\ntry to in the same way as I try to move\ntowards my own discomfort. I try to be\nthere with other people when they're\nuncomfortable and not judge. I try that.\nI'm I've I'm sure I fail a lot, but I\ntry. A friend of mine described that as\nsitting in the mud with them. Yeah.\nYeah. We often try and fix and correct\nand Yeah. I have a I see myself trying\nto do that, give advice, whatever. It's\nnot about that. It's about being with\nthe person, being being\nwith them without judging them. Thank\nyou so much for what you do. Um, you've\ngot these incredible books which I'm\ngoing to recommend everybody check out.\nBoth Sunday Times bestsellers, I believe.\nAnd a monk's guide to happiness,\nmeditation in the 21st century. And this\nbook is called Handbook for Hard Times,\na monk's guide to fearless living. I\nthink that your message is more\nimportant now than it's ever been\nbecause there's, I mean, much of the\nreason why I've probably stumbled across\nBuddhism is for the same reasons that\nmany people are, which is it feels\nintuitively like the answers we've\nbeen given in the way of life that we're\nall living is failing us in some way.\nAnd we know that we can feel it inside\nourselves. But the answers that we see\nto\nas antidotes to that feeling aren't much\nbetter all the time. And there again\noften they're about self or it's about\nyou know, join this group of people that\nare doing this sort of thing over here\nor there's this religious you know, group\nthat you can join. But actually,\nBuddhism offers us an alternative\napproach, which is to go inside\nourselves and to alleviate ourselves\nfrom the suffering that we've\nself-imposed by\nunderstanding that maybe the answers we\nwere looking for were inside the whole\ntime. And um, I'm so glad that people\nlike you do podcasts like this because\nthat you're getting the message out\nthere into the world. And it's a message\nthat I think is so unbelievably\nimportant. And I think maybe, maybe just\nmaybe, maybe you've persuaded me today to\njust give it a shot. Yeah. And that's\nthe hard thing because it's good. It's\ngood enough. It's all well enough\nknowing about something. But then what\nwill I do tomorrow morning?\nWhen you sit there tomorrow morning.\nYeah. And your mind starts racing.\nWhatever you do, don't feel like you\nfailed.\nJust remind yourself that the thoughts\nactually make your meditation stronger.\nBecause if coming back to the breath is\nwhat you're trying to do, you have to\nhave somewhere to come back from. Yeah.\nThe thought that took you away is\nexactly what brings you back. So bring\nit on. The more thoughts, the better.\nOkay.\nThank you. I'm so appreciative of you\nand thank you for spreading the words\nthat you're you're spreading because as\nI said, you're going to be saving and uh\nsaving a lot of people from a lot of\npain and suffering, but also um giving\nthem a an alternative approach to\nsitting with it with a compassion. So\nthank you. Thank you. It's really lovely\nto spend time with you.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
