  "cleanText": "[Music]\nWelcome back to Practically Intelligent.\nI am your host Sinan Ozer, and with me is\nusually OE, but this week he is taking a\nwell-deserved vacation, so I will be introducing you all to our most recent\ninterview with Rich Skrenta, the Executive Director of the Common Crawl Foundation.\nIf you've never heard of Common Crawl, it\nis a gigantic open-source repository of\ndata that virtually every LLM you've\never used has at some point used that\ndata from.\nWe talk about the past, history, present, and future of Common Crawl, so take a listen.\nAll right, we're welcoming Rich Skrenta, Executive Director\nof Common Crawl, to Practically\nIntelligent.\nThank you so much for being\nwith us today.\nOh, it's my pleasure, really\nhappy to chat.\nYeah, well, I want to get\ninto everything that you're working on\nnow, and I promise to everyone listening,\nwe are going to get there, but I think\nit's really crucial that we establish a\nbit of a through-line here because Rich is\nnot someone who just kind of wandered\ninto AI one day and said, \"I think I can\ntake a crack at this.\"\nYou know, so many, so\nmany leaders these days, I think, have\nthat mindset of AI is this a new\ntechnology, it's going to enable me to do\nall these new things, you know, I don't\nneed all that experience to really make\nthis work, but Rich is, for me, really, the\nopposite of that.\nSo I want to first\nstart by asking you to tell us and our\nand our listeners just a little bit\nabout your history, uh, specifically about\nyour, your philosophy and history with\ndata aggregation, uh, as specifically for\nAI and machine learning systems because\nI think it's, it's a really fascinating\nhistory, and I think our listeners are\nreally going to love that.\nSure, well, I've\nbeen working with search and aggregation\nfor, I guess, decades now, um, and I've gone\nback and forth between startups and very\nlarge companies multiple times.\nI sold a\nlittle search engine to Netscape way\nback in 1998, and I sold a, uh, a news\nsearch engine to, uh, some newspaper, uh,\ncompanies in 2005, and then I decided I\nwanted to compete with Google, and so I\nbuilt, uh, BCO, which was a, you know,\nfull-scale consumer search engine, uh,\nwhich we ended up, ended up selling to\nIBM Watson in\n2015.\nAnd, uh, these were all really\ninteresting projects because we had, you\nknow, you know, millions of users on these\non these sites, so we sort of had all the\nissues with content moderation, um,\ncopyright, access to data, and dealing\nwith those both as a startup and inside\nof large enterprise that have, you know,\nlots of lawyers and scrutinize\neverything was interesting, uh, and then\nmost recently before Common Crawl, I worked at\nat Meta, where I was running knowledge\ngraph, which entailed, uh, a web crawler,\nand I also ran a system that looked for, uh,\nbasically, bad URLs that are posted on, on\ntheir family of apps to see if they're\nin policy or out of policy, but these\nwere vast systems with hundreds of\nmachine learning engineers, uh, you know,\nhundreds of billions of pieces of\ncontent a day, and, uh, you know, really a\nfootprint in almost every country in the\nworld, in every language, uh, jurisdictions\nall over the place, so fairly complex\npolicy requirements to operate them\neffectively, um, but then when I left, uh,\nMeta, I took some time off because I\nrealized that I'd done about six\nstartups in my career and worked at five\nvery large companies, and I don't think\nI'd had more than two weeks between any\nof these jobs, and so I said, \"Well, maybe I\nshould just, before I run back into\nanother burning building, I'll just take,\nyou know, take a few months to gather\nmy thoughts.\"\nWhile I was doing that, uh,\nGil Elbaz, the chairman and founder of\nCommon Crawl, um, put out a post, and he\nsaid, \"Hey, I'm looking for a new Executive\nDirector for this project.\"\nAnd I know Gil\nfor, you know, many years, and I was\ncertainly aware of Common Crawl.\nWe\nworked with them at BCO, uh, but I\nthought, \"Well, this is really interesting\nbecause Common Crawl, it's sort of a\nunique animal.\nIt's a nonprofit\nFoundation.\"\nGil, after he left Google, had\nthis vision that web crawls should not be\nclosed source, that they should be open\nsource, open data, and so he started this\nproject to crawl the web and give it\naway for free, and I think when he\nstarted it, he had this idea that\nsomebody would download the data set and\nmake the next Google, and that didn't\nreally happen for 15 years, um, I think\nreally until LLMs came along.\nSo it was\nsort of a sleepy project for most of its\nlife, um, it's immensely useful, uh,\nyou know, tremendous resource for researchers,\nit's cited in over 10,000 research\npapers,\nuh, people have used it for machine\ntranslation, all sorts of things, uh, but\nit, but starting about two years ago, it\nturned out that, uh, LLMs just have this\nvoracious appetite for training tokens,\nand Common Crawl at this point is a\nmassive data set, 250 billion pages\nspanning the 17 years, it's nearly 10\npetabytes, uh, so it turns out it's one of\nthe largest or maybe the largest corpus\nout there for LM training, uh, at the\nmoment, and I thought, \"Wow, this is kind\nof a really cool project.\nThis is, I mean,\nCommon Crawl is like not just a National\nTreasure, it's almost, you know, a Global\nTreasure, uh, it's a global resource, and\nit's been non-commercial for its entire\nexistence.\nWe've never charged a penny\nfor our data, uh, we crawl very politely.\nOur robot, which is called CC bot, uh,\ntakes great pains to, you know, be a\npolite citizen of the web, consults\nrobots.txt, doesn't accept cookies,\ndoesn't bypass pay gates or login, uh, it\nonly archives pages that have\nintentionally been put on the web so\nthat people can see them, and it's not a,\nit's not a complete copy.\nEach month, we\ngo out and try and pull in, I, I estimate\nit's like 5%, you know, let's do another\nacademic sampling of the web and add\nto the, uh, add to the archive, uh, so it's\nbeen exciting.\nI started about a year ago,\nand, uh, it's been a lot of fun, uh, in\nworking with a lot of partners on the, uh,\nAI side to see what they want.\nUm, we've\nhad requests to do things like push into\nunderrepresented languages, like the\nlittle languages in Europe, like Catalan,\nthere's 500 subregional languages in\nIndia, um, you know, there's, there's areas\nwhere our web graphs are, are not as\nstrong, and, uh, so we want to make sure\nthat we have a proportionate, you know,\nrepresentation of the world's\ncontent to the extent we can.\nYeah, and, and frankly, it's, it's noble, and my\nmy first question is actually based on\nexactly that, that thought, which is, so, uh,\nfor, for reference for everyone, Common\nCrawl was originally, uh, founded in 2007, so\nthis is not, this is not necessarily a\nnew organization, but to, to your point,\nRich, after you've been on for about a\nyear, you have been expanding, not just\nthe actual data set itself, and, and\nthoughtfully so, you've also expanded in,\nin, at least in my experience and what\nI've seen, you've also been expanding in\ntrying to, uh, make access much more\neasier to the data set.\nYou know, if you\ngo to their website right now, go to the\nwebsite, you'll see dozens of examples of\nyou know, notebooks of people using it,\nexamples on how to get it from S3, which\nyou can get totally for free, um, through\nAmazon.\nSo can, can you talk us through a\nlittle bit more about that, uh, overall\nphilosophy of, I'll put it in your words,\nof trying to become a Global Treasure,\nright?\nWhat is now potentially, definitely,\nI would say, a National Treasure, what,\nwhat are those steps into becoming a\nGlobal Treasure?\nBecause I think, I think\nthe first step is diversity and\nrepresentation, right?\nMaking sure that\nyou are at least representing global\ndata in, in certain ways, whether you\nmeasure that through languages\nrepresented or, you know, websites\nrepresented around the world, but what\nare the, the steps in your mind, what's\nthe pipeline to become that Global\nTreasure?\nYeah, a great question.\nUm, yeah,\none of the first fires that we were\nfighting when I joined, uh, last year, was\nthat our, uh, Common Crawl hosted in Amazon, they\ngive us a generous, uh, hosting support\nfor the data set, uh, which would be quite\nexpensive if we had to pay for it\nourselves, so we're definitely very grateful\nto them, uh, but it turns out our, our S3\nbucket was on fire, and so when we put\nout a new data set, so many people were\ncoming to get it, and these, these monthly\ndumps are so large that everyone was\njust getting, you know, access to, I\nbecause the S3 bucket couldn't withstand\nthe inbound number of requests.\nIn fact,\nlast year when we put out our September\nupdate, uh, we started getting 11,000\nrequests per second, uh, against the S3\nbucket, and then, unfortunately, uh, some\nof our, you know, users are not being\nmalicious, but they're just so eager to\nget it that they spin up more instances\non their side to try and, you know, slam\nit, and so the, uh, number of requests per\nsecond went up to a million, uh, which I,\nyou know, I didn't even think was\npossible, um, because that's those are big\nnumbers from, uh, from where I come from,\nbut I guess CloudFront is pretty\neffective, it, uh, it's scaling, uh, but we\nwere able to work with Amazon engineers\nand identify hotspots in the process and\ncorrect them, and so at this point when\nwe put out updates now, it's, it's pretty,\nit's a pretty smooth process, but that\nwas sort of step one, like, if you can't,\nif you can't download the data set,\nobviously that's not just Ops, basically,\nexactly.\nSo, like, let's fix that.\nUm, but\nthen on the, on the diversity front, we're\njust having lots of conversations with\ndifferent organizations, um, uh, frankly,\naround the world about what they would\nlike to see in the data.\nUh, there are\nthings like, uh,\nand I don't know how technical we want\nto go, maybe, you know, you could let me\nknow how pleased you want to go into, um,\nbut there's, there's sort of two, two\nversions of the data set, um, in, in\nthe bucket.\nThere's the raw HTML, which is\nquite large, and then there's an extract,\nand those, those are called the WARC, in\nthe web files, and the web file is, you\njust the text from the page, you know, if\nyou did the boilerplate extraction, got rid\nof the HTML, whatever JavaScript or CSS\nmight be on there, and just took the, you\nknow, the tokens or text that you wanted\nto, to work with from the body\nspecifically, or just the entire page?\nWell, you know, if you think about, like, a\nyou know, a news site, right?\nThere's\ntypically, you know, C-clamp navigation,\nstuff like that, and so, you know, yeah,\njust taking kind of the text extract out,\ngotta, um, and so a lot of people prefer\nto use those files for two reasons: one,\nso that they don't have to do the\nextraction themselves, which is expensive\nto apply to the entire HTML archive, uh,\nyou know, this, the, the extract is\nabout 5% of the size of the, of their\noverall stuff, so it's just, it's just\neasier to get, um, and then, and they don't\nhave to pay for it, uh, however, um, you\nknow, our extract is, it's okay, but it's\nnot, it's not great by modern standards,\nso it turns out that LLMs benefit from\nthings like paragraph breaks and section\nheadings and bulleted lists, you know,\nthat, that light markup that might exist\non the page, uh, is very useful to them.\nThey actually get signal from that,\nand then there's other dimensions that\nare interesting that we've been talking\nabout, like, instead of doing page-level\nlanguage identification, could we do\nparagraph-level language\nidentification, uh, because sometimes, you\nknow, there's a page that's got multiple\nlanguages on it, um, or even sentence-\nlevel language identification, and can we\nupgrade our, our language classifier to\nbe, to be more comprehensive and more\naccurate?\nSo those are the kinds of\nconversations we've been having with\nwith folks, and then we've had, um, a\nnumber of requests just to make the\nthing bigger, like, crawl more frequently,\ncrawl more pages, but we want to do that\nin a way where the, where we can maintain\nthe quality, um, because, you know,\nsometimes when you get deeper to a site,\nyou start to get pages that are less\nrelevant, so we want to make sure that we\nhave metrics in place so that that as we\ndo expand the breadth and depth of the\ncrawl, that the quality won't\nsuffer.\nOne thing, Rich, it's kind of, um, we\nhave this new audience around AI where,\nand I've for talk about is that a lot of\nfolks, uh, with the background in ML are,\nand, and training models, are very\nfamiliar with Common Crawl, but new\napplication developers may not.\nUh, you\nknow, some stats here, you know, I think\n83% of\nGPT3, uh, training tokens, uh, leverage\nCommon Crawl's data corpus.\nUh, I think you\nmentioned the most or one of the most\npublicly used S3 buckets in the world.\nUh, we talked about that transformation.\nIt's a, it's a recent realization of how, uh,\nyou know, um, how Common Crawl can be used\nfor some of these foundation models.\nHow\nhas the mission of the organization\nchanged over the last two years, and, and\nand currently, where does that\nsit?\nWell, I think our mission is, uh, is\nconsistent, uh, you know, we, we want to\nprovide this academic sampling of the\nweb, um, you know, we, we, we had, we\nwere crawling every two to three months,\nand we've actually just gotten back to,\nuh, to the monthly cadence, so we started\na new crawl, uh, at the beginning of this\nmonth, and you know, we, we intend to\nlaunch those every 30 days, um, so we're\nexcited about that.\nUm, we do want to\nincrease the size of the crawl, uh, but\nyeah, we just, we want to work with people\nto say, you know, what, what features on\nthe page can we, can we be extracting\nthat are more useful?\nUm, are there\nparticular languages where we might be,\num, might be weak?\nUh, there's issues where\nthe, you know, the web graph seed might\nnot just have a lot of Catalan in it, um,\nyou know, there isn't as much Catalan\nas there is English, but then there's\nother weird technical factors, like if we\ncrawl from us East one in Virginia,\nsometimes, you know, the page, the, the\nwebsite in Catalan, uh, will actually, uh,\nyou know, it'll, it'll go us and show us\nEnglish instead, um, so because we're\ncrawling from the US, it biases the crawl\nto, to more US or more English content\nrather.\nSo, you know, how do we address\nthat?\nWell, you know, small matter of\nengineering on different fronts, but, uh,\nif we could make the crawl better in any\nway, and not just better for LLMs, but\nalso for, um, these other really important\napplications like machine translation, uh,\nyou know, like, if you want to go and\ntranslate, uh, you know, any two languages\nbetween say 230 languages on the on the\nglobal internet, it's really useful to\nhave a clean, clean corpus, um, that's well\nlabeled to be able to support\nthat.\nI, I want to come back to something\nyou said earlier, Rich, um, well, not that\npretty recently, uh, you, you're, you're\ncalling Common Crawl an academic\nsampling of the web, and that's a phrase\nI have not really heard before being\nused to describe Common Crawl.\nUm, can you\ncan you tell us a little bit more about\nwhat that means to you in the\norganization?\nLike, is, is, is the idea that\nthis is something strictly meant for\nacademic purposes, or do you foresee and\nencourage non-academic use cases for, for\nthis kind of data, cuz, you know, as a\nteacher, obviously, the academic use cases\nare clear.\nThis is easy data access for\nan NLP class that I would teach that you\nknow, that people would take, but I guess\nwhat, what, what are you thinking kind\nof beyond that, if\nanything, right?\nYeah, now that's a good\nquestion, and I, I guess I am kind of\nusing a novel $5 word to talk to\ndescribe the approach, um, but let me say\nwhat I mean by that.\nI think instead of\nacademic sampling, I could say a general\npurpose sample of the web, and by sample,\nI, it's not comprehensive, and it's\ndeliberately not comprehensive.\nEach\nmonthly crawl, uh, you know, there's\nthere's sort of all the pages that we've\never crawled in the past, uh, and then\nthere's the pages we know about that we\nhaven't crawled yet, which is about a 100\ntimes the number that we've crawled.\nThat's the crawl.\n\n\nFrontier, uh, and the\ncrawl. Crawl Frontier is vast, so each\nmonth, uh, the ranking algorithm will go\nin, and its goal is to crawl 50% recalls\nof existing pages that we've seen in the\npast to see if they've changed and 50%\nnew pages from the frontier. And we want\nto rank those. We want to rank both of\nthose in an interesting way, but we're\ndeliberately not taking a comprehensive\nsnapshot of, of every site. You know, we go\nin, we say, well, you know, maybe we got a\n100 pages from this site in the past, and\nwe know about, you know, 10,000 ones that\nwe haven't gotten. Well, let's go take, you\nknow, 200, 200 more pages and add it to\nthe list.\nUm, and you know, what could you do with\nthat? Well, researchers do all sorts of\nstudies. Um, if you go to Google Scholar\nand do a search for Common Crawl, you'll\nsee the 10,000 citations, 10,000 plus. Um,\npeople have built search engines against\nthe index, uh, but it's, it's, it's almost\nnot an\nideal, uh, corpus to build a search engine\nwith because you're not going to have\nevery, every site or every page on every\nsite. So if there's something that you're\nlooking for, it might just not be in\nthere. So if you had a, you know, a focused\napplication, um, you know, where there's a\nparticular, you know, website or narrow\ndata set, uh, that, that you want for your,\nyou know, whatever it is you're building,\nyou know, you're probably better off\ngoing and, you know, doing a deal for that\ndata with, you know, a company that has it,\nor going, you know, crawling that, that\nmaterial yourself so you can get an\naccurate and up-to-date copy. So we're\nkind of like, you know, we're sort of vast\nbut not necessarily comprehensively deep\nis maybe another way to put it. Well,\nright, because you, I mean, in a lot of\nways, it, it's, it's the idea of building\nan academic sample or just a\nrepresentative sample of some population\nis, especially when that population is\nthe Internet, is, is vast, if not literally\nimpossible, because the Internet's always\ngrowing, and there's always, you, you have\nto catch up. And the idea is, well, if you\ncould just index the entire Internet,\nwell, that's, that's kind of Google's\nmission. They, they want to index\nliterally everything on the Internet\nbecause that is what a search engine is,\nyou know, kind of for. But this is\nactually why I really wanted to start\nwith your history, because even as far\nback as Blacko, and probably even before\nthat, you can correct me, the idea of\ncuration has always been a part of the\ncompanies that you start and are a part\nof, because the, the, the philosophy that\ndata for the sake of data, I, is not\nalways going to be helpful, and\nespecially if you're trying to train an\nLLM. Well, sure, we could give it the\nentire Internet if we could, but why\nwaste the compute in the time when we\ncould give it a representative sample\nand still achieve similar benchmarks and\nsimilar performance. So that, that idea\nreally resonates to me, and, and, and I'm\ncurious if, if that is, um, if that's also\nwhat's driving this, this current mission\nto expand even more globally when you're\ntalking to these, these people abroad and\nand figuring out where, where you should\nbe pointing your crawlers and, and where\nthe crawl Frontier will, will live for\nnow. Um, what have been some of the,\nuh, pushbacks, if any, or challenges, is,\nas particularly with, uh, trying to creep\ninto that crawl Frontier, as you, as you\nput it, uh, globally? What, what kinds of\nconversations and challenges are have\nyou had to\nface? Yeah, really, really interesting\nquestions, and, um, let me say two things\nabout that. Um, one is, uh, I was talking to\na, a senior ML researcher, uh, in the\nindustry, um, and he threw an idea at me\nthat, um,\nuh, that, probably 5% of the crawl is\nworth 95% of the effective training in\nthe AI systems, exactly. And this has come\nup with, uh, you know, thinking about the\ncarbon footprint of, of the crawl, which\nis correlated with your cost to run jobs\nagainst it on AWS, right? Um, it's a lot of\nmoney to go process 250 billion pages. So\nif we could find the 5% of those pages\nthat were the most effective, um, that\nwould be really helpful, right? That would\nsave people money, and it would save, save\nthe plan electricity and heat. Uh, and we\nhave a, we, we have\na contributor to Common Crawl who\nrecently put out a blog post about this\nthat's link, linked from our site about\ntrying to, trying to actually measure the\nfootprint, the carbon footprint of Common\nCrawl. But in terms of the verticals, um,\nyou know, at Blacko, you know, that was\nsort of our differentiator. We said\nthere's a couple of thousand interesting\nverticals that have a lot of SEO\ncontention because they have high\neconomic value. So, you know, things like\ntravel, um, medical queries, shopping\nqueries, and there's just so much spam in\nthese categories that sometimes hard to\nfind the, uh, you know, the good stuff\namong, among the noise. Uh, we had, you know,\nluxury good searches or Honolulu Hotel,\nbut you misspell Honolulu, online RN\ndegree, you know, sometimes these, these\nsearches, um, we just, you know, there,\nthere's just too much junk there. And we\nhave a concern that with LLM now adding\na lot more machine-generated content to\nthe web, it may be difficult if you're\njust looking at a document and just\ngoing from the document level signals to\ntell whether it was written by human,\nwhether it was written by an\nauthoritative source, uh, or whether it\ncame out of a, you know, some kind of spam\nengine. And, uh, you know, the spam engines\nare probably going to, you know, 100x now.\nSo we're, we're thinking that it could be\ninteresting to, um, to make subs slices of\nthe data set where we have curated the\nquality sites within, within verticals\nlike, like medical, like travel, and then\nwe could, we could sort of, you know, offer\npeople not just a, uh, you know, a relevant\nslice for, for the content that they want,\nbut one that's going to be substantially\nsmaller because it's just taking that,\nthat, uh, that slice out of, out of the\nentire Internet, and then it would save\nthem a lot of time and money to\nprocess. Uh, that idea is actually\ninteresting. I, I read a paper recently,\nwell, end of last year, I, I think it was\nfrom Rice that specifically looked at\nthat data poisoning, um, idea where if you\nhave, um, some kind of generative AI\nputting out generative content into the\ntraining pool set, and then you kind of\nkeep using that iteratively over, over a\nfew generations, what is the result? And\nspecifically, they use image generation\nbecause I think it was just kind of\neasier to, you know, see, uh, the\ndegradation over time, but they came to\nthe conclusion that the, the AC data\npoisoning, even at a very small level, can\nbe pretty detrimental to generations of\nmodels, and they very specifically tested\nthis by forcing an AI to kind of retrain\non a training pool that it itself\ncontributes to over and over again, and\neven at very, very small rates of\ncontribution of AI data, you, you see\npixel deformation, like pretty quickly,\nand you see little kind of, you know, six\nfingers becomes nine fingers. I made that\nup, but like, you, what was already a\nproblem just becomes worse.\nUm, and, and I think that idea of that\ncuration, and not just for the sake of\ndiversity, but even just for the sake of\nmaintaining quality and, and, and high\nperformance and efficiency in data,\nanyone who's read, you know, books on and\nNLP knows that feature processing is, is\none of the most important steps of NLP.\nYou don't just take raw data and use it\nas is for the most part, right? You have\nto extract it, in this case, you have to,\nyou know, scan it for, for certain, um,\nyou know, certain inconsistencies and make\nsure that it's, it's matching what you\nwere going to say. So I really do\nappreciate that. I do want to eventually\ncome back to that question though of the\nchallenges that you faced, uh, in that\nexpansion, but I think O had a question. I\nwanted\nto. No, I was, uh, I was going to take it a\ndifferent direction on, go ahead. Well,\ngreat, let's come back to that then. Um, I,\nI, I am genuinely curious about some of\nthe, the challenges that you've, or just\neven pushbacks, if, if you've faced any,\nquite frankly, because I think as you're\nexpanding, I, I, I have to imagine that\ncertain countries, you know, copyright\nlaws, licensing laws, something eventually\nhas to get in the way, and, and, and I\nguess it could be as simple as because\nyou are a conscientious Internet citizen\nfollowing the robots.txt and being and\nbeing, uh, fair on the Internet, maybe that\njust kind of mitigates all of that, but\nhave there been any explicit challenges\nin going\nabroad? Um, well, I would say I wouldn't\nmake a distinction between the US and\nabroad, you know, because it's kind of a\ngeneral concern. You know, the US\nCopyright Office put out a request for\ninquiry last, last fall, and you know, I\nthink they got like 35,000 opinions from,\nfrom people. So there's many voices that\nare kind of weighing in on this. I mean,\nour, our view is that, you know, we're\ncrawling the open public web, and, um, you\nknow, we see ourselves as archivists, you\nknow, we're assembling, you know, books in\nthe library, basically, uh, but if you go\nbe a product, you should obey the laws and\nwherever your product is, and you know,\nlike folks have said to us, like, well, hey,\nmaybe you, you want to go and label\nharmful content, like hate speech, and\nwe're like,\nwell, you know, not necessarily, because\nthere's valid reasons why researchers\nmight want, might want to measure the\nrelevance of, of hate speech in certain\nmarkets, um, but if you go make a, you know,\na chatbot that, you know, is talking to\npeople, it should not, you know, be using\nthat, that content, but that's really at\nthe point of application, but there's so\nmany different applications and so many\ndifferent markets and jurisdictions and\nlanguages that I don't know how we could\neven effectively try and come up with,\nyou know, the Ultra Pure data set that\ncovers all of them. And with respect to,\nlike, I mean, there's, you know, there's\ncopyright, um, but then there's like PII,\nyou know, people's names. And so when I\nsold, uh, when I sold my search engine\nBlacko to, to IBM Watson, their, you know,\nexternal lawyers, you know, asked me, you\nknow, you don't have the names of any\nEuropeans in this in this data set, do\nyou? And I said, well, well, of course we\ndo. Um, you, it's billions of P for the\nInternet. There are quite a few of them. I\ndon't know if you've\nheard, there, there are, there are people's\nnames in the data set. Um, there's, there's\nsong lyrics, there, there is copywritten\ncontent. I mean, everything is\ncopywritten. People say, well, can you make\na safe subset? I, there won't be anything\nleft. It'll, it'll be 0.1% of the size, and\nthen you'll have lost the L in your LLM,\num, because, you know, it needs to be large\nfor, for the, the magic to work. But if\nyou, you know, I was, I was talking\nto a consulting, um,\nuh, partner who, you know, brought up a\nquestion of, like, deploying LLM tech in\nan air-gapped on-prem HIPAA-compliant\ndata center for a customer, and their\nlawyers are like, well, we don't want this\ntrained on any PII. And I'm like, well,\nguys, if you want, you know, the magic\nthing to be able to recognize names, it,\nit needs to know what a name is, and it\nneeds to have seen, you know, billions of\nnames. I mean, that's how it works now.\nThat's not to say that that machine\nshould emit PII, obviously, but that's\nkind of, you know, when it comes out, not\nnot how you train, train the model. If you\nswap a human in for that component\ntechnology, right? You're going to hire,\nyou know, let's say a person, like a 25-\nyear-old person to do the job that your\nLLM's doing, right? Well, what, what was\nthe life experience of that person? How\ndid they, how did they form the mental\nmodels in their head? Well, they, you know,\nwatch TV and listen to music and went to\nthe library and read newspapers, and, you\nknow, they ingested this enormous amount\nof content, boil it down into mental\nmodels, and then they can apply it at work,\nbut they can do it responsibly, right? They\njoin a company, they give you a policy\ndocument, they say, here, here's the rules\non how to use this stuff. But that again,\nit's, it's the point of application, not\nat the point of learning, and that's\nwhere we come, come back to sort of, you\nknow, we think that LLMs, AIs, Common Crawl\nshould have a right to read the open\npublic Internet, and there should be a\nright to train and a right to learn\nagainst this data\nset. One thing, Rich, I think it's\ninteresting\nin sort of these seminal shifts in\nsoftware, whether it was the operating\nsystem, whether it was, you know,\nunderlying databases and software, and\nthen now with data, uh, there tends to be\na, you know, rethinking of business models\nand how important open source is. Um, more\non that, it is really important, but the\nrelationship between, um, end consumers\nwith its enterprises or\nusers, uh, and software changes, you know,\nthe Linux Foundation, it's hard, hard to\nimagine the, you know, the history of, uh,\nyou know, operating systems and, and\npersonal computing without the Linux\nFoundation, right? Um, and so I guess, you\nknow, we talked about copywriting, et\ncetera, and this, this right to train, I'd\nbe kind of curious, um, how you're seeing a\nlot of, uh, you know, business model shift\nas a result of changes in relationships to,\nyou know, a right to access some of this\ndata, right? If you look at most of us\nwill be sort of familiar with, you know,\nOpenAI paying for, and different, you\nknow, companies paying, you know, mountains\nfor access to\ndata. Most, uh, you know, the average sort\nof listener or that has less machine\nlearning experience will more, uh, be more\nfamiliar with Reddit's, you know, now\nstarting to basically, um, license out\ntheir data, and then that's now under FTC\ninvestigation. So my, my question would be,\nwith all these changes, there seems to be\nan underlying, you know, this right to\nopen data is, is in question, and it's\nuncertain where that future is headed,\nand I'm curious if you can just toine on,\num, where you think, uh, that is headed,\nand where you think you, Common Crawl\ncertainly has a perspective on where\nthat should be in the\nfuture, right? Well, yeah, it's, it is, it's\nan interesting time. I think, you know, the\nrisk with, um, you know, saying that you\nhave to do private deals to get all this\ndata is twofold. One, uh, that's going to\nlimit, you know, who can access\nthe data to the, you know, to the very\nrichest companies, and, you know, open\nsource models, researchers, students won't\nhave access, uh, to that content, uh, but\nthe other issue is it just doesn't, it\ndoesn't scale to the size of, of the web.\nI mean, if you imagine, let's say you're a\nbis dev guy at some AI startup, and you\nwant to go out and start doing content\nlicensing deals, you know, how many can\nyou, how many can you realistically do? Is\nthat bis dev person? Now, let's say you\nwanted to make a product that operated\nin 130 languages, like, do you have to go\ninto each of those markets and do that,\nthat those deals too with, like, you know,\nevery newspaper of the world or\nsomething? Um, it's, it's not really, it's\nnot really feasible. It doesn't scale to\nthe size of the Internet. People just\ndon't appreciate how, how large the\nInternet is, and you know, if you, if you\njust take a small, you know, subcollection\nof content, it's not going to have the\nbreadth, uh, for the models to be able to\ntrain, you know, learn a language model,\nlearn a world model, and, and then, uh, and\nthen generalize. I think an\ninteresting, uh, an interesting, a way this\nis going right now is, is with, uh, with\nwith RAG, right? Where you have a, you know,\nyou train your big model against, you\nknow, the open corpus, and it learns a\nworld model, and it learns, um, a language\nmodel, and it, you know, you can even get\nfacts to come out of it if you're sort\nof in the popular center of the data set,\nif you're in a popular topic, uh, but if\nyou get out to the periphery of a less\npopular topic, you know, it\n\n\nStarts to make things up.\nUh, but the second problem is that these models take so long to train that if you want current, accurate data for something like, say, you know, prices on, you know, some product list, uh, it's sort of useless for that because it takes 200 days to train the model.\nUh, so then doing the second step where you do RAG against a, you know, a private collection of data that has high-quality, current information, and then, you know, maybe even use another LLM model to summarize the results for the user.\nI've seen a couple of startups that are doing that sort of thing, so I think that's an interesting way this might go.\nYeah, I think it's really interesting.\nYou know, usually when we think about this access and data, we think about it in terms of model access, you know, pre-training and training these models.\nOne thing I think, which just people a lot of times don't appreciate, is the scale of the internet, both physical and, you know, software infrastructure that goes into it.\nIt's sort of this, right, that you know, we've taken for granted.\nAnd I think a lot of times with this change in how data is treated on the internet, uh, it's hard to almost imagine.\nObviously, with new LLM model development, this is clearly going to have an impact, but with a lot of our changes and data becoming less open, I think people are, um, it'd be interesting to get your thoughts on maybe what concerns you if some of those trends continue and we don't have someone, uh, and stewards and contributors like the folks behind Common Crawl supporting the right to open data.\nHow will, uh, users, uh, you know, access to the current internet, um, and certain applications, etc., etc., change, uh, both new AI-enabled applications and ones that users have come to love?\nWell, that's right.\nUm, you know, I think, you know, the internet was, uh, you know, was created in what, 1989, 1990, by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.\nAnd I actually had the opportunity, Common Crawl went to attend an EU open web search event that was at CERN in Geneva last year, and they actually have the original web server, the very first one, which is an NeXT cube, in their museum.\nAnd, uh, and had a little piece of paper that had been taped over the thing that said, \"Please don't turn this off,\" you know, it's powering this new, this new thing on the internet.\nUm, but, you know, when the internet was created, um, you know, the idea was that we wanted to make access to knowledge globally available, that it would make the world a better place.\nAnd so these are open protocols.\nAnd, uh, I think it would be a real shame if we lost that right, if this had been a, you know, finite experiment, and we lost access to the open web.\nAnd that's kind of like why I object to the term \"scraper,\" right?\nBecause when you say you open your web browser and you go to the New York Times, you don't use the word \"scrape.\"\nIt's not, you know, Safari is not scraping the New York Times.\nIt's using standard open internet protocols to access the content that has been put on the internet so people could see it and access it with permission.\nAnd that's the same thing Common Crawl does.\nSo I think if you kind of come back and say, \"Well, we're not allowed to do that anymore,\" it's going to shut down so many applications and so much research that it's going to be a real step backwards.\nAwesome.\nSo one last question to kind of, um, culminate all of this into something a little bit more in the future, forward-looking.\nRich, given all of this, given your history with, not from the conception of the internet all the way to Common Crawl, the idea of providing access to information, data repositories of information, what are we in store for in the future with Common Crawl and with organizations like Common Crawl?\nLike, what are we, what can we look forward to, both as an academic side, from an academic side of things, and to the practitioners' side of things?\nWhat, what do we have, what do you have in store for us?\nWell, as I mentioned before, there's a lot on the data side, on the tech side, that we're working on, having better coverage of global languages, superior extract, and extract it's smaller, just so you don't have to spend $200,000 to iterate over the, uh, over the data set.\nUm, and sort of like, you know, pre-extracted slices, like per language or perhaps per topic.\nI think that will just make it all much more accessible to researchers or, you know, everyone in industry to be able to get their hands on the data and use it.\nUh, but then we would also, we're also working on the policy front.\nThere's a whole bunch of folks we're talking to, uh, because a lot of the framing that's coming out of the mainstream press is sort of simplistic, right?\nYou know, it's like, \"Okay, evil web scrapers are stealing creators' content to train murderous robots.\nThey're going to kill us all.\"\nUm, that, that's, you know, that's sort of the default narrative that's coming out of some of the, some of the major news outlets, but I don't think that's very thoughtful, right?\nThat's not three moves down the chessboard, uh, and it's not, it's not helpful to get to a place where if we want to have, you know, a useful medium between, you know, or collaboration between folks that are building these really important systems and, you know, systems that could be, um, some of the most significant technology things that have been created for mankind.\nResearchers like Jeff Hinton says this is equivalent to fire or the atomic bomb or the wheel.\nAnd so if you say, \"Well, you know, we're concerned that, uh, you know, I don't want you to read my website,\" you know, if we're not careful, we could be hindering the development of, of, you know, fantastic technology that will benefit us all.\nAnd I am AI positive.\nI think that the machines, um, you know, are more likely to help us, you know, cure cancer or deflect an asteroid than turn into, uh, you know, movie robots with red eyes.\nI think we agree with you there.\nIf, and if we want them to be best aligned with us, uh, you know, the way to, the way to teach them to behave is not to take books out of the library or restrict their access to read content.\nIt's to give them as much content as we possibly can so that they will share our values.\nYeah, I think one thing, Rich, is on that AI-positive note, is that I think it's almost, you just talking, the, you know, history of the internet, it's almost impossible now for someone to conceptualize a non-open internet and kind of rewrite that history because it had such positive influences on innovation and daily lives, et cetera, et cetera.\nAnd it really is through the, you know, the work of actually, you know, the open-source community and contributors that a lot of that history was shaped that way, and underlying technology was shaped that way in research.\nAnd then similarly, you know, you and your work at Common Crawl, I was kind of surprised to learn when you took over, it was only a few people really supporting the project, and now it's becoming this seminal, uh, project that's becoming increasingly important to the future of open data and the internet.\nSo, uh, where can people, uh, contribute, support, et cetera, get involved, uh, in supporting this project, uh, in the future?\nYeah, we, uh, yeah, we have a lot of folks that help us out on the open-source side.\nAll of our code is open source, you know, the data is completely open as well.\nUh, but we have a mailing list and a Discord, um, so folks can come in there and, uh, we talk to, uh, we talk to folks around the world all the time about their ideas for projects, but also, I think, you know, on the policy front, for people to, uh, to make their voice known, right?\nYou know, you know, to the extent that legislation is being considered in the US, in, you know, the EU, and around the world, um, you know, people should, should let the folks that are guiding the, you know, those draft legislations know, um, that they think it's important to keep this, you know, access to the open internet open.\nYou know, we don't want to go back to the days of AOL and CompuServe, you know, and that's the only way you can get online, you know, with your, with your modem.\nUh, you know, we want to go forward, not back in that way.\nAwesome.\nWell, we will drop a link, uh, to several ways you can, can all the links, all the links where you can find, uh, find Rich and Common Crawl.\nBut, Rich, thank you so much for taking the time today to chat with us.\nThis was a pleasure.\nMy pleasure.\nThanks for having me.\n[Music]\n",
