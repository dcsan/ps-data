  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHey everyone, welcome back to Practically Intelligent. As always, I'm your host Sanan Osmmer, and with me as always is the lovely Ashkay Bushan. Hey Ashay.\nHey son. Pretty excited for today. We have our friend Katelyn Donnelly coming on. Katelyn is the founder and managing director at Avalanche VC, which invests in early stage ed-tech and AI companies. Prior to that, she was co-founder of Delivery Associates, which did consulting with large government organizations to drive societal impact. Katelyn's an expert on all things ed-tech, and it's a little different. You know, we're very practical here on what you can take, etc. But I think specifically in consumer education technology, it'll be really cool to see what Katelyn has to say on the impact that AI is having in the classroom on reskilling and just how we learn in general and was excited to hear what she had to say across the spectrum here. So, let's dive in. Let's do it. Katelyn, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. I'm excited.\nI wanted to take a quote you said a couple weeks ago when we met, which was the best consumer technology is learning technology. Talk a little bit more about that and what you meant by that. Well, the other quote that I usually say that goes alongside it was the largest university in the world is YouTube.\nUm, and so people always want to build like the YouTube for learning or the Tik Tok for learning, but the reality is that consumer technology is the best learning technology out there. And um, like another example of that might be, I mean, just what I had, like, another example at the top of my head of like one of these big ones. Oh, like obviously open AI or like perplexity, like all of these AI tools that are machine intelligence are alongside human intelligence to amplify it. And so to the extent that people are working with those tools, they're learning and cognitively developing in important ways. So to the extent that all technology is a tool that makes people more effective, more productive, and learning more, the best consumer technology is all learning technology.\nAnd I think that makes a lot of sense. I mean, if you think about just humans getting together on the internet, one of the more base instincts is to share information, right? You know, some of my favorite, kind of to your point, frankly, some of my favorite Tik Tok content is watching someone teach me about woodworking. And I have absolutely no intention of actually performing any woodworking. But the idea of learning about what they're doing really excites me because I get to walk away with some new piece of information. Now, that kind of leads me to one of my, uh, something we were talking about earlier as well, Katelyn, is this kind of distinction between learning something and what you might consider more structured education. Because I think when we talk about ed-tech, obviously the ed is for education, but there really is this difference between kind of a formal structured, just what you would consider education and, you know, what you might kind of consider just learning something new. Can you walk us through what, how you think about those two concepts? Yeah. Well, when people usually say education, they think the education system. And there's very much, you know, this like formalized system both culturally and then, you know, from the government of you go to prek or kinder, you know, pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, you know, up to primary, secondary school, then you go on to higher ed, and then you go into a job and you might have corporate provided learning or workforce development. And it kind of like sees you through prek to gray education technology and that system has a lot of tech, like the in a vertical SAS sense that gets it to operate, um, in like, you know, in the whole spectrum from like courseware to enrollment software to, you know, school choice apparatus and like there's a huge market and industry there and many billion-dollar companies.\nUm, but then sometimes that overlaps with the learning, the teaching and learning, uh, in terms of curriculum products, um, or learning management systems that sell into those big institutions.\nBut learning itself doesn't need to necessarily and often doesn't always happen inside of a classroom, and it often happens outside of a classroom, whether it's like through your parents or peers or informally on YouTube. And so, um, there's some overlap between ed-tech and learning tech, but um, there are also two very distinct categories as well.\nWell, let's start to break down what those technologies are because I mean, as someone, as our listeners know, I have been teaching in some capacity for over a decade and I've taught both structured university classes as a lecturer at Johns Hopkins, and I've also taught things like general assembly, which still was a structured course, but I also make content on the internet where people can just stumble upon and and hear me give my relatively raw, unfiltered comments on reinforcement learning, and those are all, it's all me, and in a lot of ways I'm, I'm not really acting much different, but I am aware of my audience and how my audience is different. So as a teacher, I, I can feel the difference between, again, call it a classroom structured education and me just teaching my friend something over drinks, uh, that they asked me about, and I, I, I can feel that difference. How does the technology differ or or or how should it be thought about and and differed in those two pieces or in those multicontext of of learning out there?\nWell, um, you know, when you are going direct to learner, there's a, a, intimate relationship between the learner and the, uh, and the content deliverer or whoever, what whoever it is that they're learning from. And you have to really earn your right to that person's attention, right? Because like, you have to keep them engaged. You have to keep them interested because on the internet there's lots of other places they can go, and if they're not interested, engaged, they're going to go someplace else fast versus education systems or or formalized schools, you have a very captive audience. And then the actual learning and curriculum tools are often, um, sometimes they are, they are, um, they are from like, you know, the buyer is the teacher, but often it's like the bigger institution, right? Like a math curriculum might be bought by, might, might have to go through a big procurement process and like the school board, and then the teachers are really like implementing it. Um, and so you begin to get farther away from the learner as a consumer and more as like the learner is going through a education, like a fully bundled education system that includes many different parts and a lot of the choices of the technology and products that they consume are, um, are supporting a agenda that is beyond just like keeping their attention.\nAnd sometimes that's good. So, like, for example, one of, um, our most successful portfolio companies at Avalanche is a company called Prisms of Reality. And they are a math and science learning company in VR. And they sell, and it's, it's like a brilliant curriculum. You know, they each module places kids in some sort of role, like you are a scientist and, um, there's been an out, an outbreak of Ebola. You need to tell the hospital like how many cases they can expect in in a week's time, and you know, that's exponential equations.\nUm, and they sell exclusively B2B to schools, even though it's like consumer grade technology, and it's makes it so that like they built into that curriculum is a lot of teacher dashboards that make it easy for teachers to manage a classroom, to know who's succeeding, who's going, going in advance, and who's like maybe struggling a little bit so that they can tailor their instruction and help to different students who are progressing at different paces.\nIt increasingly feels like, uh, that unstructured learning that you and Snan talked about, uh, that unbundling is ripe for consumer technology disruption, especially with this new form factor prompting and, uh, LLMs or even, you know, multimodal AI. Are there examples you can think of in that direct to learning context? You know, when YouTube came out and, you know, no one thought of it as an education technology, but it's become one, and so continuing on that trend of unstructured direct to learning examples. Are there lesser known examples probably out there, but you're aware of, um, that have changed that learning paradigm, especially since the advent of LLMs? Are there, you know, demos or products you've seen that, uh, really excite you or you view as revolutionary? I think the one people get really excited about is sort of in the vein. I mean, the largest, most successful purely edtech consumer company today is Duolingo, and so, uh, language learning is definitely an area where AI generated content and interactions, um, really help students and learners learn. And so there's a company like Speak AI that is, you know, allows you to practice your speaking and get real-time feedback in for to learn a new language, and I think you speak to an avatar, and that was like an investment, one of the earliest investments that OpenAI did.\nUm, so that's one. Um, and I think the more that that you get those sort of nudges, uh, the more like those are sort of the learning in the flow of work might be like another one to think about. So like I think of Figma as like a learning company. Like Figma is now very much intertwined with the job of being a UX designer. Like it's a tool that you, you know, have to use if you're going to be in that profession. Seriously. And they had a sort of academy or a bunch of modules that are built into the product that get people to learn how to get the most out of the tool. I, I, and I think that's that's a really good point. I think this, the, I, the idea of simulation through an AI immersion, I think is the term that a lot of people would think about, like, oh, you know, like my dad would always tell me that he learned English by watching Sesame Street when he was in college because he was trying to learn English as an immigrant, and he always said like, this is immersion, you just got to listen, you got to talk, you just got to try and fail, and someone's going to tell you, hey, it's actually this way, and then you say, oh, okay, I'll do it right next time. And and and that kind of, to your point, that kind of automation, like Dolingo, you know, they do have those speaking sessions where you say something and they'll correct you, and and and and it sounds like very similar with with with speak AI. Uh, when it comes to those simulations, would you also say that outside of the simulation, for example, for me, I use one of my main use cases of AI, and you know, I say this a lot, is is frankly to help me code. Now, I say that as a broad category because on one hand, I've been coding for a decade, so that sounds weird. But on the other hand, it not only makes me faster at coding, sometimes even when I absolutely know what the next couple of lines of code are going to be, I will still prompt to say, \"Hey, can you make a function that does X, Y, and Z?\" Because frankly, I'm just curious to see, are you going to do it the same way I would have done it? And will I learn something new by letting the AI attempt to be at least more optimized than me? Because I'm someone who never got a formal, here's, you know, here's the where the terminologies come back. I never got a formal education in computer science. I don't have a, uh, a major or any kind of graduate degree in computer science. It's all in mathematics. So when I learned how to code, I learned by going to YouTube, by trying and failing to code and figuring it out along the way. Uh, I would hire people to, I would hire like contractors who are coders and say, \"I don't actually want you to code. I want you to teach me how to code.\" And they go, \"Oh, okay. That's a weird ask.\" But now I kind of treat AI like that and say, \"Hey, I need to write, I don't know, Kubernetes YAML file,\" and I kind of know what's what's supposed to go in it, but I'm gonna let you do it so I can read the best way or what you think at least is the best way to do it. So, outside of simulations, it's just people are using AI and LLMs and in and some kind of machine learning systems to say, look, I, I, I kind of get the gist of what's happening here, but it's just helpful to watch someone do it. And I think a lot of it comes back to learning styles, right? If you're a kinesthetic learner, meaning you need to do things and try and fail and repeat, an AI could help you in that sense. But for a lot of the visual learners, an AI is kind of golden to say, I just kind of want to watch you do it and then I will be able to replicate that really well. And now the auditory learners are getting the voice AI. Like is that kind of Can I tell you something? Yeah, please.\nPlease. That's actually been totally debunked. Oh, like people are not visual learners, auditory learners, or hands-on learners. It's just like those are all tools in a pedagogical system. So, it's usually like, you know, you watch me do it, then you do it, then you teach someone to do it, like in a sequence like I do, you do, we do. Or was it I do, we do, you do. Um, but like that's one of the those things in in that has kind of been debunked is like there's no such thing as like some people are visual, some people are auditory. It's like the is it's not a relevant pedagogy. Well, even better because then I guess in that in that new way of thinking or the the correct way of thinking, let's say, can an AI or can AI and LLM still match that you do, we do or I forgot, I already forgot what it was. I do, we do, you do. Can an AI inject itself into that process and and and help that learning process along or or are we still not really at a point where an AI can really assist in that in that pedagogical system? But I think you just said that there that it's already doing it. I thought it was and then you told me it was debunked. So now I'm trying to figure out where it is. I would say the thing that's debunked is like the idea, the idea that there's a difference between being a, um, like an experiential learner versus like a visual learner. Like, um, it's, it's, it's, it's not like what you were calling a visual learner, like you watching the AI do it. It's just like one step of the pedagogical process. But no, I mean, like it obviously AI is, um, is very helpful to like show you what it is that it's doing. I think one of the things that it is incumbent upon people is to be about is to know how to be\n\n\nA good learner to learn how to learn, and you're probably a really good learner, and not everyone is like a good learner.\nThey may not be patient.\nThey may not be paying attention.\nThey may not be engaged.\nSo that's one of the sort of bifurcations of all ed-tech, all education, or learning technology.\nIt's like people who are motivated, who know how to learn, who are patient, and will take the time, can learn an infinite amount using AI.\nThe people that are really struggling, that are struggling to read or struggling to do basic math, usually have emotional hang-ups or something else going on that make it difficult for them to learn.\nMakes sense.\nSo that form factor you talked about, there's a couple of interesting words you use that I wanted to focus on, which is things like simulation, nudges, different form factors that I don't think anyone would necessarily use the word simulation, for example, in the context of learning a new language unless in the context of the past two years.\nSo maybe kind of focusing on that, are there particular things you're seeing?\nIt makes sense, right, that what you talked about is that it's going to be increasingly accessible for motivated learners, whether in Bangladesh or Boston, to be able to figure out how to accelerate their learning, and will be able to learn new languages, etc.\nBut for the average student, and maybe you know, education is broad, obviously learning is broad, but for the average student who is less motivated, what sorts of products or innovation can we expect for the bottom three quartiles of learning?\nAre there new products that you find interesting that are not just for motivated learners, but also just changing, using those nudges to make learning more accessible and democratized?\nWell, that it's always a bit, I mean, learning is always very accessible.\nI think it's always very accessible.\nLike it doesn't really matter what socioeconomic or economic barrier you're in.\nIt's like, you know, that's why immigrants come to America and they might arrive penniless, but they can do incredibly well because they're highly motivated and ambitious and believe that they can take advantage of the systems to be able to be successful.\nAnd so there's usually these other things that kind of hold people back that are not just learning.\nI think one of the key things though that people are beginning to change with the education system, and this gets to the sort of how learning is eating education, is they're like, you know, everyone's born curious and creative.\nLike you learn, like you watch babies and learn, and they're doing the scientific method.\nSo it's like inhuman nature to want to learn and be curious and creative.\nAnd that often can get stamped out partially because people are being forced to do things that they might not be interested in, or they don't know why they should be interested in them, or they're just they don't see the relevancy, or they don't fully have the opportunity presented to them in the right way.\nAnd I think that the systems are going to get better at having the funding following the student instead of following the system.\nSo that will allow the students to be able to be more interest-oriented rather than having it felt like, \"Oh, I have to learn this.\nIt's a chore.\"\nIt seems increasingly accelerating this trend away from a fixed curriculum and form factored to increasingly personalized.\nThat's definitely going to accelerate.\nIt's really exciting, right?\nLike if you're not necessarily exposed, or you know, have your immigrant parents telling you to do math, you might have an algorithm, etc., to sort of surface that for you, or nudge you in a certain way to topics that you also find yourself self-motivated to learn in that coincide with that.\nAnd based off of all you're talking about, is there a specific area of, when you look at, it could be K-12, it could be university learning, it could be adult learning?\nIs there a specific area where in the next five to six years you expect to see the most impact from the growth of these new consumer technologies like LLMs, etc.?\nIs there an area you're seeing the most impact already on learners?\nI mean, I think it's everywhere.\nIt's just in the water.\nUm, yeah, I mean, the thing that AI or like generative AI does particularly well is it makes content generation very quick and easy and cheaper than it was before.\nLike Pearson used to hire teachers over the summer to do question banks for their tests, you know, and now I'm pretty sure you could, with a couple buttons, generate high-quality question banks for a test and personalize it very easily.\nAnd so you don't need to hire people to do that anymore.\nAnd so I think that means that that frees up people to spend more time on the human element of learning and less time on the administrative, like, \"Oh, I need to create content, then I need to create, then I need to do this assessment, now I need to grade the assessment,\" like all of those sorts of systems that can be automated away and put into the background, probably will be.\nYeah, I mean, I can personally attest to some of that, you know, in some of my most recent books.\nI also write quizzes for some of the section questions, and frankly, I'll write, and they, you know, I write for Pearson, I'll write, they want 10 questions, let's say I'll write three, and I'll give those three to an AI, and I'll also give the relevant content and say, \"Can you suggest seven more?\"\nAnd then, you know, frankly, I will usually have to tweak most of them in some small way just to kind of get it in my style and my voice, or maybe sometimes it's a little bit wrong, and in just like a nuanced way that I didn't want to confuse the student.\nBut for the most part, to your point, that saves me a lot of time.\nIt just saves me the time, and frankly, it focuses my brain on more, \"How do I turn this into a quiz?\nHow do I turn this into an instructor's manual or something like that?\"\nNo, I can focus on the actual content and make the content as high quality as possible.\nAnd as most people who have interacted with an AI know, the higher content quality you put into the system, the higher content quality you get out of the system.\nYou can rephrase that into a more well-known phrase with some expletives, but the concept still stands.\nThe better content you put in, the better content you're going to get out.\nAnd I, and I think again, just literally speaking from experience, that kind of help from a teaching standpoint really does give me more time to keep thinking about the content for my actual students.\nUm, can I flip that question that actually been a little bit more and say, are there areas where people are maybe not necessarily forcing, but attempting to use generative AI LLM in some capacity, and and and maybe the bet didn't pan out as much as they thought it might in terms of learning and education?\nLike is is there a is there a type of technology that people, oh, people thought AI would be great at this for education and learning, but didn't seem to be quite there yet?\nWell, I mean, so much of like AI tooling, if you look at the ones that have taken off, are homework cheaters, you know, like, \"Oh, okay, I want this homework question answered, like, oh, I want that, like, I want to write, have this paper written for me so that I can like submit it and not do the work for it.\"\nI don't really like, I don't think that that's necessarily bad.\nLike I don't have a moral judgment on that because I think that the system or the teacher should find a way to get students to want to do the work or see why they would want to do it anyway.\nHave that real motivation and engagement factor.\nBut I mean, that's that's when it doesn't work in terms of producing outcomes is when it's like helping you just like cheat or, you know, fill in the answers, get through some task that you didn't want to do that you didn't think was important.\nUm, yeah.\nThat, and obviously the whole cheating question is a big one that comes up in learning and education.\nYou know, a lot of people will use the analogy to the calculator to say, \"Well, teachers used to not want calculators in class, and now we have one in our pocket at all times.\"\nSo while that same device also has AI enabled on it.\nSo to your point, I, I, I will also come into that saying the moral judgment is is not as important to me as personally what you said, which is, \"Look, if my students want to cheat at the work I'm giving them, it is in a large part also a failure on me to not be saying, 'Look, you are welcome to go home and look this up, and you know, the coding questions I'm giving you are, I'm not the first person to ask those questions.\nYou don't even need an AI to cheat at this quite frankly.'\nBut a lot of it, you're right, is on me to kind of motivate you to want to actually try to solve this.\"\nAnd I think a lot of that comes down to, not all of it, but a lot of it comes to personalization, where I also see AI, we've talked about this already, where AI being a big help here.\nYou know, I, one of the big questions I always tell, you know, my friends who want to get into teaching is, \"Know your audience, whether they're children or adults.\nWho are you speaking to?\nAre you speaking to people who are really interested in math, computer science?\nAre they, do they want to be there?\nIn what capacity do they want to be there?\nAnd and what are they trying to get out of this?\nWhat's the what's the finish line for your students?\nNot for you, for your students.\"\nAnd the same content can be tailored towards multiple use cases, but it's going to be on you, the teacher, to know what use cases your students actually care about and actually try to personalize it.\nAnd I think AI can be a really big help there.\nUm, have you seen kind of more productized versions of these kinds of educational tools and functions out there, or do you think people can just do that on their own with AI COD and and chat GPT out there as it is?\nDo what the personalization, right?\nLike if I if I if I give a student a coding question, I is it worth giving the advice to the student to say, \"Hey, give that same question to Chad GBT, not to get the answer per se, but to ask the AI, what's the point of this?\"\nLike when when would I use something like this?\nAlmost like using the AI as a TA validator of the homework itself.\nDo you see that as a valid?\nBecause I've I've had students do that to me, quite frankly.\nThey said, \"I asked an AI a question that you gave us as homework, and the AI gave me like 10 different applications of that coding question.\"\nAnd I only cared about two of those.\nSo, like they they literally said to me, \"You should include those in your next iteration of this class.\"\nAnd then I had to say, \"Well, maybe not everyone thinks that, and there's different ways to personalize this.\"\nSo, how do you, what do you think about that interaction?\nI guess I'm curious.\nWell, I always think personal, people have always been obsessed with this idea of personalized learning.\nUm, you know, that was always the dream of the software.\nI've never been totally convinced that that's very important because every person is personalized.\nSo, you can see the way information comes in, just like your student, then they personalized it for themselves and then gave you an answer that was individual to them, right?\nLike the technology doesn't need to be so person, like personalized when the person itself is the, like, you know, why factor or whatever.\nUm, so I don't know.\nI think people over, like, obsess overly obsess about it to be honest.\nLike whether the content is perfectly, like, you're like, \"Okay, if you had some course and was absolutely perfectly, like, hit your interests, like, is it really going to make you way more interested in like computer science?\"\nLike maybe.\nI don't know.\nLike I don't think, I just don't think that's like a mo, a needle mover as much as people like think that it is.\nLike there's other things that are like higher quality that'll that might move the needle, like, like playing games.\nSo like, for example, like I love this game Factorio where you like build a factory and an alien planet in order to like launch a rocket off.\nI think I saw this on Steam actually.\nYeah, it's it's amazing.\nLike, uh, Toby from Shopify loves it.\nLike you can expense Factorio because you're like building all these like supply chains.\nUm, and we have a company called Recess where homeschoolers like work together to play interactively on Factorio.\nAnd like you can imag, like, like there's all these different materials that go into making the rocket, and you build machines in factories and supply chains, and there's different ratios of like inputs to outputs.\nBut like that sort of, like you're in a flow state, like a gamified flow state where you're learning about like, um, you know, how to be to manage production at scale.\nUh, those sorts of things I'm like more excited about.\nAnd I think to the extent that AI can like make it easier for a smaller team to be able to code up and and maintain and uh, you know, generate more excitement for like a gamified world, like that's really exciting.\nI love that.\nOne thing you've kind of touched on is when you talk about the gamification, one example you use was Figma, and then before recording you even said Nooks is a learning product, and which is a which is a total portfolio company in sales AI.\nIt does feel like yeah, the old YouTube or uh forms of software where you'd go in, you'd, it's like a book, you'd pick it up and learn it down, and now there's a lot of more immersive and gamification and the interaction between labor and learning and the AI is all of this um complimentary sort of loop, and so I'd love to hear what you mean by like thinking of like companies like Figma and Nooks as learning companies, um, and then maybe opportunities for software itself uh to kind of to make us all gamified learners.\nYeah.\nWell, I mean, Nooks I thought was just brilliant.\nSo, my sister was a senior director of sales development at a tech startup, and she was using Nooks, and like first me and my husband, uh, like I'd never been an SDR before, and we were on Nooks basically doing a practice.\n\n\nConversation with um a potential outbound client because we wanted to see who would have who would do the best in terms of like, you know, getting that person to schedule a follow-up meeting or whatever.\nAnd uh so yeah, it was like a simulation.\nAnd then the other thing my sister showed me, which I thought was also great pedagogy, is like there's a virtual sales floor, and she could like listen into anyone's conversation on the sales floor, and then after the call ended, like say, \"Hey, great work on that one,\" or \"That was a tough one, and you did a good job this way.\"\nSo like I think that sort of um, you know, when you're a manager of people or a director of sales, like you're you really are like motivating, keeping people's like, you know, motivated and and feeling seen, and those sorts of like human psych, humanto human psych psychology things can be um enabled more by allowing um more visibility into like good work that people are doing.\nUm yeah, so that that was like why why I like thought Nooks was a good learning product, and everyone's like getting smarter while they're using that software.\nIt's enabling that a higher performing organization.\nYeah, it's almost personalized mentorship because you get to see those best practices live and that managerial coaching.\nIt's like a very interesting this we just keep coming back to, you know, personalization and simulation almost of a lot of different things.\nAnd so that's um really sort of interesting.\nOne thing I think that might relate to that's obviously in how you train for your existing craft, right, for whether it's code, whether it's sales, etc.\nAI is also probably going to cause a lot of like potentially reskilling.\nAnd have you seen any good examples of um products that are helping less um, you know, essentially folks to explore completely novel new areas and get up to speed pretty quickly?\nLanguage learning is the most obvious, but are there examples otherwise?\nHow do you think of AI's um impact potentially on uh reskilling uh particularly for uh co-workers that are having to pivot out of careers or change jobs, etc.?\nAre there specific examples that come to mind there of of good examples for reskilling?\nI mean, there's a lot of people entering like the health like right now, healthcare, like frontline healthcare workers is like an area where there aren't enough um workers, and there's a real like lack of clinicians, and um there's a lot of like simulation training companies to upskill people on um like therapy, like uh, you know, mental health, uh speech developments, like autism therapy, like helping people potenti potentially become become clinicians.\nI think the thing is is like the AI enabled training with the avatar is um it's we're in an interesting time because you have companies that are training people to do those jobs, but then you have the companies that are just training the bot to do the job too.\nAnd so they're kind of like both go going at it at the same time.\nUm and it's, you know, it'll be like the actual entity that delivers it.\nuh that delivers the service is going to determine to what extent they configure their labor to be what percent human versus what percent technology to achieve the same outcome.\nAnd so I think that like healthcare is one of the front lines of that right now.\nThat's really interesting.\nYeah.\nThis synergy, right?\nBecause they're trying to get the data and underlying annotation and interactions to train up stuff that'll eventually automate, you know, or like if you're a radiologist, like at the high end, right?\nYou're like, okay, you know, how much more accurate are some of these are these models going to be at showing like whether there's the presence of cancer in in a um in an X-ray or or you know a double like right now I'm sure it's double it's a double check, but you know it might become the predominant way or like robots doing surgeries?\nYeah.\nIs there um anything you know we you you know haven't seen yet that you kind of want to see more innovation particularly around?\nUm it does feel like you know you kind of said that this is water, everyone's sort of realizing, etc.\nIs there particular thing though you want to see more of this kind of broad technology begin to be applied to um as it relates to to uh learning?\nIs there anything you yourself wish uh you know more companies would be simulating or a problem you wish people were going after?\nGosh, that's always like hard to do because it's almost like a counterfactual, you know, it's like the non known, it's the unknown unknown.\nUm yeah, I don't know, like um I think one of the things you see in general is that um people are like so previously before I started Avalanche, I co-founded and ran a um a techn a government technology consulting firm firm uh and we scaled to like 300 people.\nThey're still like, you know, go off in the world doing what they do today.\nUh getting people to upgrade themselves on technology for people who are not technologists is really, really hard.\nLike we I was trying to help some of the people on our team.\nSo I had a I founded a product division within the organization that would do, you know, like basically we're doing data accountability and implementations, and it was just like almost impossible to get consultants to like upgrade themselves on the use of technology and tools.\nIt's like hard to get an old dog to learn new new tricks.\nAnd I was just trying to move people from like Google spreadsheets to like Air Table because I was like Air Table's a way more powerful tool for us to use and it can be more like internet facing and people can interact with it.\nBut if people are not are not have not seen it before and they're not in the water, and then it's very scary, and they create antibodies very fast.\nAnd so I think that's actually like one of the biggest um like impediments to AI being transformational in the workforce um is is that fear and like people's like digging in their heels and not wanting to learn and um and uh yeah, and then also like people just don't really know, like I mean, I talked to people with kids that are coming out of college, and everyone's like, so like what jobs are they going to have?\nAnd I was like, I don't know.\nLike, nobody knows.\nNo one knows.\nYeah.\nIt doesn't help that AI itself is one of the new technologies.\nSo, you're kind of asking, \"Hey, can you learn this new technology from this even newer technology?\"\nAnd I think that that kind of compounds itself.\nAnd I think that's really that's so true.\nIt's just it's just kind of I mean, maybe not the fear is the wrong word.\nIt's just that it's that inherentness to say, \"Well, I already know how to do this.\nWhy are we doing I mean it's like all my friends who have kids now, and it's like that's not how I learned how to do multiplication.\"\nIt was a small example, but it's it's that kind of like, \"Oh, we've moved on, apparently, and I guess no one told me.\"\nAnd I and and and I think a lot of it comes back to why are you here?\nWhy are you learning this?\nIs someone forcing you to learn this, or were you curious enough to be here?\nAnd I think a lot of that comes down to what you said it perfectly, that that psychological component uh as to what why do I have to learn this?\nWhere who am I learning this from?\nAnd what if I just don't get it?\nLike what happens after that?\nAnd I think you know, and AI can't really solve all those problems, and frankly, humans can't really solve all those problems to a degree.\nAnd I think I think you summed it up really, really, really great there.\nThanks.\nI think it's interesting the just this conversation, the arc of it is that the form factors have become even more powerful, there's more and more tools available um for personalized learning to accelerate your track, but the core understanding and problem of motivation is still there, right, of um when it extends beyond the kind of context window or screen, um that's an evergreen problem, right?\nIt feels does feel of as if once you are motivated to learn uh it's not just, you know, Salman Khan or Khan Academy or a particular curriculum or you know, influencer or YouTube, it's this actual simulation and nudges, etc., that really accelerate you, but that cold start problem is almost sort of um an evergreen societal problem in education.\nHow do we raise um like San said, you know, if there's a bunch of new AI technologies have a lot of uncertainty, I think even Sam Elman said this in in an interview, right, like what do you want to raise, you want to kind of encourage traits of curiosity um in particular um versus maybe you know, a specific uh you know, skill or craft.\nSo um I really uh think that's uh you know uh an interesting sort of thing, and I'm not sure if anyone's working on the motivation aspect, etc., stuff like that, but it feels like the more things change, certain things stay the same.\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean, I think that there's like certainly there's like a barbell of will people be doing more analog things to purely analog, right?\nLike sports and um like caretaking of young children and um just like spending potentially more time in like live experiences with family that that really like human elements, you know, and like people shouldn't like run away from from it.\nLike I I feel like we're kind of in that like shitty transition time between like the old world and the new world, and that's why we have that like loneliness spike.\nLike I don't know if you've seen all that data, but it's like people are spending more time alone ever before, and like the answer is not like, \"Okay, now you get an AI friend.\"\nIt's like, I hope not, please, that can't be the answer.\nNo.\nYeah.\nThat's not the the future that we all want, you know.\nI think people want time like like inerson time with their friends and their kids and their families and um and you know, technology should be an enabler of that.\nAwesome.\nWell, thanks so much, Katelyn, for taking the time.\nUh really appreciate it and uh this was fun.\nThanks so much.\nYeah, thanks for having me.\n[Music]\n",
