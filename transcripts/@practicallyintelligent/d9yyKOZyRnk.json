Do you want to tell our audience a little bit more about our guest today? A, for sure. Yeah, I'm excited. Mike is an old friend who has been in the UX Design profession for 20-plus years. He was formerly a design lead at Meta, Twitch, Survey Monkey, and then co-founded and sold multiple companies, the latest of which sold to Brex. Mike is both a generalist and a specialist. He's incredibly honed his craft and has some thoughts on where AI is taking the profession of UX Design and how his own craft is changing. So, let's dive right in. Let's do it. Welcome, Mike. Thanks so much for being on the show with us today. We're going to get into all those posters behind you because I'm very curious, and in fact, I think one of them is going to have to do with our first question for you. I just want to get a level set for our audience to tell us a little bit about how you got into the profession of UX Design and really what was it like when you got into the field.\nYeah. So this poster back here is Age of Empires, especially, you know, just the Age of Kings, Age of Empires 2. I got into it. I just discovered website design and development because I had a clan back in the day, and the clan needed a website. So I learned how to build websites, how to design them. And then, you know, it was kind of like a snowball effect. You know, I learned HTML, learned CSS. By the way, I started on Front Page 98 if anyone remembers that. And then that snowballed into learning Photoshop and then a little bit of Flash music, etc. And then eventually, you know, I built this clan website, and I had a lot of other gamers on Age of Empires, you know, other clans ask me if I can build their website. And so I was like, yeah. So, I've got this long list of like 20 or so clans that I'm building free websites for. And eventually someone said, \"Hey, can you build my, you know, my clan website?\" And I finally had to start turning them away. I was like, you know, I've got this long list. I just can't, I can't anymore. And then this guy, he was like, \"Well, what if I paid you money? Can you put me at the front of the list?\" And that was my big aha moment. You know, I was middle school, probably like, you know, 13 years old. It's like, yeah, sure. Like, yeah, you can. Yeah, of course. I'll put you first on the list. I'll start yours tomorrow. So, that was like my first hundred bucks into this industry. I realized, you know, wow, I can make money doing this. And that kind of fueled my own learning and just continuing to learn and get better at this and then get better at the craft. Now for my own career, you know, that's kind of the beginnings of just my passion for my career. You know, I, going from being able to build websites, design them, and just kind of a designer and a builder, I was, you know, had a great skill set to start my own companies, build, you know, I build my ideas in a way. So I would have ideas, I'd have an app idea, I'd go ahead and just build it and ship it and launch it. And so that's where I started to kind of get into my early career was building my own startups, kind of learning the business side of things as well. So you kind of, you know, talking about like that trifecta of like business, you know, PMs, design, and engineering, kind of was just honing that skill set, you know, on my own, you know, building my own startups, joining startups, and eventually that kind of just ducttailed into, you know, bigger, you know, eventually got me out to Silicon Valley and things like that, larger companies. Yeah. No, amazing. And I think, and again, for everyone listening, we're talking about Age of Empires 2, released in what was it, 1998, 1999. So we're talking decades of UX experience. And I think one of, you know, no surprises here, one of the obvious major milestones in the last decade has been the user experience and user interface around, let's say, both AI chatbots, call it Claude, call it ChatGPT, and just in general, AI-powered applications. So, thinking about how you got into building clan websites for Age of Empires, and learning how to code, and learning the business side of things, and basically having to bootstrap all of this yourself, now that we are in this new era of how companies are thinking about implementing AI into existing workflows or frankly building new companies from the ground up with AI in mind, how has, and in, and there's probably many, but how, in a few major ways, has the kind of ideation and thought process around building a user experience around AI applications changed or really just kind of come out of the ground?\nYeah. So whenever I first got started, you know, I'd say around 2005 was when I really started to take, you know, the profession of what we're doing here, you know, web design, UI design, UX design, product design, right? Seriously. And that was an era of, I feel like, this industry where you weren't specialized just yet. You were like a UI designer, kind of meant you were a UI designer, you were a UX designer, you were a mobile designer, you were a web designer, you're everything. And you probably also did a lot of coding, at least some dabbling in HTML and CSS front-end code as well. So there, I wouldn't say like you're kind of a generalist in a way, but it was more of kind of, it bred from, in that era, a lot of people came from, it was a hobby turned, you know, career. And then as we started to shift towards, you know, a maturity in our industry where we started to specialize, you know, became a product designer, a product designer did a very specific thing, such as product design. There was a UX designer who didn't, you know, I don't want to get in the debate of what is a UX designer, but you know, they designed UX, you know, we won't get into what that means, right? And the UI designer was, there's visual designers, there's just all these specializations. And now with the emergence of AI, you know, not to just like go straight into the bullpen here, but it's, you know, you could almost say that we could see a world where the skill set of what we do starts to become moving towards more towards what we would call a generalist. What a generalist is, you know, it's back in the day, it was a master of, uh, what's this? What's the saying? Uh, jack of all trades of like, you know, it's a t-shirt. Master of none. Yeah. The master of none, but like back in the day, it was, you know, you're great at a lot of things, but maybe you're not like a master in everything. Well, nowadays, it's you started to master in one thing through the 10, you know, the 2010s, but now I think the emergence of AI allows you to go back to that T-shaped, um, you know, the not necessarily master of none. You can use AI to kind of help be that crutch to help master. So you can be a little bit more of a generalist where you're doing product, but you know, with a crutch, with, you know, with the support of an AI agent doing design, with a little bit of support from an AI agent, etc. Yeah. Is that an acceleration of trend, maybe? I think, you know, you saw that specialization, and then, you know, Figma and Sketch, and there was that whole maybe launch of products maybe right before the middle of the prior decade. And I felt like the, can you, can you give an, maybe as a, you know, and I'm sure, uh, you know, our UX designers will remember this, but maybe the PMs and engineers in our audience, what was it like, what was the tactile experience like to first experience those products, and how did that change how you approached your craft?\nYeah, I remember the first time that I experienced like Sketch, for instance, because I was, you know, Photoshop was what you did, right? But Sketch was it just so simple, you know, it got all, you know, it wasn't a graphics tool. It wasn't an image editing tool. It was just a UI interface tool, which means there was only like, you know, 5% of the amount of features that Photoshop had. And so I just remember thinking of like, wow, like this is really what I'm going to be designing my, you know, my UI in. This is what everyone's like latching on to. And after a while, it became just a really magical experience of like, yeah, I don't need all that other image editing stuff, but also as a builder, the emergence of CSS3 and gradients and browser technologies and standardization around browser tech meant that like, you didn't need Photoshop to build like fancy gradients and a lot of the things that a lot of the design aesthetic that was a trend during that kind of era as well. So that kind of helped a lot in terms of just not needing that crutch on image editing and really you just needed image editing for legit photos, you know, and graphic design. But at the same time, you know, Figma eventually came around, and Figma, you know, it, you'd already been introduced to Sketch and kind of the simplification around the UI and the feature set, just needing like UI, what tools do you need to draw UI? It was that collaboration piece around Figma that really just, you know, was eye-opening in terms of, you know, just being able to share a single link to anyone, you know, any of your colleagues and say, \"Hey, check this link out,\" rather than having to like publish it to, at the time, Sketch had a plugin that published to Envision, you know, and you had to like manage, like, well, was that the most up-to-date version of what I published? I don't know. I don't remember. Where else have I taken a screenshot and posted it somewhere that I need to like update in a PRD or, you know, an engineering doc, handoff doc? But now with just Figma, you just post a single link. It's a live, living, breathing link that made it just so much easier to collaborate on that front. Not to mention their, you know, the multiplayer tools they have too.\nYeah, I think it's interesting because the VCs, I know you like read the analyses of why they missed Figma, etc., and it's that um, it created its own market, right? The collaboration. I bet, I remember even thinking through when Sketch came out. Um, I think the general talk track I remember was like, \"Oh, this kind of kills UX design. It automates a bunch of the work.\" And it turns out the market was, you know, 50 times bigger than anyone realized because of things like Fig Jam, the collaborative nature, web assembly that's powering a lot of real-time specking and collaboration over design. And so, um, did you at the time, I just, you currently remember the sentiment among, you know, professionals like yourself, you probably didn't think it would completely transform the way your job as it had, or, uh, like when you look back, like talk track what it was then versus now, uh, give us a little bit of that, uh, that gradient. Yeah, I was the one, probably, I feel like I was the one designer that slept on Figma for, you know, at least a couple of years because I was just kind of like, okay, a new tool. What's wrong with Sketch? I'm fine with Sketch, you know. And by the way, one of my best friends, you know, he was on Photoshop still at the time, right? And so we're kind of just like, while we like to say that we're early adopters, it was just one of those trends where we're just like, well, we've been through this, you know, new tool, you know, fatigue quite a bit in our career. So it was kind of like, well, what is this? It's just a UI tool. What's the big deal? And so, yeah, I didn't really think that it was going to be, I didn't think it was going to put like, say Sketch, for instance, quote unquote, out of business in a way, right? I never saw that coming. So, and I mean, to that point of building a new market, I, as an engineer, not a designer, not a UX designer in any way, shape, or form, I use Figma to make all the, for example, all the figures in my books, I make myself in Figma. It took me a learning curve, but I figured it out. So, the whole idea of kind of building your own market is, yeah, they didn't realize it was big because I want to come back to something you said, Mike. I am someone who is neither a generalist nor a specialist in design. But software like Figma, not necessarily automates that, but at least gives me an interface to build something that is not going to be as good as if I hired a professional to do it, but something I definitely could not have done myself. And I think that's actually a really great analogy to how we think about the application of AI in a lot of these softwares. So coming back to your idea in the bullpen, and here at Practically Intelligent, we like to live in the bullpen. Uh, the idea that we may no longer need specialists because, you know, we'll all be generalists and the AI will kind of fill in those gaps for us. I, I won't lie to you. I've kind of heard both ways on this on this argument, which is to say, you're, or at least the side that you just mentioned is, if I'm a generalist, and let's even, let's even call it engineering. If I'm a generalist in engineering, right? I understand basic front end, basic back end, basic ML, let's say I could use a tool like Claude to say, look, generally, I know what I want, the front end talks to the back end, the back end has, you know, asynchronous jobs, workers, and it all needs to fit together. I think Kubernetes will work, but you tell me, like, I'm pointing the AI in the right direction, and the AI can be the specialist to pick up that slack and say, oh, sure, let's, let's implement whatever rabbit or reddus as your as your cue, and I, sure, that's great. I'm going to copy and paste, try it, fail, iterate. That makes sense. I've heard the flip side as well, which is to\n\n\nSay we still need human specialists because AI is still in its generalist phase. It itself cannot be a true specialist in a lot of areas. So, you need a specialist to fill in those gaps. And I think both are right to a certain degree in certain domains, in certain industries. But to come back to your side, quote unquote, of that, which is to say in a lot of UX capabilities or capacities, the generalists will be able to do more with AI tools, you know, call it AI and Figma or AI just in general. How does that impact, I mean, just the field in general? Like, how is that impacting current UX designers who you would label as a specialist? Like, what will, what might their lives look like in the next couple of years if that trend continues where the generalists will take over and the AI will fill in that gap?\n\nYeah, I could, I totally see both sides of it as well. Sure. And I don't think there's a right or wrong. I think it really depends on how you do end up using, you know, AI to, you know, be, you know, supercharge yourself. I come at it from the generalist perspective because I think of, you know, as AI, we adopt more of AI in our workflows. I see us as, you know, creators moving more towards a more strategic role, and that's where the generalist kind of take comes from, where we're able to be more like art directors in a way, or just direct, you know, the very different kind of specialists, you know, have multiple specialists, you know, of course, this is when, like you said, AI can become a specialist in some regard. I don't think we're there yet, but um, when we are there, um, you, I can kind of sit above, and I can be that big umbrella, um, kind of bird's eye view, kind of directing, kind of orchestrating all of these agents, uh, towards a north star that a generalist might be the only type of skill set that could see that, where that north star is. Whereas a specialist, I'm not, I'm not trying to throw shade at specialists, but you know, in general, um, you know, a specialist might not be able to see the north star. I'm, I'm talking about building businesses here, too, right? I'm not just saying like, hey, a programmer or an engineer or a PM just doing kind of like one thing and and and not being able to see the northstar in their own specialization. I'm thinking like, let's talk about PMs here. PMs, in a way, a lot of them that I've met, they're generalists in design, or they're, or they're um, you know, they're design curious, or they're engineering curious, and but they, they just really can't implement those ideas. They can't, they need AI to to implement or or to be that specialization. So you can imagine a world where PMs now, they are empowered, and they can, they can do more uh, with with a smaller team, or they can be more of that northstar director.\n\nYeah. And and I think that really is that, that that really matches a lot of my perspective as well. Even, even again, when it comes to engineering, this idea that I would just need to show you the north star. I mean, if you think about even at a really low level of LLMs and like reinforcement learning, you're kind of nudging the AI and saying that was good, that was bad, and and you know where you're trying to go. You just kind of keep putting it in the lines and saying, \"No, no, no, hold on. You're going too far to the left. Go, go this way a little bit.\" And and with my analogy with Figma, again, my northstar is I can see a figure in my book in my head. And up till now, I had to either make a bad one and hope a graphics department for my publisher can pick up the slack that I never met before, or I pay someone professionally to do it for me. But now, because I know the north star and I am comfortable learning a new tool, call it Figma, call it AI, I can now nudge, nudge, nudge until I get something that I am happy with. So I think, I think that analogy works, and I and I again, I think in a lot of cases, in more and more cases, that is going to be how people interact with, call it agents, call it AI, just I see where we're trying to go, and I'm willing to iterate on this tool until we get closer and closer to my direction.\n\nIt's interesting you use this generalist specialist thing because um, you know, what I found even with engineers that observe using cursor, right, there's almost a bifurcation, right? There's, you know, you know, super skilled senior engineers who are able to prompt it efficiently, and then, you know, this obvious democratization, like San just talked about, but it still feels like you have both coexisting, like you said, Mike, generalist winning and democratization of technology to create, you know, cool front ends and UX, you prompt um, and cool designs, obviously with Midjourney, but then also um, you can get a lot of out of it, and a lot of it's a lot of horsepower if you're able to use a specialist. And so you're kind of both, right? Like, you know, you've led entire design teams, you've been a founder, which is a generalist role. You've also are incredibly specialized on your craft. Uh, and so I'm kind of curious, like, day-to-day, what has changed most in your workflow in the last two years? Um, and can you walk us through, like, what are the two or three things when you, you know, boot up your laptop and you examine your day, what are the, you know, how does your day look differently? What tools are you spending more time in? What have, how has your craft changed and your workflows changed in the last two to three years?\n\nYeah. Um, I, I use AI in my role. I've noticed I use it as like a design buddy in a way, where um, you know, if I'm kind of stuck on a design problem, I really can't crack it. Instead of going to like a UI prompt that like goes and designs it for me, I, I just go to say ChatGPT, and I start to explain and kind of write a little bit of um, a narrative around what I'm trying to accomplish, what the user goals are, etc., etc., and then ask it like, what might be, you know, some general directions I could take it. And then, you know, it spits out only text, but I can start to kind of educate and kind of expand my problem space, my problem thinking a little bit, a little bit outside of what I might not have been exploring myself. And that's really helped me a lot in just in exploring and innovating and just trying to, you know, problem solve. Um, now another one, you know, is that's me being a specialist, needing help being a specialist myself, right? The the whole design craft. Now, there's the kind of UX copywriting, which I utilize a lot with like with AI and LLMs of um, you know, I just don't know the right, you know, I know what I'm trying to say, because you know, like what you were saying, but I just don't know how to say it. Help, you know, and I just use it as a a little writing buddy to, hey, just give me some ideas of where I could take this and help me, help me make it more approachable when, and I use the word like write it, you know, use UX copy is a term I use a lot, like, hey, um, so and that usually nudges them in a really, it them in a really good direction.\n\nI mean, I, I, I can even echo that, like, I, I, I especially for creative tasks, like I'm, I'm writing something, often what I'll do is I'll, I'll, if I'm getting a writer's block or something, I'll, I'll tell the AI, hey, I think this is where, again, northstar, this is where I'm trying to go, this is what I have, what are some like branches that you can think of, like, how would, or how would you rephrase this? And I usually don't end up copy-pasting or using it, but I, I will read it and say, oh, interesting, that's an interesting take. I think I can now iterate on that in my head and and and take it back to where I was going. Um, I, I'd love to talk more about kind of the the the interfaces, so to speak, that you that you were talking about. Um, and I think what kinds of interfaces does an AI like, and again, let's call it ChatGPT for now, uh, what kind of interfaces does that open up, and like, how do we, how can someone think about the learning curve for using that kind of an interfaces, and and frankly, I'd be more curious to learn your learning curve for using interface like that, and and how you think that influences other people's learning curves.\n\nYeah. So, I, this, it's designing and thinking about what the future of AI UI is, um, has not, it's, it's a pretty tough problem, and you're kind of trying to guess the future. But the great thing about design and UX is that people are our brains and our behaviors and our psychology has not changed for, you know, 200,000, however, you know, far back you want to go in the human race and civilization. We're still like the same brain that like, say Egyptians. We have the same brain Egyptians had, you know. So that's the great thing. We don't change. We kind of behavior does not change. So we can kind of design and model what the future of UI might be based on how, you know, how we as a civilization, you know, use and think. Now, with that said, though, you still got to model it on new technology, um, because that is what changes. But you can, uh, you're kind of thinking about um, like, you know, the the idea of chat, you know, the chat, just not just ChatGPT, just the the form, the the form factor of chat, um, I think in right now, it's, it's really, you know, because chat, you know, AI is not just yet, it's not very mature, like you're saying, it, it works for like every single use case, you can throw anything at it, uh, and you can just use words. It's the dictionary. However, now we start to get into like, that's not UI, you know, that's just, to me, that's just a form factor. But when we start to get into like, um, okay, well, what about UI and AI, AIUI? Well, where I'm in my day job right now, I think a lot about that in terms of we're building AI software for the recruiting industry. And so with the emergence of agents and operators, you know, we're really thinking a lot about what does that future UI look like? And I'm really starting to come to this realization that that future UI, it might not be, and this is all speculation, by the way, it might not be a single, like, well, what is the AI of UI? I'm sorry, I'm getting my word. What's the UI of AI? That's a um, and like, you know, in terms of like, what's the next evolution of chat? Like, I don't think that's the kind of conversation I'm having in my head. The one I'm asking myself is more of like niche. So, like, for instance, you use traveling and booking travel earlier. Um, it's really kind of seems very archaic to start to just prompt it with a lot of like writing sentences. It's like, I don't want to write, and you know, kind of the whole, like, early on Google, you know, the biggest complaint with Google and the search input was, what do I put in the search box? I don't know what to type, right? And so we're kind of in that same world where you start to ask people, what do I, what do I type in this? How do I prompt? You know, and you have to get really good at it. So with that said, it's more of like, I see a world potentially where the AI um, kind of it kind of steps back and goes into the background, and we have UI to help, help people do the prompting. So maybe in the background, we're still doing, you know, connecting to the ChatGPT in a lot of ways.\n\nYeah. In a lot of ways, it's almost like we were given the engine to a car before the actual car was made. And it was like, this engine's awesome. You know, as long as you know how to use it and build around it, it's, it's amazing. But until more people kind of figure out how to build that car around the engine, then it's going to be like, \"Oh, okay. Just get in the car and hit go. The engine will do the rest for you. Don't worry about it.\" I think that that that kind of um, access to the raw workload processing of an LLM, because ChatGPT, like, is very nenty in in in a couple years ago, really simply was you're talking to an LLM. You don't know what that is, and I'm sorry to say that, but this is it. This is what it looks like to talk to an LLM. And they had OpenAI had barely figured, no offense to them, they had barely figured out how to turn their engine into a car, right? You know, they, they, they engine, call it GPT3, had the knowledge. It just didn't really quite know how to have a conversation until ChatGPT came out two years later. And then people were like, \"Oh, I get it.\" And with light prompting, you can get it to work pretty well. With heavy prompting, you could get it to work, I mean, I would say really well, even when ChatGPT came out. And I think as the AI gets, you know, this is a common kind of motto is prompt engineering is a bug, right? And as AIs get better, you won't need to prompt engineer as much. I kind of agree with that. I mean, it's true to a sense, you know, you're not going to need to know, you know, 10shot learning is going to be the best way to build, build your prompts if reasoning models can keep up. But at the same time, that tabular rosa, that blank slate problem, and having built chatbots for over a decade, I can also tell you that even when we put out a chatbot in 2015, the number of times people, because we measured this, would come to the chat, stare basically, and then leave without typing anything was greater than the number of times people actually ask the AI a question, because they didn't, you're right, they didn't know what to say. They're like, \"Do I, am I basically googling something, or do I talk to you like you're kind of a person, or is, is it a hybrid?\" Like, \"What am I supposed to say to this thing to make me, to make it do what I want?\" Uh, and that's still a problem. That blank slate problem is still an issue. And not just AI, really in any UX issue, I assume, but yeah, but even more so when it's a blank input field.\n\nYeah, I think the search analogy is really interesting, Mike, because it feels like, yeah, with web 2.0 knowledge aggregation, you know, was um, kind of a key archetype.\n\n\nAnd so I remember when you would see like Airbnb or like preliminary like, you know, apps that were well-designed, it was this sifting of information. Obviously, you know, there was like beveled buttons and it was like the color scheme was slick, but it was also this kind of formula like we're sifting through information and it seems like, you know, your prompts might be it's not knowledge aggregation, but knowledge orchestration in this kind of new area, but does is there like an example of an existing app or you know, experience or software you've consumed that, you know, you gave the travel example, um, that's like kind of agentic or forward-thinking that you thought really incorporated some of this?\n\nWell, like I'm sure you have your sources of inspiration or etc. Are there examples of things that we kind of you think are like that's kind of I think the future? Um, like I remember the first time I had a like a linked desktop and mobile experience and it was like game-changing, like, \"Oh my god, there's like, you know, persistence and it like remembers things,\" and it's, you know, part of that was like an identity thing, but it was so seamless. But is there anything you want to give a shout-out to that kind of pretends to the future that you've seen and are really thinking about?\n\nUm, I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but I give an example. Let's go back to the travel, um, example, the travel booking example. You know, if you're traveling to, you know, Las Vegas, for instance, you know, you punch in a couple of, you know, what's your dates, what and then what my what my location, Las Vegas, and they do a pretty good job. And this is not AI, I'm just using as an example. They've got they do a pretty good job of ranking and ordering, you know, what most people, um, where the most people would want to stay, right? And then from there, you can it's not prompting, but I you filter. Filtering is kind of like prompting. You say actually sort by the most expensive because I'm gonna go baller in Las Vegas or the most the cheapest because I'm I'm gonna spend all my money on gambling, right? So there's there's you can kind of those are preferences and it's somewhat of a prompt and so you can kind of imagine, well, how does AI improve that filtering experience? Um, and does it make it better? Uh, I don't have the answers. That's just kind of where my brain goes when I think about, you know, what is that niche usage of AI?\n\nWell, whether it's niche or or or general, I think one of the the kind of this core static concepts we have to to continue to deal with is the fact that this is still going to be a multi-person operation. Even with AI agents in the mix, right? We will for the time being, we will still need our product managers, our engineers, our our designers at all levels. Um, they're they're working together today. They're going to keep working together in the future. I I I know your favorite thing to do is to make predictions about the future of AI. Uh, Mike, and I'm going to ask you to kind of do it again because I think as we as you have seen the evolution of collaboration between let's say product engineering and design, we've you know, we talk about Figma, we talk about AI agents at at work. Can you see tangible differences today on on how these teams are working differently together and and and does that pretend something in the future? You know, if this trend continues, it might look like this. Is that is that noticeable to you in your day-to-day?\n\nUm, what's the biggest notice thing I notice in my day-to-day working with mostly colleagues is communication is a lot better. Um, let me rephrase that. Maybe not communication, but the way we articulate things is a lot better. Um, so it's more like our Slack. I mean, this is kind of a copout excuse, but it's the way that we, you know, everything gets so well articulated now in Slack. Um, but at the same time, it gets it's extremely verbose. And so you can kind of tell when people are you're just like, \"Hey, you just you just copy pasted like this ChatGPT vomit at me and now I'm going to have to go copy and paste it back and say, please remove all instances of delve and also make this shorter.\" Yes. And so, um, that's kind of like the the world that I've been living in I feel like in the past like say, you know, three, four months.\n\nUm, yeah. Well, let's take that to a logical conclusion because I I have I think all three of us and everyone listening has at least been at one point uh the victim of you definitely just ChatGPT this and copied it to me, didn't you? Which sometimes is fine. It's like, \"Look, I didn't know and you asked me, so this is what I got for you.\" But at the same time, I think a lot of a lot of that comes down to, well, what if that becomes, you know, not to be the the teacher from the late 1990s here, but what if the calculator becomes everyone's crutch and no one really wants to think about arithmetic anymore. What if ChatGPT does become that communication facilitator that sure makes it easier on the person communicating, but to your point, yeah, there's a lot more information here. There's a lot more richness here, but it's it's maybe not the most efficient way to pro to perform that communication. Um, if that trend continues, if we start relying on AI more for call it knowledge transfer, communication, Slack being kind of our knowledge base for things that are going on, is that I can see a world where it is a just more fodder for AIs of the future to read from and do rag and agents to look at and say, \"Oh, the AI said a year ago this, so now I can use that as information.\" That's good. But on the other side, it just becomes, okay, well, if I'm just going to go to AI and copy and paste this and send it to another human, is this now a a task that I should try to get away from the human so that the human can go do something? Is that is basically a signal from the human saying, \"I don't want to do this, so I'm making the AI do it for me. Um, I would rather be working on something else.\" Both can be true. Neither could be true. Frankly, at the end of the day, it's just something to be aware of. The question is for you, the question is, is this do you see a signal where people are using AI to automate something and it's maybe almost a cry for help to say, \"I'd rather not be doing this. I'd rather be doing B over here,\" and that's why I've been giving the AI the task A to perform from the design standpoint, I guess.\n\nYeah. Yes. Um, it I could totally see that. Um, and I see, you know, the whole like, you know, I just kind of copied and pasting this, you know, this ChatGPT vomit. I'm going to call it vomit at you. There's this level, you know, that it's the human touch and the human the human to human communication or touch, whatever you want to call it, um, that will probably one of the last things that we ever automate and and and hand over to AI and that comes with like the the it's taste, you know, it's the taste, for instance, in this current world, you know, one of the biggest things that I notice and I can tell when someone has copied and pasted something to me is one, it's the veracity of it, two, the bullet points that um you copy and pasted, they're not the real bullet points, the rich bullet points, you know, they're the space space space HTML disc. You mean you don't talk normally in in markdown to your friends?\n\nYeah, exactly. And so, um, and and it's just that level of kind of like taste and knowing, you know, what does the person that I'm communicating with, what do they like, what is what do they need? What do they what's their style? And that the being able to adapt from situation to situation, I don't think is something that AI is going to be able to do very, you know, in in a short term.\n\nLet me give you an example. About 10, 15 years ago, I was working at a startup and it had hired, you know, he liked to hire MBAs. Now, no, not throwing shade at MBAs, but um it was he was a new grad and he handed me like this five-page paper on like something and I was just like I was really blunt. I'm like, \"I don't really want to read this five-page paper. Can you just like summarize it in two, like it just just give me like two sentences?\" The thing, the topic we're talking about right now and the question I asked you can be answered in two, two, two sentences. And so that was kind of like my first like looking back at what I'm dealing with right now versus back then. That was a great example of what still kind of happened in whenever GPT wasn't around. It's just happening a lot more. But I think to summarize it, what I'm trying to say is it goes back to the generalist aspect of generalists typically have more taste in some way than say a specialist. I don't you know, that's me being a very you know, uh I'm stereotyping or whatever. Um, but in my in my world that's typically a safe thing to say and when that comes you know taste is something that we will always need to have some level of layer and that goes back to the north star. The having knowing that taste in terms of are what I'm being given from AI is this moving us closer to that north star, right or not? Is it is it what a human will want to um digest and consume? Yes or no?\n\nSo maybe kind of on your point on communication, um, and kind of going back to your point on Figma, right? Um, kind of it changed you, the words you used to describe Figma were collaboration. Right. The words you describe were Photoshop design and so it's just interesting that trend of now you're using communication as that kind of thing. I'm sure the flavor of that is different though now, right? Because you have more people basically converging on generalist. So what are you kind of seeing um there?\n\nThere's obviously like San mentioned, you know, everyone's just throwing prompts and etc. back at each other, but we're able to create massively more kind of customized software much faster, right? With a design buddy, we're able to be a little bit more generalist. Um, have you noticed in any changes in kind of um ways you communicate, ways you document or you know the types of uh you just the the the the pace and and texture of your development life cycle with your teammates as someone who's you know been a seasoned practitioner?\n\nYeah.\nUm, my scope, like when I bullet, I can what I enjoy the most right now is I can bullet point kind of a scope and like a PRD kind of a product document and then expand that out into a lot like something that's a lot more articulate for my co-workers and then at that same time though, it's like consider that a draft and then edit it after the fact so you kind of apply that whole layer of taste and also did it actually expand on what I wanted it needed it to expand on. Uh, going back to like Figma though and the whole idea around collaboration, um, a world, you know, I think that prompting for instance, you know, it's you think of like, \"Hey, you know, AI, you know, the first the first form factor that Figma launched with AI was a prompt, 'Hey, design this for me,' right?\" But you know, say give it 10 years from now, I don't know how long it's going to take, but uh, I would love it for that little cursor that follows me when I'm pair designing with someone. So, something I do right now, let me back up, is on my team, let's say I'm designing something, I will shoot a Slack to um one of, you know, a design a team member that I know is like kind of specialized or has this like, you know, skill set in a certain type of problem I'm trying to solve. I slack them and say, \"Hey, here's this Figma link. Do you have five minutes to just like pair with me real quick? Just like shoot the explore some, you know, some c different avenues that I might not be thinking of.\" Here or she comes into into Figma. I see their cursor kind of fly around and we're talking. They see my cursor flying around. We're kind of communicating. I'm moving stuff around the screen. They're moving stuff around the screen. They're doing their own. They're, \"Hey, what about this? Hey, what do you think about this direction?\" I go, \"Oh, I love that. What?\" Then I go over to my little area. And I'm like, \"Hey, well, what about this direction?\" and we kind of meet in the middle. We're kind of bouncing ideas off each other. Right now, imagine if that cursor was AI and not um not a a human a human being because what what's the kind of difference, you know, in terms of like, you know, I think AI could eventually kind of kind of take on that form factor in terms of when it comes to designing.\n\nYeah, I think it's super important and outside of, you know, the Rick Rubin meme, everyone just gets known for taste, the intentionality and I think communication is a good word. Um, I think collaboration is kind of a great word for Figma, right? Because I, you know, just the the feel of if you're a PM, you know, working with a designer, there's cycles and you're you're waiting on feedback. Um, and there's a whole life cycle. I think when you're inviting that buddy in, it is really live. like iterating over PRD is live. And um it kind of relates to my next question is if you were advising um you know someone like you who is you know in their mid to late 20s who had just got into the field with so much kind of technological disruption. What skills are most highly leveraged for the next decade uh in in in UX? Um and how would you approach learning your craft differently? Um I feel like in every field no matter what your curriculum of how I learn from you both even is completely different than what you would do now. So what skills are most leveraged and how do you approach um how would you approach your craft differently?\n\nUm, you know, the advice I would give is around, you know, really learn, I hate to I hate to I hate to keep going back to this, but it's, you know, learn your taste. Learn really what, you know, the human, you know, what's um, pleasing to whatever human being that you are communicating with or delivering a tangible to, etc. really\n\n\nLearn that, you know, learn the human side of things.\nUm, because that that's not going to, that's going to be the number one thing that does not change for the next, you know, throughout your career.\nUm, and then you can apply that to whatever technology looks like in the future.\nUm, now though, I will say that the answer to this question is different than say eight years ago.\nEight years ago, I would have said, \"Oh, well, it's 2025 now.\"\nBut 10 years ago, I would have said, \"Hey, just get really good at just UX.\"\nLike, you don't need to, you don't need to be good at UI design and and visual design.\nWe got design systems and and there's, you know, we you to kind of help help you do that.\nJust really get good at UX.\nBut that's still kind of along the same lines as like you're learning how people want to use interfaces, you know, how do people, what motivates people?\nIt's the northstar, right?\nYeah.\nAnd then, um, but I'd say what impacts my answer the most is not really the current state of technology.\nIt's kind of the current state of the industry and kind of what we've been through from a postcoid post, you know, where we're kind of like the trajectory of our industry right now, which which is people are we're starting to move more towards generalist type of, you know, hires where, um, you know, being, you know, being just a UX designer now is not as, it's not good enough in a lot of, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, you really need to like to to differentiate yourself from the other the rest of the industry, you really need to step into being really good at UI design or kind of expand yourself outside of that simple circle of just a specialist.\nYou need to have at least one or two more, you know, specialties that you can, um, you know, expand your circle uh or your skill set.\nBut as technology does uh and AI does get more involved, you can lean on them for those other circles that you aren't quite yet uh began to like um dip your toe in.\nRight.\nSo yeah, I mean we've talked about a lot today.\nI, the it feels like the northstar of our conversation is exactly that is part of what makes AI so usable and at the same time frustrating is that humans still have you know the the the concept of this is the goal.\nThis is the northstar.\nThis is this is the finish line.\nAnd with that information, with that context, an AI is going to be able to pick up slack here and there, whether it's acting more as a generalist, a specialist, in a lot of ways, who cares?\nBecause if our job is to accomplish a task, meet that goal, cross that finish line, if if the AI is moving the cursor versus a human is building me the Figma design, at the end of the day, quality is going to matter, but it's also going to come down to validation of do people want this?\nIs this what I had in mind?\nIs it different than what I had in mind?\nBut is it better in some way?\nThat kind of iteration seems to still best be done by a human.\nMike, thanks so much for being on the show.\nI am going to ask you one last question and if you're watching the video, this is going to make more sense.\nIf you're not watching the video, which you definitely should on YouTube and our shorts, uh, is Back to the Future one, two, or three?\nWhich one are you watching on a rainy day to for as your comfort movie?\nI'd say I'd start with two and then because I can't just I have to watch the whole trilogy.\nI'll go watch one because I'm like, well, I got to go back to the beginning.\nThen I end up watching three at, you know, because I need to finish the trilogy.\nAnd I realize, why did I start with three?\nThree is such a good movie.\nThree is so underrated.\nI'm not going to lie to you.\nOne is definitely my favorite, but three.\nThree is so underrated.\nMike, thanks so much for being on the show.\nUh, you can come back anytime.\nUh, thanks so much for being here.\nThank you.\nYeah, thanks, Mike.\nThank you.\n[Music]\n",
