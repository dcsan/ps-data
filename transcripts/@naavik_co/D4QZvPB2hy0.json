I'm your host, David Taylor,\nand today we're joined by The Gang. And\nby that, I mean the whole gang.\nOriginally a team of five entrepreneurs,\nThe Gang was one of the first\nventure-backed studios to go all-in on\nRoblox back in 2020. They quickly made\ntheir mark with Strongman Simulator, an\noriginal game that shot to the top of\nthe Roblox charts and has since racked\nup over 1.5 billion plays. While they\nstarted with hit original titles, The\nGang soon shifted focus to building\nbranded experiences for some of the\nworld's biggest entertainment and\nlifestyle brands, including Netflix,\nVans, Shrek, Spotify, and the NHL, just\nto name a few. Most recently, though,\nthey've been expanding beyond Roblox,\nlicensing one of the platform's top IPs,\nBlade Ball, for a Steam release, as well\nas developing the original\ncross-platform game, Out of Sight. In\nthis conversation, we'll dive into the\nteam's entrepreneurial journey and what\nit was like being early builders on\nRoblox, how the platform has evolved,\nand what's next as they explore new\nplatforms and formats. Welcome to the\npodcast, guys.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nUm, just to kick us off, I'd love to get\na quick introduction from each of you, um,\nto sort of give us a sense of who each\nof you are and what you've\ncontributed to The Gang over the\nyears.\nWhy don't we start with Gustav?\nOkay. So, I'm Gustav. I, uh, my\nbackground and what I started doing at\nThe Gang is, uh, programming. Um, I started\nout back in the '90s in the modding, uh,\ncommunity and, uh, built mods for Quake,\nQuake 2, Quake 3, uh, and then\num, started working, uh, as a professional\nin the gaming industry. Uh, and I worked\nwith everything from, uh, Return Cosle\nWolfenstein to Candy Crush, uh, and have\nhad a couple of, uh, gaming companies\nbefore, and yeah, uh, it feels great to be\nback on Roblox because it feels like the\ngame, uh, modding communities. It feels\nlike I've gone full circle, um, and I love\nit. Amazing. How about you, Olle?\nHi. Um, yeah, I am similar to Gustav. I\nthink we all come from a modding\nbackground in one way or another almost.\nUm, I was, um, aspiring artist to begin\nwith, but now I'm a man with many hats.\nUm, so I went from art to character art\nin, uh, uh, mobile gaming to begin with, and\nthen did some stints in double A/A,\nuh, also done er in, um, capacity as a\ntechnical artist. Um, but right now in\nThe Gang, I'm acting as a producer on our\noriginal titles.\nVery cool.\nMarcus, how are you?\nYeah, nice, uh, nice to be here and thank\nyou for having us, first of all. Um, no,\nso I'm, um, my background is not from\ngaming originally. I started up\ncompanies in the digital marketing\nsector.\nSo I, uh, created my first company late\n'90s, and then I sold a few companies, and\nI met Gustav by investing in his previous\ncompany. So, I was part of the board of\ndirectors, and then, um,\nuh, I was sitting there until that\ncompany got sold, and that's kind of how\nwe got to know each other, and then\nmost of the other guys are from his\nprevious company as well,\nand my role now, uh, I'm the group CEO, so\noversee businesses.\nAwesome. So, we're starting to get into\nhow this all came together. Uh, Robin,\nhow about you?\nYeah. So, I'm CTO at The Gang. Uh, I\nlead the technical side of our original\nIP games, like everything from\narchitecture to performance and making\nsure our developers, uh, have the tools\nthey need to build, uh, our games.\nAnd my background is a mix of game\ndevelopment and more like traditional\nsoftware engineering. So I spent, uh, like\neight years in edtech industry, and\num, yeah, so that's short about me.\nVery cool. And Håkan.\nYeah. Um, nice to see you again, David.\nNice to see you too.\nUh, my background is, uh, within game\ndesign and and production. Um, um, I quite\nlike late figured out you can actually\nwork with game development. So I have\nhad all of these, you know, normal jobs\nworking within like industrial\nproduction and repairing robots and\nstuff like that. Uh, but, uh, yeah, slowly\nlike, uh, figured out you can actually\nwork with game development. So, uh,\neducated myself within game design and\nthen jumped into the industry like 10,\n12, 13 years ago, something like\nthat. Yeah.\nVery cool. So, I was hoping one of you\nwould sort of tackle this, but like, how\ndid the, how did the whole team come\ntogether? Like, what was the, what's the\norigin story for The Gang?\nWell, first of all, we, we had a\ndifferent idea. Uh, so we were, we were\nactually thinking to build a more\ntraditional game on Steam in beginning,\nand our first plan was to build a\ncompany. We wanted to build a game, and\nwe wanted to work with people we like to\nwork with and have fun, more or less. And\nthen we came into Roblox by coincidence.\nBut, um, I would say Gustav was more the\nglue for everyone. So I hand over to\nhim.\nYeah. I, I think we were\nuh, in 2019,\num, we were in a position where\nuh, I had sold off my previous company. I\nwas getting a bit restless. Um,\nand\nuh, we were in a position where we were\nlooking to\nmaybe not take a normal job, but instead\nwork together, as Marcus said, with\npeople that we like and do something\nwhere we thought it was more of\nlike for pleasure instead of business.\nUh, and it just happens, uh, to be that\nfrom all of the people that I had worked\nwith before,\num, the top four people that I wanted\nto work with again were in kind of\nsimilar positions where they were\nlooking for something new and something\nsomething else. So, uh, it was a perfect\ntime to to come together and say, like,\nlet's make a game together. uh, and it\ndoesn't really matter that much what\ngame it is. Um,\nwe said that we'll, we'll take a year\nwithout any pay. Um, and, uh, we'll see\nwhere it goes from there. So we\nbootstrapped it entirely. We also said\nthat we were never going to be more than\n10 people. So we failed on that one. But,\nuh, but\nsurprising because your name is The\nGang. So\nyeah. Yeah. But I mean, we still all\nwork full-time in the company, uh, now,\nlike almost six years later. So, so in\nthat sense, it was a success, and we keep\ntrue to only working with people that we\ntruly enjoy working with.\nThat's amazing. How big is the company\nnow in terms of employees?\nWe have approximately 220 people.\nOh my god.\nDo you know if you're the biggest, uh,\nRoblox studio, or I know that you guys\nare not technically a Roblox studio\nspecifically anymore, but you know\nwe, we, yeah, we are the biggest as far as\nI know in terms of employees.\nUh, we are also the biggest in terms of\nworking with, uh, brands.\nUh, we are not the biggest when you look\ninto number of, uh, CCUs on Robus game, for\nexample.\nGot it. But in terms of brands, it would\nbe like number of brand activations per\nyear.\nThen we are number one. Yes.\nOkay.\nYeah. And employees, uh, we, we do not\nlike a lot of the big studios use a lot of\ncontractors. We have full-time employees\nwith a proper salary and and pension and\nall like that. And and with that, I\nthink we're definitely the biggest.\nYeah. Yeah. I know Roblox is mostly\ncontractors.\nUm, even people, I mean, which isn't to\nsay that they're underpaid. I mean,\nthere are certainly contractors who are\nmaking hundreds of thousands of dollars\na year. Um, but yeah, it seems to be sort\nof like a, uh, a, um, you know, it's a\ncreator economy. People move around to\ndifferent projects very, very fluidly.\nThe, uh, the thing I, I would love to get\ninto is sort of the early days of of The\nGang. There there's sort of two\nquestions that I want to ask. We'll\nstart with one, which is sort of the\nelement of, like, you started off, and you\nand you said we didn't imagine ourselves\ngrowing more than 10. So what were sort\nof the key milestones that allowed you\nguys to scale to where you are today of\nover 200 employees? Um, and then the\nnext question is going to be around, like,\nwhat are some of the, what are some of\nthe funny stories of being on the Roblox\nplatform? I know, you know, it can be\nridiculous at times, uh, you know,\nworking on on a platform that encourages\nuh, creativity, encourages, uh, um, you\nknow, fast failing, and, um, also as\nentrepreneurs, I imagine you also have\nsome pretty funny stories, you know,\ntrying to raise money and whatnot. So\nwould love to just, u, give you guys the\nopportunity to share sort of that, that\npath of starting with just the five of\nyou and and growing and what are some\nsome things that happened along the way.\nI, I, I can kick off and then I hand over\nto the funny things to the guys who can\ntalk about that,\ntalk about the corporate things.\nNo. So I think from, uh, being\nentrepreneurs and, uh, looking into it\nfrom an opportunistic point of view, uh,\nvery early on when we came into it, we\nsaw that\nit's kind of blue ocean. There were no\ndevs focusing on\nuh, brand partnerships and, uh, building\ngames with the focus that we came in\nwith, and with that also experience,\nbecause there were, and there are\ntremendous devs on the platform that are,\nI'm, I'm amazed every single day when I\nsee what they are building, but, um, we are\ncoming more from a more tradition, I\nwould, Okay. Uh, gaming perspective, and\nwhen we came in, there were no none of\nthose. Uh, so when we started the first\ngame, then we saw that there is a huge\nopportunity here, and we believe this\nplatform will actually grow. So when we\nsaid we're not going to be more than 10\npeople, but then when we started to get\nrequest from clients, uh, we started to\nget traction on our own games, it, it was\nabsolutely no possibility not to scale.\nSo, uh, we just did it in order, and we\nalso scaled with profitability, and\nthat's what Gus has said before, we were\nprofitable year one, and it didn't, it, it\nwould have been a stupid mistake to, uh,\nnot scale and grow,\nand then if it came into what we're\ndoing, I'm going to hand over to the guys\nto\ntalk about our first success, for example,\nand that\nyeah, I think that kind of leads also\ninto some of the funny stories, like, uh,\none very early story that I find, uh,\nfunny in hindsight, and that was very\nhumbling is that, like, I worked\nprofessional in the games industry since\nthe '90s. Uh, I've done everything from\nlike Facebook games to mobile games to\nconsole PC, and I thought I knew gaming,\nand all of us did. We were like, \"Yeah,\nthis platform, I, it's just a bunch of\nkids making games on it.\" Uh, so we\nthought it was going to be easy, and our\nfirst game was horrible. Like, it\nperformed super, super bad. It was such a\nbad fit for the platform, and the players\nabsolutely hated it, uh, and so, so we\npulled it down and remade it entirely\nfrom, from, uh, the, from the start, and,\nuh, then it performed much better, and\nthat's how we started to to learn the\nplatform, like, we were making mistakes,\nand instead of trying to blame the\nplatform or something else, we were like,\nyeah, we don't know what we're doing, like,\nwe have no idea, and we started to play a\nlot of the games, and we started to get\nmore involved with the community, and\nstarted to learn from it, and, uh, It took\nus about 6 months until we had our first\nhit, uh, which was called Tapping Simulator,\nand I think we peaked at 30K CCU on that.\nUh, and this is back in 2020 when the\nplatform was much, much smaller. So that\nwas actually, uh, one of the top\nperforming games on the platform. Um,\nand that was, like, I'm probably more\nproud of that moment than than Strongman\nbecause it was was the first time we\nfelt like we had a hit, and we were\nmaking money, we could, uh, start to take\non employees and pay a salary for the\nfirst time. Um,\nand just a quick question on this, like,\nhow in that six-month period, how many\ngames did you try? Uh, how many games\ndid you launch, and then how long did it\ntake you to to build Tab Simulator?\nUh, do you remember, Robin? Do you\nremember?\nSo tapping must have been our fourth\ngame, right? Or fifth.\nWe had zombie tag at the same window,\nright?\nYeah. Yeah. Then it's our fifth.\nYeah.\nYeah. And I think the development was\naround, like, the prototype of the game. I\nthink we did, like, in a weekend or\nsomething.\nThat was the guest of it. And then the\nfull release was in, was it? It was two,\ntwo weeks or something. That it was a\npretty fast, really fast production.\nThat's amazing. I feel like it takes a\nlot of, uh, studios I've seen, especially\nthe, the venture-backed ones, a long time\nto sort of come to that conclusion of we\nneed to make a lot of different games in\na short, uh, amount of time. I still see\nsome companies investing millions of\ndollars into a single game, and I'm just\nlike, uhoh, that's going to be hard to\nmake back.\nYeah, we have made some, uh, expensive\ngames that have taken way too long as\nwell. But all of our successes have been\nlike probably the fastest games that we\nmake where we find, uh, like a core\nmechanic, we build the first version of\nthe game very quick. like strongman was\nabout, uh, 4 hours for the prototype. Um,\nand, uh, and when we feel like this is\nactually really fun, like this is a good\ngame, then we can start to build\n\n\nOn it.\nUh, often when we have tried starting the other way around, where we start with paper and we build this grand idea, like you typically do, uh, in the traditional gaming industry, then those games don't perform well.\nYeah, you guys also, I had a recent game launch that had some success called Prison Pump. I'm curious, like, which one of you is the weightlifter of the group?\nIt's everyone. Can't you tell? We are all, we're all strong men here. Uh, but before we jump to that, David Taylor, I think it's one more project that is important to mention that kicked off The Gang on Roblox, and this is Vans. That was also like a monumental game for us because that has been our window towards all other brands and and Roblox themselves. So that's an important, uh, um, project to mention as well and a game that we are super proud of. So yeah.\nYeah. I, I remember when I was at Super Social, Vans was one of like the few branded experiences that actually had like a sustained audience without the use of free UGC.\nUm, which I think is, uh, speaks to sort of, you know, your, your guys' ability to make, uh, you know, uh, an advertisement fun to engage with.\nYeah. But we also, that game, to be honest, we built it also from the perspective of building a game and not, yes, not as an ad or similar. We, um, we wanted to have something that is actually fitting for the platform that is fun and, um, and also they are obviously super happy. So we continue to work for them after all this time. So, um, they were one of our absolute first clients who still work with them. So it's, yeah, and it was a really process as well working together with them. They're great to work with, and they really embrace this right away when we wanted to push them in the direction of we actually have to make a proper game. I know we threw out Tony Hawk a lot of times, for example, that was a strong reference, uh, for this product. Um, so no, they were, they were great to work with, and that's important as well, that you have this great connection and relationship together with the brand.\nAmazing. So before we get into sort of the branded side of things, I also wanted to just understand, you guys have been on the platform for, for, uh, you know, five years, a lot has changed. I mean, I've, I've been on the platform for three and a half years, and it's like night and day from when I be, when I began and to, to now. What are some of the things that you've seen changing, and, uh, what are the ways in which you've had to adapt, both on the branded side as well as the original game side? Um, I think the, like, the biggest change, we have touched on this already, but how, um, how many more professionals are coming into the space, how much more competitive it's looking right now. Um, so from that perspective, there has been a huge change, but then also, um, touching on the development side of things, like it was always a pretty good environment to work in, but what happened during these years is like it's leaps and bounds from what it was before. It's a completely different engine with way more features, like the analytics tools. Everything is just better, and that's also adaptations that you have to make now as well, and you have to utilize all these tools in a different way. Um, when you say that it's there, what, what sort of has, what have these tools enabled? Has it enabled you to make games faster? Has it allowed them to be more high fidelity? What's sort of the, the unlock for the end product that we, that me as a player might, might see?\nNot so much in terms of speed. Like Roblox is always going to be fast to develop the words, but definitely when it comes to fidelity, like making, making stuff that can compete with products on Steam as well with unlock of modern technology didn't really exist, um, in the same sense. I mean, it's, it's not on the same level, but it's getting there, and you see it every year. It's, it's too much to keep up with, essentially. Um, but yeah, we're trying to keep up with everything, and, uh, especially the analytical tools are really important, and you can work way more data-driven now than what you could before. Like in the beginning, I think we used Google Analytics for everything, which wasn't really feasible in the end, but now you have this out of the box, and you really need to utilize it, uh, to be able to perform on the, on the game engine side. Do you feel like Roblox is headed towards being at the same level of fidelity performance, um, as, as other game engines like Unreal Engine or or Unity? Or do, is it still, is it never going to be there? It's really more focused on, you know, being easy to use. Like, is there, is there, is there a moment where Roblox might catch up and still be easy to use, but be just as powerful as those engines?\nI don't think it would be beneficial for them to be an indirect competitor, because that's also the beauty about Roblox, that it's, it's more about the games and to me, it should always be more about the games than the actual fidelity. And you can see that on certain titles that come out now. I know Grow a Garden is generating a lot of buzz. It's, yeah, the fidelity is not really needed in that sense. So, they could catch up. Should they? I'm not sure.\nYeah, I would probably turn it around. Like, I'm saying that the other engines need to catch up to Roblox, because, but maybe that's because I'm a coder, so I don't care about, like, uh, render fidelity or things like that. But the Roblox engine is absolutely amazing, especially for smaller teams, like the collaboration tools, where, where you can actually see what's happening in real time while, while adding it, it, and, uh, like the built, you have built-in multiplayer and the social features and everything, like the other engines have a lot of catching up to do, and I worked with probably 12 different engines, and I, I worked as an engine developer as well on them, and like the APIs from a tech standpoint point, like this is the most beautiful engine I have ever seen. I absolutely love it, and, um, you need to remember also that a majority of the players are on mobile devices. You don't want to push all, even if you have the capability, and there are some games that look amazing. We, uh, we have a horror game with like PBR realistic lighting called Dread Camp, uh, that when we show videos of it, people don't believe it's Roblox, but it's not a good product for the platform because it's not available to the majority of the players, right? Yeah, we definitely, uh, saw that at Super Social, just the more memory usage, the short, the lower our session length would be, because you'd have, you know, 50% of the player base on low-end devices, and you know, they can't, they're not going to wait 30 seconds for a game to load. You know, they'll wait 3 to 5 seconds, and if it doesn't, then they leave, and then that just hurts, hurts your session length.\nYeah. And also, I, I think we're seeing the, and maybe we're straying away a bit from the topic, but I think we're seeing a trend on the non-Roblox platforms where the successful games are starting to look more like Roblox and less like Fortnite. Um, so I think that's very interesting. Like, as I said, I think the other engines need to catch up. It's not the other way around.\nMakes sense. Anyone else want to chime in here on sort of what makes Roblox tools, uh, particularly enjoyable compared to other?\nI mean, you can summarize it that you, if you have an idea to build that idea, to cross, uh, publish that game to multiple platforms, have it live, and then also have user acquisition to that game, there is no other game engine or platform that can do what Roblox does, like that process itself. It's just, you know, so good. Yeah.\nAwesome. I, this is sort of a another philosophical question, but you know, given how easy it is to, uh, build games on Roblox, I'm curious how a company such as yourselves with, you know, 200 plus employees, how you guys are able to retain talent when you know the best Roblox developers on the platform are able to, you know, build these games without the support of a larger institution.\nI, I can start here. Uh, so the way we did it, because we work with a lot of brands. Um, and also these guys have been in the gaming industry for a long period of time. Uh, most our connections from the beginning were not from Roblox, because we didn't come from Roblox. We're not Roblox native.\nMhm.\nSo, uh, our first employees were more from the traditional gaming industry. So we hired them from, uh, uh, working from other studios, gaming studios as artists, designers, coders, and then, uh, we advocated Roblox to them, and then we, and that worked quite well for us. So that's what we have been continuing to do, more or less.\nMhm. And I think that also makes us partly unique, because most of the studios, they work mainly with, as we spoke about before, contractors or native Roblox.\nWe are doing that from time to time as well, but the majority of our employees are, uh, more traditional, uh, from traditional gaming, uh, industry.\nGot it. Okay. And something, go ahead.\nSomething we actually found that a lot of traditional game developers find it liberating to have, like, development cycles measured in months rather than years. Like that's something a lot of people seem to enjoy.\nYeah. Uh, in my current role, the, the development cycle is around four to six years. So, uh, I feel for those who have been working on a project for 6 years, and then that's when they find out if it's successful or not, and then most of the time it's not successful, just because of, you know, the hit rate in the video games industry. So yeah, it can be, I imagine, very heartbreaking, uh, to go through that long cycle, and you know, most likely being facing failure at the end and potential layoffs as well.\nUm, so yeah, I can understand why people would take shelter at The Gang. Um, and in ter, and so, so a key part of that is, is the branded experiences, right? Because you are sort of guaranteed some amount of, of revenue upfront through the contract. Um, I'm curious sort of how has that evolved over time? Like, you guys were obviously early movers in 2020. How has the, uh, market for building branded experiences evolved? And I'm really curious about now, because, um, you know, you've seen fewer branded experiences being built overall. More brands are leaning into activations, which in terms of reach are are probably the most efficient way to to market a product. Um, and then you have Roblox's advertising push, which is where they're trying to make this more programmatic advertising. So, how are you guys sort of responding to that? How have you responded over the years to the evolution of, of marketing on the platform?\nLet's begin with why we started with branded work versus, um, original games. I think that's good to know. Uh, so we, when we created a company, we, um, we didn't know if we were going to get a hit or when. So then we, we thought it's good to work also with branded work, because then we, um, have, as you said, some kind of platform, some kind of stability in terms of revenues, but not only, we also knew that having brands like Vans, for example, um, or, um, Hasbro or those that we worked with very early on, those unlock possibilities for us, um, especially in the beginning, new technologies and everything. So, Roblox wanted to test on the, on the more well-known brands. So, then we got opportunity to kind of unlock new technologies, and, uh, then we also built our own experiences outside, because we wanted to get a hit, obviously. But, um, also the second thing which was really, really good for brands was that we, um, tested on our own things. So we could, uh, test different genres, uh, different tools and everything. So when we spoke with a brand, we also know what worked and didn't work. So we didn't have to test on the brands. So that was kind of a, a really, really good thing in the beginning. Uh, what we see now, yeah, it's, it's been shifting and and moving quite a lot. Of course, what I think is the main difference now compared to before is that now brands have more knowledge on why they are actually doing something on Roblox. It's not that they are stunt. It's not that they create something else because they want to get headlines on a lot of, uh, newspapers.\nAnd in the beginning, I would say there were so many companies contacting us, had zero clue what Roblox actually were.\nYeah.\nAnd, um, they could have just made something on, uh, Roblox or on any other platform at the time. It didn't man, didn't matter if it was like, um, a platform that was for, uh, crypto or if it was, uh, Roblox. They, they just wanted to be there somewhere.\nSo I think the level of knowledge has increased quite a lot, and also the, the ROI, the possibility to, uh, get something back that you, uh, the reason why you spend the money, that has also increased, and Roblox have been pushing quite a lot on this. They have been pushing technologies when it comes to, uh, ads, as you mentioned, um, and and also integration possibilities. So it's easier now than it was before.\nHow are you guys adapting to that?\nRight. If, if, if, uh, brands are having a higher ROI expectation, and Roblox is sort of pushing towards, you know, more scalable advertising solutions. What is that? What are you guys doing to adapt?\nWell, well, that has always been the case, to be bonus, that the brand should always have a high ROI possibilities. So, the way we do it is that we work alongside Roblox and not against.\nMhm.\nAnd, uh, we utilize their, uh, possibilities, technologies. So, we work a lot with ads, for example, together with Roblox. We also bring them into the room. So, if you speak with the client, we have them alongside from the beginning to talk about what are the objectives, how can we do it, what kind of possibilities do I have here in order to not work against each other or having someone else coming in from the sideline and doing something else in the end.\nAnd I think that's quite natural. It's like with every single platform, not only Roblox, that you have to, they, they're obviously going to try to push in new technologies. So, they increase their margins and possibilities, but in the end of the day, that should also benefit the clients, and it will benefit the clients, and that's why they do it.\nMhm. What would you say are, are the benefits of building an original experience today? Like, I, I still see a lot of brands doing original experiences. I, uh, you know, I think Universal did both an original experience as well as sort of a, a slew of integrations across multiple experiences.\nUm, so how, what is the role of the original experience versus the activation? How do those things differ?\nI, I think, I think it's, um, pros and cons for both, first of all. So it's not that one is better. Um, when you have your own exper\n\n\nSince you have full control first\nof all, you can do anything within as you\nwant. You can also activate or integrate\nother partners. We work with a lot of\nsports brands, for example. If you take\nWimbledon, that is ongoing right now, uh,\nthe tennis tournament there, we have, uh,\nmultiple of their partners in their\nactual competition that they have\nbrought into the space. That's possible\nto do if you have your own space or a\nplace. Uh, so you can offset some of the\ncost to, um, together with your partners\nalready.\nMhm. Uh, and but mainly full control and\nalso build community over time. So you\ndon't\njust take something in, put it in someone\nelse's experience for a short period of\ntime, but then you can actually build a\ncommunity and foster community and speak\nwith a community and use it as, um,\nsimilar as any other channel, website, or\nsocial media integrations.\nThey are really, really good if you want\nto reach a certain audience. You know\npredefined which audience you want to\nreach. You want to know, you also know\nhow many they have. So you can calculate\nforehand exactly how many are you going\nto reach, who are you going to reach for\nwhich period of time. So, so I would say\nit's\ndepends what your, what your objectives\nare and time frame. If you, for example,\nwant to launch a product and you really\nneed to, uh, reach a lot of people, you\nmight be better off doing an\nintegration. But if you're going to do\nthis long term, uh, you might be better\noff building your own, uh, space\nand long, and you say better long term\nbecause why you might grow an audience\nover that time.\nExactly.\nAre there examples of games that have\ngrown, you know, significant audiences\nover time?\nUh, Vans.\nI would say Vans is one of them that, uh,\nthere's a reason why we continue to work\nfor them over time. Um, we, um, we have,\nI, I would say Wimbledon as well. We're\non the third year right now. So, um, in, in\nthe beginning it was only Wimbledon. Now\nwe also work with US Open and Australian\nOpen, and we have, um,\nquite good traffic when it's, when the\nevent is, and then it goes down when it's\nnot, obviously. So they, um, they do see\nreasons for being there, and also I would\nalso say reach, reaching an audience that\nyou cannot or is difficult to reach\nelsewhere. Of course, you might be able\nto reach them on YouTube or Tik Tok, but\nit's different platforms.\nYeah. And here you have a focused\naudience.\nCool. I want to talk about the future a\nlittle bit. Um, where, so, you know, you\nguys have launched a cross-platform game.\nYou have sort, you're sort of dabbling on\non these adjacent, uh, platforms. You know\nBlade Ball being ported over, it's not\ntechnically a port. It's a, it's a, a\nlicense of Blade Ball and and bringing a\nversion of that experience to Steam.\nWhat sort of is driving that\nexploration? Um, and, and what is sort of\nwhat's sort of your views on on the\ngaming industry today that are leading\nyou to take these, these exploratory, uh,\npaths?\nUm, I can talk a bit on that. Uh, I've\nbeen producing, uh, Blade Ball. So,\nno,\nin case of, uh, in case of that, I think,\nsorry,\nand while, sorry, just to, well, since with\nwith that information, would also just\nlove to understand sort of what it's\nbeen like doing that because I think\nit's a really interesting, uh, strategy,\nand I'm sure if you guys are successful,\neveryone's going to probably be piling\nin trying to do the same thing. Um, so\nI'm sure people's ears have perked up, uh,\nto just sort of understand how that all\ncame together if you're able to share.\nUh, and, and what are some of the\nhypotheses behind it?\nUm, I mean, they,\nI don't remember exactly number now how\nmuch they peaked in CCU, and that's what\npeaked our interest. I think it was up\nto half, half a million or a million\neven. Um,\nyeah. And they've stabilized around\n20,000, 10 to 20,000. I mean, and they're\nalways in the top 10 earning games.\nThey're around number 10 or 11.\nNo. So, that's a big part of it. Like,\nit's a very strong community. Uh, it's a\nvery creative concept. And I think\nthat's what it comes down to, these\ncreative ideas, um, that you can find on\nRoblox, uh, in another sense. And that's\nwhat we wanted to tap into. So, doing\nthis, uh, as a collaboration with\nBlade Ball, then we get to utilize their\ncommunity, um, to actually help shape the\nproduct into what it's going to be\neventually. Uh, I'm actually going to\nplay this in 10 minutes. I accidentally\ndouble booked the stream that we're\ngoing to do, so I'm going to have to\nplay a little bit on the side here while\nwe do this. Um,\nit's all right. We can try to wrap up by\nthen, too.\nNo, but it's fine. Like, I, I'm, I know it\nby the back of my hand, so I don't\nreally have to focus when I play it\nanymore.\nI'm sure you wouldn't be the first\nperson on the podcast to play video\ngames while he was being interviewed.\nYeah. No, I can imagine. Um, no, but\nthat's, uh, so that's how we're working\nwith it right now, like playing together\nwith the community now. We're\ncollaborating, collaborating together\nwith two streamers are going to play it.\nUm, so essentially just building it up\nuntil we feel that it's ready for\nrelease and that we get a thumbs up from\nthe community essentially that, uh, now\nit's good to go.\nDo you think that there will be new\naudiences that come, or are you really\nsort of anchoring towards being able to\nget people who are typically on Roblox\nto come over and play on Steam?\nUm, both in a sense. Um,\nbut what we have been trying to do, we\nrealize that the games don't take the\nexact same shape as they do on Steam, for\nexample, versus Roblox. There, there will\nbe differences. So we have tried to\nshape this game in being, in this case,\nit's a, it's a bit more complex than what\nyou would see, um, on Roblox, like, uh, we\ndon't have to really have a mobile in\nmind as much, so we can rack up the\ncomplexity a bit, and by that we want to\ntry to scare players from that, like\ngames like Rocket League, for example, or\nuh, similar multiplayer brawler games. Um,\nso that's our hypothesis, like, take a\nreally good creative concept, uh, in this\ncase, do, um, this collaboration together\nwith, uh, Blade Ball and try to shape it\ninto a new product. I see them working\nside by side essentially. They, they are\nnot competitors in any sense. They are\nthe same in many ways, but they are\ndifferent games. Um,\nyeah. I mean, Blade Ball was, uh, heavily\ninfluenced or inspired by Genji Ball,\nwhich is an Overwatch creative mode, and\nI think that was inspired by another\ngame mode from Team Fortress 2,\nPyro Pyro Ball.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nPyro dodgeball. Yeah.\nPresumably there is an audience off of\nRoblox that's interested in playing this\ngame as well.\nYeah.\nBut I think that's where we're coming\nfrom as well. Like, we, we have not only\nworked with games for a long time, we\nhave all been playing games since we\nwere kids as well. And we have seen this\nbefore, like, uh, Dota started out, uh, as a\nmod, and, uh, and a lot of good game ideas\ngo through different platforms and they\nevolve and change, and we felt with\nBlade Ball especially, we felt like this\nis a brilliant game mechanic, like this\nhas been been on so many platforms, and\nit has evolved into something that is a\nvery, very good core gameplay. Uh, and we\nalso see again, uh, as I mentioned earlier,\nlike, we, we see a trend on on Steam and\nconsoles where a lot of the hit games,\nlike Lethal Company was a hit game last\nyear on Steam, and it was made by a\nRoblox developer, and we're seeing like\nthe top games when we play them, and we\nsee them, we're thinking like, hey, this is\na Roblox game, and it's doing really\nwell. So we think that the creativity is\nso high on the platform, uh, and, uh, and\nthere are so many good games, and we\nthink they should be available to a\nbroader market.\nYeah. Uh, I mean, that's why, why I love\nthe platform is just getting exposure to\nall of that creativity. Uh, it's, you\nknow, it's delightful to just look at\nthe the charts every day and just see\nwhat's popped up lately and and hop into\nit and see what it's about. Um, so, so we\ntalked about Blade Ball. How about the, um,\nOut of Sight? How, how did that\ncome about? How did you guys decide to\nto explore just an entirely original\ngame that's cross-platform?\nThat, that is actually, uh, that's a fun\nstory. Um, so, uh, I was, uh, I was doing a\ntalk at, uh, at an event here in Stockholm,\nand after me, a student team went up on\nstage, and, uh, they had won like all of\nthe awards, all the student awards in\nSweden that year, and one of the guys\nwere working at The Gang. So I was like,\n\"Hey, that's Simon, and he's part of this\nteam that like won all of the awards\nthis year.\" Um, so, uh, so after their\npresentation, I just grabbed them and\nsaid like, \"Hey, let's make this into\nmore than a student project. Let's make\nit into a full game and do it with us.\"\nSo Simon didn't tell you he was doing\nthis. You just happened to\nHe had, he had done this, uh, during his\neducation. So he joined us when, uh, when,\nuh, after his education, uh, straight from\nschool. Um, so, so they were presenting\nlike their, their final exam, uh, which was\nthis game, and, and that game had also\ngone viral, uh, through Itch.io\nand, uh, and had a lot of YouTube views.\nSo, and it's a brilliant game, like, it's\nit's very different from what we\ntypically do, like, single player horror,\nuh, game. Uh, but, uh, it was just such a\ngood game, and, uh, we thought like, if you\nsee a good game, why, why pass on it, that\nthat let's see this game realized as, as\nthey would have wanted to see it and not\non a student budget.\nSo I, I imagine you guys are sort of new\nto launching cross-platform games. How\nhave you sort of taken the approach of\nmarketing this and and getting it,\ngetting people aware aware that the game\nexists?\nUh, we did the boring thing and went with\na publisher.\nUh, uh, really, like,\nwe have, we have had a lot of releases\nbefore The Gang on, uh, on like\ntraditional platforms, but we have always\nworked as developers and not publishers.\nWe started out thinking like, hey, we\nself-publish on Roblox. Let's, uh,\nself-publish outside, but that is a\ndifferent beast altogether. Uh, so we\njust signed with a publisher.\nAwesome. Well, I hope that the publisher\nknows what they're doing when it comes\nto marketing. Not all publishers do. Um,\nyeah. So, okay. So, cool. So, um, I guess\nlike, just, you know, just to sort of wrap\nup the conversation, would love to sort\nof reflect on the the five years that\nyou guys have been on this journey, given\nwhat you know now. I'm sure you've\nlearned a lot over over your time on the\nRoblox platform at least. Um, but what\nwould you do differently if you were\nstarting the game today? I, I can start\nfirst of all, I don't regret a second\nthat we jumped on Roblox because it's, uh,\nsuper, super fun, and we, and also\ntestament to that, we still work together\nall of us full time, and, um, we haven't\ngotten tired of each other yet, which is,\num, quite amazing.\nUm, but I think what we would probably\nhave done differently, we have been doing\na few larger, uh, investments early on in\ngames. Like you said before as well, um,\nthat\nthe the hits that we have had are way\nshorter, uh, time spent on building, uh, the\nprototypes for. So we would probably, we\nshould have probably have done focused\nmore on that and not been doing\nthe more grandiose\ngame types.\nMhm.\nI think, uh, and the second thing from a\ncompany perspective, I think we should\nhave kept original games versus brand\nbusiness a bit more separate from day\none. It was very entangled,\nand, um, for a reason, it, it worked for us,\nbut I think, uh,\nwe have been working for quite some time\nnow to separate it.\nYeah, you guys have, I, I remember seeing\nsort of new CEOs popping up of different,\ndifferent parts of The Gang, like, how did\nthat all come together just out of\ncuriosity? No. So what, what we did was\nthat we, we noticed it was actually, uh,\ncounterproductive to have everything on\nthere or entangled too much. So we\nseparated the brand work that we do, uh,\nthe work, work for hire versus the\noriginal games into two separate\nentities, and then we put, um,\ntwo people to lead each part. It's Max\nand Yo. Yeah.\nAnd the reason for it is that we will\nhave way better focus on each part\ninstead of stealing resources to one or\nanother, and mainly from a regional games\nto, uh, to brands. So when we got the big\nnew client coming in, it was all hands\non deck, and then we stole resources from\na regional game development.\nUh, and that's why we needed to do this\nbecause we wanted to have 100%\ndedication, very full focus forward, and\nthen we can grow much better, and also\nthe platform has evolved quite a lot. So\nit's different way of working with\nbrands today were 5 years ago.\nYeah.\nAnd, um, so I think this makes a lot of\nsense, and that's probably something we\nwould have done earlier.\nHow about the rest of The Gang? Any\nother things that you would have done\ndifferently?\nNo, I think, I think the most important\nthing is kind of what Marcus said, like,\nmore focus. Um, we consider ourselves t\nplatform agnostics. Um, and we have built\nlike games on UFN, and and we have built\non,\num, like a lot of the other platforms\nthat are not as big. And we have been\ntrying to\nstay on top of like the trends across so\nmany different verticals that\nsomehow we ended up being\nlike spread thin on our original Roblox\ngames, I think. Uh, and we kind of lost\nfocus. Um, and yeah, I would have, if I\nwere to redo it, that's the thing I\nwould change, like, more focus, saying like\nthis is where we're going to be, uh, the\nbest and and execute on that instead of\nsaying that we're going to be good at\neverything, but, but really don't\nmaybe\nexcel at our own games. Like, I don't\nthink we currently have a game in top\n10. Uh, and I think we would have had\nthat if we would have kept a super focus\non on that goal alone.\nAmazing.\nI can only echo what the guys says here,\nlike, uh, focusing more on our own\nproductions, and I mean, the platform\nproves it year on year, like, we think\nwe've seen the biggest game ever, but\nthen next year, you know, you have the new\nhit game, or you think that, oh, this is a\nvertical where it's like, there's no room\nto go in and, uh, compete within this\nvertical, and then a game like, I don't\nknow, Dress to Impress comes, or then a\ngame like Fish comes, and you know, the\nthe platform just keep on proving us\nright in that sense that we should focus\non building our own games and our own\nIPs.\nYeah, couldn't agree more.\nAwesome. Well, I know Ola has to get to\na, to a, uh, Blade Ball stream, so I think\nwe can wrap it up here. It's been\namazing to have you guys on the podcast.\nAppreciate you all finding time to be in\nthe same virtual\n\n\nSpace at the same time.\nUh, this has definitely been the largest uh group of podcast guests that we've ever had on the podcast.\nI'm glad we all fit on the same screen.\nUm, but yeah, this has been super enlightening.\nReally appreciate you guys coming on and best of luck in the coming year.\nThank you so much for having us.\nThank you, David.\nIf you enjoyed today's episode, whether on YouTube or your favorite podcast app, make sure to like, subscribe, comment, or give a five-star review.\nAnd if you want to reach out or provide feedback, shoot us a note at podcastnavic.co or find us on Twitter and LinkedIn.\nPlus, if you want to learn more about what Naavik has to offer, make sure to check out our website, www.navic.co.\nThere you can sign up for the number one games industry newsletter, Navic Digest, or contact us to learn about our wide-ranging consulting and advisory services.\nAgain, that is www.navic.co.\nThanks for listening and we'll catch you in the next episode.\n",
