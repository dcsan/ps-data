Over the years, we've had all\nsorts of interesting conversations about\nesports on this podcast. We've talked\nwith the leaders of competing esports\nteams, event platforms, and of emerging\ntools and services. And along the way,\nit's been abundantly clear that esports\nis not only undergoing massive\nrecalibration and change, especially\nwith all that we see in the West. But\nthe story isn't the same around the\nworld. Saudi Arabia, for example, has\nremained bullish on esports and\ncontinues to make outsiz investments\nthat will leave a mark on the entire\nindustry. One of those investments is\nthrough the Esports World Cup\nFoundation, which is building a massive\nannual event pulling teams and fans\ntogether around the world, all backed by\na $70 million prize pool. Clearly, the\nworld of esports continues to evolve.\nAnd to help me break down the latest and\nhow the Esports World Cup fits into it\nall is my guest today, Mike McCabe, the\nCOO of the Esports World Cup Foundation.\nMike, welcome to the podcast. Thanks\nvery much, Aaron. Lovely to to meet you.\nSorry we can't be in the same room to do\nthis. That is totally fine. We're across\nthe world at from each other at the\nmoment, but I'm I'm sure the\nconversation is going to be super\ninteresting nonetheless. And Mike, I am\nexcited to dig into all things\nesports with you, and we'll spend most\nof today's conversation on that. But\nbefore we get there, I'd actually like\nto spend a couple minutes learning from\nyour past because before esports, you\nspent time doing other interesting\nthings at other notable companies inside\nand outside of gaming. To start at EA,\nyou received global exposure and were\ninvolved in important franchises like\nFIFA. And I'm curious, what did you\nlearn about operating in emerging\nmarkets through EA and at the forefront\nof emerging trends that set you up to\nsucceed later as a games industry\nleader?\nYeah, it was look, it was a really\ninteresting time. I had the fortune to\nbe part of EA both from a publishing and\na and a studio standpoint and really\nhelped build out both the publishing but\nalso the studio capabilities in in a lot\nof emerging markets and building products\nspecifically for those markets. I think\nthe most interesting piece for me was\nwas really around the product and and\nactually tuning both the product and the\nlive service really to support the\nneeds, the desires, the aspirations of\nthose players in those emerging markets\nbecause it was it was quite different\nthe way that people wanted to play with\nthe game, some of the mechanics that we\nused as well. So that was the the the\nreally enduring piece for me was was\nidentifying talking to the community,\nunderstanding looking at the products\nthat were being successful in those\nmarkets and then taking a product like\nlike FIFA or EFC as it is now and and\nactually building something specifically\nfor the market. And that was a a unique\nopportunity and it's it's rare to be\nable to do that with such a big\nfranchise, but it was great that that EA\nwere really open to that and we built a\ndedicated version of of FIFA at the time\nto be able to operate in markets like\nSoutheast Asia and a a slightly tuned\nversion for Korea and the same for China\nas well.\nAwesome. And so after EA or I guess\nbetween stints at EA, you were at Nike\nwhere you oversaw digital products and\nand innovation and Nike obviously isn't a\ngaming business. But are there any\ncompelling lessons you learned from Nike\nabout winning in digital that you think\ngames teams underappreciate or maybe\nabout how gaming insights are applicable\nelsewhere in ways that those outside the\ngames industry might not know? Yeah, it\nwas it was a really interesting time. I\nwas there for 4 years and it was really\ninteresting to see how a lot of a lot of\nthe elements of of game design and and\nlive service are relevant in other\nindustries as well. And that's what Nike\nwas specifically interested in.\nPersonally, I was just interested in the\nbrand and being able to take some of the\nvision that we had and some of the\nthings that we did within gaming into an\namazing brand like like Nike. And what\nwe saw was a lot of the the mechanics\nthat we built to to drive engagement to\nto keep people engaged within a an\nexperience and bring them back and and\nreward them was directly transferable\ninto the world of activity and and you\nknow many of us sometimes struggle to\nstay active and and there's nothing\nbetter than than taking some of those\ncues and bringing them across. And so it\nwas really good fun to to identify the\nthings that that worked and bring them\nacross to help people be active in a in\na healthy and a sustainable way. But it\nalso was great to bring some of the\ncommunity elements that are critical to\nto game development, game operation, and\nbring them over as well to to really be\nable to listen and understand. And\nthat's we used a lot of that within the\ninnovation space. It's sometimes a\nlittle too easy to to bring technology\nfor technologies sake into into those\ntypes of situations, but it was really\ngood to use the the actual athlete or\nthe consumers as the as the barometer\nthere as to whether these mechanics made\nsense. Yeah. Just a quick follow up on\nthat. One big trend that people are\ntalking about around gaming right now is\njust the idea of gamification, right, of\nother apps or services. Is that what\nyou're talking about here? Or or I'm\ncurious like maybe could you give like a\nspecific example of like what you guys\napplied or or learned? Yeah, there was I\nthink gamification absolutely\nleaderboards, rewards, those kind of\nrecognition for achievements, but also\ncontent. I mean, what what you and the\nteam do in creating really engaging\ncontent. I think one of the other things\nthat we we brought across was that and\nand something as simple as giving people\ncues to help them through a journey in\nthe same way as we when we're playing a\ngame sometimes we need need cues to get\nthrough things or to to optimize or\nimprove. Same for running. How it should\nfeel when you're running. If you cannot\nbreathe and you cannot talk, you're\noverdoing it. Back off. And so we built\nguided runs as something really really\nsimple using distance or timebased cues\nor just checking in with people. So all\nelements really have that have that\nability to transfer across and it was it\nwas really fascinating to to bring those\nacross. I wish all industries developed\nat the same pace as the games industry\nwhen it comes to code development and\ncreating and bringing features to life.\nBut it was amazing to to be there and be\nable to to bring all of those some of\nwell some of those ideas across. Cool.\nAnd your final career stop before joining\nthe Esports World Cup Foundation was at\nEpic Games where you saw oversaw\ninternational publishing between 2021\n2024 which obviously has been an\nimportant time period for Epic in its\nown history with UFN Epic Game Store and\npublishing itself becoming a bigger deal\nand and so I'm curious like any\nmemorable takeaways or lessons learned\nworth sharing from being at Epic during\nthis time. Yeah, look, it was a it was a\nfascinating time to be there. Obviously,\npart of that was was the COVID the COVID\nperiod and a lot of the COVID boom\nwithin the games industry and being\nthere then and then seeing that chart\nthrough through the correction that\nwe've seen over over the last 18 months\nor so. But there was a couple of things\nthat were real standouts for me. And one\nwas, specifically within Fortnite, just\nseeing how different IP could merge and\nlive in in a persistent place together\nat the same time. That was for me was\nsomething truly unique in the industry\nwhere IP had historically been very\nsiloed. And so it was really fascinating\nto see how that could all interact and\nworking with those IP owners to be able\nto get them to a place of comfort where\nyou're able to have all of those things\nhappening once. So I think that was one\nof them. And then you you touched on the\nother one of UFN and and user generated\ncontent and the explosion that we've seen\nthere whether it be with Roblox or or\nUEFN or other platforms that are there\nas well. this idea that almost as we\ncreated more and more sophisticated\ntools for people to create games in\nparallel at this we've got an\nopportunity for anyone to create a game\nand anyone to create an experience and\nand that democratization of of creativity\nI think was something that's really\nfascinating and and I'm still really\ninterested to see how that goes and to\nsee what is the next huge breakout game\nthat we're all Yeah.\nRight. And we we talk a lot about UGC on\nthis this podcast as well. And I guess\nyou you're also involved in the\npublishing publishing deals like with\nRemedy and Alan Wake 2, which was one of\nmy favorite games of recent times. So\nSo thank you for for publishing that\none. But let's go ahead. Too scary for\nme. It it it does have some scary\nmoments. Those those jump scares are\nstill seared into my brain you know, a\nyear or two later. But, anyways, really\nawesome game, but let's let's go ahead\nand zoom to the present. And I I teased\nit at the beginning, but, can you tell\nus more about the Esports World Cup\nFoundation and what you are up to as its\nCOO, and then we'll we'll dig much deeper\ninto everything going on with esports\nand the Esports World Cup. Yeah,\nabsolutely. The foundation that we're all\npart of here and and is a nonprofit and\nand really part of of one of the many\nstrategies in in the kingdom that are\nreally pushing towards the growth of the\ngrowth of gaming esports and and all of\nthe the elements within that. For us\nwithin the foundation, we're really\nfocused on on the Esports World Cup and\nand we have a few objectives there\nreally uniting the esports communities\nand the gaming communities for a the\nbiggest competition in the world. So\nreally focused towards creating that\nesports world cup champion. It's a\ntruly unique event because it's it's\nclub-based and so we have a huge number\nof clubs who are who are joining that.\nWe had our inaugural event last year and\nthere was a huge success with that first\nevent and we're just in the in the final\nphases of putting the finishing touches\nto EWC 2025\nwhich is in July. It's coming up pretty\nsoon. That's right. July 6th. Yep. Oh\nman. Kickoff July 6th. Yeah. Well,\nthat'll be exciting. And so let's get\nwe'll get back to the the nitty-gritty\ndetails of the Esports World Cup in a\nmoment, but I want to zoom out a little\nbit first to get your thoughts about the\nglobal state of esports as a a backdrop\nof this conversation first. So at least\nin the west, esports has been going\nthrough a challenging reset over the\npast 2 or 3 years. Let's let's call it.\nMany team organizations and leagues\nraised too much capital and you know\nthey've had to deal with the\nrepercussions of that whether it's\nrestructuring making some type of big\nchanges some have even shut down and I\nknow you're based out of Riyadh these\ndays but maybe starting with the west\nlike where do you see\nwesternbased esports going from here?\nYeah, look, a great question. And I\nthink to answer that, I probably zoom\nout a little bit first and and just look\nat honestly the gaming industry as a\nwhole. And so the the gaming industry as\na whole over the last couple of decades,\nwe've seen a continual upward trend.\nYes, there's been a couple of little\ncorrections, but if we ultimately look\nat it, then we see ultimately an an\nupward trend. And we honestly feel the\nsame for esports. Esports has had some\ncorrections definitely, but we think that\nthere's there's a significant amount of\nuntapped opportunity when it comes to\nthe growth of esports and I think esports\nhas really satisfied the the endemic need\nfor competition and and the passion that\nis within that audience. But for us, we\nsee the biggest opportunity in actually\ntaking the fun of competition, some of\nthe incredible stories that exist within\nthe players, the communities, and the\nclubs, and really evolving that and\nconnecting people. And so for us, when\nwe look out, if we look in the next five\nplus years, we see definitely growth\nthere in the west, but also worldwide as\nwell. And I think if you look around the\nworld, you start to see some of those\nsome of those leading indicators which\nare really demonstrating what I think is\ngoing to be a pathway for the west. And\nwe've seen this so many times within the\ngaming industry where it doesn't those\ninitiatives don't necessarily start in\nthe west. They have often started in the\neast and then find their way to the west\nin an in an evolved state. whether it be\nthe advent of free-to-play gaming or a\nwhole host of other things that have\nkind of started in in different parts of\nthe world. Sure. So, I guess we can we\ncan talk about the global piece a little\nbit cuz I mean, as you as you mentioned,\nand it's totally true, esports is very\nmuch a a global business and how it\nworks in different parts of the world.\n\n\nThis is just different, I guess.\nUm, and uh, I'm curious, like, as you've ramped up in this industry, like, what have you learned about how esports differs, um, as a business or anything else, you know, in other parts of the world, like Asia and the Middle East, that maybe can uh, like, pave a new path or, you know, show the West that has struggled, you know, a better or newer way of doing things?\nSure.\nI look from an Asia perspective, I'd probably point to China, um, and see what we've, what we've seen from a growth within competitive esports there, and honestly, everything around it, uh, in China has been a huge, huge development.\nAnd for us, as the Esports World Cup, we've seen incredible success from a viewership, from an engagement standpoint in China as well.\nI think some of the, um, some of the things that have particularly surprised me, um, and give me a lot of hope and anticipation for the future, is uh, going and seeing some of the events in China and being part of those events.\nI was at a Honor of Kings event recently, and the clubs there are on a different level when it comes to the support that they have.\nAnd what was fascinating for me were uh, seeing the passion of those fans traveling across the country to see their club compete on the big stage.\nAnd it was very much like what I've seen with football and seeing fans follow their football or their soccer team from city to city to be able to experience that.\nAnd so that level of fandom is unique.\nAlso, when I look at the diversity of those fans and seeing the gender split as well, and seeing in many cases more women following those clubs than men, um, is also uh, really, really fascinating for me.\nSo I think when I look at that and I see uh, the opportunities for the clubs to build out their rosters, which we're obviously uh, we want to support them, and that's one of the pivotal elements of the Esports World Cup is to have multiple rosters, um, to be able to compete, and we only see that increasing, which is uh, which is fantastic.\nAnd then if we talk about the Middle East and seeing um, the growth here in Saudi Arabia, the growth of esports and the gaming industry as a whole, um, that's also really, really interesting and seeing some of the big clubs uh, locally, whether it be Falcons or Twisted Minds or Power, like the big, the big three clubs that we have here, we're obviously seeing a lot of investment in other clubs being created as well.\nSo I think that as we see that growth and as we see the number of people who are not just playing games, but also want to compete, um, it's really fascinating.\nAnd between those two markets, I think the other thing that I've seen that's changed is really the perception of being, um, being an esports athlete and seeing the recognition, and it's an okay job to do, and actually people are encouraging, uh, if you have the ability to take part and play competitively, whereas when I was younger, that probably wasn't the case.\nUm, and I love that there's now a recognition that these players have incredible skill.\nWell, they're training like athletes in any other sport, and they have an incredible career opportunity, whether it be playing or casting or creating other career paths within the industry, right?\nUm, yeah, I guess when I look at this, I mean, there obviously is a lot to learn from all sides around the world, but I mean, just I guess to make like an east-west comparison, it definitely does seem like the East, they have, uh, like, culture advantages and scale advantages that are just hard to replicate.\nAnd so some of it just kind of is what it is.\nBut I mean, with uh, how your company is positioning itself and even um, much of the Saudi Arabian investments generally, it's interesting to see um, like a focus on, on one hand, consolidation of, like, you know, pulling together a better business by bringing events and stuff together under one hood.\nBut also when you do that, um, such as with the Esports World Cup, you're, um, you're like one location for all of the world to come together, um, under one roof, one big event.\nUm, and so I'm curious, I guess, just connecting this to, um, like, why Saudi Arabia is betting so big on esports, like, um, as I mentioned, like, much in the West has suffered.\nThe East has a like a massive scale from, you know, just like a big population that is interested in esports.\nWhy, why exactly is Saudi Arabia betting so big on esports?\nLike, what does it see from its vantage point, and like, like, what is that opportunity?\nYeah, there's, there's a couple of pieces there.\nUm, a couple of stats.\nUh, 70, close to 70% of the population are under 35, and of that population, 7, you know, close to 70% of that population identify themselves as gamers, um, which is, which is there.\nSo there's a passion, there's an inbuilt passion in the community here that people love games.\nAnd I experience this on a day-to-day basis when in everything you do in life, and people you meet, people are playing games, and they have played games their entire lives, and now they're playing games with their kids and so on and so it will continue.\nSo this isn't, this isn't an anomaly.\nThis is something that you have an entire country who predominantly identify themselves as gamers.\nI think coupled with that, you have from a government standpoint and from a leadership standpoint, um, there's a recognition that let's connect passion with investment.\nLet's connect passion with opening up an element and a large portion of IG against the games industry because it's always great to do something you love.\nAnd so that kind of fostered as part of Vision 2030, uh, the creation of the National Gaming and Esports Strategy.\nAnd that has a whole host of goals, whether it be uh, jobs-focused goals of 39,000, um, jobs by 2030 or 50 billion contribution of GDP, but it's within 13 different sectors, of which esports is one, of which the one that we're involved with directly, but it covers every other sector of the industry as well, whether it be uh, from a development standpoint, from a support, from ultimately running events as well and content creation.\nSo it's really an investment across the board.\nAnd as a result of that, there's organizations such as ourselves who are running uh, running events, but then you have uh, the likes of EFG who are running events globally, um, or Savvy who are investing directly in game studios like Scopely and many others as well.\nSo it really kind of hooks back to that national strategy, and there's, to my knowledge, there's no other countries in the world that have actually put it down and said, yeah, we are going to focus on this, this is a national strategy, and we are going to invest and resource this in such a way that it can be successful and compete on a global stage, right?\nThe government backing is very unique, especially with the scale that it's operating at.\nSo uh, I mean, I've been interested in following um, you know, Saudi Arabia's moves in esports and broader gaming over the past few years, and I imagine we have many, many more years of watching all of these investments unfold and continue to evolve, which will be really interesting to see.\nOne last uh, bigger picture question for you before we dive more specifically into um, your business, which is how do you think the next decade of esports will look differently from the past decade?\nWhere are we going with all of this?\nSo, I think we're going to, if I look, yeah, it's always fun 10 years out.\nI look, I think that the core DNA of competition, people love competing against other people.\nThis has been there since we started walking around this planet, whether we're running faster or we're throwing something further, whatever it, we would be competition, it is wired within us, and so competition will continue.\nI think the content that we compete with, I hope that we evolve and we have more genres that we're competing in, and there's new and exciting games that we have to master, so that would be one.\nI think that's more of a wish rather than necessarily a pathway.\nThe other thing that I think is going to change within the next 10 years is something that I think we've been waiting for for a while, and we've kind of, we've hoped it was going to happen, and it hasn't necessarily happened on its own organically, and that's really the move of competitive esports into a more mainstream audience.\nAnd I know I've tried this in the past, and it hasn't been successful.\nBut I think that we've learned now, and we've seen, and we've seen other sports who have been able to open the aperture.\nThey've been able to look at the cues from, honestly, from the gaming industry and from entertainment and from other sports and be able to build that path to a much more mainstream audience.\nSo for me, I think that is probably going to be the biggest delta, and that's something that we are absolutely committed to and really investing in and experimenting because, you know, not everything will be perfect and work first time, but we feel that that is critical for the success and the growth for us over the course of the next 10 years.\nAnd then to reinforce that, you've got the likes of not just what we can create within the event that we're doing at the moment and what the publishers are looking to do and what we do within entertainment, but is that other institutions like the IOC are now recognizing that um, competitive gaming is something that they want to be involved with too.\nSo the idea of the Olympic Esports Games is something that obviously we're working very closely with them on as well.\nGotcha.\nUm, maybe you could talk about that a moment.\nI actually don't know much about the Olympic Esports Games.\nWhat is the latest on that, or how is that working?\nWhat should we expect from the Olympic Esports Games?\nSo we're working on that in the process, or we're in the process of working on that with the IOC at the moment.\nAnd really, it's a pathway to really open the aperture of esports is exactly what I was saying.\nAnd the idea there is that we take some amazing games that people are playing, and we're able to bring that sense of competition in a slightly different way.\nSo obviously it won't be club-based like the other esports tournaments that we generally operate.\nIt's going to be nation-based.\nAnd so we think that there's an incredible opportunity for nation-based gameplay again to open the aperture.\nUm, if you think about the Olympics, and when you're watching the Olympics, I don't know about you, but there's certain sports that I will sit and watch during the Olympics purely because there is somebody British competing in that, and I don't understand necessarily everything about that particular sport, but I will cheer that person on.\nAnd so we see that as being another avenue for us to bring nation-based esports into the ecosystem where it, whilst it's existed, it hasn't necessarily broken through, and the tier one athletes haven't necessarily been competing in those environments.\nSo we're working on it with the IOC at the moment.\nUm, we're incredibly excited to continue that partnership with them, and we, as a founding partner in that OBG, is something that obviously we're very committed to.\nYeah, that's really interesting.\nBut, okay, let's go ahead and dig more into the details of the Esports World Cup.\nUm, first of all, can you maybe just break down in more detail what all happens at the Esports World Cup, which, as we mentioned earlier, begins in a month or so?\nUh, like, what makes it such a notable spectacle compared to any other esports events out there?\nI think, I think though there's a few things.\nSo for us, um, bringing the best games is critical, and you mentioned this earlier, the idea that we bring multiple titles from the biggest publishers in the world and put them under one roof.\nLast year, the team operated over eight weeks, um, with 21 different games, 22 tournaments that we operated.\nThis year, we'll be doing 24 games with 25 tournaments over seven weeks because we don't like to make it easy for ourselves.\nWe want to compress it a little bit.\nUm, but that, that first one, want to bring in the best games that people are playing from around the world.\nAnd so we have great representation of games that are huge in the West, um, some that are huge in the East, some that have just got global appeal as well.\nSo we can really bring uh, all of those incredible IPs together.\nUm, the second is the fact that Sure.\nCan you name some of those big games just to get so people have some context, like, what are the big ones?\nAbsolutely.\nSo League of Legends, Valorant, EFC.\nWe'll be bringing Crossfire this year, which is a new title.\nUm, we'll also be bringing chess this year, which is a new title.\nUm, but we have a whole host of what would be considered traditional esports games like Starcraft and uh, Dota, but then also bringing new games that we feel are an opportunity for us to open the aperture.\nAnd then when we look at Asia and we see games like Honor of Kings and MLBB being huge, uh, having huge resonance in China and Southeast Asia as well.\nSo really, we want to have everything from VR to MOBA's, we've got sports games, we've got strategy.\nUm, so we feel like we've got a really good mix.\nAnd then in addition to that kind of club competition, so we've got those huge games.\nWe've invited, and we'll have over 200 clubs competing as part of the tournaments.\nAnd the concept is really interesting because each club can have multiple rosters and compete in as many different games as they want if they qualify.\nUm, and ultimately, whoever is able to amass the most points from all of those different tournaments that they compete in will ultimately be crowned the Esports World Cup champion.\nUm, and so that's the pathway.\nSo huge games, the best players.\nWe have an incredible prize pool that we will be bringing.\nLast year it was just over 60 million US.\nUh, this year it'll be over 70 million, um, that will be provided to players, to clubs, um, all the way across that ecosystem, really, with the objective of supporting the growth and the stability of the gaming ecosystem in the community.\nYeah.\nUm, first of all, I think it's cool that you're working with so many different games, like, like pulling games together across publishers, across leagues, you know, all in one spot.\nLike that strikes me as, you know, a big deal.\nUm, and then second, just a follow-up to this.\nUm, could you maybe share, like, I, I assume, you know, you're pulling all of these people together, bringing them to Saudi Arabia to compete, like, like, what does the event on the ground look and feel like?\nMaybe you can even just share um, some details about last year's event.\nUm, like, for those going or those interested, what is, what is that like?\nThere's a lot of logistics.\nSo we had\n\n\nWe had over 1,500 players from 100 countries last year. So there's a lot of logistics on the back end, but once we tried to make it as seamless for people to get here, whether they be a fan or whether they be an athlete. So we're trying to create pathways. Um, and for us, on-ground participation is something critical. So we obviously care massively about the viewership, and we want to be able to broadcast and share this worldwide. And we had over 500 million people watch the Esports World Cup last year and 250 million hours watched across all of our platforms and distribution streams. But the other element is people being here. And we had over two and a half million people cycle through all of our venues over the course of the eight weeks last year. And it's a combination of a couple of major things. One is the Esports World Cup, the competitive esports across all of those different games. And the second is the festival. So we have a huge festival which is running in parallel with the competitive element, the club championship, where people can celebrate gaming, everything that is gaming, whether it be actually taking part in a community tournament or play tests or seeing their favorite IPs and understanding and learning more. There's a whole host of different elements that we have there. A lot of experiential gaming opportunities that people love playing, but we want to level up the play. And so, because we have that amazing platform for multiple weeks, we're able to really create some compelling and really, really fun activities for people to come as a family and really engage with it. And so that's the focus for us is building that festival in parallel with the club championship. And this year we're really focused on creating weekly themes around the IP that will be happening in any given week. There may be a sports focus or a mobile focus, but the idea is to create multiple opportunities for people, whether they be in a region or locally or traveling internationally, to come for multiple opportunities to see, experience, and engage with a whole host of these different opportunities. Yeah. Wow. I mean, that sounds exciting. Hopefully, I can check it out one day myself. You're welcome. You're welcome. I mean, it sounds really fun. Uh, but also I can't imagine, just putting my business hat on, I can't imagine how much organization goes into making a big event like this happen every year. And as COO, I bet you're involved in countless logistical details here. Um, so I think what could be interesting is just for you to peel back the curtain a bit and share some of what goes into making this event happen operationally. Like what are some of the crazy things that it takes to bring this all to life?\nYeah. Well, we touched a little bit on logistics, and there's a couple here. One, we are incredibly lucky that we have incredible support from basically the rest of the kingdom. Um, our partners, government stakeholders, everybody kind of pulls together. So, I'll be honest, it's a real team effort, and that makes it a whole lot easier. Uh, because it takes what may be red tape in other parts of the world away, and really everybody is has a concerted effort against the goal, which is making this as big and as fun and as engaging and as seamless and easy for people to enjoy as possible. So, that's the good bit. That's the, like, we're all in this together fun bit. The challenging bit is just the sheer scale and the duration, and it's a long event. Um, when you look at other multisport, multi-week events, they don't last seven or eight weeks. The Olympics does not last that long. So for us to be able to build that capability and build the flexibility for us to be able to cycle things in and out, whether it be the games that are being played or those festival activations that are tied to a specific thing, we need to be really agile, and we need to be really nimble in the way that we think about these things and create them. And then the last piece for me is honestly the jigsaw puzzle of pulling it all together. Uh, we wouldn't be here if it weren't for the publishers. Uh, we wouldn't be able to do this if it weren't for the amazing games, the amazing clubs, um, that come here and compete. And so basically playing that jigsaw puzzle of being able to make sure that what we do is additive to the ecosystem is critical. So every game that is taking part in the Esports World Cup already has their own calendar. They already have their own competitive calendar, and we have to find a way to fit ourselves in where this doesn't impact, doesn't detract from what they're doing, but is always additive. So, I spend a lot of my time on all three of those pieces, on navigating and making the connections, on being able to support the logistics of getting all of these things to fit together. Um, but ultimately making sure that we keep an eye on really on the fans, the clubs, and the publishers and just making sure that what we're doing and have that constant check and balance, like, is this helping? Is this a good thing? Is this making it better? Whether it be from a fan experience or from a publisher to open up a new market or open up a new audience for them. So, yeah, it look, I'll be honest, keeps me out of mischief. Uh, keeps me busy. Um, but it's look, it's amazing, and I've loved every minute of it, and I think it's a unique moment and a unique opportunity. So, yeah, it is has its challenges, but I very much love it. Well, that's awesome. And are you guys in partnership or interface with ESL Face It at all, which is obviously part of Savvy? Uh, I'm just curious, like, how that might connect for you guys since you're both backed by Saudi Arabia. Yeah, EFG are one of our key partners, one of the partners that helped bring it to life. Um, the scale of the operation and the scale of the tournament is so huge that we can't just have one partner. So we have many partners, and EFG are one of our integral part partners. They helped us last year with the inaugural EWC, and they're helping us again this year. And so, yeah, we start, we start planning, well, I'll be honest, we've already started planning 2026, I bet. So we have to keep one eye, one eye, one eye here, and definitely we're already starting to look one eye, uh, one eye in the future. Yeah, I saw you guys are at least confirmed through 2027, I think I read on the website somewhere. But um, that's awesome, and obviously just to hit on Saudi Arabia maybe one last time here. Um, the country has made big financial bets across, um, you know, many sports at this point, and you know, from my perspective, it sort of seems like your $70 million prize pool echoes similar aspirations. Um, I'm curious, is there any truth to that observation? Like, is the Esports World Cup aiming to grow the esports market and capture market share in a similar way that these other Saudi-backed sports leagues have attempted to, um, or am I just making incorrect assumptions there? Yeah, look, this isn't a market share play. Um, this is not something that that is the focus. The focus for us as the Esports World Cup Foundation, as a nonprofit, is really in support of the ecosystem. And so for us, we see ourselves very much as a catalyst for growth and for sustainability across the whole ecosystem. And this is supporting, and that's why that prize pool is not, it's not exclusively player-focused or club-focused. It's supporting the full ecosystem, and then we're building that in partnership with the publishers. So that's where almost a little bit what I was getting at before of just making sure that what we do is additive and what we do is being able to support and help the growth. And I guess another example of that is the club program because we know that, and you mentioned this earlier, that we've seen, we've seen a lot of investment in clubs. We saw corrections. Some people that struggled, and we see that, and we see that the best way for clubs to be sustainable long term is by having diversity in the IPs that they're supporting, that their games go up and down, um, teams are successful, and sometimes they're not. So being able to have more rosters across more games helps build that long-term sustainability for them. And for us, the club program, we support, this year, we're supporting 40 clubs through that club program where we invest in those clubs directly to help them build rosters, to help them really build that solid foundation that is a sustainable foundation that they can grow from, rather than being a huge investment. They build out, and then they've got a burn rate, which is just not sustainable. And so for us, we see this as much more than a market share play. This is an ecosystem play. And we are passionate, like I would pretty much all of my career in gaming. We love games, and we love building out the capability so more people can not just enjoy them and play them, but make a career in engaging within the industry. Right. Um, could you tell me a bit more about the nonprofit elements of this? Um, as you mentioned, the foundation reinvests the proceeds from the event back into the sector, um, advocating for the esports industry. Um, can you tell me more about what that means? Like, why is this structured as a nonprofit, and can you tell me more about what you are reinvesting into? And you mentioned, like, how some of the prize pool goes beyond the players and teams, like, where else does it go? Just talking about this in a bit more detail would be really interesting.\nYeah, for sure. And as a foundation, our goals are not financial. Our, honestly, our KPIs are building the ecosystem, building viewership, building, um, building the number of visitors that we have coming into the kingdom here. And so we really are building towards a self-sustaining model. And so we obviously have support from the government to help us build, but we also work with a whole host of commercial partners in through sponsorship and through other mechanics that we've seen within the industry as well. And so when we're focused as that, there's a couple of things. So, one, yes, profit is not a priority, but it also positions us that we're not, we're not actively trying to make a profit, and therefore the partnership with the publishers is a collaborative one as well, that they're not necessarily thinking that, okay, this is a margin play because it's absolutely not. It's about building that foundation, and from our, you know, whether it be the IP-agnostic nature of what we're creating, it's just not about profit. And so the prize pool, yeah, it's one part of it, um, that we're investing into the success of the tournament all the way through the qualification, um, to the clubs themselves, to the individual players, to bounties and other things that we can really see that to sustain that operation. I mentioned the club program as well that is unique from that perspective as well, and that's something that we will, we started last year. We'll continue to invest in that. We've scaled it up this year as well, and as I say, we have 40 clubs that are up from 30 last year, and we've got up to a million dollars of funding coming to those clubs during the course of this cycle. Yeah. And so really we're, we look at it along that way. Um, we have obviously, as I say, really great support from the government as well, who are invested, and as part of that national gaming and esports strategy, we see investment coming from there as well. Cool. Um, and I guess one final question on this before we begin to wrap up. Um, tell me about the future. Like, what do you envision for the future of the Esports World Cup? Like, what does long-term success look like? What does improvement look like? You just talked about some of the goals and aspirations and maybe some of the metrics that matter, but maybe you can unpack what you aspire for and the future a bit more.\nYeah, it's easy to say it's about being bigger or better, but it look, it's a lot more than just scale for us. Um, we want to be much, much more efficient in the way that we're actually operating, and we're able to be a lot smarter in the way that we do things. So, we make sure that they're as impactful and meaningful as they can possibly be. But there's a couple of different areas when I look at improvement. And the first one is really probably around structure and access in the way that we're, we really want to be able to bring more people into the event. And we're doing that through the creation of pathways through different qualification pathways around the world to be able to have more clubs, more players from diverse backgrounds being part of that. Um, and building connection with the creator community as well so we could have more people come and experience the event firsthand for themselves as well. Uh, the festival, we launched with a festival last year. We are doubling down with that this year, bringing a lot more structure to that as well. I mentioned the themes based on a weekly basis of being able to switch and evolve those themes over the course of the seven weeks of competition. Uh, but really for us, we see that as a massive opportunity for us to really create a celebration of gaming. Um, we've been to, I'm sure you and I have been to so many game shows around the world and have experienced different things in different parts of the world, and we're trying to bring as many of those different elements into one place so people can really celebrate that convergence of entertainment. We've got, whether it be through music or gaming, pop culture, everything that we've got coming there as well. So, that one is really an opportunity for us to open the aperture and really have a family-friendly event that everybody can come to. And the last piece is really around more connectivity and really connecting people in the way that makes sense for them. And so when we're building the experiences, we've, we obviously have a core esports audience, and we know how they consume esports and what they want to do, but we really want to open the aperture on that. Um, we really want to create much more of a mainstream experience that we can have people enjoy competitive esports and the tournaments that haven't necessarily engaged with that. And so a lot of that is going to be on the broadcast products that we create, the way\n\n\nthat we position it, the way that we package it. Um, and to create those moments like the incredible opening and closing ceremonies to be able to bring people to an event and have them experience it in a way that they've never experienced it before.\n\nAwesome. Well, I really look forward to seeing where you all take this. And as I mentioned earlier, I hope I can check it out in person sooner than later. But I have three quick final questions for you before we wrap. Um, first one being just what are you personally most looking forward to? Like do you have a favorite event that you're looking forward to attending or bringing to life this year?\n\nUm, I look I I love Battle Royale. So, um, I'm going to be particularly excited to see some of those games and the scale of those as well. But look, I'm I was lucky enough to be part of some of the Esports World Cup last year and honestly just seeing the passion. I'm most excited about seeing people with smiling faces and people running to get in and to see and really soak up that excitement. And so yeah, that's that's for me it makes it all worthwhile for the team when they see that and makes all of the late nights and the hard work and the missed weekends worth it when you just see the passion and see the celebrations and see how much it means to people as well when they win these tournaments and hear some of the personal stories. And we just announced yesterday a documentary that we're releasing on Pride Video. And so we're starting to try to find more ways that we could share some of those incredibly personal stories for people so that more of us can connect and really understand how much of a difference or how how tough it is sometimes, but also how much of a difference some of these opportunities make.\n\nAmazing. Um, and then I mean obviously we talked all about esports today. You're completely dialed in on esports day today, but what else in the games industry are you excited about these days? Uh, like when you look around, what what piques your interest?\n\nLook, I I love playing new games and I love seeing where the creativity is going. So, I think what excites me about the game industry at the moment is seeing some of the great content that's coming out in the months ahead. And I think that for me is the most exciting thing and seeing how we're seeing this evolution and seeing the evolution of gameplay. Uh, I really hope that we continue to see new IPs. I really hope that we continue to see new gameplay mechanics coming as well. And I really I really hope that you know as we've seen the advent of UGC as we start to see some really material um highly engaging games within that UGC world actually break through and start to jump out. And so there's look there's a lot to be excited about. There's more people playing every year with this is a one of the few trends in the world where it's going upwards and to the right consistently because every day there's more people playing games and that will continue to be the case because we know that the new generation who are who are joining us and going to be coming up like games are are integral to their entertainment and their social life. So, um, yeah, I there's there's a lot there's a lot to be excited about. Um, and, uh, it's going to be great to be part of that journey.\n\nTotally. And I think some of these UGC games popping off is is already happening. We I think like as we're speaking right now, there's like a gardening game on on Roblox that's been like hitting I want to say like 8 to 9 million CCUs. like it's it's just absurd what some of these games that, you know, a lot of people haven't even ever heard of or will never hear of are doing. And that's, you know, it's still early days in so many ways. But, uh, final question for you. Um, if anyone would like to reach out to yourself or your organization, and we have a bunch of listeners that are leaders of their own companies all across the games industry. Um, where should they go? How should they best reach out?\n\nUm, LinkedIn's probably the easiest either. Um, feel free to reach out to me personally or or definitely the Esports World Cup Foundation page on LinkedIn. They're probably the easiest way to connect with me or part of the broader organization.\n\nAwesome. Well, let's go ahead and wrap up here. Mike, it's been a real pleasure um chatting with you today and learning all about your world of esports and best of luck with the big event in I guess a couple months from now.\n\nYeah, thank you. Thank you. It's going to be it's going to be a busy few weeks for us. Uh we yeah, we launch on July 6th and yeah, it's going to be an amazing seven weeks of of\n\nYeah, can't wait.
