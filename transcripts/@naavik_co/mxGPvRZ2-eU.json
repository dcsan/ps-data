Welcome to the Naavik Gaming\nPodcast. I'm your host, David Taylor.\nThe Call of Duty franchise needs no\nintroduction, but today we're speaking\nwith a leader who has been there since\nit launched in 2003. So, let's do a\nquick review. Call of Duty is the\nbestselling first-person shooter\nfranchise and the second bestselling\nvideo game franchise of all time after\nMario and ahead of Pok√©mon and Tetris.\nIt reportedly surpassed over 500 million\ncopies sold in 2023, over 30 billion in\nrevenue, and maintains a monthly active\nuser base of 100 million players.\nAccording to the Washington Post, over\nthe years, there's been three primary\nstudios working on it. Infinity Ward\ncreated the franchise in the seminal\nModern Warfare series. Treyarch\nestablished zombie modes in World at War\nand the popular Black Ops series, and\nSledgehammer Games joined later to\nco-develop titles starting in the 2010s.\nToday, we're going to dive into Call of\nDuty's amazing history through the lens\nof Treyarch. With that, I'm thrilled to\nbe joined by the former studio head of\nTreyarch, Dan Bunting, who is now the\nfounder of Ready UpUp Games and a\nventure partner at 1 a.m. Gaming. Dan,\nwelcome to the podcast. Thank you. Glad\nto be here. So, we're going to cover a\nlot of your career over the next hour,\nbut just to kick us off, could you give\nan introduction on your journey? How did\nyou get into the video game industry?\nAnd how did you find yourself at\nTreyarch back in 2003 when the Call of\nDuty franchise was just getting started?\nWell, how so how I got into games um was\na very meandering path, but um\neventually got there. Um you know, as a\nyoung kid, of course, I played games\nlike everybody in the 80s. Um Kid Icarus\nwas the first uh NES game that kind of\nlike got me addicted to really hard\ngames, which I've still I love hard\ngames to this day. Um, uh, Zelda, Mario,\nyou know, I played them all on my\n13-inch black and white TV in my bedroom\nwhen I was a kid. Um, and, uh, you know,\ngrowing up playing games, I never quite,\nyou know, I didn't think of it as a\ncareer or a thing that you could do. You\nknow, I I kind of grew up with a very\ntraditional sort of upbringing with, um,\nyou know, go to school, study hard, get\ngood grades, um, overperform, and then,\nyou know, find a good paying job. like I\nnever thought of games, you know. Um\nwhen I got to college, um that was when\nkind of in the in the mid 90s when the\nid Software explosion happened and I got\nvery hooked on first person shooters,\nQuake one, Quake 2. Uh I was really into\nthe mod community mod scene and I was,\nyou know, I would download and play\nevery mod uh that came out from uh from\nthe modders. Um, the Team Fortress, the\noriginal Team Fortress mod was became\nsort of my go-to game for like two years\nafter that. Um, and so, you know, from\nthat point forward, I was hooked on on\non games. I mean, for for my whole life,\nbut but shooters, um, specifically from\nkind of college on. Um, when I graduated\nin the late '90s, I had uh kind of done a\ntour around Europe, backpacking and\nsuch, trying to find myself and figure\nout what I wanted to do with with my\nlife. And I knew that I wanted to do\nsomething creative in uh what I would\nthink of as sort of like at that point\nin time a renaissance art like something\nthat's multi-disciplinary\num that involves art, storytelling,\nuh engineering, um history, you know,\neverything that you can imagine in terms\nof the arts coming together to tell\nstories. And so I decided I was either\ngoing to go to grad school for\narchitecture, I was going to get into\nfilm and TV, or I was going to get into\nvideo games. Those are my three paths. I\ndidn't set one in stone, but just kind\nof packed everything I I owned up into a\ncar, drove out to LA because LA was a\nplace that you could do all three of\nthose things. Um, and started my journey\nthere. Um first job I took was uh in at\nFX Networks doing um kind of part-time\nwork for a while and then got full-time\nthere. Um that became, you know, four\nyears of kind of learning how to be a\nprofessional, I guess. Um uh which was\nfun, but it wasn't my career uh\nambition. And you know, ultimately I I\nrealized to get serious about what I\nwanted to do with my life, I wanted to\nget into games. So I just started\npounding the pavement. Um it took me\nabout seven months from start to finish.\nUm every day I would keep a journal of\nwhoever whatever network connection I\nwould make. Um you know it I would talk\nto anybody and everybody and I didn't\ncare you know how executive level or\nhigh up they were. I just was I would\ncold call people. I would try to get\nwarm introductions whatever I could do.\nUm, and the funny thing is that of all\nof the uh connections I made over that\nseven months, it was actually the very\nfirst call that I made that led to the\njob 7 months later at Treyarch. Um, and\nso, you know, the rest is kind of\nhistory. That that was that was how I\ngot in. I mean, it was a long it was a\nlot of interviews. Um, at that point in\ntime, they were uh really focused on\nSpider-Man games. Um, and I originally\nhad interviewed with the Spider-Man\nproducer. Um but then he referred me to\nthis other project that was a new\nproject um which was called Dead Rush.\nAnd Dead Rush was an open world zombie\nsurvival horror game which uh had a lot\nof potential. It was a lot of fun. There\nwas really great um gameplay mechanics\nand features in it. Um but ultimately I\nthink the company determined it was too\nbig of a risk and they uh shut down the\ngame in 2004 which was you know a\nblessing for me because um I for was\nfortunate to be then put on the Call of\nDuty team in uh early 2004. So um and\nthat was right after the first game\nlaunched. So that was the beginning that\nthat kind of I guess walks you through\nmy journey. That's amazing. And I feel\nlike that zombie game is going to\nsomehow come back. uh later in the\nstory. Um, and I also love that, you\nknow, you mentioned that you're like\npassionate about history and, you know,\nthen you found yourself at Call of Duty.\nLike, it just sounds like this was meant\nto be. Definitely. It was a dream come\ntrue for sure. Yeah. That's awesome.\nOkay. So, so you're at you're at um\nTreyarch in 2004. Could you take us\nthrough your journey at Treyarch as\nwell? and and then we'll sort of dive\ninto like a bunch of questions about\nthose different time periods, but would\nlove to just understand your journey\ngoing through uh through through\nTreyarch. Yeah. Well, so I joined in\n2003. The very first project that I\nmentioned, Dead Rush, was a super small\nteam. I think we had like 15 developers.\nUm and it was, you know, it was it was\nlike scrappy startup land. I mean, you\ndidn't get it was a risky kind of new\nIP. you didn't have the same kind of,\nyou know, publishing backing that you\nwould have for a large, you know, proven\nfranchise or anything. So, in a lot of\nways, it was like an indie game, um,\nthat a startup would do. It was small,\nsmall team, um, very scrappy. We had to\nkind of, um, you know, figure out how to\nto do, do more with than, uh, other\nteams with less, you know. Um, but it\nwas a great great experience for me to\njust cut my teeth. Um, you know, my\nfirst one of my first jobs was just to\ngo around to every team member every day\nand kind of like figure out what was\ngoing on, what tasks they were working\non, what was their schedule like, which\nwas super intimidating cuz I didn't know\nanybody and I was new to the games\nindustry. So, I had to go, you know, be\nthis like nerdy little kid who's I think\nin their mind is probably just annoying.\nUm, but it was really it was an amazing\nfirst experience because it forced me\nnumber one to get out of my shell and\nand and talk to people. Number two, it\ntaught me what everybody on the team did\nand understanding workflows and tasks\nand how games are put together. Um, so I\nthink that, you know, the kind of the\nyear one of training wheels was actually\na really good way for me to to to start\nmy career because it it gave me a good\ncross-section of what everybody does and\nhow games are made. Um, so that was that\nwas a you know I'm thankful for that\nexperience and and I think that the fact\nthe game got canceled was a blessing in\ndisguise obviously for me. Were there\nany things that um sort of set you up to\nbe successful in that role from your\npast that you can sort of touch on like\nyou know you know being able to ask\npeople questions or you know the fact\nthat you had spent a lot of time on mods\nand sort of getting an understanding for\nhow the how games got made just as a\nplayer.\nI would say that um well there's a\nnumber of things. one, I kind of, you\nknow, one of my I guess, you know, if\neveryone everyone has their own\nsuperpowers, one of my superpowers is I\nI can I tend to spin a lot of plates.\nUm, and I think part of that's just kind\nof my background of, you know, I was a\nvery bookish kid. Um, very, you know,\nheavy on school work and and was able\nlike I try, you know, always try to push\nahead on things beyond my, you know,\ncomfort zone. Um, I waited tables in\ncollege. That was another one that\nforced me to like multitask and just\nlike deal with stuff um deal with\nstress. Um and then in the TV role that\nI had, it was a production role. So it\nwas a lot of coordination across a lot\nof different people, a lot of\ndepartments um into in internal and\nexternal. You know, I was talking to,\nyou know, big producers of TV shows and\nI was t up to, you know, vendors who\nwould drive, you know, tapes from one\nplace to another. Um, so it was just I\nthink like you know all of that kind of\nmultitasking prioritization\num missiondriven kind of emphasis is\nwhat really helped me establish that\nstrong foundation. That's awesome. Okay,\nso we got a lot of ground to cover\nbetween uh you as sort of the the person\ngoing around just checking in on what\neverybody's working on to co-studio\nhead. So what was sort of like your\nprogression from there? like what were\nthe opportunities that came up and I\nknow that the franchise just kept\ngrowing but how did how did you you know\nmove through the ranks and and become\nthe studio head\num you know wow that's a long one um it\nis it is a very you know any any career\npath is going to be a very um long and\nand kind of meandering journey um I\nthink that on the first project the\nexecutive producer of that project had\ntaken a particular interest in me\nbecause I was such a hustler and like\njust trying like just trying to get\neverything done to the best quality as\nmuch as I possibly could and just and\njust like overloading myself with work.\nUm, and I think that really helped me\nthat was probably the the main reason\nwhy I was put on the Call of Duty team\nin the first place cuz it was, you know,\nit wasn't like everybody just got moved\nover. they did handpick a select number\nof people. Um and um I think that\nyou know from there it was you know it\nwas just like I would do anything. I\nwould order food. I would you know I\nthink I you know on that first project I\ngot um my first two employees quote\nunquote which were like um the the only\nQA testers internal QA testers on the\nproject. um one of whom I brought onto\nthe team and is now you know an art\ndirector uh on the weapons and vehicles\nteam which is amazing um and I'm you\nknow I love him and that you know that\nwas part of like that was also part of\nmy career journey was I would always\nbring people up that I what I identified\ntalent bring people into the development\nteam and and give them a safe place to\ngrow and learn and kind of shape the\nculture alongside the rest of the team\num and uh you know So that that next\nproject was uh Call of Duty United\nOffensive, which was branded as an\nexpansion pack after the first Call of\nDuty launched, but it was a really a\nfull game. Um uh we had joined with the\nteam at Grey Matter, which was a smaller\num PC dev shop. They had also just had a\nproject canceled. Um, and so we kind of\nwe brought together the PC first person\nshooter like hardcore gamer chops of\ngray matter into the console, you know,\nmass market expertise of Treyarch at the\ntime. I was much more of a, you know,\ngray matter type of person because of\ncoming out of the, you know, the Quake\ncommunity and and and mods and being\nsuper hardcore into first-person\nshooters. Um, so that I like when I\nmoved over to the gray matter building\nthat was like that was the really the\nbeginning for me because I just kind of\njelled with that team there and and a\nlot of those team members are still\ncurrently the like the director level of\nuh Treyarch today. So it did eventually,\nyou know, Call of Duty took over as it\nhas done within the larger Activision\nfamily.\nAmazing. So sounds like, you know, you\njust, you know, was a I think you were\nthere for 18 years and just over the\nyears more more opportunity, more\nsuccess, and you just sort of kept kept\ngetting more responsibility.\nYeah. And it's I mean, you know, a part\nof it is just\n\n\nThe under promise, over deliver, you know, always trying to just do the best that you possibly can. Um, I tend to be a very mission-focused person. So, it's like whatever that thing is, whatever the right thing to do for that project is and that team is, is where my, uh, you know, my north star is going to be. And so, I'm just always pushing to make things better. Um, and it's, you know, a personal life goal to always leave things better than I found them. So, um, that, you know, that kind of motivation, I think, drove, drove me and propelled my career. You know, those first three projects we worked on, each one was done in under a year. So, you know, 2004, 2005, 2006, uh, we shipped games, and, um, it was a brutal slog. I mean, anybody who makes games, especially at that scale, can understand how, um, you know, especially a multiplatform, global, you know, fully localized, simultaneous launch, how, how challenging that can be. Um,\n\nand then, you know, by the time we got to *World at War*, um, that was a big turning point for us as a as a team at Treyarch because we were no longer sort of just cranking out like, you know, these second games that are, you know, um, behind or underneath one of the Infinity Ward games, but we were now making, you know, a proper standalone two-year development where we actually for the first time got to utilize the same tools that the Infinity Word team had been using, the same tech. Um, and so I think *World at War* really was where the expression of, uh, Treyarch first came out. Um, it was like, you know, that was our identity. That was our, uh, that was kind of who we were. And, um, it was dark, you know, it was edgy. It pushed boundaries. It made people uncomfortable. Um, yeah. It was like the first game that had dismemberment, I think. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.\n\nAnd you know, and player cho like some some player narrative choices in the in the mix. Um, which became a theme as as time went by. Um, and you know, we also as a as a team at Treyarch, you know, also part of our identity was that we um felt like we're underdogs. We felt like we had something to prove. We kind of had a chip on our shoulder. So, we sort of overextended ourselves on our ambitions. Um, *World at War*, we got two years to make that game. We're like, \"Hey, let's go make a co-op campaign, you know, like not smart, but you know, that was that was kind of where our head was at.\" And, um, so we built that game, you know, for co-op. And you know that that that required us to basically take the engine apart and put all the parts, you know, on the, uh, you know, on the garage floor and then put them back together with networking, um, which was no small feat and it also took a long time. So, our first two-year development was actually ended up being basically another one-year development, um, because, uh, so much of the work that went on without having, uh, co-op campaign, you know, ended up getting thrown away. Um, but, uh, once, once the, once the co-op stuff had come together and we were and the missions were starting to, you know, get fleshed out better, I think we kind of realized, you know, co-op in a very bespoke roller coaster ride, Michael Bay AAA blockbuster campaign kind of doesn't work. You know, it's like it's very hard to, to, uh, you know, custom tailor an exciting cinematic roller coaster ride experience for four players, you know. Um,\n\nand, uh, so that was that was something that we learned a little bit later in law in the development process, which ultimately led to the reason that Zombies existed was the need to have a smaller, replayable, uh, co-op mode you could play with your friends that actually was at the heart of what co-op gameplay was about. Wow. And so I'm not answering your questions at all. I'm just kind of talking. No, no, this is Sorry. I'm glad you, I'm glad you brought up zombie mode. I was, uh, when I was in college, I played zombie mode with my, my soccer teammates, uh, over and over again, seeing how far we could progress through, through the levels. Uh, how many, I think I'm trying to remember the name of the guns. There's like the, the one-off.\n\nYeah, the, Yeah, the, I mean, the ray gun's the one just like stayed. That was, that was, um, that was one of those guns that was, you know, it was kind of kitschy, retro 50s style sci-fi, but very much fit the era. And, um, you know, I don't, there was not really a, a strong narrative thread or universe around Zombies when it first came out. That was the thing that sort of came together with, you know, it, the, the mode itself had only existed because individuals from every department just put in extra work to make it happen. Um, and so all of those sort of individual contributions that came together helped to shape what the identity of Zombies was. And then as time went by, as more content was released, you saw this, um, the, the community reactions to all of those little pieces and they started forming their own narratives, their own hypotheses, and there was a very conspiratorial kind of thread to all the community, you know, talk about it. Um, and which we loved. But I mean, like, as, as developers are, you know, especially a few members of our team were really, really, really into that, um, kind of MK Ultra sort of vibe stuff and and seeing where the community was going with it and then started playing with the community and adding, like, it was, it was this feedback loop. They would come up with conspiracy theories. We'd say, \"Well, that looks like a fun one to play with. Let's bring.\" So we' we'd feed into that conspiracy theory for the next one. And it kind of went on like that through the, through the four DLC releases of *World of War*. Um, until you got to Darice, the end, where, where I think a lot of fans, you know, really think about that as as a, uh, as a big change, like a big point for the solidification of, of that, uh, narrative universe.\n\nI'm, I'm curious about the, the like transition. Do you think that the reason why you guys came up with zombie mode was because you had worked on a game that was sort of similar, or was, are they completely detached and like there wasn't like a, \"Oh, you kind of already designed this before?\" It was completely detached. I know it seems very much like, \"Oh, that was a, you know, a good synthesis of an earlier game that Treyarch was working on,\" but, um, the developers, most of the developers who were building Zombies had actually come from Gray Matter, um, not all, but most. Um, and, um, so I think that that, uh, that that threat of what, uh, *Dead Rush* had been, there were a little bits that came into it because some of the engineers had worked on *Dead Rush* on the team. Um, but for the most part, it was really, I think, you know, the origin, I mean, it's been out, it's been talked about before, but the, the origin of, of the actual zombie part of it, inspiration had, had come out of a mocap session where they were doing motion capture for kind of walking wounded soldiers. Soldiers had just come or shell shocked. They'd just come out of an explosion. And so they, as they were hobbling around, they looked like zombies. The character models had, you know, were bloody and and dirty and, um, and, uh, they were hobbling like zombies. And that kind of, I think, started the, the foundation of, of that idea.\n\nIt's fascinating because when I think the reason why it resonated with me so much was because I had played *Return to Castle Wolfenstein* and so like the idea of Nazi Zombies was like already like there and I, it was like a op opportunity to like re-engage with, Yeah, with that concept. Um, and that Gray Matter team had had worked on, uh, *Return to Castle Wolfenstein* as well. Well, there you go. I knew there was a connection here. Yeah. Uh, cool. So, I think we should, let's keep going. Let's talk about *Black Ops* because that obviously has turned into, um, that sort of came out, came off of *World at War*. I'm curious, like, what were the, it was it was a, it was following *Modern Warfare*, uh, which had been this, you know, huge moment. I, I played that game for hundreds of hours. Um, and so you sort of, you, you talked about how like you guys were, were looking at Infinity Ward and it almost felt like at that point it was like, \"Oh, who's going to like, uh, make the, make the better game?\" *Black Ops* seemed to like go in a different direction, carve out its own identity, and that's sort of gone on to be its own, um, you know, subranchise. I'm curious to understand like what was that process like? How did, how did, um, *Black Ops* become such a distinct game from, from *Modern Warfare*? I think any, I mean, any group of developers going to bring their own sensibilities to the table. Um, especially in a, um, younger team like we were at the time. Um, because you know, you, you haven't, you're not experienced enough to get kind of infused with some of the like business knowledge, I guess, you know, and thinking about, thinking about it as a franchise. You were thinking about it as your game. Um,\n\nand, um, and I think that that kind of rawness and, um, you know, the magic that comes out of, I think, is what helps to shape that identity. Um, *World at War*, like I said, was the beginning of our expression of our, our identity and our, our tastes and our, um, uh, our kind of, you know, fictional preferences. And you started to see the, the beginning, the, what we called mind [¬†__¬†] later. Um, but mind [¬†__¬†] became the, the lynch pin of the whole Zombies ethos or Zombies, sorry, *Black Ops* ethos. Um, and, uh, you know, the introduction of Resnov in *World at War* was such an iconic character. Um, I actually did a little talk about this, um, at USC not too long ago, but, um, because it's such an interesting, like, the whole story around Resnov is really cool, but I'm down to take a, take. Let's do it. Oh man, it's, it's a long one, but, uh, you know, it was Gary Oldman, uh, was with the voice actor for Resnov. Um, but his, the, the very introduction of him in *World of War* was just such a memorable moment in that game because you wake up at the beginning of the mission. You're, you don't know what's going on. It's sort of like you're coming in and out of consciousness. There's these black crows and dead bodies around you and you see German soldiers you walking by. You're inside this fountain and you're, you start crawling. Once the player gets control, you start crawling. And as you're crawling, you see the, the kind of German soldiers walking past and one of the dead bodies just turns to look at you and gives you a whisper, but he whispers with his missing finger, which that's just like to me, I, that I remember like the, the putting together of that moment was just such an iconic thing. Um, and I like it still gives me chills just thinking about it. But, um, thinking about like the history of him after that and then that, that was the introduction. We had no idea at the time what he was going to turn into. Um, and then, you know, you learn that the missing finger was because, you know, he's, he's a sharpshooter. He's a sniper, but he, um, he had his finger shot off. And so that's why he's giving you now the sniper rifle. And that was, and so then you have to take out all these guards with the sniper rifle. Um, and it be, that was the, the setup for the snipe, you know, sniper level. And, um, uh, it was just, I don't know, like it was such a cool, cool way to introduce that character. And, and he became, um, so popular, like everyone loved him on the team. Um, and of course we had to bring Gary Oldman back. So it was almost like Resnov, uh, the character had to, um, you know, be the reason that *Black Ops* existed, you know. Um, and so you saw *Black Ops* carrying the same themes forward, the dark themes, the, the mind [¬†__¬†], the, uh, you know, some of the MK Ultra stuff that crept into, uh, these dark CIA experiments on human psychology. Um, and it was just a lot of fun material to play with. Um, you know, and on that project I was focused a lot more on multiplayer than campaign at the time. I had, um, you know, I had had produced a handful of the campaign missions in *World at War*, um, but I really wanted to do multiplayer, you know, first and foremost. So *Black Ops* was the first one was really the first time that multiplayer team as a core came together, uh, to work as one unit where everyone had, you know, was sort of, uh, you know, on the same team working towards the same mission. Um,\n\nfrom a multiplayer perspective, we had a different, we had a different philosophy, I think, uh, than the Infinity War team did. Um, you know, there the *Modern Warfare* game was very, very lethal. You know, you could sneeze at a player and they're going to die. Um, and so it really was a game of who get, who sees the other player first. Um, we wanted to have, um, not to say that like we were influenced by *Halo* or anything, but, but there were some games that had higher, um, time to kill and they, you know, there, there's a certain thing that happen. There's a dance that happens in those combat encounters where you get an extra chance to get to break away and have a longer engagement. And we felt like those longer engagements and that second chance of being able to break away and and circle back around and outflank the other guy, outsmart the other guy was fun and that that would be a more, you know, that was just a more interesting, exciting way to play the game. And so that was where *Black Ops 1* departed a little bit from *Modern Warfare*. We had a higher time to kill. Um, it was a bit chunkier combat. Um, yeah,\n\nbut, uh, definitely I used, uh, I, I, I remember the thing that I remember about, uh, *Black Ops* is just using a silent shotgun and just sprinting around and and getting into really close combat because for that reason, cuz like because you could survive long enough to get close enough to use the shotgun. It like, uh, it, it was unique from in that sense from from *Modern Warfare* where it was like, yeah, you just use the heartbeat sensor, like, that's cool. Um, I'm curious about like, during that time period, were there any, uh, you know, design or technology trends that were enabling these games to come through, like, were you guys seeing technology that was not around previously that you were then introducing into the games?\n\nUh, that's probably another one of those areas where, um, we, you know, just not knowing what we don't know, uh, led us to making\n\n\nVery kind of ambitious decisions about things.\nUm, you know, we had introduced the emblem editor.\nUm, we'd introduced the theater mode.\nUm, we were very into our team, and the DNA of our team was very much, you know, massively into social systems and um, and building a, a, you know, uh, tighter social weave around the game.\nAnd that that drove us to to build a lot of these kind of, you know, the theater system, for example, didn't exist in the game.\nTechnology to do it was kind of there.\nBut um, in terms of, remind me what the theater system was.\nSo, theater was the fact every single game was recorded from a data point of view.\nSo, it's not video recording.\nIt's recording the data positioning and location of all the um entities in the world at any point in time.\nAnd um, so it would record that as a data chunk would then get stored.\nYou could stream it back down to your system to to watch um replays.\nUm, so you could have an entire match, you know, would be replayable.\nWe put controls for fast forward, rewind, uh, free camera controls.\nYou know, the the features that were around that were really robust over time.\nI mean, over the next three games, we added the ability to attach cameras to objects.\nSo, like if you had an amazing combat axe kill, you could attach the camera to the combat axe.\nIt would follow it to the kill.\nSo, people could make really cool videos using uh the theater.\nUm, and that was totally outside of core gameplay.\nI mean, there was very little reason, I guess, for us like logically to do it because it wasn't core to the game.\nWell, I guess there was, you know, YouTube was coming up around that time, right?\nSo, that's true.\nYeah.\nAnd then with *Black Ops* 2, we integrated uh Twitch streaming functionality and YouTube streaming functionality directly into the game.\nUm, because at that time, Twitch was not big yet.\nUm, uh, so we were able to actually get the Twitch team to very heavily focus on feature development just to make our game stream their service directly out of it or directly out from our game into their service, I should say.\nUm, and you know that like they weren't a really, it wasn't a really big platform at the time.\nI think they just set up Twitch SE outside of Justin TV, you know, very, you know, recently.\nAnd um, but because they were a small team, it was also a startup and also very eager to make a name for themselves, they bent over backwards to help, you know, get their streaming service connected to *Black Ops* 2.\nUm, so that was another one of those examples of just pure social features, totally outside the game, not core of the game, but it was things that we were passionate about and try to be kind of cutting edge technology-wise.\nUm, I mean, there's a million pieces of tech I could go into, but those are just some of the ones that just top of mind.\nGot it.\nOn on the design side, so like I've noticed that the maps have gotten smaller over time.\nLike I remember with with *Black Ops*, they were still pretty expansive in terms of, you know, all of the call turbine was old man turbine.\nThat was what we called it in in in house because it was such a large map that it took forever to compile and and build for.\nSo anytime we were trying to ship the game in *Black Ops* and and we're in like, I don't know, 2:00 in the morning trying to get the game out the door to first party submission and it's like there's a bug in Turbine.\nAnd it was like, \"Oh my god.\"\nYou know, you had to wait cuz then you had to wait for that entire map to build before you could get the next game built out.\nIt was just that was such a nightmare.\nBut um, yes, they they were much larger earlier on.\nUm, that we took a very data-driven approach to, you know, kind of optimize.\nI think there are if you if you follow data just 100% purely, it's always going to, you know, overindex on just the single thing that people always want, and that can be self-defeating because then people will get bored, they'll, it'll feel grindy, they're not getting enough variety to their experience, so we didn't always just, you know, I mean, everybody would want Nuke Town or Shipment, you know, or Rust, like that they would want.\nYeah, I mean, it's the most popular map of all in the franchise.\nUm, but uh, and it is for good reason, you know.\nIt's it's just constant action.\nThere's never a, there's never a moment of downtime, really.\nUm, but why do you think it's so, like, why do you think that's so hard to replicate?\nCuz you wouldn't think of Nuke Town as like that very, you know, complex map to design, and yet like you can't, I at least in my experience playing it over the last, you know, six months, like there really isn't a map that that uh sort of is that com, is as compelling as that.\nUm, I mean, Nuke Town has its own experience or its own uh story to tell.\nThat was um another part of that talk that I gave at USC.\nUm, it uh, it actually, there was a design bible for how to build really good *Call of Duty* levels, and you could go through and you know, it's doc, well documented over like 60 pages or something, like all the different, you know, rules, and those got refined over the years, of course, through iteration, but um, but if you go and you actually looked at the rule, the rules of level design for COD at the time, and you look at Nuke Town, you could check all the boxes.\nUm, and that was the goal in that map in the first place was we wanted to have a very small map that was like Shipment, but more structured.\nSo, we wanted to have a Shipment experience with a more viable, you know, kind of three-lane, um, checks all the boxes of of the gameplay rules kind of map.\nAnd that was what, you know, that was that was the slug in our schedule that Nuke Town filled.\nUm, that um, and so yeah, so every, you know, it was the thing that was difficult with that map because it was so small.\nUm, and we did, you know, different art styles of it over every game release.\nUm, one of the biggest challenges always line of sight because every, it was so tightly constructed so that every line of sight was controlled.\nIf you change the geo even a little bit, you would open something up that was, you know, so that was always like a big challenge with that map and and redoing, reimagining it over the years was always making sure those lines of sight were still covered.\nBut yeah, every little detail and nuance is conforms to the rules of the rulebook of what makes great COD map design.\nGot it.\nWhich is the counterpoint to what you were saying just before we launch into this, which is like you can't follow, you can't just follow like what the data says, you know, directly.\nYeah.\nUm, I'm curious.\nAll right.\nSo, so what are some maps or what are some examples of things that emerged that weren't data-driven or maybe didn't broke, broke some rules that you know, that you know, prove the rule?\nOh man, rule breakers.\nUm, we had a lot of rulebreaker maps.\nI would say that, um, there was never a map where you could break, you know, too many rules at once.\nYou know, like a lot of times what we would do is say, \"Hey, what makes this map interesting is we'll break one rule.\nWe'll do something that we don't normally do or doesn't fit within the construct of of the game.\"\nUm, and uh, you know, like I think about some of the inter map interactive objects that we would put in like uh, radiation from *Black Ops* 1.\nYou had the big bay doors that could open and close.\nYou had the conveyor belt that that players could could walk up onto.\nYou know, a lot of kind of little things like that that really were not part of core gameplay, but just made the, made the map spicy.\nUm, Summit had the the hanging gondola that you could jump in.\nWasn't super useful, but it was kind of fun and cool when you got a, you know, when you got a kill from it.\nFelt pretty awesome.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat's cool.\nUm, so I'm curious about like the competitive environment.\nSo, you know, *Battlefield* went in a completely opposite direction of of going from small scale to massive scale.\nUm, how did you guys approach your competitors over the years?\nDid you look at what *Halo* was doing and and what *Battlefield* was doing, or were you really just focused on on your uh and building the best possible version of your game?\nI mean, we play, you know, we're gamers at heart, so we all play games, we all look at the other games that are coming out, um, especially shooters.\nBut I don't remember ever a time really looking at what they were doing and being like, \"Oh my god, we have to go compete at that level.\"\nLike we just always had our thing.\nAnd I feel like the uh the battle between COD and *Battlefield* uh was really more of a media manufactured battle because I don't ever feel like internally that was a thing that we worried about.\nThey were just two such different games.\nYou know, they, it was, they were both first-person shooters.\nThey both had guns.\nThey both had military themes.\nAnd that was about where it ended.\nUm, you know, beyond that, you had very large scale vehicular combat with heavy, heavy on destruction versus very small scale kind of arcadey combat.\nUm, which was, you know, low time to kill.\nVery different game experiences.\nUm, so I just, it was not something that we really worried about.\nI think the only time we ever felt um, there was one *Halo* launch that happened uh the week before one of our game launches.\nI want to say it was *Black Ops* 3, um, which definitely did soften the week one launch, but it picked up and then some in week two.\nSo, it was like, it, it never really was a thing.\nGot it.\nYou know, what do you, so, what do you think?\nI'm curious what your perspective is on why *Call of Duty* sort of took the the lead spot and why, you know, *Halo* and and *Battlefield* haven't, haven't uh been able to keep up.\nAre there any insights that you can share on what made *Call of Duty*, you know, so much more successful?\nI, I mean, I would probably boil it down to sticking to your knitting, like instead of trying to chase other people.\nUm, once you start trying to chase competitors, then you've already kind of lost the race.\nI think um with *Call of Duty*, it was a very, like I said, we never, we were never trying to copy what the other shooters were doing.\nWe were trying to do our own thing.\nUm, in fact, we would be more interested in what other non-shooter genre games were doing in terms of systems and mechanics and ideas.\nUm, and I think that once you started to see the other franchises, I guess, I mean, I don't want to, you know, I wasn't there working on them, so I can't tell you, but uh, when you started to see them drift a little more towards trying to compete against COD or or emulate some of the *Call of Duty* feel or or vibe or style.\nUm, I think that actually weakened their efforts, but they've always been great games.\nI mean, I was a huge *Halo* before I got into the games industry.\nUm, I was connecting lands for *Halo* 1 and using a tunneling app just so I could play online.\nUm, because they didn't have native online support.\nSo, to play multiplayer online, you had to use these like these basically hacked Xbox consoles and a tunneling app on your PC.\nYeah.\nSo, yeah, I guess so.\n*Halo* was maybe, maybe was in the top spot like earlier on.\nUm, and and so and then *Call of Duty* just has been so consistently successful year-over-year.\nI'm curious if you have any thoughts on like what uh on what's been, what's enabled *Call of Duty* to have that long-term franchise retention?\nLike why do players come back every single year to to play the next *Call of Duty*?\nUm, so there's a couple things.\nUh, one of the things that I would always say about *Call of Duty* is it's a greatest hits franchise.\nUm, it was not the one blazing trails on new features and mechanics necessarily.\nUm, a lot of them would be, you know, ideas that were maybe smaller ideas that were done in independent games or smaller games that seemed really cool.\nUm, and they would build a following.\nI mean, you look at game modes like prop hunt, you know, um, and uh, you know, that would get adopted in its own sort of *Call of Duty*, *Call of Duty* twist into into the game.\nAnd over the years, you know, of course, what that means is now you have something for everybody.\nYou've got large scale battle royale, you have extraction shooter, you have, you know, 2v2 small scale PvP action, you got zombies, you've got, you know, wacky game modes like prop hunt and everything in between.\nSo, it's it's just um, a part of it just like always kind of, you know, we always were driven by this idea of surprising and delighting the fans and bringing new, new experiences so that um, there's different variety that people can enjoy and attract new audiences.\nThat was one thing.\nI mean, like at the core though, of course, just the feel of it was nobody could replicate the feel, the snappiness, the fast pace, the the immediate reaction.\nI mean, we really leaned into the moment to moment and and making sure that player feedback systems were super dialed in.\nYeah.\nI still to this day, like as an adviser to other companies, I'm like, like player feedback systems number one.\nLike get that right.\nYou've got to, you've got to do everything and go the extra mile to give every little piece of feedback to players at every in every step of the way.\nSo that when you refer to player feedback, those are like the sort of the pop-ups that are re sounds, animations, UI, yeah, controller rumble, just every little um piece of sensory, you know, input that you can give back to players for doing things in the world or inter interacting with the world.\nYeah, I, I distinctly remember, I think it was *Modern Warfare* 2 when like they, it was just like this, there was just like a never- ending roll of feedback of like, you did this, you did that, you did this, you did that, it's like, okay, cool.\nSounds comical at some point.\nYeah.\nUh, awesome.\nAll right.\nSo, I want to take some time to sort of like, you know, we've been talking about the the history, but I, I'm curious about personal reflections on on, you know, *Call of Duty* and and your your legacy there.\nLike, what, what stands out to you as your proudest accomplishments of your time over\n\n\nOver the 18 years that you were at Treyarch?\n\nI mean, to be honest, my proudest accomplishment is, uh, when we, um, looked at just our internal, um, team member retention numbers and saw that, um, 50% of our studio had been there for 10 years or more.\nUm, wow.\nSo that, above anything else that we did, I think the fact that we had a really great culture that kept people together and motivated them to stick with it, game after game after game.\nUm, we were always, you know, a part of it was, um, the culture of the studio.\nIt was the fact that we did feel like underdogs.\nSo, we always were trying to prove ourselves that can bring people together.\nUm, the fact that we, you know, we're trying to constantly innovate and do different things in the franchise, even though conventional wisdom would be to just keep iterating and adding more of what you're already doing.\nWell, um, so we were big risk takers.\nUm, the fact that we had good workflows, I think, you know, the way that people worked together was really, was really productive.\nUm, constant play testing and feedback sessions.\nWe would, um, I mean, we, I think at one point, we had like three play tests, different play tests with different groups happening every day of the week.\nUm, and, um, it's just that was just kind of ingrained in the culture is you're constantly playing your game.\nYou're constantly talking about your game.\nYou're constantly defining what's the next thing you need to do to make it better.\n\nThat's amazing.\nAnd it's really interesting to hear that because it's in stark contrast to, like, what I think a lot of people hear about, uh, you know, Activision Blizzard and the culture there.\nLike, it seems like you guys had carved out a distinct culture within the broader parent company.\n\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean, I think, um, that, you know, the original kind of the whole business model around Activision, um, from the early days was this independent studio model.\nUm, you know, and that, I think, with every large company that matures over the years, that it may not be able to be sustainable for forever, but that is definitely what built, I think, the success there.\nUm, and so each studio did have a lot of flexibility, freedom, autonomy to carve their own path and define their own culture.\nUm, build games the way that it made the most sense for their team to build them.\nAnd, um, I think, you know, a lot of that kind of that autonomy is what allowed it to be a unique place, a unique culture.\n\nYeah.\nI mean, it's, it's wild to just think about, like, you had been there for 18 years.\nHalf the team had been there for more than 10 years.\nLike, you guys must have all just been like a family.\nI mean, you're not supposed to say that your co-workers are family members, but I feel like if, if, if it applies to anything, it would be like that team, right?\n\nVery much so.\nUm, you know, I, I'm not going to, you know, sugarcoat it.\nThere was, it was hard.\nUm, there were weeks that I remember, you know, for months on end, I'd be putting in 100 hours plus a week.\nUm, I think the longest time I spent in the office without going home was that I was into the fourth day.\nUm, so it's not, and it's not like, so there's definitely, there's plenty of pain points, but it was something that we at least always were trying to improve, and it did improve over the years from game to game.\nEvery game, I think, got better.\nUm, and you know, I know, you know, the in the last couple of projects I worked on, it felt like it was way, despite the fact that it was also, like, I think the standards were a lot higher, if you looked at it purely relative to previous projects, it was, it was heads and shoulders above where we had been in terms of, like, you know, crunch culture and things like that.\n\nWhat, what enables that?\nBecause, you know, presumably the reason why crunch culture exists is because you're delivering a product in a very specific time period, and if you could, if you could do it more efficiently, everyone would, would love to do it.\nSo how are you guys able to sort of adapt?\n\nIt starts at the top.\nI mean, that's the number one thing you do have to have.\nIt, it is a leadership, um, challenge.\nUm, and a lot of that is, it's about, um, discipline, development discipline.\nUh, you need to be willing to cut features constantly, um, which I think is hard for a lot of teams.\nMhm.\nBut if you can constantly cut based on an ongoing, uh, assessment of scope, um, you know, some teams, I've, I've heard a lot of disparaging of, like, production when it comes to creative game development teams, but I was a huge supporter of production.\nI think that production was the glue that made everything work just so much more efficiently.\nUm, and you know, allowed developers to actually be able to add more polish to their features, um, because a lot of that kind of, like, overhead and, and, uh, you know, otherwise challenging interactions with other team members would be, uh, kind of bogging them down.\nUm, but we had a really just world-class production team, and, um, always keeping a finger on the pulse of development and understanding where we were, how much would it cost us to do whatever XYZ thing was.\nUm, you know, and they, they weren't making the decision.\nThey were just advising the leadership.\nBut it, it's that, that, that awareness of what, what state are we in at any moment in time, and are we right-sizing our development to make sure that we're not going to get underwater?\n\nIs there any, are there any feedback loops in order to, like, cut features?\nLike, you can quickly test something and see if it's going to be valuable to players.\n\nIf it's not fun within the first two to three iterations, then it's, um, going to be very hard to make it fun.\n\nGot it.\nSo, so, and is that internal testing or...\n\nYeah.\nYeah.\nJust, just with the team.\nGot it.\nCool.\nUm, okay, so I want to sort of transition into forward-looking a bit.\nWell, and I want to also hear more about what you're working on today.\nUm, but before we, we get into that, one last question just on the Call of Duty franchise, when you look at, you know, the next 10 years, are there any sort of, like, are there any key challenges you see for the franchise, or, uh, do you think that, you know, this, this franchise is just here forever?\n\nSo, I'm speaking purely as an outside observer at this point.\nUm, I think that it's, you know, it's going to be important for the franchise to maintain, uh, a certain amount of nimbleness, um, because there's a lot of disruption happening right now.\nThe industry is, I mean, across the industry, it's very, we're, we are in the midst of a disruptive moment, and, um, there's a lot of factors going into that, from AI to, um, you know, lack of funding to, uh, publishers not knowing how to, you know, kind of navigate the current market to, uh, otherwise kind of random indie hits becoming the, the, the big games of the year.\nUm, I just think that there is, uh, there's a lot of uncertainty that's happening right now, and, um, I think it's always going to be harder for incumbent franchises that are large and, um, and, and kind of like, you know, just developer development heavy to be able to navigate change in that way.\nSo, I think that's the big thing is just being able to be aware of what's happening around and be able to constantly be able to adapt.\nI mean, still nobody, you know, you, you still see a lot of games coming out where people will try them and they go back to Call of Duty.\nCall of Duty is still a big staple for most players that are, you know, in into that genre.\n\nYeah.\nYeah.\nMakes sense.\nOkay.\nSo, sort of in a, in a similar vein, so now you're a venture capitalist.\nUh, you know, what are the things that you're most excited about in the, in the video game industry?\n\nWell, in a lot of ways, I've gone 180 degrees from where I was.\nYou know, I was, I was buried deep into development, um, in a very insular bubble for many, many years.\nUm, and then, uh, on the outside, it's the complete, it's just a different world.\nUm, but I've been having so much fun because it is so different.\nYou know, 20 years, 20 years doing one, one thing a certain way, and then now the last 3 years doing a completely different thing, um, has been really rewarding for me.\nUm, I, I love working with other developers, especially startups, because it reminds me of, um, it reminds me of where we, you know, what I went through in the early days of my career, um, with those, you know, early teams.\nUm, and it's, you know, having that 23 years now of hindsight to be able to, um, to help other people do things better, um, is, is very satisfying to me.\nUm, we have, we have a lot of, uh, entrepreneurs who listen to the podcast.\nSo, I'm just kind of curious to know what are some of those, uh, those pitfalls that you're helping entrepreneurs navigate, or what are some of the common pitfalls you see?\n\nUh, I think, I mean, one of the things is that people, especially if they've come out of AAA or come out of large established, um, operations, um, don't realize, even if they get a lot of funding, how hard it is to go from zero to one, and, um, everybody who goes into that space needs to think of it as, like, they don't have any money.\nThey're scrappy.\nThey're punching above their weight.\nThey are doing everything that they can to, um, outperform, um, because that's what you have to do.\nUm, so that's one thing is just, even if you have a decent amount of funding, like, don't act like you have a decent amount of funding.\nDevelopment is unpredictable.\nThere's always going to be something that comes up that derails, derails your, your plan.\nUm, I mean, every single one.\nI've never been on a project that didn't have a derailing moment, you know, or multiple.\nUm, and, uh, so I think, like, being prepared for the storms is an important part.\nUm, understanding that there are smarter ways to do stuff.\nUh, you know, I think, and I've kind of, you know, I've had this conversation recently with some of my friends and peers.\nUm, if you are a, you know, very senior veteran at a development studio that's been managing people for a long time, if you haven't gotten your hands dirty, it's going to be very, very hard for you to adapt to startup life.\nUm, the, the, the very, the most experienced people in the industry who are also successful as startups are able to get in and still work with their hands.\nUm, still do stuff, still build things.\nUm, because you do have to wear a lot of hats as an entrepreneur, uh, as a startup.\nI mean, think about, like, you know, you're probably three games away from being at a, at a little bit more settled place that's closer to what you came from.\nUm, and that's kind of how you have to set your mind to it.\n\nWhat do you mean by you're three games away?\n\nSo, you know, your first game is going to be, even though you've learned a lot in, in your past life or whatever your career has been, um, it's going to be very different, and it's going to be a lot of headache.\nUm, you're setting up your, your tech base, you're setting up your processes and pipelines, you may have new tools that you're using that didn't exist before.\nYou've got maybe different people in the mix.\nThere's less people.\nUm, you probably don't have all of the advanced, you know, like, build systems that help you optimize your build processes and QA processes and all the things that can basically drive efficient game development.\nAnd so you have to rebuild all that stuff.\nAnd it's never going to happen in one game.\nIt's going to be like, I mean, that's like, I generally think three games is about the, the time it takes to get to a much more stable place where, where your systems are refined, your people are much more comfortable working together, and you're just kind of firing on all cylinders.\n\nIt's interesting.\nYeah.\nI, I was, I'm coming from the publishing, uh, angle, and I was like, three games, like, that's too many games.\nYeah, we need it now.\nI know that, but it, it, and I think it's important for publishers to understand that, you know, it's a messy, it's a messy business.\n\nHow, I'm curious your perspective on just the difference between venture capital funding and publisher funding, like, uh, are you think there's merits to both, or what do you think the funding model for the future is?\n\nUm, everybody's going to, everyone's trying to figure it out right now.\nUm, everyone's going to have hot takes about this.\nUm, I, you know, I don't want to give you a my hot take, per se, but I can talk about kind of what the landscape looks like.\nUm, you know, basically, it breaks down into two categories.\nYou have equity and you have debt.\nThat's kind of how those are the two ways that you can finance any of these ventures.\nUm, VC is always focused, is, historically, been focused on equity, you know, which means that you're, you're, you're buying stakes in a company early on, which then gives them money to fund their development, to bring their product to market, blah, blah, blah.\nYou hope that down the line there's going to be an acquisition or an IPO, some kind of exit event.\nUm, that's the only way that VC exists.\nThat's the only, that's the only makes sense for equity at all.\nUm, so I think for that model, um, to actually work better in our industry, um, we need more M&A activity.\nSo, we need the, the industry itself needs to mature where there's enough big players out there that are competing at the highest levels, um, and are opportunistically going out and, and, and buying teams that are going to complement their, uh, brand or product lineup or skill set or technology.\nUm, and I feel like at the moment, and, and, you know, I'm not tapped into every single, like, M&A activity in, in the industry, like some of the later stage folks are, but, um, there are, uh, from my perspective, there's not enough M&A, um, to sustain the influx of venture capital that's, that's come into the games in the last, call it, eight years.\nMhm.\nUm, maybe it will get there eventually.\nI think we're definitely not in a place for it right now, but I'm hoping in the next few years you'll start to see it spin up again.\nUm, so that's that's the kind of like the venture capital equity side.\nThen on the debt side, you have, you know, various models.\nYou've got, you know, publishers will, you know, do, um, dev, dev financing, which is basically just, you know, like a revshare deal.\nEffectively, it's a loan.\nIt's like, here's a bunch of money.\nUm, we're going to take it back first out of your, out of your first sales until we get to a recoup point, and then, you know, you're going to have some sort of trailing percentage beyond that of, of\n\n\nHow much you know revenue share you get.\nUm, that model is the the longest and most standard in our industry, right?\nUm, and I think that in the past though, it's been not very developer friendly, which is why you see so many developers trying to spin out and do their own things.\nUm, and so the marketplace needs to be more competitive.\nI think there needs to be more publishers.\nI, you are seeing a little bit of this happening right now where there's sort of micro publishers coming out.\nThere's different models of publishers coming out.\nThere's shadow publishing like, you know, what Midwest Games has been doing and talking about.\nUm, I don't know.\nShadow publishing.\nWhat is that?\nWell, it's it's it's sort of like uh publishing for hire.\nIt's not about revshare.\nIt's about services.\nOkay.\nIf that makes sense.\nUm, and so, um, I think that that model needs to evolve, but it's not going to evolve from some, you know, grand, you know, person saying this thing.\nIt's it's going to evolve because there's competition in the marketplace.\nUm, and so I I do hope that there's more publishers that can start up, that more publishers can be effective at different scales and they can, you know, like I I love seeing when small publishers can have a big outsized hit.\nI mean, you look at kind of like Blacksmith this last year.\nUm, and um, you know, PM Games is is hot right now, right?\nLike growing.\nUm, just talked to them the other day and it was very cool to kind of like hear their journey and how they've gotten to where they are.\nUm, and so I think that you need to have a a much more competitive publishing ecosystem for for all of that to, you know, kind of be a healthier industry.\nUm, I think what you're seeing between those two models is and it will it could also there's other things like, you know, venture debt and other kind of financing models that are, you know, like credit or whatever, but um, those are the basically the two you're seeing a little bit of experimentation on both sides.\nUm, so publishers are being more having making more strategic investments.\nUm, meaning like they're buying an earlier equity stake with the uh in as a part of that deal they will take first right or refusal for publishing.\nSo they kind of you that's sort of a a way for them to uh protect the the long tail upside while also um making sure that they're bringing in capital return in the short term.\nUm, and then you see some VCs that have pivoted to, you know, dev financing or more like a publishing model.\nUm, and I think really what the fundamentals are is that you just to get investment in games and game studios, you have to return capital.\nThat's basically, you know, that's like the bottom line.\nAnd are you returning enough capital at a good enough pace to where people are interested?\nYou're bringing in a lot of outside investors.\nYou're the the capital's flowing.\nThere's more and more investment.\nAnd so, you know, we need to find a model as an industry where we're returning value to investors on a much more regular basis.\nUm, and um, you know, there's a number of ways to do that.\nYou could start to do blended deals like I mentioned where, you know, a publisher might make a strategic equity investment and then they do a publishing deal for for Revshare.\nUm, VCs can do that as well.\nThey can blend, you know, if if they if they set up a model where that's that's kind of that blended model is how they operate, that would I think return could could return a lot more value to investors.\nUm, I think companies need to issue dividends more.\nUm, which I don't, you know, I haven't talked to many folks that do that, but maybe it's out there.\nUm, so I think like, you know, long-term we have to we're going to all have to kind of evolve a little bit.\nI don't think that venture pure venture capital in the traditional sense works very well in games, at least not right now, because there's not enough M&A to to justify all of these venture bets.\nWell, now I just want to know what your hot take is, but uh I won't I won't force you to to tell us.\nUm, what's the best way for for folks to follow you and and follow your journey from from here down?\nUh, I mean I mostly I don't do a lot of social media honestly, but uh LinkedIn is is where I probably deal most do most you know communicating with the industry um at large.\nAwesome.\nBut I'm I'm not I'm not a very I'm not a frequent poster.\nSo just don't be offended if he takes a while to get back to you.\nThat's right.\nOh my god.\nIt's my inbox my messages are a nightmare.\nUm, it's like 20 a day.\nI can't I just can't keep up, you know.\nWell, it's been a privilege to have you on the
