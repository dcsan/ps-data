  "cleanText": "Andrew Mayne: I'm Andrew Mayne, and this is the OpenAI Podcast.\nAndrew Mayne: There's a lot of conversation and debate about the future of AI when it comes to labor and work.\nAndrew Mayne: To talk about this, my guests are Brad Lightcap, who's the Chief Operating Officer of OpenAI, and Ronnie Chatterji, who is the Chief Economist.\nAndrew Mayne: We're going to find out the kind of research OpenAI is doing, the conversations they've been having, and hopefully get a glimpse of where they think the future is headed.\nBrad Lightcap: We had a lot of people coming back to us and saying, you know, actually this is I think one of the best things that has maybe ever happened to this industry.\nBrad Lightcap: AI is a tool that lets people do things that they had no ability to do otherwise.\nRonnie Chatterji: They have the world's smartest brain at their fingertips to solve hard problems.\nAndrew Mayne: So Brad, you're the chief operating officer, you're the chief economist.\nAndrew Mayne: Explain what your roles are.\nBrad Lightcap: My role probably boils down mostly to what we call deployment.\nBrad Lightcap: So zooming out OpenAI is a research and deployment company.\nBrad Lightcap: And when we think about our mission, what we really think about is not only building AI and doing the research that underpins the building of AI, but how do you actually take it out into the world and have people use it and have it be beneficial for people, have it be safe for people.\nBrad Lightcap: How is it used in one country versus another country, one industry versus another industry?\nBrad Lightcap: So I spent a lot of time trying to figure that out, which means working with customers, working with partners, spending a lot of time with our users and just kind of studying kind of how people, what people want from OpenAI and our products, how people actually use the technology, and then as the technology changes, how that pattern of use changes.\nAndrew Mayne: It seems like because OpenAI started primarily as a research org and wasn't even sure if they were going do product or even put things that were sort of public facing.\nAndrew Mayne: And so how much has this changed rapidly for you?\nBrad Lightcap: It's changed really quickly.\nBrad Lightcap: I think ChatGPT, in November 22 was kind of the pivotal moment and it was the first time that we really saw AI used at scale.\nBrad Lightcap: And I think, you know, what we kind of, and it's interesting almost the story of how we actually learned that and how we made the decision to do ChatGPT, which was we had previously built an API for developers.\nBrad Lightcap: And we had a thing, you'll remember, Andrew, in our API, that was, the playground.\nBrad Lightcap: Where you could basically try prompts out and see how the model would complete the prompt.\nBrad Lightcap: And this was back in the days of, like, the models just being purely completions based, where they take an input and they kinda continue the text on, predicting the next word, and the next token in the sequence.\nBrad Lightcap: And people were trying to, like, hack the playground, to figure out how to get it to talk to them.\nBrad Lightcap: And they almost you could tell people kinda wanted this conversational interface.\nBrad Lightcap: And so we kind of learned from that, and we built ChatGPT as the first version of a conversational interface where we taught the model how to instruction follow to be more responsive to what people wanted to talk about.\nBrad Lightcap: And that, very much surprised us and became, I think, the kind of dominant paradigm of what we call the first era of AI, which was these kind of chatbots, that, you know, really were good enough to be engaging for people and be helpful for people.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah, it seems like because at the time we kept thinking that like GPT-4 would be finally when it was really useful and ChatGPT was built on top of GPT-3.5.\nAndrew Mayne: And it seemed like certainly changing the interface was helpful, but we thought we needed a faster, more smarter model.\nAndrew Mayne: But it was actually the interface was such a big unlock.\nAndrew Mayne: And that was I had the problem whenever I would do demos at GPT-3, it would be this blank canvas.\nAndrew Mayne: I go, now you do something and people be like, I don't know what to do.\nAndrew Mayne: But once you put it into the chat interface, they go, oh, ask it a question.\nAndrew Mayne: I'll ask it if we do this.\nAndrew Mayne: And that was such a big unlock.\nAndrew Mayne: But then the pace after that, like you said, was it was insane because ChatGPT exceeded beyond any expectation here.\nAndrew Mayne: I think there was an expectation it would kind of level off, but it didn't.\nAndrew Mayne: And then pretty soon, there was this awareness.\nAndrew Mayne: I think people thought AI was something in the future and now it came into the present and now bringing in an economist to come help map this out and figure this out.\nAndrew Mayne: So what is your role?\nRonnie Chatterji: As you say, I mean, the future has arrived more quickly than any of us could have imagined.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so I joined at a time when we were deploying intelligence at scale into the economy and the society.\nRonnie Chatterji: And my job is to help people understand what the impacts of that are gonna be on businesses, their jobs, their relationships, the way government does policy, and develop forecasts to help people understand, how to make investments investments with their time, and overall with their resources.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so as an economist, it's an amazing time to join because I think we're at a beginning of a real transformation, in the economy, and it's something that I think people need to be prepared for.\nRonnie Chatterji: So the biggest job I have at OpenAI is developing indicators to kinda tell us where the economy is going and communicating that to people all over the world.\nRonnie Chatterji: Because this is gonna be bigger than just The United States and what we do here, but something that's actually gonna transform people's lives around the world.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nAndrew Mayne: So in my experience and limited experience of understanding, like, when corporations employ economists often to figure out, let's say, the prices of products or things like that to make kind of predictions.\nAndrew Mayne: But here, your job isn't just internal, external.\nAndrew Mayne: So are you how are you sharing this?\nAndrew Mayne: What is OpenAI doing to help people understand where things are headed or what we think they are?\nRonnie Chatterji: You're right.\nRonnie Chatterji: I mean, there's a tradition of, you know, economists joining companies and in tech specifically.\nRonnie Chatterji: This job was was designed a little bit differently, and I think it reflects that this company really has research roots.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I think people really want it to be a job that, yes, thought about pricing and AB tests and analyzing data from the platform.\nRonnie Chatterji: But maybe more importantly, also thought about how is this gonna change the world and doing research, rigorous research, just as rigorous, but in a different way as our AI researchers do in terms of what's gonna happen and how can we tell people about it?\nRonnie Chatterji: How do we get people ready for this?\nRonnie Chatterji: And so a big part of my job is external.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, since I started, I've been in London and Brussels and Delhi and Washington.\nRonnie Chatterji: We'll eventually go to Sacramento and Sydney and every place in between.\nRonnie Chatterji: But it's so interesting to see the conversation and the vibes across those different markets and how people are thinking about this and the different use cases.\nRonnie Chatterji: So I have to say as much as we go out and do that work, I learn as much in those interactions as I probably teach.\nRonnie Chatterji: But a big part of my job is external and getting sort of people ready for what's happening right now.\nAndrew Mayne: Well, there's a lot of anxiety because I think, oh, but I was caught off guard by the success of ChatGPT and the rate of adoption in the place it's being used.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think every disruptive technology people, there's a fear of change and change is inevitable.\nAndrew Mayne: But there is the fear of how it's going to change work, how much it's going to change labor and employment.\nAndrew Mayne: And how much does open, I think about that and how much of what you do is sort of like thinking about helping people adapt to that, etc.\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah, I mean, I would say, it's something that we look at a lot.\nBrad Lightcap: I think Ronnie probably looks at it through one lens.\nBrad Lightcap: I kind of somewhat look at it through the lens of what are the things that we need to build to accelerate the opportunity that AI has to be impactful in a kind of an economic and outcome oriented context.\nBrad Lightcap: And that could be at a micro level, it could be an individual person, for example, trying to better understand, their medical care.\nBrad Lightcap: could be at a macro level, at a firm level, it could be a company that's trying to think about how to accelerate software engineering and pull forward projects from next year into this year.\nBrad Lightcap: So all of these things actually, I mean, you know, Ronnie probably does the interesting kind of studies on these things and takes a much more scientific vantage point.\nBrad Lightcap: We take a very product led vantage point though on it, which is how do we actually go build the tools that are representative of the things that people actually want from the systems?\nBrad Lightcap: And so, you know, software engineering is the thing that I think right now is super interesting is the systems we're building are progressing at just an insane rate in terms of their capabilities in software engineering.\nBrad Lightcap: You've seen rise of tools like Cursor and Windsurf and others.\nBrad Lightcap: And we think there's a huge opportunity there to help software engineers and kind of entirely change the tool set of software engineers to make them, you know, not 10 times 10% more productive, but maybe or 10 times more productive.\nBrad Lightcap: And then Ronnie gets to study the impact of that, you know, on an economic level.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's it's amazing.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think about it exactly this way.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's almost a handoff from what Brad is leading on the product side.\nRonnie Chatterji: Okay.\nRonnie Chatterji: Now our software engineers have these amazing tools, intelligence at their fingertips to be more productive.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, we might, across the world, write, like, a few billion lines of code in a day.\nRonnie Chatterji: And now you could multiply that by 10 x.\nRonnie Chatterji: What could we build?\nRonnie Chatterji: What could they build if you can write that much more code and that much sort of even better code potentially than you could on your own?\nRonnie Chatterji: That to me is a huge economic opportunity.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so, yeah, my job is to pick it up from that angle, understand how a software engineer's job is changing, how she might be using these tools to do things she couldn't do before, and how the organization that she works in is also gonna benefit from that, creating more productivity and ultimately value for the economy.\nRonnie Chatterji: So I see it as super interesting challenge.\nRonnie Chatterji: The other thing I'd say is, like, scientific research is one I get really excited about.\nRonnie Chatterji: So I think taking Brad's analogy, it's like we wanna put amazing intelligence in the hands of scientific researchers.\nRonnie Chatterji: Why does that matter?\nRonnie Chatterji: Because, you know, science drives growth.\nRonnie Chatterji: It drives economic growth.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so we can accelerate science, accelerate discovery.\nRonnie Chatterji: We're gonna have more economic growth and more good things for everybody.\nRonnie Chatterji: So I always think about if I can study how science is changing with our with the use of our products, and that'll be a useful contribution, in terms of economics, but also just the world.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: I wanna I wanna touch on that a second.\nAndrew Mayne: But what in the software space, I think you've seen there's been a I've seen a lot of people have a concern because all of a sudden companies are saying, oh, we don't need as many developers now.\nAndrew Mayne: But I would say the broader picture is we're never going be done writing software.\nAndrew Mayne: There is always going to be more need software than there is right now.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think the challenge is that some of the bigger companies are getting a bit disrupted or internally, but we need to think about where the smaller companies, the more agile ones are going to come in and where they're going to come from, because I think small teams can do a lot more.\nAndrew Mayne: And has that been something you've observed where, you know, let's say some companies are saying, okay, we can do more with this tool and but we're seeing smaller companies come forth with new solutions.\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah, for sure.\nBrad Lightcap: And I think that is the trend line of AI fundamentally is the world is rate limited by talent, by people.\nBrad Lightcap: Real, you know, economic growth in in the world rounds to zero in most places.\nBrad Lightcap: And why is that?\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: It's because it's really hard for the average company, whether it's a small business, large business, you know, financial services company, an insurance broker, a hospital to find people that can actually produce better tools, better systems, and ultimately better outcomes for customers.\nBrad Lightcap: And if you go ask kind of any company, you ask any company in Silicon Valley, you know, where, if they need to hire more engineers, the answer is almost always yes.\nBrad Lightcap: And this is this is the Mecca of engine know, software engineering.\nBrad Lightcap: Now imagine what the rest of the world looks like.\nBrad Lightcap: And so just taking software engineering as an example, we see it as not only incredibly, you know, there being an incredible opportunity to inflect outcomes for those companies, know, for companies large and small, but we see it really as incumbent on OpenAI to be able to build the tool sets, the models, all the, you know, the safeguards, all of the the compliance schemas and all that to be able to actually serve these these tools in the places that they need to be.\nBrad Lightcap: And it's it's interesting kind of the the polarity of it.\nBrad Lightcap: Think, you know, on on the one hand, you've got this tool set that is going to be incredibly enabling of people who have no sophistication on the subject matter.\nBrad Lightcap: So you've got companies now building tools that are enabling people to build software who've never written a code line of code in their life.\nBrad Lightcap: And on the other hand, you've got these tools that are incredibly sophisticated and taking, you know, level 10 engineers and making them 50% 2x more productive.\nBrad Lightcap: And it's a remarkable thing that you can get both of those effects.\nAndrew Mayne: Something I thought was interesting was using the the Moderna case example where they deployed ChatGPT Enterprise.\nAndrew Mayne: And one of things that happened internally was you had people developing their own GPTs.\nAndrew Mayne: And sometimes people go, what's happened to GPTs externally?\nAndrew Mayne: But I think that's been an interesting thing is internally, somebody who may not have thought about how to build an agent or something like that, who may not be technically inclined, is able to do that.\nAndrew Mayne: And has that been a common\n\n\nTrend with other companies that are now just building on top of the platform?\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah, I mean, I think that is fundamentally kind of how this is going to work. I think AI at its core and its essence is a tool that kind of lets people do things that they had no business or ability to do otherwise. And there's gonna be kind of crazy outcomes that come from that. I think it's kind of somewhat unpredictable. And if you kind of look in the long arc of history of what makes for these kind of disruptive platform shifts, to me, the thing that is kind of demarcating of that is when you now have people who actually have the capability to go off and do something at either a much higher level of productivity or something that's parallel to the core thing they're doing that they couldn't do before, where they were kind of rate limited or gated on someone else being able to having to do that thing for them. And so that's GPTs are a good example of how you now have someone who can configure what could be a fairly complex workflow. And it's on us to continue to build a product that enables even more complex workflows over time as the models get really good. And that's that's a remarkable thing.\nAndrew Mayne: What sectors do you see being impacted next?\nRonnie Chatterji: I, you know, I think that we're just scratching the surface when it comes to scientific research areas like drug discovery, material sciences. I think the next couple years, you're gonna see massive discoveries in those spaces for the reasons that Brad is talking about. When I think about science, I think about a an endless corridor, with doors on either side. And scientists, researchers in companies have to make decisions about where they're gonna explore. And that that's a rate limiting sort of situation to to Brad's point. You can't explore every door. But what our tools can help you do is actually look behind all those doors and take a peek and figure out where you wanna spend the time working on the hardest problems. And I think if we can accelerate science, in that way, you're gonna see massive discoveries coming out of private sector labs, national laboratories, like many of the ones we're already working with, in the public sector. And so I expect those areas in research to really be transformed over the next several years. I think you'll see a lot of different discoveries that we wouldn't have thought possible happening more quickly. I think another area is gonna be on sort of professional services. Like, we both, work a lot. I know a lot, of folks who are in this industries, either whether it's private equity, investment banking, consulting. So much of the work there that people are doing, we can augment that work by you know, I think about the way I use, our tools to create slide decks or prepare for a presentation. I can now focus on the higher value and higher margin things that are important for my job now that I can use our tools to do some of these things that I was gonna have to do myself. As I see professional services as a key area where a lot of consultants, bankers, and private equity executives are gonna be able to use this in a big way. So those are two areas I see finance, and science driven discovery companies being really revolutionized by our tools.\nBrad Lightcap: And I would say it's not just the on the science side, at least, it's not just the depth of any individual step of the work. So certainly, like, you can now do this, you know, more multifaceted exploration for any given thing. But it's the breadth across the the span of the work that these models can reason over. So having these systems able to understand if, you know, if you look at kind of how a drug gets developed, for example, there's like, you know, some number of insanely complex discrete steps in that process that all require kind of handoff at various points to a lot of different people, who all have to kind of gather context from the person before them and kind of prepare context for the person that comes after them. And you can actually schematically break it down, and to have models basically woven across that entire workflow, not only are you enabling the scientists to go deeper, but you're actually enabling the people who work with and around the scientists to actually kind of accelerate the end product, you know, ultimately to a better outcome and ultimately faster.\nAndrew Mayne: One of limitations the I've seen, so one of the companies I've worked with, they're doing drug discovery and the models are great at suggesting things, but it still comes down to the clinical trial and the lab bench and things like that. And hopefully we'll find ways to accelerate that. But what are some of the other limitations either to what these things can do or bottlenecks for us seeing sort of the benefits?\nRonnie Chatterji: I think human judgment decision making is going to be really important. I actually think it might be more important. You know, what we're finding in a lot of research, and I'll I'll one of my colleagues in this is David Deming at Harvard. He has this research that shows that people who are great at leading teams, let's say someone like Brad, the top of the company, they're also the same people who are great leading agents. And I think that a lot of the skills that let people be make great judgments, lead teams, they're gonna be even more important and at a higher premium in this economy. And so I feel a situation like this where, firms are using in drug discovery, you're still gonna need the judgment of experts. You can do refinements on the experiments, and you're gonna need help in terms of scaling. I also think there's other institutional changes, that might accelerate science. Clinical trials come from an old world of how we used to test, drugs for safety and efficacy. Those are really important. But everything from the sample sizes to how you enroll people, I mean, our tools could be hugely helpful in those areas. So I feel like you're gonna see it in drug discovery, but you're also gonna see it in every part of the value chain for, let's say, a pharma biotech company that might ultimately not just increase the rate of discovery, but the rate of commercialization and scale. That's my hope.\nAndrew Mayne: You just mentioned agents, and I think it's a word that's kind of like the word of the year. People hear it and sort of there's all sorts of definitions of it. Do you wanna take a stab at that and kinda see how you guys see that playing out?\nBrad Lightcap: I mean, I'll I'll probably get, you know, yelled at by someone. Mean, for me, agents have a very high bar. It has to be a it has to be a system that can be reliably handed complex work that it can take on autonomously, you know, and and and execute at a high level of proficiency, where it hasn't seen that work before. And that last part is a critical piece is these aren't just things that are trained to copy. They have to be things that kind of implicitly leverage the reasoning ability of the model to solve new problems. And this is going to be important in a lot of domains. And so people use the word agent. I think there's maybe an enterprise productivity context of it. There's maybe a science, you know, kind of context of it, there's a software engineering context of it, but the kind of common thread for me is, it has to be something that you can actually hand something to, you almost work in tandem with kind of like a teammate and, you know, that teammate could be a scientist, it could be a software engineer, it could be a data scientist.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you have a hypothetical example of like a kind of task?\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah. Mean, I think software engineering is is has has an obvious set, which is, you know, you you could ask ask it to basically go off and and actually write code for you, and, you know, and then kind of similarly go do the QA, go do, all the unit testing, go, you know, automate kind of meaningful parts of this process of the, you know, of code writing. And you know, in different context, I would say it's, you know, it's working with, agents that can make your, your sales teams more efficient. So slotting into parts of your sales funnel where you have a volume problem, where it's like, okay, I've got a 100,000 inbound leads for a thing, but I've got five people to look at them. Can you actually have an agent that can ingest those leads and understand those leads, process them, qualify them, move them through your funnel, recommend who should talk to who, recommend all the follow-up steps, and ultimately kind of drive a lead toward a conversion. So it's generalizable concept that kind of maps in any number of areas.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you see this like like where I might email an agent or something and say, okay, I need to and just treat it like I would another employee?\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah, I think that's kind of the interesting part of it is that, you know, in some sense, there's the kind of the input mechanisms, will be specific, I think, to the user, right? It's if you are a software engineer, you may want that agent living in your IDE. If you're a scientist, you may want it living in the software you use that you do experiment design and execution with. If you're, you know, doing, you know, user operations or customer support, you may want it sitting in your inbox because that's where your work happens. So how do you build product that, is intelligence underneath, but is extensible into kind of any number of surfaces and can be, you know, without the without without compromising the, the reliability and the, the power of the system is actually a hard product problem.\nAndrew Mayne: I have friends that are, pretty ChatGPT focused, you know, power users and have heard comments from before of like wanting to sort of do more with it and even small business owners too, the idea that if they could have like a virtual ChatGPT agent or something like that, is that something that you see in a near term horizon that, you know, I'd be able to like get to take care of a lot of the little work that there's just not enough hands to do?\nRonnie Chatterji: I think it's, I mean, it's a really amazing near term application in my view. You know, when you think about the limits around the world to growing the economy, one of the biggest ones is small business. There's what they call in economics a missing middle in so many countries where you had a bunch of small businesses and you have a few large businesses, but the small businesses don't grow large. And that was a big benefit of The US economy that our small businesses and entrepreneurs can actually grow and scale. In most places around the world, that's not true. Why is that not true? Because they often don't have the the mentorship, the coaching, the support, the advice to actually know what to do to grow their business. Now imagine you democratize, an AI agent that understands the basics of how to grow a restaurant business or an ecommerce business, and that's relatively easy to do in terms of instantiating that kind of intelligence into an agent. And then a small business owner could leverage that advice and decide, oh, maybe I should change a menu item or hire a sales rep or do something different with my strategy that could help them grow. And I think for small business owners around the world, including The United States, tremendous opportunity to get sort of small business advice, evidence based advice from agents. That's something I'm very interested in. I know a bunch of folks around the world are working on.\nAndrew Mayne: So I wanna I wanna address that when the evidence based approach in a second. But tell us more about what you're seeing from developing economies, because I know that's a big area of concern is one of the fears is that there's a lot of of lower level of knowledge work that's done in developing economies. And the fear is that AI is going to take that away. But you just brought up the fact that there are these limiters there that all of a sudden get unlocked.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think there's a lot of opportunities we should be talking about as well. I know that when I work in emerging markets, there's a lot of human scaling problems. It's related to what the rate limiting factors that Brad talked about with Silicon Valley hiring engineers. One of the biggest returns on investment in Africa is agricultural extension support. What that means is helping a farmer figure out what kinds of seeds he should be using, what kind of fertilizer he should be using, what kind of farming techniques he should do to get the most out of his land. Because a lot of people are small scale, so systems farmers, If we could increase productivity for that farmer 10, 20, 30%, it is life changing. And we have people who are trained up to do that, but there's not enough of them. And when these extension support services are offered, there's always someone, probably 10, who don't get the service for every one person who does. Now imagine that we could have intelligence provided to those 10 who never got that service to begin with. And I think when you think about agricultural extension support scaling with our tools, it's a huge opportunity to improve lives of people, in sort of lower income countries and emerging markets, particularly in agriculture. I'd say the small business one is another example. You know, we know from The United States, one of the best ways to move up the income and wealth ladder is start a business. That should be true in other places too. But there's so many limits to scaling, and often it is hiring the right person or getting the right advice. And so those are two opportunities, I think, if we can do this right, are gonna make a huge impact, for the positive in those parts of the world.\nAndrew Mayne: My mother-in-law is in India and she has a candy company. And she uses ChatGPT a lot to help her plan menus and recipes and write stuff. And it's been an interesting sort of unlock because now I've seen I think she did have quality before, but now it let her basically spend more time on other things. And so it's interesting because like you've seen like an African development where cellular was a bigger change than anybody predicted. It\n\n\nWas you took a country like Kenya, which maybe like 5% of the population had phones and it was all controlled by the government or something.\nAndrew Mayne: Then when cellular came through, then you had people were able to like figure out how to go to market, you had all sorts of commerce stuff things.\nAndrew Mayne: And what changes are you seeing right now with ChatGPT or like technologies?\nRonnie Chatterji: I mean, to your point, first, if if your mother-in-law is running an Indian sweet company, I got three little interns in my household who'd love to point.\nRonnie Chatterji: So just let us know if there's a job opening.\nRonnie Chatterji: But, this is where the disruption is, like, both exciting, and I also understand it induces anxiety.\nRonnie Chatterji: But you're exactly right.\nRonnie Chatterji: When you look at the Kenyan experiment, when they leapfrog the generation of technology, when new innovations came out, we're now doing something fairly radical, which is putting intelligence in individual's hands.\nRonnie Chatterji: Right?\nRonnie Chatterji: When they have a ChatGPT account or subscription, they have the world's smartest brain at their fingertips to solve hard problems.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's not intermediated by a government or a big business.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's it's something they can use to solve problems, and I'm really optimistic about the problems people are gonna choose to solve.\nRonnie Chatterji: One of the coolest things about this organization is we don't really tell you what problems to solve.\nRonnie Chatterji: Like, that was one of the most interesting things I think here is, like, when you think about how people are using ChatGPT, it's a wide diverse set of uses, much less how they're building on the API, right, with our developers.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so people will choose to solve the problems that are most relevant to them, and that's gonna be incredibly, sort of transform for their lives, but also disruptive because, right, they're gonna be able to have that power that they didn't have before.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I think when I think about it as an economist, those are the kinds of transitions I wanna study.\nRonnie Chatterji: I wanna understand.\nRonnie Chatterji: I wanna make easier for individuals, organizations, and society.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I think the level that you're talking about happened in Kenya and other parts of the world.\nRonnie Chatterji: This is a much bigger transition that we're on the verge of.\nRonnie Chatterji: So it's something that my team spends a lot of time thinking about when we look at data, not just looking at The US and Europe, but looking at other parts of the world.\nAndrew Mayne: You mentioned before in working with agents how having sort of, I guess, managerial skills or the ability to delegate is important.\nAndrew Mayne: Could you expand on that and also maybe like what other skills might be important that people need to be thinking about that they want to develop?\nBrad Lightcap: AI is interesting because it really is kind of a reflection of your will, right, and your desire.\nBrad Lightcap: And I think you it it sky's the limit kind of in terms of what it can do for you, right?\nBrad Lightcap: If you wake up one day and you decide you want to start a business, that just got meaningfully easier.\nBrad Lightcap: If you wake up one day and you decide you want to build a piece of software, right, that got meaningfully easier.\nBrad Lightcap: And so there's an incredible level of agency, I think that's required to extract the most out of AI.\nBrad Lightcap: I think as we think about kind of where the product moves, our job is to try and lower the bar so that there's you don't you can basically simplify the kind of the path from idea in your brain to, to outcome.\nBrad Lightcap: And, you know, there's interesting ways in a meta sense the models can actually help help do that.\nBrad Lightcap: But I think that, you know, the the that's probably to me the kind of really important important thing is, that the agency is going to matter a lot.\nBrad Lightcap: There's gonna there's gonna be, you're gonna see the the rewards accrue to people who, are, you know, Sam said it the other day, it's like the the return of the idea guy in some sense.\nBrad Lightcap: It's it's the people that I think can, you know, not only figure out what it is that they want, and, you know, what the what good looks like, but then can kind of figure out how to activate the systems to be able to work on their behalf.\nBrad Lightcap: And there's going be people that do that incredibly well.\nBrad Lightcap: And I, you know, one of my kind of personal bars for, for how impactful our work ends up being, is will you see the rise of companies that are one, two, five, ten people that are doing a billion dollars in revenue?\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: That's kind of the ultimate agency outcome.\nBrad Lightcap: If you think about it, it's like you have a a very small set of people capable of commanding, you know, what could be this very large scale enterprise, you know, mostly because they are opinionated about things like sales, marketing, products, software engineering, and so on.\nBrad Lightcap: And I think that's going to be a really cool cool thing to see.\nAndrew Mayne: Marc Benioff said something along the lines that they weren't going to be hiring any more software engineers, which maybe they over hired too, I don't know.\nAndrew Mayne: But then that they're going to be increasing the number of salespeople.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that often people hear the word sales and they think somebody calls you up randomly or cold calls, but sales is actually a big part of it as people who are networked, who know a lot of other people.\nAndrew Mayne: I think that's what he was talking about was what was going to be really valuable to the growth were humans with human connections.\nAndrew Mayne: And is this something you've seen data to back this up or to see this as a high growth area?\nRonnie Chatterji: Yeah.\nRonnie Chatterji: A lot of the research, coming out of this is showing that EQ matters a lot.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, lot of people think in this world is getting more and more technologically sophisticated.\nRonnie Chatterji: All of a sudden, the soft skills, the social skills, being to connect with people would be less valuable.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's actually the opposite.\nRonnie Chatterji: Yeah.\nRonnie Chatterji: Once you make these, abilities and these capabilities democratized to be able to write code, for example, then some of the other things actually start to matter more in the market.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so I'm not surprised at all that salespeople who have, you know, deep technical knowledge, and we have many here in in Brad's org and across the organization, are gonna be at a premium or around around, around the world because those are people gonna be able to connect the dots, use their EQ plus their technical expertise to solve problems.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I feel like, when you're thinking about what skills, we want in the economy, that's gonna be a key part of it as well as critical thinking and decision making.\nRonnie Chatterji: We're still gonna need people to identify those problems to chase after.\nRonnie Chatterji: Right?\nRonnie Chatterji: And that's where Brad talked about the agency combined with ability to target the right problem is going to be at such a premium.\nRonnie Chatterji: I expect that to be really important.\nAndrew Mayne: I've seen in tech, I think there's this over indexing on IQ and horsepower.\nAndrew Mayne: And I'm a big believer that I think these systems are going to be able to do just about any cognitive task we can think about.\nAndrew Mayne: But you brought up EQ, we think is a really important one.\nAndrew Mayne: I don't think that enough attention gets paid to that because I know some small companies that scaled really big and they build great products.\nAndrew Mayne: I can't get anybody on the phone.\nAndrew Mayne: I can't talk to anybody because they're just focusing purely on the technical component and not where they exist in the network of people and everything else like that.\nAndrew Mayne: And what are ways that somebody right now who wants to be, you know, find themselves in a very aligned position with the future, how do they build these skills?\nAndrew Mayne: How do they work towards that?\nAndrew Mayne: And how do organizations find people or foster that?\nRonnie Chatterji: I think it starts in schools like, you know, one of the really exciting things about the moment we're at is education is going to change.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I know that also creates a lot of excitement and anxiety, but I think so many things that we're learning in school, I have younger kids, and so in elementary school grades, they're gonna be even more relevant.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, what are you teaching people when they come into Pre-K or Kindergarten?\nRonnie Chatterji: You're teaching them how to be a human.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I can't think of a better set of skills to learn now than how to be a human because that's gonna be sort of how you become a better complement for this amazing intelligence.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, as an economist, you think about two constructs, substitution, which creates a lot of the anxiety, but also complements.\nRonnie Chatterji: If humans could become compliments to intelligence and leverage it with agency, that is gonna be the unlock.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I feel like a lot of schooling in the early stages even now, and it'll be more so as we go forward, is teaching those kind of soft skills and how to be a human.\nRonnie Chatterji: Later on, critical thinking, financial numeracy with numbers, still gonna be really important.\nRonnie Chatterji: I mean, my kids have calculators, but I still wanna teach them how to do multiplication tables.\nRonnie Chatterji: Dictation software works really well.\nRonnie Chatterji: I still teach them how to write.\nRonnie Chatterji: You'll need those skills, and you'll need a sense of some other kinda higher order cognitive skills, resilience, grit, things that they're gonna need to adjust to these changes in the market.\nRonnie Chatterji: So when a CEO says, look.\nRonnie Chatterji: We're looking for more something like this instead of that, students in the future are gonna be able to prepare to pivot in the right way and have that baseline skill.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's kinda how I think about people preparing.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think education will play a big role.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think work experience and great organizations can play a role too.\nRonnie Chatterji: Those are the two areas.\nAndrew Mayne: I've been advising some students, and I don't want to name the college, but it's in the Bay Area.\nAndrew Mayne: It's a pretty good college.\nAndrew Mayne: They have a pretty good CS, computer science program.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you know how many days they spent in the last semester learning how to use tools like Windsurf or Cursor?\nRonnie Chatterji: No, tell us...\nAndrew Mayne: Zero.\nAndrew Mayne: None.\nAndrew Mayne: None of their professors professors have taught them anything about how to use AI coding agents yet.\nBrad Lightcap: They're probably all using in the background.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah, they are.\nAndrew Mayne: And I'm also the ones that aren't, I'm strongly encouraged them to that.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that was sort of for surprising thing to find out that at that level, they're about to be put out in the workforce and they're not even getting a day.\nAndrew Mayne: And I understand you want them understand the fundamentals and understand that.\nAndrew Mayne: But, you know, they're going to be applying for jobs.\nAndrew Mayne: I help them put together projects and stuff so they can get jobs in places.\nAndrew Mayne: But where does OpenAI see its role in policy, both from education and policymakers and stuff and trying to advise or influence?\nBrad Lightcap: It's a good question.\nBrad Lightcap: I think, you know, there's no question that we're headed toward an overhaul, think, of kind of how the education system works.\nBrad Lightcap: I think that will be a positive overhaul.\nBrad Lightcap: I mean, you know, at the most kind of reduced level, right?\nBrad Lightcap: What what is it that we're building?\nBrad Lightcap: You've got this thing now that is this kind of personal tutor of every person on Earth, right?\nBrad Lightcap: And as it gets better, it will start to understand you better.\nBrad Lightcap: It'll understand your rate of learning better.\nBrad Lightcap: It'll understand how you like consuming information, right?\nBrad Lightcap: Are you more visual?\nBrad Lightcap: Are you more quantitative?\nBrad Lightcap: Do you need things explained certain ways?\nBrad Lightcap: We've had with the amount of feedback we get from people, for example, even with children who are dyslexic, trying to learn and the impediment that that creates in the learning process and ways that AI can unblock, you know, learning for those for that population, it's consistent.\nBrad Lightcap: And so, I think that, you know, the the entire kind of way that we think about education and what education is in the country will will have to adapt.\nBrad Lightcap: I think it'll be good though.\nBrad Lightcap: I think it will force in some ways our systems to think about, you know, what are the ways that people will use these tools in the future.\nBrad Lightcap: I think, we, you know, the the example you gave is in some ways surprising, but in some ways not.\nBrad Lightcap: I think the the people adapt faster than the institutions.\nBrad Lightcap: But the question here will be, you know, how do we work with policymakers and with the institutions themselves to try and help the institutions adapt?\nBrad Lightcap: I think the ones that do though will have this incredible accelerant.\nBrad Lightcap: I think that you will see the outcomes among students and the the ways that they think about, you know, what this tool can do in the classroom will will just fundamentally change for the better.\nBrad Lightcap: And it will also then free up teachers, free up students to spend more time on things that are going to be the kind of high leverage skills of the future that Ronnie mentioned.\nBrad Lightcap: So, things like decision making, things like critical thinking, you know, tool based problem solving, how do you, know, how do you kind of develop agency, and conviction early in children?\nBrad Lightcap: I think that that type of thing is going to be, you know, super important as opposed to a curriculum that today is, you know, reinforces things like memorization, regurgitation, and so on.\nRonnie Chatterji: Yeah and I also say, I mean, I'm pretty optimistic that we can make these changes in the education system.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think it's gonna come from teachers and students the way Brad's talking about.\nRonnie Chatterji: Like, in the early sixties, president Kennedy said we were gonna put a man on the moon.\nRonnie Chatterji: And if you look at what we actually had in terms of national assets at that time and, like, the scientific capabilities, that was pretty far off goal.\nRonnie Chatterji: But during that decade, we dramatically increased the number of people doing PhDs in sciences and engineering as people geared up for this challenge.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so I do think there's a really strong role for leadership across sectors to kinda sound the clarion call and say, look.\nRonnie Chatterji: This is where we're\n\n\nGonna go.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I, when I think about OpenAI, think about we have the best information about where the technology is going.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's an important role to play to let people understand, \"Here's what we're building.\"\nRonnie Chatterji: And other people in society, education leaders, government leaders, business leaders, and other sectors will be able to see it from their perspective.\nRonnie Chatterji: But if we put that call out there, I think you're gonna see a lot of dynamic changes across.\nRonnie Chatterji: And, you know, Brad and I are both loyal Dukies, of course.\nRonnie Chatterji: And at Duke, I expect the curriculum in computer science and in economics to be really different five years from now in a lot of positive ways.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I expect a lot of experimentation, you know, beyond whether you can use ChatGPT to study or how you regulate in the classroom as a professor, really important points.\nRonnie Chatterji: I don't wanna downplay that.\nRonnie Chatterji: But more important is how are you gonna use this stuff to do stuff topics in your curriculum, help students who maybe can't learn from a graph but could learn from a oral presentation or, you know, teach students the same thing, though in three different ways so everyone in the class gets it.\nRonnie Chatterji: There's so much amazing stuff that happened.\nRonnie Chatterji: I do think it'll happen.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think we have a history here in The United States, and you'll see this around the world as well.\nRonnie Chatterji: But I know The US the best where we've actually responded pretty dynamically to some of these big challenges.\nAndrew Mayne: Can you talk a bit about OpenAI's engagement with educators and policymakers specifically about what you are doing to facilitate?\nRonnie Chatterji: I can start with the example of Cal State University.\nRonnie Chatterji: So, you know, for those of you from California, spend a lot time here, Cal State is like, you know, just the ultimate unlock for students who are first generation whose parents, maybe they've come from another country or they haven't attended higher education.\nRonnie Chatterji: Those are the kids that Cal State specializes in.\nRonnie Chatterji: And those are the students that Cal State has traditionally, for its long illustrious history, taken to the next level.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so we are proud to, you know, to work with them.\nRonnie Chatterji: And, you know, this is something that comes from what Brad is talking about the research and the deployment.\nRonnie Chatterji: Someone like me picks it up and says, okay.\nRonnie Chatterji: Now that we're working with this great institution, how are we gonna maximize the outcomes for students when they go for that first interview?\nRonnie Chatterji: Can we prepare them with the skills they need to do well?\nRonnie Chatterji: Can we track their career outcomes over time and say, you know what?\nRonnie Chatterji: Having access to this intelligence made a huge difference.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so that engagement has led me to work with administrators at CSU, researchers.\nRonnie Chatterji: And once we get everything in order, students, ultimately, to make sure we're gonna make a big difference.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so for me, it's been a great interaction, and it's been facilitated by the deployment we've done with CSU.\nRonnie Chatterji: So that's an education example.\nBrad Lightcap: Maybe education has been for us the fastest growing segment that uses ChatGPT and other OpenAI tools.\nBrad Lightcap: So, it surprised us a little bit I think in some ways.\nBrad Lightcap: You know, we knew early on when we launched ChatGPT that it had a resonance with students and that was, it was clearly applicable to the way that people wanted to learn, engage with information, engage with knowledge, test their own learning abilities and skill set.\nBrad Lightcap: And what funny side story is we, when we right after we launched ChatGPT, we launched it in November of '22.\nBrad Lightcap: We had basically the kind of remainder of that school year, where I think there was a lot of upheaval, I would say, in that sector, and you probably remember this.\nBrad Lightcap: And for a while, we all looked at each other here and we're like, man, we, you know, I don't know what this is going to ultimately lead to for us, but you know, and is all this stuff ultimately going to get banned?\nBrad Lightcap: Something over the summer of '23, as the school year changed over, I don't know what it was that went around, but when when everyone came back in the fall, the level of enthusiasm and I think the level of forward lookingness of the of the leadership in kind of the broader American educational system, had changed.\nBrad Lightcap: And it was, they we had a lot of people coming back to us and saying, yeah, you know, actually this is I think one of the best things that has maybe ever happened to this this industry.\nBrad Lightcap: It's meaningfully changed how my students are learning.\nBrad Lightcap: We're starting to develop perspective on how people are really using this.\nBrad Lightcap: And not only do we have that perspective, I actually wanna extend and develop that perspective so that I can figure out how to better use this in my classroom, work it into my curriculum, challenge students in new ways.\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: Figure out ways that, we can actually have it surface gaps and vulnerabilities in certain student populations that maybe aren't getting the attention they need.\nBrad Lightcap: So all that work now kind of is culminated in work that we're doing internally with an EDU team here at OpenAI to try and work more with the sector.\nBrad Lightcap: You know, Ronnie mentioned the Cal State example is just one of many examples of ways that we're we're trying to to to engage.\nBrad Lightcap: And so part of it is product building, part of it is is engagement, part of it is policy, but we are going to take kind of a whole of company approach to it.\nAndrew Mayne: I remember one in the school system, but they famously had banned it.\nAndrew Mayne: They're like, \"Oh, we're banning this to use the school system.\"\nAndrew Mayne: And then I'd heard anecdotally that a number of teachers within had been using it and having really positive outcomes for many reasons you pointed out.\nAndrew Mayne: You know, I helped do a study when I was here and one of the number one feedback we got was from students was: \"It doesn't judge you.\"\nAndrew Mayne: ChatGPT doesn't judge you.\nAndrew Mayne: And it was a great way if you're feeling you're going behind or whatever to go questions and get up to speed.\nAndrew Mayne: And then we saw that some of the teachers were getting really good results in the classroom and didn't went to the school system and said, \"Listen, no, we need this.\nAndrew Mayne: This is something we've been sorely lacking.\"\nAndrew Mayne: And there was a kind of a famous reversal on that.\nAndrew Mayne: And that was, I think like that happened faster than I expected.\nAndrew Mayne: And would you say that you're seeing probably a faster adoption than you'd been expecting or was I just not with it?\nRonnie Chatterji: I've been seeing it.\nRonnie Chatterji: I mean, I think you're right.\nRonnie Chatterji: There was that transformation sometime in 2023 where people realized, \"Wow, we can unlock a lot of value here for students and for professors.\"\nRonnie Chatterji: And maybe what happened over that summer, I don't know, maybe happened for me.\nRonnie Chatterji: One of the biggest barriers to innovation for new faculty members, let's say, a university is developing a new curriculum.\nRonnie Chatterji: So someone says, \"Look.\nRonnie Chatterji: Hey.\nRonnie Chatterji: This topic's hot.\nRonnie Chatterji: Why don't you develop a whole class on it?\"\nRonnie Chatterji: Professors wanna help their students.\nRonnie Chatterji: They wanna introduce some new material, but there's a huge cost as it puts together against your research, your other teacher responsibilities.\nRonnie Chatterji: But all of a sudden, I can use the tools in ChatGPT to develop that syllabus.\nRonnie Chatterji: I can make a great entrepreneurship and AI syllabus now much more quickly than I could before.\nRonnie Chatterji: It can help me decide how to decide what classes I'm gonna teach, the slides I might use, the readings I might assign, even discussion questions for my students.\nRonnie Chatterji: When you lower the barriers to creating new content, it becomes even more exciting for a professor to try something new or a teacher in the K-12 context.\nRonnie Chatterji: So I feel actually that now as faculty and teachers are unlocking that, you're seeing a lot more adoption.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think the other thing is that, at the end of the day, introducing students new ideas they wouldn't have had anyway or otherwise is such an amazing thing.\nRonnie Chatterji: Any teacher, right, sees that, and there's a spark.\nRonnie Chatterji: And that's gonna make them wanna find a way to use those tools.\nRonnie Chatterji: We definitely need, you know, rules and policies they'll set up at the school level.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's really important when and how students use these tools.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's that's gonna be key.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I imagine those will be worked out, and there'll be variation across different educational institutions.\nRonnie Chatterji: But, but I have no doubt that it's gonna be a huge part of education, given how valuable it is.\nAndrew Mayne: We talked about this a little bit before we started recording, which is there has been years and years, you know, century of speculation of what happens when you have intelligent systems.\nAndrew Mayne: Well, how is that gonna disrupt the world, whatever.\nAndrew Mayne: And now we're in the place where we're actually starting to see this happen.\nAndrew Mayne: And we realize that I think a lot of it was fanfic and it was just so scenarios and the scenario is playing out and it's very different.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think your approach has been you're very evidence based.\nAndrew Mayne: It's the idea that you prefer research over theory.\nAndrew Mayne: And where are you directing your research right now for impact and guidance for policy?\nRonnie Chatterji: For my work, least on the economic research part, that narrow piece of it, I've been thinking about a couple of things.\nRonnie Chatterji: One is which sectors are gonna be affected first?\nRonnie Chatterji: I think what I can do to help the organization, but also the world, is if I can identify that sectors like health care and education might be transformed more quickly, let's say, than retail and finance, that's a really important insight to provide to the world.\nRonnie Chatterji: Because if people are in those sectors and thinking about their jobs and what they can do, it both unlocks opportunity on the enterprise side, but also helps people plan their careers and make their investments.\nRonnie Chatterji: So one of my big goals is to figure out which sectors are gonna be influenced first and by how much.\nRonnie Chatterji: The next thing I've been thinking a lot about is which countries, which geographies are gonna be most affected.\nRonnie Chatterji: I also think that's really helpful.\nRonnie Chatterji: When I look at previous technological transformations where people were left behind, a lot of the impacts were geographically concentrated, let's say, in big manufacturing hubs in the Upper Midwest in The United States during the last transition.\nRonnie Chatterji: And when you look at that disruption and the scarring that happened over many decades afterwards, I realized that if we can develop good indicators of where in terms of geography these effects are gonna be most pronounced, that's gonna be really, really helpful.\nRonnie Chatterji: So my team spends a lot of time on that as well.\nRonnie Chatterji: And the last piece is communicating it.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know?\nRonnie Chatterji: A lot of economists or if I was in academia, that's sort of the last piece, the piece you tack on there and say, okay.\nRonnie Chatterji: Well, you know, somebody besides my mother is gonna read my paper with its, you know, 33 appendices.\nRonnie Chatterji: In this job, especially given the privilege that I have to be close to the researchers who are changing the world, I gotta be able to translate that for real people.\nRonnie Chatterji: So those are the three aspects, think, sort of where, geographically, which industries, and explain to the world how that's coming.\nRonnie Chatterji: And that's kind of where the evidence base that I at least want to develop is coming from.\nAndrew Mayne: It seems like a big unlock that kind of what I noticed was when ChatGPT went to from you had to have a credit card, you had to have, you know, your login and all that to now you just go to openai.com and you can just use it, which just increased accessibility around the world.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think it's been iPhones now and seeing that kind of rule out there, which I think was a really good democratization of it, was the idea that it went from only a certain part of the world was going have access to it to now anybody in unrestricted countries, you're able to use that, which I think is great.\nAndrew Mayne: I think that's very cool.\nAndrew Mayne: You mentioned though, research into sectors are going to be effective.\nAndrew Mayne: What have you found out so far?\nRonnie Chatterji: So far, think the sectors that are less regulated, where there's rest, let's say, sort of red tape, rules of the road that need to be followed, those are the sectors that going to change the quickest, right?\nRonnie Chatterji: And so sometimes it's like healthcare for very good reasons.\nRonnie Chatterji: We have sort of HIPAA protecting patient privacy.\nRonnie Chatterji: We have rules in how care is delivered.\nRonnie Chatterji: These are really important parts of The US healthcare system and they are similar around the world.\nRonnie Chatterji: Those are sectors that are going to be harder to change, right?\nRonnie Chatterji: And they're going to be slower to adopt new technological tools.\nRonnie Chatterji: And that's not just true for AI.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's true for previous, incarnations of technology.\nRonnie Chatterji: IT moves slower into health care and education than it did to other sectors.\nRonnie Chatterji: So I think where you have sort of high levels of regulation and compliance requirements, you'll see slower adoptions and those jobs changing slower as a result.\nRonnie Chatterji: Doesn't mean we can't unlock a lot of productivity in health care delivery and education.\nRonnie Chatterji: In education, we're seeing this on the student side and teachers, but overall, like implementation, I think, you'll see it move faster in sectors where the regulations aren't as sort of significant as you are in those two sectors.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's that's key.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think the other thing you'll see is where the workforce is gonna embrace it.\nRonnie Chatterji: Brad made a good point earlier.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's like this happened with enterprise software.\nRonnie Chatterji: People brought tools to work like new storage solutions, and then their CTO was like, \"Hey.\nRonnie Chatterji: What are you doing there?\"\nRonnie Chatterji: Right?\nRonnie Chatterji: And then eventually, they're like, \"Wait.\n\n\nThis thing you're bringing is actually the whole company should adopt it.\nRonnie Chatterji: In sectors where you have highly skilled workers who are bringing these tools to work using things like ChatGPT, building on our API, those sectors are gonna transform more quickly.\nRonnie Chatterji: And that's why I think places like finance, research, and drug discovery type organizations, that's places where I think you're gonna have those people bringing it to work to solve problems.\nRonnie Chatterji: I expect those sectors to move pretty fast.\nAndrew Mayne: What career advice are you giving your children?\nRonnie Chatterji: That's the hardest question.\nRonnie Chatterji: And what I tell my kids is when I was growing up, I was the son of immigrants.\nRonnie Chatterji: So, like, if your parents are from a certain part of the world, the advice you might get would be, there's only two choices.\nRonnie Chatterji: There's like, be a doctor or be an engineer.\nRonnie Chatterji: And if you're really creative, you could be a biomedical engineer.\nRonnie Chatterji: So there's like a narrow set of choices.\nRonnie Chatterji: Why would parents give those advice to kids?\nRonnie Chatterji: It's because it's like they would predict.\nRonnie Chatterji: These are gonna be the stable professions.\nRonnie Chatterji: But during the course of that generation, health care changed a ton.\nRonnie Chatterji: We had managed care.\nRonnie Chatterji: A lot of physicians work for hospitals.\nRonnie Chatterji: The job is so different than the generation that was giving that advice thought it would be.\nRonnie Chatterji: Engineering, I mean Brad talked about this earlier, has changed dramatically.\nRonnie Chatterji: We never had full precision and full predictability to say, your kid should do this.\nRonnie Chatterji: In fact, many of the jobs we have today, we didn't have names for them in 1940.\nRonnie Chatterji: So first, I have a dose of humility, which is like, it was never easy to tell our kids what to do or guarantee they would listen.\nRonnie Chatterji: For my kids, though, I reflect back on what we talked about, which is you've gotta learn how to be a critical thinker and identify problems, develop a point of view to have the agency Brad's talking about.\nRonnie Chatterji: You have to have the neuroplasticity, resilience, flexibility to be able to adapt because the world is gonna change a lot.\nRonnie Chatterji: If you think about what's happening in AI, changes to our climate, changes to geopolitics, you're gonna have to adapt a lot.\nRonnie Chatterji: And last piece, I do think that the EQ and the financial numeracy will be really, really important as they navigate their careers.\nRonnie Chatterji: In terms of predicting what their job title is gonna be, I don't think I have any more information than my parents did and and I think they're gonna be okay.\nAndrew Mayne: It's an interesting note that like the title may change, or excuse the title may stay the same, but the work may change.\nAndrew Mayne: One of my favorite anecdotes was Dan Bricklin, the guy who created PhysiCalc.\nAndrew Mayne: He had, in the 1970s, was a high level programmer, extremely capable, then programming was changing a lot then and you're moving into object oriented programming and libraries and stuff.\nAndrew Mayne: And he thought that programming jobs were going to become more scarce.\nAndrew Mayne: And so he actually left to go get his MBA and it was while staring at the back the blackboards with all the figures, he's like, why doesn't somebody make like an electronic spreadsheet?\nAndrew Mayne: And then he invented PhysiCalc.\nAndrew Mayne: And it was just funny though to read how he thought that programming job was ending in the 1970s.\nAndrew Mayne: And I kind of think that it is changing a lot now.\nAndrew Mayne: But you mentioned about how if you're somebody who's running, you know, an AI software tool, you're kind of managing a project, it's project management and having the technical skills is certainly critical.\nAndrew Mayne: And I've heard this a lot, like why bother learning to code?\nAndrew Mayne: And I'm like, you know, do I want an airline pilot that doesn't know aerodynamics?\nAndrew Mayne: You know, what are other skills you think are still going to be mattering, you know, in the future?\nBrad Lightcap: Well, I think the direction of travel of technology is toward always toward individual empowerment.\nBrad Lightcap: I think if you look at trend like trend wise, every kind of past technological revolution and every, every past phase change, it it always, drives toward the individual and what the individual is capable of.\nBrad Lightcap: So, you know, 1900 you had 40% of The US economy working in agriculture, Today, it's 2%.\nBrad Lightcap: And we produce some multiple, more, you know, agriculture output than we did in 1900.\nBrad Lightcap: And you can run a large farm with a small fraction of the number of people it would have taken to run a large farm in 1900.\nBrad Lightcap: And so now what happens when that, you know, you get that same phenomenon kind of applied widely across the economy and in sectors where historically we haven't had that phenomenon.\nBrad Lightcap: But, and I think that there are a lot of places that would benefit from a phenomenon like that.\nBrad Lightcap: And that's not to say that there's a, you know, it's an argument for job displacement, for example, but, I think that the argument here is toward, you know, higher economic output kind of per unit of input.\nBrad Lightcap: And that fundamentally is what drives economic growth.\nBrad Lightcap: But people are resilient.\nBrad Lightcap: They find other places to go work.\nBrad Lightcap: And when you create the kind of local level, the micro level empowerment, you tend to create, you know, have the second and third effects of of other jobs that get created that that we couldn't have foreseen, you know, in in retrospect.\nBrad Lightcap: And so, you know, it would be weird to tell someone in 1900, for example, that there are people today whose entire job, is to make content for a small little device, that people consume, you know, many many hours a day, and that those people can make a perfectly kind of viable economic living.\nBrad Lightcap: It would seem like a it would seem like something that was almost kind of unimaginable that, you know, would exist, but it does.\nBrad Lightcap: And so there will be that set kind of second set of changes and second and third quarter impacts.\nBrad Lightcap: But I think that, know, I always kind of come back to, the the the kind of individual empowerment point of, the the direction of travel being toward, more people being able to do a lot more with a lot less, and then you know, their labor, and their ideas and their creativity creating kind of the downstream opportunity for people that, you know, twenty years ago would have been doing a different job.\nAndrew Mayne: The example I use is in ancient Mesopotamia, 98% of people were in agriculture and all of a sudden somebody invents the plow.\nAndrew Mayne: And if you're thinking, well, we're all farmers, we're doomed.\nAndrew Mayne: That may have been a mindset, but the reality was that led us to inventing education and healthcare and actually governments and all these things.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that that's to your point, like that's the thing I think we sort of forget is that we've had huge, huge upheavals, like literally taking going from 98% and, you know, agriculture to all of a sudden where they go.\nAndrew Mayne: And, you know, if we thought back in the year 1800 and said, hey, we're going to get rid of almost all farm jobs, people would be thinking, well, what are we going to do?\nAndrew Mayne: There's going to be massive problems.\nAndrew Mayne: And we realized that, like you said, we created all these new kinds of rules, entire sectors, the economy and stuff.\nAndrew Mayne: And it's always hard to predict, though.\nAndrew Mayne: It's always hard to predict where that's going to be because we just imagine the future is sort of the present, but with like shinier clothes and robots.\nBrad Lightcap: Right.\nAndrew Mayne: And flying cars.\nRonnie Chatterji: And part of, I think this is part of the job of research and organizations that are close to technology, produce the information to help people make the best decisions.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, Brad talked talked about agency.\nRonnie Chatterji: Agency requires sort of an individual characteristic.\nRonnie Chatterji: But it also will require information about what the market looks like, where technology is going.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so I feel that as a big responsibility in what I'm doing here.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, our mission is to benefit all humanity.\nRonnie Chatterji: And to do that, I wanna make sure people have the information they need to the best of my ability.\nRonnie Chatterji: We can't predict with perfect fidelity whether it was gonna be.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I can't tell my own kids much less than anyone else's kids.\nRonnie Chatterji: But if I can give good information based on research, that'll help people make better decisions.\nRonnie Chatterji: And I and I do think ultimately find a place where they can flourish.\nBrad Lightcap: We should also keep in mind there's a lot of people who can't participate in the economy the way that they would like because of extenuating circumstances in their life.\nBrad Lightcap: That are, you know, born in part of things like lack of access to health care, lack of access to education.\nBrad Lightcap: I mean, we talked a little bit earlier about what are the impacts that we might see in parts of the developing world where access to those resources is scarce.\nBrad Lightcap: You know, there's the direct impact that we have of how do you make make it easier for someone to scale a small business.\nBrad Lightcap: That's gonna be a clear present and I think very positive set of things that, you know, that happen.\nBrad Lightcap: There's a kind of second and third order almost hidden impact that we also, I think, you know, Ronnie has the challenge of having to figure out how to measure this.\nBrad Lightcap: But what happens when you enable people to better manage health care, right, or better manage the health care of someone who is dependent on them, you know, a a sibling or, you know, a parent or something like that?\nBrad Lightcap: What happens when you raise the education level, you know, and and the educational outcome levels by 2%?\nBrad Lightcap: And what is the kind of second and third order effect of that as a downstream impact on on the economy and on, you know, on on on, people's ability to participate in the economy?\nBrad Lightcap: So, you you know, there's there's kind of the direct way to look at this.\nBrad Lightcap: I think there's also the indirect way to look at this, and that's right.\nBrad Lightcap: You know, I just deferred it to to Ronnie on on whatever he can measure.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think it I think this is a really good point, though, Brad.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's something I've been thinking it's hard to measure, but important here is coaching, mentoring, counseling.\nRonnie Chatterji: When he talked about people who can't fully participate in the economy, my mind immediately went to there's so many people who have so much to offer, but maybe, they're neurodiverse or maybe they need a coach or someone to help them get to the next level or a level of counseling and behavioral health, which we don't have broad access to in many cases, is expensive.\nRonnie Chatterji: And depending if you live in a part of the country or the world where you don't have access to that, you're sort of sidelined.\nRonnie Chatterji: And, you know, economists will use the technical term of labor force participation.\nRonnie Chatterji: What it really means is you're sidelined.\nRonnie Chatterji: You you can't participate.\nRonnie Chatterji: But if we can help people, compared to having no help now, some help, we could help them participate in the economy more fully, and that can unlock a lot of potential.\nRonnie Chatterji: I do think any equation, any cost benefit analysis, any sort of sort of reckoning about what's gonna happen to the economy needs to also consider people who aren't participating the way they could now getting enabled.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think I think that's a really important point.\nRonnie Chatterji: And we'll try to measure it, but even now, I think it should be thought about, in that way.\nAndrew Mayne: I think we, in developed economies, sometimes have a habit of forgetting the things we have that other people don't have.\nAndrew Mayne: Like if you want legal help, you hire a lawyer, but if you're living in a subsistence level economy, like that's hard.\nAndrew Mayne: You can't do that.\nAndrew Mayne: You know, financial planning, everybody would benefit.\nAndrew Mayne: I mean, the people who benefit most from financial planning are people who had access to financial education.\nAndrew Mayne: I think that's an exciting area.\nAndrew Mayne: I think that certainly we're going to start seeing those effects eventually when you start to see what happens when you unlock so many of the people around the world by just the circumstances of where they were born and had access to didn't have access to that information or expertise.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that's going to be very cool to see how AI makes that possible.\nAndrew Mayne: We've seen just through ChatGPT alone, how people are able to use it as educational tutors, helping translations and helping small businesses, helping people who have to work in communication, etcetera.\nAndrew Mayne: And that's been a benefit.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that we've seen in some situations where you have a tool, let's say translation, people often think like, oh, that's going to decrease the need for translators, but actually can increase it because all of a sudden a company that never did business overseas now can once send out query letters, etcetera, now find themselves dealing with an entirely different country in the economy and that's increased the demand for a human skill.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you think this is going to be happening in other places?\nAndrew Mayne: Do you think this is going to be just a big area of opportunity or is it just going to be minimal?\nBrad Lightcap: Look, what we actually see in our data at OpenAI is when we cut the price of our models, which is really cutting the price of intelligence, we see a disproportionate increase in demand for that model.\nBrad Lightcap: And and we see that with ChatGPT too, when we make better intelligence available and more of it available, people use it more.\nBrad Lightcap: And we don't see the upper bound yet on kind of how intelligence and demand correlate.\nBrad Lightcap: It seems like there's just this relationship that the more we can make really great intelligence available more cheaply, the more consumption there will be around that that thing.\nBrad Lightcap: And so if you think about kind of how that plays out in an economic context, you know, what happens when you've got, you know, if you can cut the price of good legal advice, for example, by a factor of a 100, you know, do you see a corresponding thousand x increase in the demand for legal services?\nBrad Lightcap: Same in health care, same in education\n\n\n, same in software engineering, same in any other thing.\nBrad Lightcap: And I don't think we've quite come to terms with what that means.\nBrad Lightcap: And if you think about, you know, thousand x demand increases kind of across every segment, that's a lot of strain.\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: That's a lot of demand in the economy, which is a good thing.\nBrad Lightcap: But, you know, I think there's and ultimately, people are gonna have to kind of, like, organize themselves to figure out how to serve all of that need and and and and be there to serve those, you know, that demand and and those and those needs, which means that you need people who are gonna come up with ideas, take initiative, go start things, go create things.\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: And so that's the dynamism, I think, of the economy that's underappreciated when we talk about what the impact of AI will be.\nBrad Lightcap: And it's the thing that we see at a very, you know, at a micro level now at OpenAI.\nBrad Lightcap: But, I think, you know, we should look at as as we make intelligence, you know, Sam has a phrase I love, too cheap to meter.\nBrad Lightcap: What does it really mean for, the world's ability to, to create output?\nBrad Lightcap: And then, you know, ultimately, I think that the downstream impact of that we'll find is that it actually had an incredibly enhancing effect, on on jobs, on productivity.\nBrad Lightcap: And, you know, that's that's the positive future I think we're we're excited about.\nRonnie Chatterji: And as an economist, I'll just say this could be really exciting for people in those professions in the following way.\nRonnie Chatterji: When you sort of make intelligence too cheap to meter and that intelligence of providing, let's say, legal advice or financial management advice or advice on real estate, all of sudden, get a bunch of new people accessing that never could access it before.\nRonnie Chatterji: Right?\nRonnie Chatterji: So it's opening up the market, number one.\nRonnie Chatterji: And then once those people sort sort of start making decisions, right, buying a property, right, making a transaction, engaging with legal services, they're gonna have higher and higher level needs.\nRonnie Chatterji: Right?\nRonnie Chatterji: And all of a sudden, the business that they're running is more complex, or they have two properties to manage.\nRonnie Chatterji: And then there's a bunch of people who are trained in those fields who never served this market before, but now they're gonna come to them with more complex questions.\nRonnie Chatterji: And if that accelerates, that could create tremendous opportunities in those fields.\nRonnie Chatterji: It will be about deciding which part of the market to focus on, what kinds of skills you wanna leverage.\nRonnie Chatterji: But I think for real estate agents and insurance brokers and financial advisors, there's a potential for this to actually onboard a tremendous number of people who never would access their services to begin with.\nRonnie Chatterji: That's the excitement of reducing the cost of intelligence dramatically, which is what's happening.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: I would say an example that's, think, kind of very close to home here is that every time there's a new model or in some new technology from OpenAI, you'll get some pundit will go, well, how come they're still hiring?\nAndrew Mayne: And I think I'm a growth mentality person.\nAndrew Mayne: I'm like, well, of course they're hiring because and I want to get a sanity check on this.\nAndrew Mayne: My prediction I've told people is more people are going to work for OpenAI after AGI than work before it.\nAndrew Mayne: That it's not like all of a sudden, great, we've got a new tool.\nAndrew Mayne: You don't need people doing these roles before.\nAndrew Mayne: The roles change, but you're going to want more people.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you think, would you agree about my assessment of the trajectory of OpenAI?\nAndrew Mayne: More people here after AGI?\nBrad Lightcap: I think it will be more people after AGI.\nBrad Lightcap: I think I kind of go back to what I said earlier of how do you, you know, the the kind of demarcator of, of the impact of AI being about kind of more output per person.\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: And so you now have, you know, you get this kind of scale down basically in kind of how large of a firm or company can be run by some number of people.\nBrad Lightcap: So, you know, a large enterprise had to be run by a 100,000 people before maybe that number comes down to 50,000, eventually 20,000, you know, 5,000, a thousand, you know, a 100 and so on and so forth.\nBrad Lightcap: And maybe it's, you know, it's an even steeper fall off than that.\nBrad Lightcap: And so I suspect and hope OpenAI will be kind of no different than that, you know, especially given what we do.\nBrad Lightcap: And so, you know, I think but I think going back to also the point I made around what do we see as the second and third order impacts of the deflationary aspect of intelligence.\nBrad Lightcap: Right?\nBrad Lightcap: Is it it creates significant and disproportionate demand for the service.\nBrad Lightcap: And so what does that mean for us?\nBrad Lightcap: It means we need more people that can help work with more users across more use cases.\nBrad Lightcap: It means we need more people helping policymakers think about the problem.\nBrad Lightcap: It means we need a chief economist.\nBrad Lightcap: You know, if you'd asked me three years ago, if we would have needed a chief economist, I would have I would have said, I don't maybe in 2030.\nBrad Lightcap: But here we are.\nBrad Lightcap: And so, you know, I think that that's, I think it will be more people, but I think it is kind of somewhat consequence of both of the trends I just mentioned.\nAndrew Mayne: I am helping out a friend who's working on training models and stuff to help with cancer nutrition.\nAndrew Mayne: And we were talking to somebody from OpenAI yesterday and they said, would it be helpful to talk to the health team?\nAndrew Mayne: And I'm like, you have a health team?\nAndrew Mayne: I said, yeah, we do.\nAndrew Mayne: I'm like, well, great.\nAndrew Mayne: And then, you know, having a conversation with them and that was the thing like, wow, this is what a great area of expansion.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that I hope that other companies are sort of thinking about how these tools really are augment and amplify and create opportunities for growth because I think that if you have good talent, you want to keep that talent and find more talent, not find a way to not need talent.\nAndrew Mayne: I think that'll put them at a disadvantage if they're you know, not being forward thinking about that.\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah, mean, you can get incredible leverage on every marginal person, you know, 10x, 100x leverage that you could get, you know, 10 from 10 ago or something like that, like in some sense why why wouldn't you want more people?\nBrad Lightcap: Yeah.\nBrad Lightcap: You know, if Ronnie's team can now, you know, with a team of 10 people, do economic analysis across, you know, 10 different subjects or 10 different sectors versus, you know, two, because every person now is doing three or four times more.\nBrad Lightcap: That's, I mean, that's an amazing thing, right?\nBrad Lightcap: And so it just means that we as a company are capable of doing more.\nBrad Lightcap: And the thing that we kind of set out, we'll handle that in 2026 or 2027.\nBrad Lightcap: It's like, no, we can do it right now.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you have favorite ChatGPT tips or advice you give people on using AI?\nRonnie Chatterji: I have a few.\nRonnie Chatterji: I think the coaching is so valuable.\nRonnie Chatterji: You know, you meet so many people who they say, hi.\nRonnie Chatterji: I'm a religious ChatGPT user, and you find out, like, they're not even logged in or they don't know about Deep Research, and you're like, oh my gosh.\nRonnie Chatterji: There's so much more you can do.\nRonnie Chatterji: For me, the coaching has been so valuable on diet and fitness.\nRonnie Chatterji: Brad doesn't know this, but I'm training for a, a big, athletic adventure to play basketball at Duke, at a Coach K camp.\nRonnie Chatterji: Okay.\nRonnie Chatterji: I've I've requested time offer.\nRonnie Chatterji: He's gotta approve it.\nRonnie Chatterji: But I gotta be in good shape because otherwise, I'm gonna get like, I'm gonna, like, tear my ACL the first second I get out there.\nRonnie Chatterji: So ChatGPT is helping me over the next four weeks, like, really get in the best shape of, like, I guess, middle age.\nRonnie Chatterji: And how is it doing that?\nRonnie Chatterji: Well, it's looking at the food I'm eating and giving me advice and giving me calorie breakdowns.\nRonnie Chatterji: It's reducing the decisions I need to make by analyzing what I've had that day, and it's helping me track, weight and and other kind of fitness indicators.\nRonnie Chatterji: So in doing that, I have this, like, map out to four weeks, which we're doing really, really hard with the jobs we have and the travel that we're all doing to manage.\nRonnie Chatterji: And so I feel like that's a pretty simple one that you don't need super advanced tools to do, but it's really changed my outlook and made this possible.\nRonnie Chatterji: So that's my favorite one of this month.\nBrad Lightcap: The, the thing I do, especially now with o3, and I think o3 as a model kind of broke through the the barrier for me.\nBrad Lightcap: It kind of crossed the chasm, and I look, all of our earlier models were great.\nBrad Lightcap: o3, there's something deeply great, and the thing I use it for is to actually like challenge me.\nBrad Lightcap: So, a lot of my job is is I'm trying to make assumptions about how things work just based on kind of empirical observation of what companies are using us in certain ways, what users tell me they like or don't like.\nBrad Lightcap: And, in some ways, you know, like I said early on, our job is to predict the future.\nBrad Lightcap: o3 has an incredible ability to actually be a question asker.\nBrad Lightcap: So I think people think of ChatGPT as something that you can only ask questions to.\nBrad Lightcap: But a lot of times what I really wanted to do is actually ask me questions and challenge my assumptions and make an arg counterargument to me of why something works or doesn't work the way I think it might work.\nBrad Lightcap: And it's an incredibly effective thought partner in that regard, and it can be at really big things, you know, or it can be at really, you know, low level dumb things.\nBrad Lightcap: I just got a puppy,\nBrad Lightcap: and I've, you know, I've had a dog my whole life and, you know, we've we've had a puppy that now is has been, I would say not the easiest when it comes to getting her to calm down and go to sleep.\nBrad Lightcap: And, know, my wife and I could not figure out how to how to get her to do this.\nBrad Lightcap: And so ChatGPT kind of being a resource for challenging our assumptions about what we thought we knew about puppy training, for example, has been an interesting experience.\nAndrew Mayne: o3 is something special.\nAndrew Mayne: And we talked a lot about, yeah, what happens when the models can can push as well to pull in, when they can kind of, you know, get you to think about a thing, and that has been just just been amazing.\nAndrew Mayne: O3 has really been a fun experience talking to.\nAndrew Mayne: It's the first time I felt like it's not just something that's kind of telling me a thing that it looked up and versus something that thought about.\nAndrew Mayne: Brad, Ronnie, thank you very much.\nAndrew Mayne: This has been great, and I hope we can speak again in the future about this and maybe check on the progress of all of this.\nBrad Lightcap: Looking forward to it.\nRonnie Chatterji: Thanks for having us.\n",
