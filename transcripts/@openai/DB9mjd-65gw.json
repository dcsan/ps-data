  "cleanText": "Andrew Mayne: Welcome to the OpenAI Podcast.\nAndrew Mayne: My name is Andrew Mayne.\nAndrew Mayne: For several years, I worked at OpenAI, first as an engineer on the applied team and then as the science communicator.\nAndrew Mayne: After that, I worked with companies and individuals trying to figure out how to incorporate artificial intelligence.\nAndrew Mayne: With this podcast, we have the opportunity to talk to the people working with and at OpenAI about what's going on behind the scenes and maybe get a glimpse of the future.\nAndrew Mayne: My first guest is Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of OpenAI.\nAndrew Mayne: And we're gonna find out a bit more about Project Stargate, how he uses ChatGPT as a parent, and maybe get an idea of when GPT-5 is coming.\nSam Altman: More and more people will think we've gotten to an AGI system every year.\nSam Altman: What you want out of hardware and software is changing quite rapidly.\nSam Altman: But if people knew what we could do with more compute, they would want way, way more.\nAndrew Mayne: One of my friends is a new parent and is using ChatGPT a lot to ask questions.\nAndrew Mayne: It's become a very good resource.\nAndrew Mayne: And you are a new parent.\nAndrew Mayne: And how much has ChatGPT been helping you with that?\nSam Altman: A lot.\nSam Altman: I mean, clearly people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time.\nSam Altman: I don't know how I would have done that.\nSam Altman: Those first few weeks, it was like every, I mean, constantly.\nSam Altman: Now I kinda ask it questions about like developmental stages more because\nAndrew Mayne: I can.\nSam Altman: I can do the basics, but\nAndrew Mayne: Is this normal?\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: But it was super helpful for that.\nSam Altman: I spend a lot of time thinking about how my kid will use AI in the future.\nSam Altman: It is sort of like, by the way, extremely kid-pilled.\nSam Altman: I think everybody should have a lot of kids.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: A lot of my friends at OpenAI, former colleagues and current ones, are having kids.\nAndrew Mayne: And people go like, oh, what about this AI thing?\nAndrew Mayne: Everyone I know inside is very optimistic in having families.\nSam Altman: I think that's a good sign.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: Like, my kids will never be smarter than AI.\nSam Altman: But also they will grow up.\nAndrew Mayne: Way to set them back.\nSam Altman: there though.\nSam Altman: I mean, they will grow up like vastly more capable than we grew up and able to do things that would just, we cannot imagine.\nSam Altman: And they'll be really good at using AI.\nSam Altman: And obviously, think about that a lot, but I think much more about the, like, what they will have that we didn't than what is gonna be taken away.\nSam Altman: They're like, I don't think my kids will ever be bothered by the fact that they're not smarter than AI.\nSam Altman: I just like, you know, I there's this video that always has stuck with me of a baby or like a little toddler with one of those old glossy magazines going like this on the screen.\nAndrew Mayne: Because it thinks it's an iPad.\nAndrew Mayne: Thought it was\nSam Altman: a broken iPad.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: And, you know, kids born now will just think the world always had extremely smart AI.\nSam Altman: And they will use it incredibly naturally and they will look back at this as like a very, you know, prehistoric time period.\nAndrew Mayne: I saw something on social media where a guy talked about he got tired of talking to his kid about Thomas the Tank Engine.\nAndrew Mayne: So he put it into ChatGPT into voice mode.\nSam Altman: Kids love voice mode\nAndrew Mayne: in ChatGPT.\nAndrew Mayne: And he was like an hour later, the kid's still talking about Thomas the train.\nSam Altman: Again, I suspect there this is not all gonna be good.\nSam Altman: There will be problems.\nSam Altman: People will develop\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nSam Altman: These sort of somewhat problematic or maybe very problematic parasocial relationships and, well, society will have to figure out new guardrails and but the upsides will be tremendous.\nSam Altman: And we society in general is good at figuring out how to mitigate the downsides.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: So, yeah, I think optimistic.\nAndrew Mayne: We're seeing some interesting data where used along in classrooms with a good teacher, good curriculum, ChatGPT becomes very good, used solely by itself as sort of a homework crutch can lead to kids sort of just doing the same thing as trying to Google stuff.\nSam Altman: I was one of those kids that everyone's worried I was just gonna Google everything when it came out and stopped learning.\nSam Altman: You know, it turns out, like, relatively quickly, kids in schools adapt.\nSam Altman: So Yeah.\nSam Altman: I think we'll figure this out.\nAndrew Mayne: Think of what you could have become if you didn't Google everything, Sam.\nAndrew Mayne: You know?\nAndrew Mayne: So we've seen this adoption figures, are really insane.\nAndrew Mayne: It's OpenAI's most popular product.\nAndrew Mayne: Five years from now, is it gonna be ChatGPT?\nSam Altman: I mean, I think ChatGPT will just be a totally different thing five years from now.\nSam Altman: So in some sense, no.\nSam Altman: But will it still be called ChatGPT?\nSam Altman: Probably.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nAndrew Mayne: So it's a solid name.\nAndrew Mayne: So the other thing we hear is AGI, which I'd like to hear your definition of AGI.\nSam Altman: In many senses, if you asked me or anybody else to propose a definition of AGI five years ago based off, like, the cognitive capabilities of software.\nSam Altman: I think the definition many people would have given then is now, like, well surpassed.\nSam Altman: Like, these models are smart now.\nAndrew Mayne: Right.\nSam Altman: And they'll keep getting smarter.\nSam Altman: They'll keep improving.\nSam Altman: I think more and more people will think we've gotten to an AGI system every year.\nSam Altman: Even though the definition will keep pushing out and getting more ambitious, like, more people will still agree to it.\nSam Altman: But, you know, we have systems now that are really increasing people's productivity that are able to do valuable economic work.\nSam Altman: Maybe a better question is what will it take for something I would call superintelligence?\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nSam Altman: If we had a system that was capable of either doing autonomous discovery of new science or greatly increasing the capability of people using the tool to discover new science, that would feel like kind of almost definitionally superintelligence to me and be a wonderful thing for the world, I think.\nAndrew Mayne: So, basically, a lot of it's kind of this gradient where it keeps getting better and better in each one of our definitions.\nAndrew Mayne: I felt like that way when we hit GPT-4 internally playing at this, this, I'm like, there's ten years of runway that we can do so much stuff with this.\nAndrew Mayne: And even when it starts using itself, like, can enter reasoning was really capable.\nAndrew Mayne: But when you're saying it comes up with some new theorem or proof or something, and then, oh, hey.\nAndrew Mayne: We found a better cure for cancer, or I found out some new GLP drug or something.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: I mean, I am a big believer that the high order bit of people's lives getting better is more scientific progress.\nSam Altman: Mhmm.\nSam Altman: That is kind of that is kind of what what limits us.\nSam Altman: And so if we can discover much more, I think that really will have a very significant impact.\nSam Altman: And for me, that would just be, like, a tremendously exciting milestone.\nSam Altman: I think many other great uses of AI will happen too, but that one feels really important.\nAndrew Mayne: Have you seen, like, signs of this you'd see internally?\nAndrew Mayne: Have you seen things that made you go, oh, I think we've kind of figured it out?\nSam Altman: Nothing where I would say we have figured it out, but I would say increasing confidence on the directions to pursue.\nSam Altman: Maybe the, I mean, this is the example everyone talks about, but I think it is still interesting.\nSam Altman: What's happening with people using AI systems to write code and coders being much more productive and thus researchers as well?\nSam Altman: Like, that is a sort of example of, okay.\nSam Altman: It's obviously not doing new science, but it is definitely making scientists able to do their work faster.\nSam Altman: We hear this with o3 all the time from scientists as well.\nSam Altman: So I wouldn't say we figured it out.\nSam Altman: I wouldn't say we know the algorithm where we're just like, alright.\nSam Altman: We can point this thing, and it'll go do science on its own.\nSam Altman: But we're getting good guesses, and the rate of progress is continuing to just be, like, super impressive.\nSam Altman: Watching the progress from o1 to o3 where it was like every couple of weeks, the team was just like, we have a major new idea, and they all kept working.\nSam Altman: It was a reminder of sometimes when you, like, discover a big new insight, things can go surprisingly fast, and I'm sure we'll see that many more times.\nAndrew Mayne: I noticed recently OpenAI had just shifted the model in Operator to o3.\nAndrew Mayne: And I noticed a big improvement\nSam Altman: Way better.\nAndrew Mayne: With operator.\nAndrew Mayne: It and I'd I'd say that the thing that we ran into before was brittleness, is that you have people who promise agentic systems, can do all these things, but the moment it gets to a problem it can't solve, it falls apart.\nSam Altman: Interestingly, speaking of the AGI question, a lot of people have told me that their personal moment was operator with o three, and there's something about watching an AI use a computer pretty well.\nSam Altman: Not perfectly, but it's not.\nSam Altman: It's o3 was a big step forward that feels very AGI like.\nSam Altman: It didn't it didn't really have that effect on me to the same degree, although it's it's quite impressive, but I I've heard that enough times.\nAndrew Mayne: Mine was with Deep Research because that felt like a really agentic use of it.\nAndrew Mayne: And that was when I came back and it produced something on a topic because I had been interested in that was better than I read before because previously all those models would just get a bunch of sources, summarize it.\nAndrew Mayne: But when I watched the system go out on the Internet, get data Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: Follow that, then follow that lead, and then follow back, then come back, like I would've, but better, was interesting.\nSam Altman: I met this guy recently.\nSam Altman: He's like a one of these, like, crazy autodidacts, just obsessed with learning and knows about everything.\nSam Altman: And he uses Deep Research to produce a report on anything he's curious about and then just sits there all day and has gotten good at digesting them fast and know what to ask next.\nSam Altman: And it is like, it is an amazing new tool for people who really have a crazy appetite to learn.\nAndrew Mayne: I built my own app that literally lets me ask questions and it generates audio files for me of this stuff because it's just like that.\nAndrew Mayne: My curiosity probably exceeds my retention.\nAndrew Mayne: And Operator, I'll tell you the magical moment for me, and I'm curious see where the thing's going next, was I was doing a thing on Marshall McLuhan, and I wanted to get a bunch of images of Marshall McLuhan, and I asked her to do it.\nAndrew Mayne: And then all of a sudden, I had a whole folder full of these things, was, for a research thing, would have taken me forever to do.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: I think we're just gonna keep seeing things like this where whatever we thought about what a workflow had to be like and how long something had to take is gonna just change, like, wildly fast.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: How are you using it?\nAndrew Mayne: Deep Research?\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: Science that I'm curious about?\nSam Altman: I'm I'm just in this, like, weird place of I am extremely time strapped.\nSam Altman: If I had more time, I would read like, I would read Deep Research reports preferentially to reading most other things, but I'm sort of short on time to read in general.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: What's neat too is the sharing feature, which I love because now it's easy to share that with somebody else.\nAndrew Mayne: The PDFs are great, and that's cool.\nAndrew Mayne: And I would say that even though we have deep research, we have these tools, there is a model race going on.\nAndrew Mayne: And so the question comes up is like GPT-5.\nAndrew Mayne: And any idea is that with a system like that, we should see an increase in capabilities.\nAndrew Mayne: What is the time frame for GPT-five?\nAndrew Mayne: When are we gonna see this?\nSam Altman: Probably sometime this summer.\nSam Altman: Right.\nSam Altman: I don't know exactly when.\nSam Altman: One thing that we go back and forth on is how much are we supposed to, like, turn up the big number on new models versus what we did with GPT-4o, which is just better and better and better and\nAndrew Mayne: I had to handle the release of GPT-4, right, when that was coming out.\nAndrew Mayne: And meanwhile, I had to kinda do this take test off between that and 3.5.\nAndrew Mayne: And 3.5 kept getting better and better and better.\nAndrew Mayne: And the comparisons I was able to make were changing.\nAndrew Mayne: And so that's my question.\nAndrew Mayne: It's like, yeah, that, you know, like, would I know GPT-5 versus, wow, this is a really good GPT-4.5?\nSam Altman: Not necessarily.\nSam Altman: I mean, it, like, it could go either way.\nSam Altman: Right?\nSam Altman: You could just, like, keep doing iterations of 4.5 or at some point you could call it five.\nSam Altman: It used to be much clearer.\nSam Altman: We would train a model and put it out, and then we would train a new big model and put it out.\nSam Altman: And, you know, now the systems have gotten much more complex, and we can continually post train them to make them better.\nSam Altman: I were thinking about this right now.\nSam Altman: Like, every time let's say we launch GPT-5, and then we update it and update it and update it.\nSam Altman: Should we just keep calling those GPT-5?\nSam Alt\n\n\nMan: Like, we do with GPT-4o, or should we call those 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 so you know which you know when the version changes?\nSam Altman: I don't think we have an answer to this yet, but I think there is something better to do than the way we handled it with 4o.\nSam Altman: We see this periodically.\nSam Altman: Like, sometimes people like one snapshot much better than another, and they might wanna keep using one.\nSam Altman: We gotta figure something out here.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: The challenge is even if you're technically inclined, you can kind of understand, okay, if there's an o before it, I know this.\nAndrew Mayne: But if I want, know, like but then even then it's not clear, should I use o4-mini?\nAndrew Mayne: Should I use o3?\nAndrew Mayne: Should I use this?\nSam Altman: I think this was like an example of this was an artifact of shifting paradigms.\nAndrew Mayne: Mhmm.\nSam Altman: And then we kinda had these two things going at once.\nSam Altman: I think we are near the end of this current problem, but I can imagine a world—I don't know what it is—but I can imagine a world that we discover some new paradigm that again means we need to, like, bifurcate the model tree.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nAndrew Mayne: Even more complicated names.\nSam Altman: I hope we don't have to do that.\nSam Altman: I am excited to just get to GPT-5 and GPT-6, and I think that'll be easier for people to use, and you won't have to think, do I want, you know, o4-mini-high or o3 or 4o?\nAndrew Mayne: o4-mini-high is what I use to code.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: I have a conversation, it's o3.\nSam Altman: I think we will be out of that whole mess soon.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: For now.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: I mean, it's it's fun to have choice when you know what they mean, but it's it's still I think one of the things that's made these things more capable but also harder to understand where the capability is coming from is integrations of things like memory.\nAndrew Mayne: And memory started off as one very simple thing and now memory's got more sophisticated.\nSam Altman: Memory is probably my favorite recent ChatGPT feature.\nSam Altman: Mhmm.\nSam Altman: You know, the first time you could talk to a computer, like GPT-3 or whatever, that felt like a really big deal.\nSam Altman: And now that the computer I feel like it kind of, like, knows a lot of context on me.\nSam Altman: And if I ask it a question with only a small number of words, it knows enough about the rest of my life to be pretty confident in what I want it to do.\nSam Altman: Sometimes in ways I don't even think of.\nSam Altman: Like, that has been a real surprising, like, level up.\nSam Altman: So I and and I hear that from a lot of other people as well.\nSam Altman: There are people who don't like it, but most people really do.\nSam Altman: I think we are heading towards a world where if you want, the AI will just have, like, unbelievable context on your life and give you these super, super helpful answers.\nAndrew Mayne: Which I for me is cool.\nAndrew Mayne: The fact that you can turn it off is also great.\nAndrew Mayne: But one of the challenges came out was in New York Times ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI, they just asked the court to tell OpenAI they had to preserve consumer ChatGPT user records beyond the 30 day window that has to be held for regular reasons.\nAndrew Mayne: And Brad Lightcap just wrote a letter responding to this.\nAndrew Mayne: Could you explain?\nSam Altman: We're gonna fight that, obviously, and I suspect, I hope, but I do think we will win.\nSam Altman: I think it was a crazy overreach of the NYT to ask for that.\nSam Altman: This is someone who says, you know, they value user privacy, whatever.\nSam Altman: But I to, like, look for the silver lining here.\nSam Altman: I hope this will be a moment where society realizes that privacy is really important.\nSam Altman: Privacy needs to be a core principle of using AI.\nSam Altman: You cannot have a company like The New York Times ask an AI provider to compromise user privacy, and I think society needs to—I think it's really unfortunate The New York Times did that—but I hope this accelerates the conversation that society needs to have about how we're going to treat privacy and AI.\nSam Altman: And I hope the answer is, like, we take it very, very seriously.\nSam Altman: People are having quite private conversations with ChatGPT now.\nSam Altman: ChatGPT will be a very sensitive source of information, and I think we need a framework that reflects that.\nAndrew Mayne: So that brings up the other question from people who are using this or skeptical is that OpenAI now has access to this data, and there's the concern one was about training, which OpenAI has been very clear about when or when not.\nAndrew Mayne: It's training.\nAndrew Mayne: You have the option to turn that off.\nAndrew Mayne: The other thing is, like, advertising, things like that.\nAndrew Mayne: What's OpenAI's approach towards that?\nAndrew Mayne: How are you gonna handle that responsibility?\nSam Altman: We haven't done any advertising product yet.\nSam Altman: I kind of—I mean, I'm not totally against it.\nSam Altman: I can point to areas where I like ads.\nSam Altman: I think ads on Instagram, kinda cool.\nSam Altman: I bought a bunch of stuff from them.\nSam Altman: But I am like—I think it'd be very hard to—I mean, take a lot of care to get right.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: People have a very high degree of trust in ChatGPT, which is interesting because like AI hallucinates.\nSam Altman: It should be the tech that you don't trust that much.\nAndrew Mayne: My friends hallucinate too, I trust them too.\nSam Altman: People really—Yeah.\nSam Altman: Do.\nSam Altman: But I think part of that is if you compare us to social media or, you know, web search or something, where you can kinda tell that you are being monetized and the company is trying to, like, deliver you good products and services, no doubt, but also to kind of, like, get you to click on ads or whatever.\nSam Altman: Like, you know, how much how much do you believe that, like, you're getting the thing that that company actually thinks is the best content for you versus something that's also trying to, like, interact with the ads?\nSam Altman: I think there's, like, there's a psychological thing there.\nSam Altman: So, for example, I think if we started modifying the output, like the stream that comes back from the LLM.\nSam Altman: In exchange for who is paying us more, that would feel really bad.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: And I and I would hate that as a user.\nSam Altman: I think that'd be like a trust destroying moment.\nSam Altman: Maybe if we just said, hey, we're never gonna modify that stream, but, like, if you click on something in there that is gonna be what we'd show anyway, we'll, like, we'll get, like, a little bit of the transaction revenue, and it's a flat thing for everybody.\nSam Altman: If if we, you know, have, like, a easy way to pay for it or something, maybe that could work.\nSam Altman: Maybe there could be, like, ads outside the transaction stream.\nSam Altman: Sorry, outside of the LLM stream that are still really great.\nSam Altman: But the burden of proof there, think would have to be very high and it would have to feel like really useful to users and really clear that it was not messing with the LLM's output.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: It's gonna be a difficult one.\nAndrew Mayne: I hope there's a solution.\nAndrew Mayne: I would love to do all my purchasing through ChatGPT or a really good chatbot because a lot of the times I feel like I'm not making the most informed decisions.\nAndrew Mayne: And so mitigating\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: No.\nSam Altman: That's good if we can do it in some sort of really clear and aligned way, but I don't know.\nSam Altman: Like, I love that we build good services.\nSam Altman: People pay us for them.\nSam Altman: It's like very clear.\nSam Altman: It's a\nAndrew Mayne: Well, that's benefit.\nAndrew Mayne: That's like, I'd say the difference in models is like, I think Google builds great stuff.\nAndrew Mayne: I think the new Gemini 2.5 is a really good model.\nAndrew Mayne: I think they went from\nSam Altman: It is a really good model.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: They went from kinda like, and like, oh, man, these things are good.\nAndrew Mayne: But end of the day, Google is an ad tech company.\nAndrew Mayne: And that's the thing that always kind of, you know, I, you know, using their API and stuff is not as too concerned, although, but I do think about like, man, if I'm using their chatbot, that whatever, that is my thinking is that their where their incentives are aligned.\nSam Altman: Google Search was an amazing product for a long time.\nSam Altman: It does feel to me like it's degraded.\nSam Altman: But, you know, there was like a time where there were lots of ads, but I still thought it was the best thing on the Internet.\nSam Altman: I mean, I love Google search.\nSam Altman: So I don't like, it's clearly possible to be a good ad driven company, but and I, like, respect a lot of things Google has done, but there are obviously issues too.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: The Apple model, as an Apple user, I liked was I know paying a lot for my phone, but I know they're not trying to cram all these things in it.\nAndrew Mayne: They did iAds, which was, you know, not terribly effective, which probably showed you their heart was really not in it.\nSam Altman: Their heart was really not in it.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: So it's gonna be interesting.\nAndrew Mayne: I guess we just have to keep watching and seeing this and we start to think, man, know, ChatGPT is really pushing this.\nAndrew Mayne: I need to start wondering about this.\nSam Altman: Anything we do, we obviously need to just be like crazy upfront and clear about.\nAndrew Mayne: So we had an issue, there was a model update and then the thing that happened was apparently the model was trying to be a little bit too pleasing, was trying to be a little bit too agreeable.\nAndrew Mayne: And that brings up the human AI interaction as people are using these systems more and developing these relationships with that.\nAndrew Mayne: Like, do you see the shape of that coming and what's OpenAI's position on personality?\nSam Altman: One of the big mistakes of the social media era was the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended negative consequences on society as a whole and maybe even individual users.\nSam Altman: Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted or someone thought that user wanted in the moment, which is get them to, like, keep spending time on the site.\nSam Altman: And that was the was the big misalignment of of social media.\nSam Altman: And I think there were a lot of other things like, you know, making people upset kind of gets them stuck on more than being like happy and content.\nSam Altman: And I always knew that there'd be like new problems in the world with AI.\nSam Altman: Where the thing that, you know, there'd be like something that was, like, misaligned in a not obvious way.\nSam Altman: But definitely one of the first ones that we experienced was if you ask a user what they for one given response versus and then you try to, like, build a model that is most helpful to the user.\nSam Altman: And you show a user, say, two responses, which one's more helpful to you?\nSam Altman: On any given thing, you might wanna model to behave one way, but over the course of, you know, all your interaction with an AI, that might not match up.\nSam Altman: You know, you can see and we did see these problems where if you pay too much attention to the user signals and a lot of other things that we talked about in our our postmortem, but that I think this is just, an interesting one.\nSam Altman: On the short horizon, you kind of don't get the behavior that the user most wants or is most helpful or useful or healthy to a user in the long run.\nSam Altman: So, you know, maybe the analogy to filter bubbles is going to be AIs that are, you know, helpful to a user in a short amount horizon, but not over a long horizon.\nAndrew Mayne: Why, I think a sign of that was DALL-E 3, which I thought technically was a really capable model, but they all kinda started to be one kind of genre of image.\nAndrew Mayne: And and and all kinda like an HDR sort of style, and was that from doing that sort of comparisons where users said, looking in just these two things in isolation, I prefer this one better?\nSam Altman: I don't remember for DALL-E 3, but I would assume so.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: Which I think it's gotten better.\nAndrew Mayne: New image model is like The new image model is fantastic.\nAndrew Mayne: Crazy good.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: And I can only imagine where that's gonna go from here.\nAndrew Mayne: So when you're building these things and you're increasing usage, and that's always been sort of a problem, the new image model comes out and you have to restrict usage and you have to have, like you have Sora, which you can only have a certain amount of compute to do that, illustrates the big problem everybody's facing, which is compute.\nAndrew Mayne: And so to address this, we heard about Project Stargate, which has a very cool name and it involves computers.\nAndrew Mayne: Other than that, I think a lot of people are going in their price tag, you know, half a trillion dollars.\nAndrew Mayne: People are going like, wait.\nAndrew Mayne: What?\nAndrew Mayne: What what is the simple description I give to my mom about Stargate?\nSam Altman: I think it's just it's quite simple.\nSam Altman: It's an effort to finance and build an unprecedented amount of compute.\nSam Altman: It's totally true that people we don't have enough compute to let people do what they want.\nSam Altman: But if people knew what we could do with more compute, they would want way, way more.\nSam Altman: So there's this incredibly huge gap between what we could what we can offer the world today and what we could offer the world with 10 times more compute or someday, hopefully, a 100 times more compute.\nSam Altman: And a thing that is different about AI than other technologies I've worked on or at least AI at the scale of delivering it usefully to hundreds of millions, billions of people around the world is just how big the infrastructure investment has to be.\nSam Altman: And and so Starg\n\n\nStargate is an effort to pull a lot of capital and technology and operational expertise together to build the infrastructure to go deliver the next generation of services to all the people who want them and make intelligence as abundant and cheap as possible.\nAndrew Mayne: So it is a massive project, global project.\nAndrew Mayne: We talked before, one of the partners is The UAE.\nAndrew Mayne: You're working at that.\nAndrew Mayne: You're working with other governments around the world on this.\nAndrew Mayne: One of the considerations is, you know, one, been asked on social media, half a trillion dollars, 500,000,000,000.\nAndrew Mayne: Do you have the money?\nSam Altman: Don't literally have it sitting in the bank account today,\nAndrew Mayne: but we are Is it in the room right now?\nSam Altman: It's not the room today.\nSam Altman: But we will deploy it over the next not even that many years.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nSam Altman: You know, unless something, like, really goes wrong and it turns out we can't build these computers.\nSam Altman: I'm confident that people are are good for it.\nSam Altman: I went recently to the first site that we're building out in Abilene.\nSam Altman: That'll be about, you know, roughly 10% of all of of all of the initial commitment to Stargate, the the sort of 500,000,000,000.\nSam Altman: It's incredible to see.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: It is a like, I knew in my head what a order of gigawatt scale site looks like.\nSam Altman: But then to go see one being built and the, like, thousands of people running around doing construction and going to, like, you know, stand inside the rooms where the GPUs are getting installed and just, like, look at how complex the whole system is and the speed with which it's going is quite something.\nSam Altman: We'll have more to share about the next sites soon, but there's a great quote about a pencil, just like a standard, you know, wood and graphite pencil and how no one person Yeah.\nSam Altman: Could build it.\nSam Altman: And and it's it's this like magic of capitalism.\nAndrew Mayne: Mhmm.\nSam Altman: It's miracle really that like that the world gets coordinated to do these things.\nSam Altman: And and standing inside of the first Stargate site, I was really just thinking about the the global complexity that it took to get these racks of GPUs running.\nSam Altman: You know, when you get your phone out and you type something into ChatGPT and you get the answer back, you you probably this point, you probably don't even think that's, like, particularly surprising.\nSam Altman: You just expect it to work.\nSam Altman: There was a time, maybe the first time you tried it, we're like, that is really amazing.\nSam Altman: But the work that happened over the last thousand or at least many hundreds of years of people working incredibly hard to get these hard won scientific insights and then to build the engineering and the companies and the complex supply chains and kind of reconfigure the world that had to happen to get this, like, rack of magic put somewhere.\nSam Altman: Think about all the stuff that went into that.\nSam Altman: The, you know, that and trace it all the way back to people that were just, like, digging rocks out of the ground and seeing what happened so that you now get to just, you know, type something into ChatGPT and it does something for you.\nAndrew Mayne: I read a behind the scenes story about the development of Project Stargate and the international partnerships, particularly The UAE, and that Elon Musk had tried to derail that.\nAndrew Mayne: And what have you seen?\nAndrew Mayne: What have you heard?\nAndrew Mayne: What's the take on that?\nSam Altman: I had said, I think also externally, but at least internally after the election that I didn't think Elon was going to abuse his power in the government to unfairly compete.\nSam Altman: And I regret to say I was wrong about that.\nSam Altman: I mean, I don't like being wrong in general, but mostly I just think it's really unfortunate for the country that he would do these things, and I didn't think I genuinely didn't think he was going to.\nSam Altman: I'm grateful that the administration has really done the right thing and stuck up to that kind of behavior.\nSam Altman: But yeah, it sucks.\nAndrew Mayne: Well, think the thing that's changed, and I think Greg Brockman had just talked about this, where there was a couple years ago where people thought, like, okay, whoever gets there first is the winner, and that's it, and the game is over.\nAndrew Mayne: And now we realize there are great AI labs elsewhere.\nAndrew Mayne: Like Anthropic is building great tools.\nAndrew Mayne: I think Google's really got its game up.\nAndrew Mayne: There's good stuff happening everywhere, and it's not gonna be that one person runs away with I agree.\nAndrew Mayne: And so it seems\nSam Altman: I yeah.\nSam Altman: The the example that I like the most is the discovery of AI was analogous to this, not perfect, but close, to the discovery of the transistor in many surprising number of ways.\nSam Altman: But many companies are gonna build great things on that, and then eventually it's gonna, like, seep into almost all products.\nSam Altman: But you won't think about using transistors all the time.\nSam Altman: So, yeah, I think a lot of people are gonna build really successful companies built on this incredible scientific discovery.\nSam Altman: And I wish Elon would be less zero sum about it.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nSam Altman: Or negative sum.\nAndrew Mayne: I think the pie is just gonna get bigger and bigger if we think about that.\nAndrew Mayne: I was just at an energy conference, and it was interesting talking to the people who were involved in energy production and stuff and hyperscaling, the term they used for this was a topic.\nAndrew Mayne: And that does bring up, like, the energy requirements.\nAndrew Mayne: I know that for, Grok 3, apparently, I guess they had to put generators in the parking lot to be able to train that model.\nAndrew Mayne: And that's the question is, like, how where is the energy gonna come from?\nAndrew Mayne: Money, I understand.\nAndrew Mayne: Energy, to think of when we talk about the scale of energy needed.\nSam Altman: I think kinda everywhere.\nSam Altman: Right.\nSam Altman: I think it's a big mix right now.\nSam Altman: Eventually, I think a lot of I'm very excited about advanced nuclear, both fission and fusion.\nSam Altman: But for now, I think it's it's a whole mix of the entire portfolio.\nSam Altman: Right.\nSam Altman: Gas, solar, I mean, really nuclear, everything.\nAndrew Mayne: So all of the above and stuff.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: I was talking to people that were some of them worked in areas like in Alberta where they said we have a lot of access to energy and not as much for it there, etcetera.\nAndrew Mayne: And now this is just this total picture I hadn't even thought about.\nSam Altman: You know, traditionally, it's very hard to move energy around the world.\nSam Altman: Most kinds.\nSam Altman: But if you exchange energy for intelligence and then move the intelligence around the world, it's much easier.\nSam Altman: So you could put the giant training center or even the big inference clusters in a lot of places and then just, like, ship the output over the Internet.\nAndrew Mayne: There was a speaker at at opening.\nAndrew Mayne: I came to an event, and it was somebody who's working, think it was the James Webb Space Telescope.\nAndrew Mayne: And he talked about his biggest bottleneck was they're about to get all of this, you know, terabytes of data, but he doesn't have enough scientists to work on it.\nAndrew Mayne: Doesn't have enough people to go through the data.\nAndrew Mayne: And here we have these answers about the universe, whatever in front of us, and it's like a big data problem.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: I've always joked that one thing we should do when we have enough money, when OpenAI has enough money, is just build a gigantic particle accelerator and solve high energy physics once and for all.\nSam Altman: Cause I think that'd be like a triumphant, wonderful thing.\nSam Altman: But I wonder what are the odds that a really, really smart AI could look at the data we currently have\nAndrew Mayne: Mhmm.\nSam Altman: With no more data, no bigger particle accelerator and just figure it out.\nSam Altman: It's not impossible.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: And and, yeah, so there's this question of like, okay, there's already a lot of data out there.\nSam Altman: There's a lot of smart people in the world, but we don't know how far intelligence can go.\nSam Altman: With no more experiments, how much more could we figure out?\nAndrew Mayne: I remember reading some of talk about how in early nineteen nineties somebody had found like a form of Ozempic, alright, and presented it to like a drug company to this and they said, nah, we're gonna pass on that.\nAndrew Mayne: And that's been a life changing drug for people, like for people who've just basically done chronic obesity, whatever, it's gonna improve the quality of life, you think, this was sitting there for twenty five years.\nSam Altman: I suspect there's a lot of other examples that we'll find where maybe we already have existing drugs that we know do something good, but they're reusable in some other big way or with a couple of small modifications, we are very close to something great.\nSam Altman: And it's been very heartening to hear from scientists using the even the current generation models for this kind of work.\nAndrew Mayne: So it sounds like one of the things we're gonna need though for next generation models is models that understand physics and chemistry and stuff.\nAndrew Mayne: Is Sora sort of a stab at that?\nSam Altman: I mean, it'll understand like Newtonian physics.\nSam Altman: I don't know if it'll help us with discovering new chemistry and sort of like new, like novel physics or novel theoretical physics or whatever you'd like.\nSam Altman: But I think I'm optimistic that the techniques we use for the reasoning models will help us with those things a lot.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nAndrew Mayne: And what is the short definition of how a reasoning model works versus just me asking GPT-4.1 something?\nSam Altman: So the GPT models can reason a little bit.\nSam Altman: And in fact, one of the one of the things that got people really excited in the early days of the GPT models was you could get better performance by telling the model, let's think step by step.\nSam Altman: And it would then just output text that was thinking step by step and get a better answer, which was sort of amazing that that worked at all.\nSam Altman: The reasoning models are just pushing that much further.\nAndrew Mayne: So it's the idea of like, when it's able to break the question down, it can send more time on each step.\nSam Altman: When you ask me something, a question, I, if it's a really easy question, I might just fire back like almost on reflex with the answer.\nSam Altman: But if it's a harder question, I might think in my head and have like my internal monologue go and say, well, I could do this or that or maybe maybe, you know, this will be clearer.\nSam Altman: I'm not sure about that.\nSam Altman: And I could like backtrack and retrace my steps.\nSam Altman: And then when I finished thinking and I've, you know, been thinking in English, I can then, you know, make some bullet points and then kind of like, I'll put an answer to you in English.\nAndrew Mayne: One of the interesting things I've observed now when I use the app, if I ask a Deep Research question or something and I go away on my lock screen, I get the it's still processing and thinking about it.\nAndrew Mayne: And I heard somebody, another company, forget who was, was using a metric of how long something spent.\nAndrew Mayne: I think it was Anthropic.\nAndrew Mayne: Like I said, hey, this model actually spent like fifteen minutes or thirty minutes or whatever length of time to think about a thing, which is a good metric, but it needs to actually give you the right answer.\nAndrew Mayne: And I thought that was sort of just interesting paradigm of\nSam Altman: One thing I have been surprised by is people are surprisingly willing to wait for a great answer.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: Even if models are think for a while.\nSam Altman: All of my instincts have been, you know, the instant response is the thing that matters and users hate to wait.\nSam Altman: And for a lot of stuff, that's true.\nSam Altman: But for hard problems with a really good answer, people are quite willing to wait.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: So we have all these tools, all these things.\nAndrew Mayne: So far, I'm using my phone.\nAndrew Mayne: And now OpenAI just announced that you guys are building hardware.\nAndrew Mayne: You had the video with you and Jony Ive talking about you guys been talking about and collaborating for a couple years.\nAndrew Mayne: Obviously, you can't I mean, well, I could ask you this.\nAndrew Mayne: Is is it on you right now?\nSam Altman: No.\nSam Altman: It is not.\nAndrew Mayne: Alright.\nSam Altman: It's gonna be a while.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nSam Altman: We're gonna try to do something at like a crazy high level of quality and that that does not come fast.\nSam Altman: But computers, software and hardware, just the way we think of current computers, were designed for a world without AI.\nSam Altman: And now we're in, like, a very different world, and what you want out of hardware and software is changing quite rapidly.\nSam Altman: You might want something that is way more aware of its environment, that has way more context in your life.\nSam Altman: You might wanna interact with it in a different way than, like, typing and looking at a screen.\nSam Altman: And we've been exploring that for a while, and we've got a couple of ideas we're really quite excited about.\nSam Altman: I think it will take time for people to get used to what it means to use a computer in this kind of a world because it is so different now.\nSam Altman: But if you, like, really trusted an AI to understand all the context of your life and your question and make good judgments on your behalf where you could, like, have it sit in a meeting, listen to the whole meeting, know what it was, like, allowed to share with who and what it shouldn't share with anyone and, you know, kind of what your preferences would be.\nSam Altman: And then you ask it one question, you trust that it's gonna go do the right follow ups with the right people and do like you can then imagine a totally different kind of how you use a computer to get done what you want.\nAndrew Mayne: So kind of the way we interact with ChatGPT is kind of kind of inform the device.\nSam Altman: I mean, could also say that the way we interact with ChatGPT was informed by the previous generation of devices.\nSam Altman: So I think it is this sort of like co evolving thing, but yeah, I hope so.\nAndrew Mayne: One of the things that made the phone so ubiquitous was the fact that I can be in public and look at the screen.\nAndrew Mayne: I can be in\n\n\nPrivate and have a phone call and talk to it.\nAndrew Mayne: And I think that's one of the challenges for new devices is that trying to bridge that gap between what we use in public and private.\nSam Altman: Phones are unbelievable things.\nSam Altman: I mean, they are really fantastic for a lot of reasons.\nSam Altman: And you can imagine one new device that you could use everywhere, but also like there's some things that I do do differently publicly and probably like at home, I've got great stereo system built in the music.\nSam Altman: When I'm walking the world, I use AirPods and that doesn't bother me.\nSam Altman: Yeah.\nSam Altman: So I think there are things that are different in the public and private use case, but the general purposeness, I agree is important.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: It follows you with it.\nAndrew Mayne: So nothing yet until maybe next year.\nSam Altman: It's gonna be a while.\nAndrew Mayne: Alright.\nSam Altman: It will be worth the wait, hope, but it's gonna be a while.\nAndrew Mayne: Okay.\nAndrew Mayne: I'm I'm excited and curious.\nAndrew Mayne: I have thoughts.\nAndrew Mayne: So if you're giving advice to a 25 old right now, what do tell them?\nSam Altman: I mean, the obvious tactical stuff is probably what you'd expect me to say, like learn how to use AI tools.\nSam Altman: It's funny how quickly the world went from telling, you know, the average 20 year old, 25 year old learn to program Mhmm.\nSam Altman: To program it doesn't matter.\nSam Altman: Learn to use AI tools.\nSam Altman: I wonder what will be next, but of course, there will be something next.\nSam Altman: But that's that's very good tactical advice.\nSam Altman: And then on the sort of like broader front, I believe that skills like resilience, adaptability, creativity, figuring out what other people want.\nSam Altman: I think these are all surprisingly learnable.\nSam Altman: And it's not as easy as say, like, go practice using ChatGPT, but it is doable.\nSam Altman: And those are the kind of skills that I think will pay off a lot in the next, you know, couple of decades.\nAndrew Mayne: And would you say same thing for 45 year olds is just learn how to use it in your role now?\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: Probably.\nAndrew Mayne: Whenever we have whatever your personal definition of AGI, will more people be working for OpenAI after then or before?\nAndrew Mayne: More.\nAndrew Mayne: More.\nAndrew Mayne: So, yeah.\nAndrew Mayne: I see a lot of online people like, oh, they're they're so good.\nAndrew Mayne: Why are they hiring people?\nAndrew Mayne: I'm like, because computers can't do everything.\nAndrew Mayne: They're not gonna do everything.\nSam Altman: The slightly longer answer with more than one word is that there will be more people, but each of them will do vastly more than what one person did, you know, in the pre AGI times.\nAndrew Mayne: Right.\nAndrew Mayne: Which is the goal of technology.\nAndrew Mayne: Yeah.\n",
