  "cleanText": "Hey, this is a quick programming note from me, Jason. Uh, and it's gonna be followed by another note and intro before we do the podcast. I'm very sorry, very annoying, but for the first time since we founded 404 Media in August 2023, uh we're all collectively taking a week off. So, there's no normal episode this week. I wanted to just do like a really quick explanation and thanks uh to everyone. So, for the nearly two years since we founded this company, we've been hustling super hard. Uh, this is because we love the work that we do and we think that it's really important, but it's also because publishing a lot of things is how people find out about us and it's how we grow. So, we're not used to breaks because we know that the best way to build an audience and a business of people who read our articles is to actually write a lot of articles and record a lot of podcasts. And so, that's what we've been doing. The last few months have been particularly crazy uh as we've been covering Elon Musk takeover of the federal government, followed directly by the creeping surveillance state, Trump's mass deportation campaign, AI's role in stomping all over workers, the general destruction of the Internet, and of course, the more uplifting stories of all the people fighting back against this sort of thing and doing DIY stuff and doing all the things that we care about. At the moment, we have more story leads than we can possibly get to. And we're really, really excited for the second half of the year. But I wanted to thank everyone who's listening to this because when we started this company, we had no idea if anyone would subscribe or if anyone would listen to our podcast or if anyone would read anything that we did. We had really no idea how it would go. We took zero investment from anyone. And we hope that if we did good work often enough, enough people would decide that they wanted to support independent journalism. And we hope that we could make a job out of it. And we also hope that we can make a sustainable business that would work for the long haul. We didn't take it for granted then and we don't take your support for granted now. But because of your support, we now feel like we don't have to scratch and claw for every possible new dollar that we can get. And y'all have given us the breathing room in our business to quite literally take a breather ourselves. So, there's not going to be any new posts on the site this week. There is this podcast, but we are all chilling out. We're not tired really. I think I personally at least feel more energized and ambitious than ever knowing that there's so many people out there who enjoy our work and are willing to financially support it, but we also don't want to burn ourselves out and also we had like vacations planned for the holiday. So therefore, uh school's out for summer for one week. We'll be back to our regular programming next week. Hey everyone, this is Jason. Uh, I mentioned this last time I did an interview episode, but we're going to start doing more of these about all sorts of topics. This week, I'm talking to our friend and my friend Casey Johnston, a tech journalist turned fitness journalist. Casey studied physics, which led her to tech journalism. She did some of my favorite coverage of Internet culture, as well as Apple's horrendous butterfly laptop keyboards, if you remember those. We worked together at VICE where Casey was an editor and where she wrote Ask a Swole Woman, which was an advice column about weightlifting. After she left VICE, Casey founded She's a Beast, an independent site and newsletter about weightlifting, but also about the science of diet culture, fitness influencers on the Internet, the intersection of all those things, etc. She just wrote A Physical Education: How I Escaped Diet Culture and Gained the Power of Lifting, a really great reported memoir about how culture and the media often discourages people from lifting. How this type of exercise can be really beneficial to your brain and your body and it's a really great book. Uh, I found the book really inspiring and actually started lifting right after I read it. In this interview, we talk about the book, about journalism, about independent media, and about how doing things like lifting weights and touching grass helps us navigate the world. Here's my interview with Casey.\n\n[Music]\n\nCasey, hello.\nWelcome to the 404 Media podcast.\nIt's uh so excited to be here.\nI'm going to grill you.\nThat's always what happens with podcasts.\nThey're always you think it's going to be a nice chill time with your friends and then it turns out to be an interrogation.\nYeah, a real gotcha situation.\nUm, so I guess like a little bit of background is uh we are friends also colleagues, but I think this is our first like recorded conversation.\nUm, I think that's I think that's correct.\nI think that's correct.\nUm, so Casey and I used to work together at VICE but knew each other before that. And Casey started as a tech reporter.\nIs that I mean I guess you did many things but I I knew you most as a extremely good tech reporter and who wrote many many iconic blogs probably uh most famously about butterfly keyboards uh on the MacBook.\nMhm.\nThat was really after I stopped being a tech blogger proper but one of my proudest blogs for sure.\nYeah.\nI think uh I think you single-handedly got Apple to change their keyboard design.\nI think I did too because a lot of people were were um sort of soft pedaling the situation where they were like the keyboards like they were I think they were like I'm having some issues but there's no indicator that like it's a real issue and it might be just me.\nAnd then I wrote this thing that was like I'm pretty sure it's not just me.\nI think the keyboard might be total garbage.\nAnd this is like still when I mean I don't know you lived through the era when like it was it felt dangerous to like criticize cuz Apple fanboys used to be like what gamer gators are now a little bit like that's maybe a overly facitious comparison but they were people were afraid to like criticize Apple too much.\nSo Apple fanboys were really intense for sure, but then also Apple PR was kind of relentless as I recall where they would they would ignore me a lot, but then when they decide not to ignore you, they would like relentlessly call and yell.\nUm, my scariest like PR situation ever, not scariest, but kind of like the wildest one was when Motherboard wrote an article called AirPods Are a Tragedy about the environmental impact of AirPods.\nAnd we had a fantastic article uh by uh Caroline Haskins who was a new writer at the time.\nUh she works at Wired now and and she was my intern before that I think at the outline.\nYeah, there's a a That is correct.\nFull circle.\nUh, and she was like, &quot;Oh, uh, Apple wants to talk about the story.\nI'm going to hop on the phone with them.&quot;\nAnd I was like, &quot;Let me come also because they're probably going to be pretty mad.&quot;\nAnd there were like six people on the line.\nLike six Apple PR people on the line.\nPoor Caroline.\nJeez.\nBut anyways, uh, that is already we have digressed.\nWe're talking to you today because you have a new book out.\nUh it is called A Physical Education: How I Escape Diet Culture and Gain the Power of Lifting.\nUh which is about weightlifting and your journey which is not something that we talk about very often here but or really ever here but I was going to say how often do you talk about weightlifting on this podcast?\nProbably never.\nI think this is probably the first mention of weightlifting in any way, shape or form.\nYeah.\nUh we do sometimes talk about surfing and recently I talked about baseball for like 30 minutes.\nSo weightlifting like is technology just old technology.\nSo it's like more relevant than either of the things that you just said.\nI feel like I think that that is accurate.\nAnd I also was going to say that you approach weightlifting from a scientific lens for sure and also with the background of both being a science reporter and a technology writer.\nAnd so uh there's that.\nAnd then also we can have anyone on the podcast that we want to have on.\nThere's no rules.\nBut uh you also are an independent journalist uh who owns She's a Beast uh which is a bi-weekly bi-weekly as in twice a week newsletter that is hosted on Ghost which is what we're also hosted on.\nOur frequently asked questions for subscribers is cribbed from you and you uh I feel like you pushed me to begin 404 Media or to think about doing it and then also uh like pushed me to use Ghost and not a different one.\nSo, not that you needed like any reason to be on here other than writing a really fantastic book that we're going to talk about.\nCasey Johnston just like hovers over the whole for the whole enterprise operation.\nThe whole the whole enterprise.\nUm, so yes.\nUh, I wanted to talk about the book though and then we can get back to indie media maybe toward the end.\nFor sure.\nUm, I have been reading your work for a long time.\nUh, Ask a Swolewoman was an advice column where you answered people's questions about weightlifting and then She's a Beast expanded out upon that.\nBut I never weightlifted.\nLike I never really like I read those and I was like, &quot;Oh, this is very interesting to me.\nThis is like well reported and it seems like Casey's inspiring a lot of people to pick up weightlifting.&quot;\nBut I did not do that.\nBut then I got A Physical Education your book and I read it for one hour and I immediately joined a gym and I immediately started weightlifting and I've been doing right there three times a week in a way it's like not my impact because I didn't have the impact until however this is like the average experience of my writing.\nI feel like over the years I'll get people who find my writing and they're like love your writing read every single thing.\nI'm never on my life ever going to lift weights.\nAnd then several years later, they write to me and they're like, &quot;So, you were right.\nI finally tried lifting and it's changed my everything and I wish I had done it sooner.&quot;\nSo, that's always how it goes.\nPeople always feel bad and I'm like, &quot;You all take a while to warm up to this stuff.\nIt's totally fine.&quot;\nDo you remember when you got a pull-up bar and you were going to install it in the office right before the pandemic?\nI did.\nAnd there's an entire there's a few chapters in your book about pull-ups.\nAnd I then gave you the pull-up bar or I bought the pull-up bar for you to to do it at the office cuz we were going to do it at the VICE office, right?\nAnd then uh the pandemic happened.\nSo I took it to my apartment, right?\nAnd then I moved to California and I gave you the pull-up bar.\nWell, I think what you had actually bought was basically like a squat stand, and it wasn't a nice one, and it was maybe even mainly a pull-up bar, but you could turn it into you could like put the hooks on it and turn it into a squat stand, which is what I did.\nUm, and I had it until we moved out of New York.\nBut, um, yeah, that might have if not for the pandemic, you might have gotten into lifting at that time.\nI may have.\nI may have.\nAnd I promise that like I I want to hear so much about the book, but I feel like this this thing that you just described where people read your work and they say, &quot;Oh, I'm never going to lift.&quot;\nAnd then they end up lifting later.\nDo you have any sense like why that happens?\nLike you you incept people and then it takes them a while to to warm up to it and then they sort of just go and do it.\nYeah.\nI mean, you could describe my journey kind of that way where it was like it just feels so maybe unfamiliar or off the beaten path of like what quote unquote normal exercises.\nLike I've written a couple or at least one column about this on She's a Beast where it's like we have a sort of built-in literacy of like cardio because so much of our gym classes is cardio.\nSo, it's like even if you think you don't know anything about exercising, you probably at some point had to like run the mile in presidential fitness.\nSo, you at least know there's a concept of like pacing yourself and like you're um running for time and like what it feels like when you're running at a speed that is sustainable for you versus one that's too hard and you have to slow down.\nIt's like that kind of incremental um familiarity with a type of physical activity is we don't have anything at least like when I was a kid when you were a kid when most people who are now adults are kids did not have any anything in our lives or schools that like helped us grasp the fundamentals of lifting in that same way.\nSo it just feels like totally unfamiliar in the way that like a lot of regular sports or cardio don't.\nUm so it takes some time to sort of like you you probably think you don't know anyone who does it until you become more aware of it.\nIt's like when you I don't know learn about a new type of car and then you start seeing that car everywhere.\nIt's like you learn about it, then you start seeing it everywhere, and you're like, maybe this isn't so weird or abnormal, and then you can sort of wrap your mind around doing it yourself.\nYeah.\nSo, there's a there's a couple things in the preface that really spoke to me.\nUm, and I think that like right away when I started reading this book, I was like, I actually I need to go try weightlifting right now.\nUm, and I luckily live very close to Muscle Beach in Venice, which is where Arnold Schwarzenegger uh famously lifted a lot.\nSo, well, it's like famously the birthplace of like all modern bodybuilding culture.\nSo, it's like you just happen to live at the cradle of life of what I do now.\nYeah.\nAnd I always thought that I when I moved here, I was like maybe I'll join for a laugh sometime just to say that I did.\nAnd now I'm like uh going four times a week.\nSo, I'm like the thing to know about it is that I didn't know about it for a long time is that it just like is a gym that you can join and like pay a monthly fee.\nIt's not just like a when you walk by even it's like what is this?\nIt seems like a platform for like maybe professional somethings to to like I don't even know.\nBut the relationship you can have with\n\n\nIt is like that of a Planet Fitness. Yeah. And when you walk by it, uh, very often they're doing bodybuilding competitions, and they'll have, uh, you know, like spray tan booths and sell like tiny bikinis and things like that, and it's like a very intimidating sort of situation. But it's also incredibly cheap. It's $200 for a year, which is unheard of that cheap anymore.\n\nYeah. So, here's the quote. Uh, you're talking about your appearances on podcasts, and we're probably going to spend the whole time talking about this, but you write, quote, \"Inevitably, one question would always come up on podcasts. What was it about lifting that I loved so much? I would say something along the lines of, quote, \"It completely changed how I think and feel about the world and myself and everything.\" I knew that was true, but I didn't know exactly what I meant, and I didn't have the words to put it in more specific terms. This book became about finding them. Um, and that, that's why I like the book so much and your writing so much because you're very often writing about the, like, not how to do weightlifting, but the culture of weightlifting and also the culture that permeates our lives that prevents people from weightlifting. Uh, specifically diet culture, where you write here in the book as well. Diet culture is not just a set of well-intentioned, if sometimes misguided, lifestyle suggestions. Many of its patterns are directly, insidiously harmful, not just psychologically, but biologically in ways that engrave themselves again and again upon our brains and bodies.\n\nAnd the book I feel is a mix of a memoir as well as like reported science about weightlifting and what it does to your body, what it does to your mental health, and also why we feel the way that we feel about weightlifting. Does that sound like a correct summary of the book?\n\nYeah. I mean, now I think kind of what I do in general as like sort of translating the benefits of this thing that at least formerly had a pretty niche place in our culture to an audience that I feel like I'm a part of, a wider audience that is almost maybe feels diametrically opposed to something like lifting or even working out in general, and I'm my role is kind of saying, actually, here's a bunch of things that are not maybe well known about lifting that might interest you. So yeah, it sort of uses my story as kind of like scaffolding for all of this information that I feel like is not widely known about how dieting works and how dieting is specifically destructive to our bodies and our brains. Like it literally, no one ever said this to me when I, when I was dieting, and I think it's still not widely said, but it like literally makes you stupid. Like you, you, um, think you can't think as well when you don't, when you aren't fed, especially like chronically over a long time. You don't have to be, um, starved and like on your deathbed in order for that to be true. It can be sort of like long-term moderate to semi-aggressive caloric deprivation leads to like dulled, literally dulled senses. And, um, there's a lot of things that about strength training that are specifically corrective to the dieting that we so commonly engage in or the calorie burning and like the, the weight loss that we just sort of see as an obligatory part of being a grown-up in the world is that like you deny your cravings and you lose weight and you, um, exercise because it's like, quote unquote, good for do. Um, and I, I've been saying about this book, like this is not a long refer or, um, like a lecture on like why working out is good for you. Like everyone knows working out is good for you. It's about the all of the things that, um, all of the dynamics at play between how, how we commonly understand the stuff to work and like how it could work if we sort of knew a little more. I had a, uh, writer who was interviewing me for Vanity Fair while we were talking said something like, \"It's your book is about powerlifting in the way that Friday Night Lights is about football.\"\n\nMhm.\n\nAnd I was like, \"That is so perfect.\" And I like, I feel like nothing else needs to be said, really. I, I just, just go around saying that instead of trying to explain myself.\n\nYeah. Uh, so I mean, I knew this about you because we've been friends for a long time, but, uh, you know, the, you came to lifting after many years of dieting and running and cardio, and you sort of describe, uh, like trying to lose weight, stay thin, etc., as this like neverending treadmill. Forgive me. Um, and like this, this like, um, pattern of sort of deprivation and and things like that. And it seems like you felt for a long time that like weightlifting was not for women, or you never even, maybe it never even like occurred to you that it was. And and like you said, it's like our culture has been, has pushed weightlifting off to the side for a long time. And I guess I wanted to give you my perspective of weightlifting in my, cuz I've played tons of sports.\n\nAs a man, no, but I'm cur, I'm curious because like this book is for everyone. Uh, but I feel like some of the things that you describe in here, I also like, I, I avoided weightlifting for a very specific reason, I think. And I'm curious what you think of, of this reason. And so I grew up playing baseball, and in high school we had weightlifting like in the offse. So I did a very small amount of weightlifting in high school for baseball. And I couldn't bench press the barbell. Like I just, I was a very, I was a pretty scrawny kid, and I could not do it. And like the other players on my team made fun of me more or less because I couldn't do it and and they could. And so I was doing like other things in the gym with like dumbbells and lighter weights. And eventually I was able to to bench the barbell, like at age 14 or whatever. Um, and that was one, it was like very embarrassing for me that I, I couldn't do the barbell and everyone else could. And then I also always thought of myself as like good at sports, like, like, uh, good at the skills of sports, but when I thought about the gym and when I thought about people who weightlifted, I always thought of myself as like a smart kid, and I didn't want to be like beefy and roided up and like seen as a meathead more or less, and like so I stayed away from gyms. And when I did go to gyms, I didn't weightlift because I didn't have any clue how to weightlift. I thought that people would make fun of me if I did it wrong. And then also, if I did the machines, if I did weightlift, I would do a machine because there would be a diagram of what to do, and I would like pull down on the little cord, and I would say, \"Okay, I did that. It was fine.\" And I guess like I never really thought about how that persisted in my life for like 25 years, that sort of initial perception of me thinking, probably from movies and also just my experience of getting made fun of like one time, that like weightlifting was for dumb meatheads, and I didn't want to be bulky because I didn't want to be seen as stupid very stereotypically, and I also didn't want to get made fun of, and so I never did it. Uh, and then in the book you describe like some of that stuff, and then the reality of the situation is like none of that is true. People are very, very nice in the gym.\n\nYeah. I mean, I think we like have this cultural perception or like prejudice where we're painting with a broad brush of like, there these two groups of people who want nothing to do with each other, which is the people who like are already strong and go to the gyms, and then people who, you know, their favorite thing about them is their clever thoughts, which is the group that I am in. And I was, I thought similarly, where I was like, I'm really, I'm really just trying to like minimize my body's involvement in how anyone perceives me. Like honestly, to work out more for that to be part of like my thing. I thought that that would supersede my, you know, the perception of me as an intellectual person, and that was what I cared about. Um, so that I think was like a really common judgment, and it still is, and I still worry about it. Like I still feel like I don't get taken as seriously as a writer because of the topic that I write about, despite that I feel like I throw everything I have behind it, and I try to really like, there's people who write about fitness that I get it. This is not, you know, Charles Dickens or whatever, but, um, I really try to bring a lot of heft in terms of the reasoning and like the support and the data and all this stuff. And, um, but still it's like I'm, you know, I don't think I'm probably getting the regard that I still would like to get or that I think I would get if it were a different subject with the same amount of effort put in. Um, but yeah, I think that ultimately what I, the reason that I'm so behind it, even though it's not giving me probably the gratias that I would like to have, I still like, I just feel like it's that important that I had this incredible experience where, among other things, as you're saying, in the gym, I found like a really nice community of people where they were very welcoming of me. Like they really wanted to share their hobby with new people. They know what a new, they could identify a new person at like a thousand yards. They, they knew exactly what was going on, and they tried to like clear a path for me in a lot of ways where they would unload their weights or whatever and be smiling and, you know, like, here's my bench, like I'm all done, like letting me know. Um, but also I liked that they also did a measure of leaving me alone, where they weren't in my business all of the time, and they weren't like, you know, obviously there were a couple of people where they were trying to like sell me their personal training services. But for the most part, the community members sort of like implicitly trusted me to have like sort of find my way about it. And that was really compelling to me as somebody who was like hated having like a million voices in my head and just wanted to have like to be able to figure it out on my own to some extent and to not have somebody like teasing me because, oh, you haven't put in any experience, but you can't bench the bar. It's like, of course, I can't bench the bar. I've like never done this before there. Why should I be able to do that? You know, so that was, that's, that's really interesting because, uh, there can be many, many different goals in weightlifting, and I have just begun them, but you, you talk about the different things that you, uh, you know, the different reasons one might lift, and it's funny when like you start any other hobby or any other skill or sport. It's like if you wave weightlifting is a skill, but it an outsider would probably just measure it by how much can you lift and how many times can you lift it? And what you just said, where it's like, of course, I can't bench the bar. I, I'm just starting this, this thing. It's like the one of the goals of weightlifting is to get strong in a variety of different ways, but you have to start from somewhere. Um, and it's like we don't make fun of people who start other things who don't know the skills from the get- go.\n\nExactly.\n\nYeah. For whatever reason, there's this like perception of lifting that you're only supposed to do it if you can already do it, or like it's sort of already your thing. Like you need it for your job or you're a football player or something, and you're like already strong. So like you need this intense type of working out, where if you don't have a natural, you're not bringing some sort of natural talent to it, then it's like what are you bothering with this for? But it has like what I always find myself saying to people is that the worse you are at it, the less experience you have, the more you have to gain with like barely any effort. Like the, um, ramp up is so fast, and it's only faster the further down you start. It's like if you come in squatting 200 lb, you're not going to progress as fast as somebody like sort of relative to your starting point as somebody who comes in who can only do like a body weight squat or whatever.\n\nYeah. I guess, uh, I'll pause here to say that if you are thinking about getting started, like A Physical Education is not going to teach you how to do it. It's going to more explain the why and and the sort of like, it's, it's going to explain the why to do this. But Couch to Barbarell is the guide for people who have never done this before and and want to learn how to do it. Can you talk a little bit about Couch to Barbarell and how you made it and when it came out and all that sort of thing?\n\nRight. So, yeah, that's also my book, my first book, although I published it myself online. Um, so yeah, I mean, writing this Ask a Swole Woman column, the question that people would always ask me, I would over and over again, no matter how many times I tried to answer it in the sort of column form, was how do I get in? How do I get into lifting? How do I get started? And I honestly, I didn't have that good of an answer. So this book was my attempt to answer it in as thorough a way as possible for an audience that I felt was not well addressed by anyone out there currently because I felt that usually there's, I think it kind of felt like anyone who educates anyone about working out assumes there's like sort of the body weight Pilates yoga, uh, running, whatever people, they're over here, they want to keep doing their body weight stuff, then there's like the people who want to learn to lose weights, and there's nobody who really wants to go from one group to the other, and I was one of those people where it was like I was a runner, I got to a point where I was getting a lot of injuries, and I wanted to try strength training, but I had no, like, I had no ability for it, like a lot of the guides that I found assumed that you could lift a barbell, and I couldn't. So, I had to find all of this, all of these other resources for myself to bridge that gap. So, I was like, what if I made a program that bridged that gap for the people like me, where they're not good at this, but they're bought into the idea that there's something for them there, even though they don't have this natural ability, which you don't need. You shouldn't need to have anyway. This limited edition inbound is September.\n\n\n3rd through 5th.

Secure your spot at inbound.com/register.\n\nThat's inbound.com/register.\n\n[Music]\n\nTo talk a little bit about the why and some of the benefits that weight training has done without turning this into like a science says sort of thing.\n\nI feel like one of the smartest things you ever did was on your website, you have a video of you pulling a gigantic box of Chewy, like uh, pet food uh around, because I feel like if anyone listening to this has pets, you order like a gigantic uh thing of dog food or cat food or whatever, and then like moving that thing around is... you just like throw out your back trying to do it, and and you're just like pulling it around with ease.\n\nMhm.\n\nUh, I want you to talk a little bit about moving through the world with confidence, to like move stuff around, to carry a table around, to carry your pet food around. Like I, I feel like that's very, that that's very appealing.\n\nYeah. I mean, this was like one of the, it wasn't an immediate payoff, but it was so fast because it's like, while my big nemesis was the 40 lb box of cat litter that I had to buy, cuz I had two cats and I had no money, and that's like the cheapest form of litter you can get. But I physically could not budget it, let alone, let alone like get it up all of the stairs to my apartment.\n\nBut 40 lbs in the scheme of learning to lift weights, it doesn't take that long to learn to lift 40 lbs, to learn to squat 40 lbs. You, so the way it works is like you add five or 10 lbs per session every time that you go to the gym. So like in a matter of couple weeks, you might be squatting 40 lbs, um, or benching 40 lbs, overhead pressing 40 lbs.\n\nSo it doesn't, it's not an exact one-to-one translation with a box of cat litter, but like you can build the amount of strength that you, that for like your sort of daily challenges really, really quickly. And um, not only is it the strength, but the sort of like form that goes along with it, like the sort of picking up things in the quote unquote right way with your muscles rather than trying to lug everything with your lower back, which means you're going to throw it, throw it out or get a spasm or whatever. Um, so that was really one of the things that hooked me really quickly was how much of a difference that made.\n\nYeah, that, that's um, again, like I just started, and I'm, I've been an active person my whole life. Like I, there was a period where I was going to yoga quite often, and uh, I stopped going to yoga just cuz I, I stopped like signing up for stuff uh, out of laziness a few months ago. But then I started lifting, and I went to yoga the other day after doing six weeks of lifting, and I realized that I felt a lot more stable. Like I was able to do a lot of the movements that I previously struggled with. Even when I was going to yoga like two or three times a week, like I did when I was going to yoga a lot of a lot, I felt like certain moves were getting easier and like I was maybe in better shape, but I would still struggle with things like chair pose, which is essentially a squat and you hold it for a very long time. And when I went the other day without having done yoga for quite a while, but having done just like a few weeks of weight training, I felt... I just felt like all of my poses were like stronger and better, and I was like moving with more ease. And I felt that surfing also. And um, you know, I've been surfing for a long time, and and I would just like surf every day, and I was getting in much better surfing shape and much better shape. But all of the surfing forums and like people that you talk to about surfing say like, don't weight train because you'll get like bulky, and then you'll get heavier on the board, and then it's like blah, blah, blah. And it's like I did a few weeks of weight training, and I can paddle so much faster and so much better surfing. Like I, I can just tell, I can tell. And so, um, I don't know. I just feel like it's, it's helped out a lot very quickly in terms of just like very basic, like moving through the world stuff.\n\nI'm very happy to hear you say all that because I feel like I say all of these things, and like no one believes you, and not only that, but they say the, they're like, oh, well, you know, maybe that will be true, but then it'll be all undone by this some like bulky argument, which is not um, realistic for anybody, like it, it simply can't, like nobody can grow muscle that fast, like you can add muscle like one pound per month, and that's simply not going to be the difference maker for most people, but anyway, way. Um, yeah, I think the contribution of free weights when you have to stabilize them and they're like on your back or in your arms as opposed to on a machine is super, super, super underrated, especially because I have a column in my like to-do list to write about this, but the fact that not only is the, there this free weight stabilization, which you could say also takes place in like Pilates or yoga or whatever. But with free weights, you're able to do what we call overreach in a systematized way that scales with your ability. But like you can, when you're using your body, you're only sort of building your capacity for your own body. Whereas like essentially you're, when you have weights on you, you're building your capacity for like if someone were to, you know, push you, like you have so much more, your muscles are gaining so much more um, capability in that stabilization task because there's more weight that they're handling in this, in this task, whereas when it's just body weight, it's only your body. So yes, that's like a, a really huge aspect of it that I think would come into play in in surfing also with balance, right? Um, and I think people don't know about it, and I feel like I have not, you know, there's a secret to talking about it. I haven't landed on it yet, but I'm super happy to hear that.\n\nYeah, I, I think um, again, that, that's why I like reading your stuff so much is that it's very practical and pragmatic about this sort of thing in a space that is full of grifters and people trying to sell you stuff, whether that's supplements or uh, weight loss pill or their ebook, which I guess you are trying to sell us your book, but like it's in a straightforward, like I, I'm a journalist who did research sort of way versus a like, you know, grifter way. Um, I want, I, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how you found the fitness, journalism, health, journalism, science, journalism intersection space to be as someone who is coming at it from a very journalistic perspective in a world that's like full of influencers and people trying to, where, where maybe the um, incentive is not super clear. I guess...\n\nI do think there's a lot of grifters, a lot of people who are just trying to make money off of everyone's insecurity and shame, and uh, they know that we feel insecure about how we look or what we eat and the fact that we are not quote unquote taking care of ourselves. And so they're giving us all of these sort of shortcuts to try and be like a quick fix for the, for all of these bad feelings. And a lot of those bad feelings are rooted in, like I mean, part of why I get into all of like my family stuff and my own personal history is because it just sort of gratifies the idea that a lot of this is really complicated for everybody. Like we're told that dieting is simple or that exercise is simple, and then we all feel bad because it's like, why can't I just walk into the gym? Why can't I just like not eat cookies? Like what's wrong with me? But for a lot of us, those things are immensely emotionally complicated and have to do with not just a matter of willpower, but like our sort of built-up experiences in life. And so where was I going with this? I guess the grifting, like I, but I think even if you had the sort of best of intentions, there is a a um, like tendency to try and tell people what they want to hear, and what they want to hear is not always like actually that helpful.\n\nI think this stems from the fact that the traditional sort of like fitness educator in an adult world is like a personal trainer, somebody who works in a gym, and they have people coming to them, and they're like, whatever the person wants, they have to sort of go along with it. If they're like, I want to lose weight for my daughter's wedding, or I want to get huge biceps, it's like the personal trainer does not have space to be like, well, what would actually help first is if we build a strength base for you, and then we can like bring in a calorie deficit, or we can add in some more bicep accessories. It's like they want what they want right now. And your job as the personal trainer is to sort of more than it is to like actually try and take care of their health, is to indulge their like sort of almost fantasy of how things work. Um, so the beauty of the Internet, I feel like is that I can, I can sort of be like, this is my vision for how things should work. You don't have to agree with it. I'm not even really here to like convince anyone per se, but my hope is to find my way organically to people who are who have found themselves on the page of like, okay, I think like full body beginner strength training for a normal person might be where I'm at. Is there a resource for that? And then it's like, here I am. And that feels like a much healthier relationship for both me and all those people out there, you know?\n\nYeah. I, I feel like, so when you left VICE, you started uh, She’s a Beast like very quickly after that. Um, which is a subscription, you know, paid subscription, just like 404 Media. And I, I just felt like it was the perfect thing for you immediately because you had this audience of people who were coming to you for Ask a Swole Woman. And I just, I've maybe I don't know anything about the, you know, exercise, health, like newsletter space per se, but it felt like you were filling a gap that like extremely did not exist at the time, and maybe it, and I think it probably still doesn't exist, like you are that gap. You're, you're like the little uh, domino that's holding up like the entire uh, like science and uh, like facts-based real talk uh, exercise journalism ecosystem. Uh, maybe that's, maybe that's being, I'm sure there's others. I'm sure there's others is what I'm saying, but I'm not sure. Um, but I guess it's just like you, I felt like you were early to the newsletter game. You were, this is a journalism question essentially. It's like, uh, I feel like you were early to the newsletter game. I feel like you built a community very fast. Uh, how, how has it been going for you? Like, how, how, what has the space even looked like? Who are your competitors? What's going on?\n\nRight. I mean, I think I have a combination of like insane passion for lifting, plus like I bring a, you know, science research element into it, plus like a voice that people like. Like I do think that there's people who tell me that, maybe not millions of them, but they're like, I kind of like everything that you write regardless of what it's about. So I think that, you know, a little bit of humor or like sort of candidness or um, you know, playfulness in this subject area is not that common. So I think people respond to that. I think like a lot of this content can be like, I have people that I follow whose content I really appreciate. Um, but it can be maybe a little bit dry as so much research or science-driven content is not that fun to read about. So, I can like take it and um, or like inaccessible, I guess.\n\nYeah. Like pull it all together and sort of sum it up in a way that's like helpful to people where they don't have to then read it all themselves. Um, so yeah, I think there's a lot of like, to me, there's a lot of room. I don't feel like there's like, I'm not like elbowing people out of the way. I mean, like media, unfortunately, has like been, it just like is flushing the toilet every two and a half years, you know, like we lose so many people so fast. It's like if you can just sort of hang on, that's a big factor in success. Not only hang on, I guess, but like also have some integrity, like, at the risk of being too mean to a lot of people. It's like to be in this business and not be like doing tons of spawn con or um, doing your own sort of grift of, I don't know, selling supplements is is one that comes to mind that seems to happen with a lot of fitness influencers. But like, um, to stay in it without going down that road is like unusual. So kind of in a way, just by holding on, I've like built some trust that I really cherish, and I think has become, unfortunately, really rare in the media world, and uh, but I value it. It's like I think if I wanted to sell this newsletter or like, I don't know, take sponsorships, I could be doing that, but I feel like it would compromise what I want to be doing, so I don't do it, and I've been fortunate to have the support of readers who also see the difference between those things. So that's, I think though, that's that's like a big part of the picture.\n\nI know my question was like all over the place. Need to work on that. But um, I, I really do see like what you're doing, and you know, I knew that what you were doing was resonating with people. Like you started She’s a Beast, I think a year, a before 404 Media, maybe longer than that. Um, but I knew that it was like that you had built this community of people, uh, that people were subscribing to you, that you were able to spin up a...\n\n\nwebsite.\nYou were on Substack, then moved over to Ghost, um, which ended up being very important to us to not be on Substack and to be on something that's like open source and that more aligns with our values, right?\nUm, and I just feel like the fact that you were able to do it and make it look pretty easy.\nI know it's not, but like, really did give me a lot of confidence to say, like, \"Oh, maybe we should try something like that.\"\nLike, and I guess what I'm saying is, like, I think that you have done a very good job and not in building what you've made to be beyond just, like, I'm going to send you a newsletter.\nSometimes it's like, you have shirts, you have books, but, and I feel like you have a very clear voice and a clear, like, value proposition that is, like, you staked out a lane of, \"I'm going to tell you what I think.\nIt's going to be well researched.\nI'm not gonna pull punches, but I'm also not, like, I'm not going to compromise my values, uh, because it might, maybe it would work better if I did it this other way.\"\nAnd I feel like that's something that we have tried to do where it's like, \"This is what we want to be buff for tech.\"\nUm, I think it's tough.\nYeah, I think I actually do make it look a lot easier than it is.\nI've definitely had one of the meanest things someone ever said to me was like, \"Well, of course people pay for your newsletter because it's like they feel like an obligation to spend money on fitness stuff.\"\nLike, your, I think I was trying to, um, encourage someone to start their own newsletter thing and was saying that I was having a good time doing it.\nIt was working.\nAnd they were like, \"Well, of course it works for you because people spend guilt money on fitness stuff essentially.\"\nAnd I was like, \"That's so wild.\"\nI think that's, that's like not untrue, but such a, like, I don't know, underestimation of, like, how much I put into this.\nPeople might, people might feel like it's an investment in their themselves, which is not a bad thing, but if what you're offering them is shitty, they're not going to stay, right?\nAnd they're not going to recommend their friends do it.\nAnd, um, I like a lot of people I know have found you through word of mouth.\nUm, in the same way that we hope that people will find 404 Media through word of mouth, where it's like, \"Oh, you're not reading 404 Media?\nLike, what are you doing?\nLike, you have to read it.\nUm, like, here, go do it.\"\nAnd it's funny, my, uh, my aunt lifts, and she, yeah, she found you through, through someone at her gym.\nReally?\nYeah.\nAnd I think, I mean, I, I hope she subscribed, but she definitely follows you on Instagram and is like, \"Oh, swolewoman.\"\nLike, I, I love following her.\nI love that.\nAnd, but I do feel like it's a space where, like, word of mouth and community is so important.\nAnd, um, I do feel like, yeah, it's like, I think we've lost track of how actually helpful that can be because we are so used to all this, like, programmatic advertising and, like, people spamming social media and, um, and paying, paying for their own, like, sort of algorithmic-driven, you know, ads on Instagram or whatever.\nBut it's like, not only does that stuff not work, still, the only thing that really works is somebody who you trust saying, \"Hey, I like this thing.\nLike, if you are interested in this, you might also like this thing.\"\nAnd things don't grow as, you can't sort of froth your numbers with that because, like, it doesn't happen that fast for most things.\nLike, obviously, some things sort of go viral, and it's like, \"You got to see this, the dress post.\"\nSome people say it's blue and black, and some people say it's gold and white or whatever, and, like, but good things, by and large, sort of percolate more slowly than that.\nSo it's like, you have to give them time.\nLike, we see so many media ventures that start, and then 18 months later, they shut down because it's like, \"Oh, we're not, like, we don't have, like, 200 million readers.\"\nAnd, and, like, we've run out of money to, like, uh, pay Facebook and Google to boost our stuff, right?\nOr for traffic from, like, Kazakhstan or whatever.\nUm, so, yeah, I think that it's like, easy to lose track of, like, your own impact isn't, you're like, \"Who am I?\nI'm one person, like, making a recommendation to another person,\" but, like, a good recommendation from, like, a person who, who you have, like, not, not somebody, like, like in Amazon reviews online, but, like, somebody who you trust to make a good recommendation is, like, that's still the gold standard of, like, how these businesses work, you know?\nYeah, this is a very big question, but, but what, what, why lift, like, in terms of, like, science, science-wise, um, because there is a lot of very good science in the book that talks about the benefits of lifting, and we don't need to go, like, very deep into it, but, like, what are the, you said it changed everything about your life, like, what, what did it change about your life?\nMhm.\nI felt like the unique contribution of lifting to my life as opposed to, like, other forms of exercise that I've tried is that the sort of atomic unit of lifting is you do a rep, or you do a set, and then you pause, you rest for a while, and then you're asking yourself in that time, like, \"How did that feel?\nWas the weight too light?\nWas it too heavy?\nHow is my form?\"\nUm, and you're, you have this sort of incremental process of self-perception.\nMaybe you're, like, learning how you respond to things and learning how to observe it.\nAnd I had had this experience in life of learning to always push down my feelings and always, like, kind of be on my toes and be responsive to everybody else.\nAnd, like, it didn't matter how I felt.\nI would take on whatever I needed to in order to, like, create my own safety, really.\nI thought that was what I had to do.\nIt didn't matter if it was fun or if it felt bad.\nIt was just like, \"What had to happen.\"\nI had no sense or concept of basing things around how they made me feel or even figuring out how I felt in order to base decisions or whatever around them.\nSo having this kind of discrete sandbox for practicing feeling stuff and observing how I felt was this thing that radiated out into the rest of my life without me even really realizing it.\nLike, I wasn't expecting lifting to translate into, like, helping me figure out relationship, like, sort of romantic relationships or relationships with my family or work.\nUm, but all of these examples sort of come to pass in the book where it's like, \"I am able to better realize when I'm getting some bad signals from things and to value those signals because I'm so used to being like, well, even maybe if I do, like, have a sort of pervasive bad feeling about something, I'm used to thinking I'm wrong, that I, like, if I, if it were bad, that someone else would tell me or, like, make it okay for me to act on that feeling.\"\nBut that's, like, not how life works.\nYou have to be able to trust your own feelings and and act on them.\nAnd that was a really kind of zero to one moment for me.\nYeah.\nIn my very brief time lifting, I feel like, uh, exercise always, like, helps push down my anxiety or helps relieve my anxiety, not push it down.\nIt, it straight up just, like, dissipates, and it's a real, like, you know, \"touch grass\" moment.\nWe talk about touching grass constantly, uh, on the pod, uh, because you can't just, like, stare into the abyss of the Internet all day, um, or our phones or whatever.\nAnd so that's why I initially, uh, really got into surfing, 'cause I was like, \"I cannot look at my phone in the water,\" and I would just feel like so much better taking a a moment away from the computer or my phone, and then also just, like, all of the much-studied benefits of exercise, whatever.\nSomething that I appreciate about lifting, though, is that it doesn't take that long.\nAt least when you're getting started, it's like 30-ish minutes, 30 to 45 minutes.\nAnd in between sets, you rest for a minute.\nSo, I have actually found it to be a good happy medium for when I need to, like, do something.\nI need to, like, get away from my computer, but I can't be, like, fully away, uh, for a minute, which I bet a lot of people have, where it's like, \"I can, I can answer an email in between a set or answer a Slack message if I have to.\"\nUm, and I feel like you can't really do that with other types of exercise.\nThere's, like, there's, like, built-in breaks, and I, I appreciate that.\nYeah, there's, like, a action and an inaction sort of, like, pattern to it that, um, I think it's not only, like, like, I just enjoy it as a form of exercise where I was so used to it being, you know, you start running, and you're not supposed to stop running for 30 minutes, and you just got to keep going, no matter, no matter what happens, no matter how you feel.\nAnd so I, when I learned that in lifting, not only could you, but you are supposed to, uh, take these rests between only, like, five reps and then rest.\nFive reps and then rest.\nUm, and that was always something that I really liked about it, and I think not enough people know that about it.\nBut yeah, it makes it a little bit easier to, I don't know.\nYeah.\nIt's like, if you're running, you have to answer an email, you would have to, like, stop, slow to a walk, and it would, like, ruin the whole thing.\nYeah.\nI feel like I can fit it into my life when I'm busy.\nLike, when I'm really busy, I still feel like I can fit it into my life without it feeling like I [ __ ] up the entire exercise.\nLike, 'cause you're right, when I, when I run, and it's like, \"Oh my god, like, I'm getting a call, and I need to take it.\"\nIt's like, \"Cool.\nLike, I've stopped, I stopped the exercise,\" whereas here it's like, \"Oh, actually, uh, I needed to take a short break anyway.\"\nUm, but yeah, I don't know.\nI think it's like, if you've never lifted or if you have, you should definitely read A Physical Education.\nYou should consider, consider, uh, starting to lift because, again, it's something that I never thought I would like, never thought I would enjoy.\nUh, you're fully the reason that I even tried.\nSo, thank you for that.\nOh my god, I'm so happy to hear that.\nI'm so happy for you that you finally gave it a try and that I wore you down, and that the book worked.\nThat's the main, you know, I mean, it doesn't have to work.\nI will say this, you could read the whole thing and be like, \"That's nice.\nI have, like, so much more knowledge, so many little facts that I can roll out at a cocktail party.\"\nBut you, and you might not be compelled to lift.\nAnd that's, like, totally fine.\nIt's like, you will just know a lot more than everyone else, which is always, not always a good feeling, but often a good feeling.\nNo, we, we love knowledge.\nWe love reading.\nUm, Casey, thank you for coming on.\nThank you for having me.\nThanks everyone for listening.\nThe book again is called A Physical Education: How I Escape Diet
