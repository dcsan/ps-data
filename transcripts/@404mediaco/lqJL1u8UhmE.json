  "cleanText": "If you like 404 Media, you probably have followed our reporting about how big tech has made consuming the news a mess. Social media and search algorithms have made finding and understanding the news exhausting. It's tough scrolling through timelines full of content that have been reverse engineered to perform well in an algorithm or that you're only seeing because of targeted advertising. That's why I like Ground News, a news platform that doesn't use manipulative algorithms and which lets me quickly see how news outlets around the world are covering a story. Ground News helps me get a snapshot of the entire media ecosystem, left, right, and center, which I found really useful as someone who's scanning the internet all day. I found Ground News to be particularly helpful when I was trying to parse through Donald Trump's massive legislative agenda. On the left, Ground News surfaced an American Prospect article called \"10 bizarre things hidden in Trump's big beautiful bill.\" In the center, it also surfaced a great analysis from Higher Ed Drive called \"One Big Mistake: Higher Ed Sounds Warning Over GOP Budget Law.\" And then I also was able to find a bunch of news takes and analysis from right-wing outlets without having to dive into the muck on X. Ground News let me do all that research really seamlessly without having to endlessly scroll through social media's echo chamber reinforcing algorithms. Go to groundnews.com/media today to get 40% off the Ground News Vantage Plan and get access to all of their news analysis features. That's groundnews.com/media for 40% off the Ground News Vantage Plan for a limited time only. groundnews.com/media.\n\n[Music]\n\nHello and welcome to the 404 Media podcast where we bring you unparalleled access to hidden worlds both online and IRL. 404 Media is a journalist-founded company and needs your support.

He's still on vacation. We, as listeners will know, we all took last week off, which is only possible due to our paying subscribers. We have never done that since we launched in August 2023. At this point, uh, it was rejuvenating and ready to get back into it. A ton of stories already to go through now and then we're going to have a bunch more for next week um, as well. So, let's get straight into it. This first one is one that Emanuel published uh, I think today or or yesterday. The open-source software saving the internet from AI bot scrapers. So we spoke about the problem a little bit on an earlier um episode of the podcast. Can you just lay out that problem first of all before we talk about this solution? So what is happening with AI scrapers and who is it impacting exactly?\n\nI think uh one of the funny things about taking a vacation after not doing it for so long is it warps your perception of time. And I'm like when did we have that podcast? Was that two weeks ago or the early 90s? I don't remember. But yeah, it was like I think it was two weeks ago. Um I wrote this story about the first good study that I've seen about how AI uh training data scrapers are really messing with libraries, museums, and any other form of uh resource or archive that's open to the public. So you have all these AI companies. They need all the training data they can get in order to train their AI models. So they send these bots to crawl the entire web and hoover up all that data. And there are so many companies doing this now. And they're doing it so rapidly that if you're just a a university or even a big university with an online library, all these bots suddenly hit your website. They're doing it millions of times a day and they crash the websites eventually uh making them unavailable for the human users that they were initially made for. So that's kind of largely the problem.\n\nYeah. They're being bombarded basically in these maybe not intentional but essentially DOS attacks where there's all of this traffic coming and and it's knocking these systems offline so nobody can really uh enjoy or read them or get anything from them. So that's the problem. You need some sort of solution, some sort of mitigation. I mean hopefully the mitigation isn't take them offline which uh some people have unfortunately had to do. So enter this tool that you've just written about called Anubis. What is it and you know how does it work? How's it trying to address this problem? So I wrote that story that I just talked about and a bunch of people reached out and said, \"Hey, you should really check out Anubis. There are several solutions that people are trying in order to prevent these uh AI uh bots. One that we've talked about and that historically has worked is robots.txt, which is a file you can put in front of your website that tells uh bots not to crawl it. Just like no automated tools should crawl this website. That used to work. That was pre the generative AI boom and this data mining gold rush. Suddenly people just don't give a and they're like scraping the sites anyway. So yeah, go ahead.\n\nIs is that the reason it doesn't work? Because again, you're totally right and plenty of people have brought this up that it used to work pretty effectively. You you you have that file on your website and it tells people please don't scrape this. Uh is it just that people don't care now or there's like way more people doing scraping or a combination of both? Like why doesn't robots work anymore?\n\nBecause it's not a rule. You know what I mean? It's not like if you ignore robots.txt the internet police is going to come to your house and arrest you. It just what?\n\nNot yet.\n\nNot yet. Once they give us badges, maybe we will do it. But uh no, it's it's it's just a norm that used to be respected. And I don't know, we should probably talk about this at some point, but the internet used to there's protocols and there's norms. And the internet used to to run on a lot of norms. And these are just being ignored entirely now because it's going to be very profitable for you to build a successful AI tool. So if you need to jump over the robots.txt TXT fence in order to get that training data. You're going to do it. Who cares? Um, so that no longer works. You have some other big companies that are trying things. Uh, Cloudflare, I think they announced a new method that they're trying today where they're blocking AI bots by default. I'm not sure how exactly that works. They've also done this kind of mischievous thing where uh Jason wrote about this, some other people are doing this, but once you uh once an AI bot comes to your site, you kind of send it down a rabbit hole of neverending links to garbage websites and you kind of trap it in this infinite loop. Uh so that's one solution.\n\nAnubis is the reason people I think reached out to me and are very happy with it and it's getting widely adopted is it's lightweight, it's open source and it's fairly effective um in a in a less expensive way that we can get into later.\n\nYeah. Um, and I think the Cloudflare one as well. I mean, hate to hand it to Cloudflare, a company that enables a lot of bad stuff and it's kind of all over the place when it comes to his ideologation or whatever. Oh, okay. Dash did something pretty interesting. I'll give them that. Um, but there's also a way that publishers may be able to get funds potentially through that Cloudflare mechanism as well. It will direct people to well do you want to pay this publisher to script this material right?\n\nYeah. So, you you asked me how it works, which I I I lightly dodge because it's complicated and I don't want to get it wrong, but basically these bots, the scrapers that are trolling the entire internet, they don't look or behave like a normal internet user. When that traffic comes to a website, it doesn't look like a human user who is using a browser in order to access the website because there's no browser involved. It's just like a very lightweight automated tool that is accessing the site and taking the data. What Anubis does is basically put a check before you can access the site where it is looking for a type of um uh uh cryptography that JavaScript does and has been doing and all web all web browsers have been doing uh since around 2022. Uh maybe you could talk about this a little bit. A lot of people really hate JavaScript and there are browsers that don't use it and there are people who kind of disable JavaScript across the board. So if you're one of those people, you're not going to be able to access sites that use Anubis. But the vast majority of people are using Chrome or some other type of browser that is constantly going through this cryptographic check to make sure that the user is there and that they're they're using a browser. And basically all Anubis does is look for that once it verifies um that it's a that it's a browser that it's probably a human and it lets you through. Uh the reason that is clever is because uh there's a cat and mouse game that's happening between uh admins and people that that are trying to protect our websites from scrapers and the AI companies. So the reason that the creator of Anubis uh Shi Yaso was willing to tell me how this check works is because she knows that the AI companies can't really implement the solution. It would be too computationally expensive for all these AI scrapers to pretend to run Chrome before they access a website. And that's why it's kind of like a simple, lightweight, clever solution.\n\nYeah, it is really smart. Um, and I don't want to oversimplify it, but maybe it's just a way for people to understand, but like, you know, it's a more sophisticated capture in a way where a capture is, you know, you're you're doing proof that you're not a robot, you're solving a little puzzle. Of course, there are entire companies of people in various countries who will get commissioned. uh I think commission is putting it very charitably. They'll be paid very very low wages to click through captures and then provide the solution to that and of course a plenty of AIs can actually bypass captures. Now this is like a much smarter way of going about it. Um it seems and you mentioned JavaScript and I'll just say briefly like it seems like a really good trade-off to me that you know you have this JavaScript running in your browser you're using ordinary web browser it lets you through. You're right in that some people don't like to use it. For example, when you download the tour browser, there is a a very easy to flick on and off setting to disable or enable JavaScript. And the reason for that is, you know, you can leak some personal data about your device to websites are running certain pieces of code. And you know, it's I I guess it's a little bit less now, but you go even 5 6 7 years ago, malvertising was just a massive thing where JavaScript was constantly used to deliver malware to people's devices simply for loading a web page. So, it doesn't have the best rap, but I don't know, you're an ordinary user with a fully upto-date um uh web browser and you're accessing a website. Seems like a pretty good trade-off to filter out all the AI bots really. So, you mentioned you spoke to the creator. Um, what did they tell you about why they decided to make this?\n\nLike, what makes somebody wake up and then just go, I'm going to make a new scrapers came for her. That's why she did it. Uh, like all the other libraries and archives that were in this previous story that I I wrote about how AI scrapers are messing up their infrastructure, she has a git server where she keeps some of her work. She keeps it open so other people can access it. And one day she was trying to access it. It didn't it didn't work. And she looked at what was going on and some kind of Amazon AI scraper was hitting it hundreds and hundreds of times and uh forcing it to reset and then eventually go offline and that's when she set out to make Anubis.\n\nThat's amazing. So she makes it it sounds like for for personal use initially. Uh did she uh upload it publicly at the same time and then people I'm I'm just trying to get from how she makes it to apparently a ton of people are now using this like what's the what happens in between those two points?\n\nYeah, I think it's just word of mouth. She did make it available. It was on GitHub and I think people started to use it and it seems like what really made it take off is that uh I know that you're previously a Linux user so maybe you're familiar with this but Gnome which is a popular open-source uh implementation of Linux started to use it to kind of protect its libraries and all of its publicly available data. they picked it up and it kind of went from there and then a bunch of people in the open source community honestly started to use it because it is open source I think was part of the attraction um and then yeah it's been downloaded when I wrote the story it was 200,000 times I imagine it's a lot higher now because the story got some pickup and people were really excited about it uh UNESCO's uh website and infrastructure uses it uh some universities use it you sent me a story after I published where Duke had a case study about them dealing with scrapers and they also came to Anubis for the solution. I think that's what they ended up doing.\n\nYeah, I'm trying to find it right now um about remember off the top of my head in that it wasn't even just that they were using it. They were like almost reviewing it and being like this is how effective this was um for you know protecting uh our property and protecting us from scrapers. And it seems like it it worked um pretty well.\n\nYeah. And and I guess like just to stress like 200,000 people downloading something, okay, not the biggest number in the world, but like they're not random normal users. They're probably web administrators or something, you know, like that. And 200,000 web admins or CIS admins is a lot of people, I would say.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Two. Yeah. Right. It's It's not 200,000 individual users and their little blogs. It's 200,000 users, many of which are uh the admins of incredibly valuable uh online resources that are accessed by millions and millions and of people.\n\nYeah. So I guess just the last thing is what do you think happens now? Is it just that more and more people use Anubis or is it also I mean\n\n\nObviously, both can be true. Maybe more and more solutions start cropping up like cloud flares as well, and there's just sort of this ecosystem of all of these, \"Hey, screw you, stop scraping us\" solutions.\nYeah, I think it's hard to imagine that Cloudflare is not going to provide some sort of workable solution to its customer base, and other internet infrastructure companies are probably going to do the same.\nI think the question is how popular this open-source alternative gets. And I don't know the answer to that, but I know that it has a lot of momentum. I know that a lot of people are using it. A lot of notable organizations are using it.\nThe developer says that she's not yet at a place where it can be her full-time job, but she wants it to be. Uh, and I don't know. I can definitely imagine that happening. I can imagine her getting enough donations to make this a full-time job, hire a contributor, and have it be like an open-source protocol that is very popular and is used more and more as this problem persists.\nYeah, the problem isn't going away, and it's probably not even getting smaller or plateauing. It's going to get worse if anything. And the other thing I forgot to mention is that not everyone can or wants to use Cloudflare or another kind of solution from a big company. A lot of people on principle or for practical reasons want an open-source free solution.\nYeah, that's fair. And I guess the last thing I'll say is, um, of course, we try to block AI scrapers as well. This is a big reason why we require email address signups on the site. You know, an article will go out there, and we'll pull it behind the free wall where you have to provide the email, and you know, and then stuff is obviously payable as well. But it seems that it has stopped some scraping, and the way that we can see that is a fewer AI generator ripoffs of our articles essentially, which is not the best metric in the world, but it's a pretty good one, and I'm sure we'll look deeper into it as well of how much are being scraped and whether it's going down or plateauing or whatever. Um, but that's what we do. All right, we'll leave that there, and when we come back, we're going to talk about another story of mine, which is about ICE and its new facial recognition app.\nWe'll be right back after this.\n[Music]\nToday's episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.

Uh, the headline is ICE is using a new facial recognition app to identify people, leaked emails show. Um, so Joseph, you've been doing a ton of really good reporting about ICE and about facial recognition separately and sometimes combined.\nUm, this to me is something that was not even on my radar yet as far as what police were doing in the field and then realizing that they were sticking phones in people's faces and then also using that as a facial recognition app was just like a one, two, like, \"Oh my god, this is insane and horrible.\" Um, so yeah, why don't you just explain maybe for a second before we dive into the app itself? For people who might not be familiar, what exactly are police doing or ICE agents or officers or whoever doing in the field that people were like, \"Oh, what are they doing? What are they doing with their phones before we get into the app even?\"\nYeah. Yeah, that's fair. So, um, as many listeners will know, ICE is conducting operations all around the United States, but especially in Los Angeles. Um, and of course, there were protests in response to that, and Trump deployed the National Guard and then later the Marines. Um, those protests have kind of petered out for the moment, but there are all of these sort of individual flashpoints where ICE will raid a Home Depot or a 7-Eleven or somewhere else, and then the community will get around it. Um, ICE will be wearing masks. They'll be heavily armed. They may not identify what agency they're from, uh, their badge number or anything like that. And there's a few videos coming out around that time of ICE officers repeatedly taking their mobile phones and sort of not shining or almost shoving them into people's faces, like very deliberately and clearly filming or taking a photo of people. And there was one very stark example where a protester was following ICE in his vehicle. From the video that was published, it didn't look like he was interfering with the operation. It didn't look like he was getting in the way of federal law enforcement or anything like that, but he was following them. These apparent ICE officers stop. They get out of their vehicle. They crowd around his car, and this is like it seems on a busy road. They then start asking him, \"What are you doing? Why are you following us?\" and then two, maybe three of them get out their phones and keep pointing it at his face. Like it looks like they're taking photos of his face. And that's what I thought it was at the time. And it might still be, and we'll get into the nuances of what exactly we know and what we don't know. Um, but people saw that, and they were asking on social media and elsewhere, why is ICE, why do they keep taking photos of us, which I know a fair question to ask, but then I got these leaked emails from Inside ICE revealing the agency has a new facial recognition app. So maybe they're using that. We don't know if in all of these videos they're doing that, but it absolutely adds new context to that. And the fact is that ICE does have this app now, as you know, I'm sure we'll get into.\nYeah. So, what is this app, like you said, might or might not be what is in the videos. We don't know, but we know that it's being used or at least ICE has it. Um, what's it called and what does it promise to do? Yeah. So, it's called Mobile Fortify, and it promises to allow ICE agents to identify people in the field by simply pointing their mobile phone at them, which obviously is the point of facial recognition. That's obviously the entire purpose of the technology. But it's one thing to have facial recognition, I don't know, on a camera outside a military base to make sure who's coming in or, you know, facial recognition at a retail store, which is still very controversial. But it's different to have it immediately and accessible in the hands of federal law enforcement who are grabbing people without due process and putting them into this black box system and giving them a capability right into the palm of their hands that can identify people on the street. And we've of course ICE has facial recognition from other companies as well. Well, we don't know who made this one, whether it's in-house or made by somebody else, and other law enforcement do as well, but it's the immediacy and it's definitely the context of Trump's mass deportations that makes this interesting. And of course, these emails that I got, ICE was announcing the existence and the availability of this app to all of the personnel in enforcement and removal operations, ERO. And that's a part of ICE that you know that deals with deportations. This isn't HSI which does child abuse investigations. This is ERO, the deportation part of ICE.\nOkay. Gotcha. So you found this through FOIA documents or how did you figure out the details of this app?\nI was leaked emails from inside.\nOh, leaked. Okay. From inside ICE, and these emails were sent to all personnel inside ERO. So that's a very widespread of people, which I think is interesting because that's a very widespread of people that may or may not be using this tool. It's at least being advertised to them inside the agency. And of course, with this new budget that US lawmakers have just passed and then Trump's, you know, signed into law, ICE just got another 6 billion for surveillance capabilities and I think 150 overall, 45 for more facilities to store people, all of that sort of thing. Um, so it's clear they're ramping up their surveillance tech. And I think this is just one part of it.\nYeah. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. Sending it to everyone in ERO is very, very crazy. So we know that like Clearview as you mentioned before uses facial recognition tech, but how is this similar? How is different? Is it different? Um, what are we working with here in comparison since we already have that as kind of like an example?\nYeah. So the way that facial recognition tech works really broadly, and obviously there'll be some differences between different companies and that sort of thing, but broadly is that it has this massive database of images of people's faces or maybe it has a massive database of the hashes of people's faces, like the cryptographic representation of it, but a lot of the time it's just going to be literal photos. That's the case with Clearview AI, which is a company that Kashmir Hill and your times revealed several years ago at this point, and they had, as she described in that coverage and as the person who provided the public records to her, they had sort of crossed the Rubicon of facial recognition where to build that database of faces, Clearview scraped social media, it scraped the web, so people's Venmo accounts, uh, social media accounts, uh, web pages, all this sort of thing, and created this massive database of billions upon billions of faces. Um, that's what makes Clearview apparently pretty powerful and apparently very popular with law enforcement at a local, state, and federal level. So, that's how it usually works, and that's how you usually get this sort of data. With this new ICE app, Mobile Fortify, it's not using images scraped from social media. Well, it appears to be using, and again, there are still, there are still questions, we don't have all of the answers to, but it's the emails I've got said this ICE app is using the system from Customs and Border Protection that takes a photo of somebody every time they enter or leave the United States. You imagine you go to the border, and that could be LA airport or whatever, or it could be crossing via car from Mexico or wherever, you're probably almost certainly going to have your photo taken, especially if you're, you know, on a travel visa or or a work visa or something like that, your photo will be taken. Now, the emails again aren't particularly, um, they, they, they don't answer all of the questions, but here's one quote which I thought was very, very telling. The app uses CBP's traveler verification service and the seizure and apprehends the biometric gallery of individual for individuals for whom CBP maintains derogatory information for facial recognition. There's a lot of buzzwords in there. Derogatory comes up, and they're sometimes hard to tell what they mean, but they say they have a biometric gallery of individuals which comes from when people enter or leave the United States. That appears to be based on these emails how they got those images and what\n\n\nICE is now using it in the field.\nYou get a photo taken when you arrive at an airport, and now you're getting pulled over in LA, and an agent is putting a camera in your face, and they know who you are based on the biometrics taken at the border.\nOkay.\nGotcha.\nYeah.\nI think I expect when I'm traveling, and I'm sure most people do, that at this point, like you're getting your picture taken in a thousand different ways by 100 different cameras, which is exhausting to think about and sucks in its own way.\nUm, but then having um, having ICE agents have access to this app like on their phones seems like just a whole other invasion of your privacy, invasion of your personal space, um, invasion of much worse than that if they decide to harass you or, god forbid, kidnap you.\nUm, so yeah, I think the situation with this app is really is really shocking and crazy.\nUm, what do you think this kind of says about where we're at with surveillance tech in general in this country?\nYeah, I think it's one main thing, and I have another eye story coming that will touch on this as well, but we're absolutely in the age of all of this existing data that maybe has been collected by private companies and then it's stored in databases, and then ICE gains access to it, or in this case, collected by Customs and Border Protection for one purpose, which is verify who is coming and who is leaving the country, and it's then being completely retextualized and repurposed for where now we can instantaneously identify people in the field and potentially, um, again, we we don't know the the full parameters of this tool, but if it's getting data from that that is presumably linked to immigration status as well, like that isn't in a tool like clear view AI, which scraped a bunch of people's photos from VMO.\nVMO doesn't have your immigration status or or anything like that, or it doesn't come in the photos.\nThis could be a much, much more powerful tool for that and much more applicable for what ICE wants to do.\nSo I just think it shows that all of those surveillance capabilities, biometric capabilities that have been built, I honestly think all bets are off for basically how they can be used now.\nAnd you know when I spoke to the ACLU about this system and they asked them for comment, they said, I mean, DHS was never authorized by Congress to use facial recognition tech in this way, and they should stop this um immediately.\nOf course, I have no expectation that ICE or DHS would, but I really think that all of these hairbrain schemed uh hairbrain schemes, you can think about, oh, maybe the data could be used for this or used for that.\nBasically, all of them are possible at this point.\nI'm constantly surprised every time I write a story about DHS and how they're using data, and I just get shocked uh every time.\nAnd that that's going to keep happening with these other stories that have coming as well.\nAwesome.\nI'm giving two thumbs up for people who are listening.\nIt's just Yeah.\nI mean, I don't blame anyone at this point for having a conspiratorial mindset.\nWe try not to here, but it's like if you can think of it, it might probably actually be happening.\nUm, and it is happening with technology that the cops have their hands on because cops left toys.\nUm, all right.\nWell, I think yeah, I think that's why I'm so shocked because or or consistently shocked because I don't have a cons I I strive of obviously we all do.\nI'm not saying you have this.\nWe we all strive to not be conspiratorial.\nAnd that's why whenever I get one of these stories or another one, I'm still shocked every single time.\nEven though I'm sure people will be like, \"Oh, what did you expect?\"\nWell, we're doing journalism, not, you know, palm reading here at this point.\nWe're and I'm surprised every single time.\nUm, all right.\nIf you're listening to
