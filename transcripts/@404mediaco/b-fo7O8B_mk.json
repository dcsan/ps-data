  "cleanText": "Hello and welcome to the 404 Media podcast where we bring you unparalleled access to hidden worlds both online and IRL. 404 Media is a journalist-founded company and needs your support. To subscribe, go to 404media.co as well as bonus content every single week. Subscribers also get access to additional episodes where we respond to their best comments. Gain access to that content at 404media.co.\n\nI'm your host, Joseph, and with me are the 404 Media co-founders, Sam Cole, Emanuel Mayberg, and Jason Kebler.\n\nSo, one small bit of housekeeping. We are having a party slash gathering/event in Los Angeles July 30th, Wednesday at 6 p.m. I'll put a link in the show notes. But Sam, anything else you want to shout out now while I'm just doing it or should people go to the event page if they want to see us hang out and talk about 404?\n\nGo to the event page and buy a ticket or email one of us for the code if you're a supporter. Um, if you're a subscriber in the supporter tier, which means you're a paying supporter of 404 media, you can get in free. Um, and we have the password. So, we'll have a post up on the site soon with the actual password for subscribers to get in, but um until then, you can just hit us up. But, yeah, we're excited.\n\nYeah, sounds good. Again, that's July 30th, Wednesday, at 6 PM. Check the event page for all of the latest information, but it'll be great to see some of our subscribers. Jason, where you going?\n\nIt's uh it's going to be at a place called RIP Space, which is like a hacker DIY space. Um, we'll probably do some sort of like live podcast, live Q&A, something like that. We're we're sort of nailing down what it is we're going to do. Probably by the time you hear this, there'll be more information on both the event page and our website. Uh, but yeah, we'd love to see you and there'll be a party after.\n\nYeah, sounds good. All right, we have as ever a bunch of stories to go through here. The first section is going to be a series of the um pieces written by Emanuel all about AI uh porn, Civitai, Hugging Face, all of these different platforms are hosting it. And there's there's been a ton of developments over the past few weeks and months in this world. So the first piece is uh the headline of the first piece is A16Z backed AI site Civitai is mostly porn despite claiming otherwise. So Emanuel, Civitai is this popular AI platform. We've spoken about it a bunch. You've done a bunch of investigations into it. We've especially covered how it's used to, you know, uh, host models and and generate pornography. What is Civitai's stance on that? Do do they see themselves as this big provider of pornography or not?\n\nWell, they definitely didn't used to, and we can kind of talk through where they landed these days, but historically, Civitai, which is a platform where people share uh AI image generation models, they've always allowed adult content. They've always allowed AI models that generate the likeness of real people. They just didn't allow people to post models or images that combine both of these things, right? So, no non-consensual content. That policy was always there. A lot of my reporting has been about how they failed to properly enforce that initially on their own platform, but then especially off platform.\n\nAlso, while I was talking to them for all of this reporting, whenever I managed to get their PR person on the phone or talk to anyone there, they said that my reporting is unfair because yes, there is adult content on the website and they support free speech and they think people should be allowed to have porn models and have models of real people. Um, but that's really a minority of the content that is on the site. And I have said in my stories and I have told them directly that that just like as a user experience as someone who goes to their main page if you look at the top models the top images the latest models the latest images it's just a neverending stream of adult content but I didn't have the data to back that up. So I've always kind of presented what a user sees versus what they claimed.\n\nEspecially they made this case especially strongly uh after I published this piece that showed that Civitai's cloud computing provider called OctoML had a lot of internal discussions about the kind of content they were generating for Civitai and they were worried that they were generating child pornography right for Civitai and that really freaked out the company and they then went out a kind of like on a mini PR tour with their CEO, Justin Mayer. And one of the things he did, I think the day of me publishing the story, right? So like in order to coordinate with the deadline that I gave them, he gave this exclusive interview to VentureBeat and he said, \"Uh, let me pull up the While while you're pulling that up. This is back in 2023, right? This is an investigation you wrote pretty early on or 2024 maybe but quite early on in our history, right?\n\nYeah. So this is end of this is December 2023.\n\nAnd VentureBeat writes that contrary to those figures showing 60% of content on Civitai as not safe for work, a figure derived from 50,000 images, today users on Civitai generate 3 million images daily. And the company says, quote, less than 20% of the posted content is what we would consider PG-13 and above. So this is Justin Mayor, the CEO of Civitai, explaining to VentureBeat that the kind of audit that OctoML, this cloud computing provider did on the content they were generating, they saw they thought it was 60% of the content was explicit. They say that it's less than 20%.\n\nCut to um recently I wrote a story about Civitai changing a lot of its policies because of pressure from payment processors. So uh in May they stopped uh or they banned rather all models that generate the likeness of real people and also specific types of porn that the payment processors thought was too extreme. I wrote about this. I published a story. a researcher uh from the University of Zurich reached out and said that she has been scraping Civitai and she has like really comprehensive data on what exists on the platform and we can dig into some of the numbers if you want but basically it shows that their claims that it was only less than 20% of the content are absurd and the content is primarily used for adult content. Yeah, this is really really interesting because you have your reporting um over years at this point where it's just like there's a lot of porn on here, you know, and I think you did a story a long time ago as well which basically showed that one of the the driving forces of capital and innovation in the AI industry is to develop porn basically. And of course we all know that um from Sam being the original reporters who cover deep fakes as well like it's it's always here all the time. So you have the reporting, you have um not to undermine it or anything, but your experience of the website is more anecdotal, right? As you say, you you log onto the website,\n\nI don't have the data.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So So I see a lot of there's a lot of poor models on here. You finally have this data and we'll talk about what those numbers are in a second, but you said this researcher was scraping civeti. Um, I don't know whether they got this granular with you, but sort of how did they do that? Did they look for all images that were marked as not safe for work or did they grab videos and analyze them? Did they break down how they did the scraping exactly or did they not give the details?\n\nUh, they didn't technically explain how they like gathered all the data. I'm not sure what the specifics there are, but what they the data is composed of more than 40 million images that they took from the site. Each of those images has a bunch of metadata that Civitai itself generates. This isn't the researchers annotating the data or analyzing it or anything. It's data that Civitai itself tags as using its own rating system of like R, PG-13, um, R, uh, sorry, XX, right? That's kind of the its own method for tagging images. And then there's other tags that could include like names of celebrities or the type of sexual act that's in the image uh, and and things like this. They also did something similar to the models themselves and they uh did that for 230,000 models I think are in the paper. I've been in touch with the researchers and I've looked at some data that's is more comprehensive than that. I think they're up to like 400,000 as uh as what they have but it's not published yet in like in in a journal or in a draft.\n\nYeah. So it's interesting that it it's based on the classifiers where it's cifi itself saying this is not safe for work which uh well that that meme that that that gif of they just admit it it's it's almost like that tasteful. Uh so the researcher scrapes that has all these images has all these classifiers very handily attached to them. Well what's the research showing? what what numbers are we talking about here when it comes to the prevalence of porn pornographic content on civeti.\n\nSo in December of 2023 is when I published my story about octol that's when Justin Mayer gives this quote to venture beat. He says less than 20%. The researchers say that by October of 2023, 56% of all the images were tagged not safe for work or higher, right? So that is already like more than double than what mayor claimed. the actual number is likely higher because as both the re researchers noticed and as I have noticed and reported not everything is properly tagged. Some people self-identify their content as not safe for work. Others do not and maybe try to get it under the radar. Right? If you have like some non-consensual content or a non-consensual model up on the site, maybe the people who are doing that are not tagging it properly because they're trying to evade moderation. So, the actual numbers are higher. Now, I'm looking at a graph of kind of the distribution of adult content and safer work content from the first quarter of 23 to the fourth quarter of 24. And mayor was incorrect or misleading in his statement back when he made it and back when I was talking to him for for my reporting. But from that time until now the number of overall images and models on the site has absolutely exploded as has the proportion of adult content. It's like at this point it looks like 80 90% of everything that is on the site is adult content.\n\nI mean that's staggering, right?\n\nYeah. I mean it just it it it it shows that the reason the hearing from this person and reading the paper was very validating is because it it it shows that like my user experience of Civoti and what I thought the site is despite what it was presenting itself as to the public and investors it's just porn. It is just a porn site. Like I feel very comfortable saying that it is a porn platform. And actually when I reached out to Justin Mayor for this story, he said he he he's standing by his like venturebe comment which I think are completely wrong. But he does now admit that somewhere around the beginning of 2024 the the the reason people use the site has changed. And I think that is probably because it's like you you can't deny it anymore. Just like by looking at the numbers, by looking at the site, it's just undeniable that it is primarily used for adult content or at least was until these policy changes.\n\nYeah, I mean I mean that's really really interesting. And then you just the last question on this article, then we have a couple more uh to touch on related to this. But you you brought up these policy changes and we'll go into more detail about the exact why of this with the payment processes in a bit. But basically, Civitai banned models related to real people in May, which is obviously a huge seismic change for any sort of AI platform. What happened when Civeti banned AI models based on real people according to this researcher who's constantly scraping Civet? Like, did it fall off a cliff? like what happened?\n\nI don't think first of all I should say this is a very this is another very important number. Um and another very interesting finding of the paper because they just recently changed the policy. So the researchers have all these models in a spreadsheet with the metadata and also the links to where the models live. So once Civitai announced that it was removing real people content from the site, it was very easy for them to check how many models were removed overnight. And the actual number is more than 50,000, which is another kind of interesting. You kind of when we when I report about Civitai, it's like, you know, there's Taylor Swift and there's uh Natalie Portman and like, you know, all these big celebrities that have like multiple models. And then you see there's a bunch of YouTubers and lesserk known Twitch streamers, but like you're like what is the actual number? And it's it's much higher than I thought. It's like I can't even think. Like obviously there are multiples, but but like tens of thous tens of thousands of people have bespoke AI models to create their likeness. It's just like really kind of a shocking image uh shocking uh figure. Um, but to your question, I don't think they still they they they have like post policy change usage number and post policy change like content distribution. They can just see um what was removed uh that was posted before uh the end of 2024 I suppose.\n\nYeah. Um, so then this just leads onto two other stories and the title of this podcast is something like the AI exodus starts. And that's where this comes in in that Hugging Face, another um AI model hosting platform. You have a headline here, um, Hugging Face is hosting 5,000 non-consensual AI models of real people. So are these some of the models that were on Civitai and then they got removed and now they've moved over here? Like what's the deal here?\n\nYeah. So basically credit card companies come to Civitai. They say hey you have to remove all this content all these real people models or we're not going to work with you. They are not working with them anyway still even after they remove that content. Um maybe Sam wants to talk about this but we saw something similar with Pornhub. It's kind of really hard to undo a payment processor cutting you off after they make that decision. And that's where Civitai is at the moment. But when they initially announced this, they were like, \"Hey, we're making these models invisible. The people who made them can have access to them for an unspecified short time and then we're just nuking them off the site entirely.\" And the moment that they announced this, the Civot\n\n\nAI community immediately mobilized and started this. Civitai, or actually the Civitai archiving project, already existed in the form of a Discord channel because there was other policy changes that kind of made people feel like something was coming, and they were starting an effort to like archive anything because they were afraid that Civitai would remove it. Once this news came out, it really kicked into high gear, and they started grabbing everything that they can in order to make it available elsewhere on the internet. And because of this research that I talked about in the previous story, I had a spreadsheet with all the links of all these real people models where they used to live on Civitai, and the archiving project created a website where you take that link, you enter it into the website, and it directs you to a mirror where that model was re-uploaded to Hugging Face.\n\nSo, Hugging Face is like an AI tool and resource sharing platform. It's very popular. It's got like a multi-billion dollar valuation, a partnership with Amazon. They've been very outspoken about wanting to be like an ethical AI company and what that means to them. I talk about that a little bit in the story. They don't have any specific policy against models that generate the likeness of real people, but they do have a lot of kind of vague language about AI being needing consent in order to be ethical. I told Hugging Face that I have this data that I know of at least 5,000 models that are hosted on their site, and not just random models, models that I know were used to create non-consensual porn models that were removed from a different, as we just discussed, porn site because they were used for this purpose, and I just haven't heard back from them after multiple attempts.\n\nYou haven't heard back from the ethical AI platform company about the unethical stuff happening on their platform.\n\nThat's right. Yeah. And I've talked to them before, and they've replied to my emails, and I don't know why they're stonewalling me about this one, but they are. I think I can say we're recording unusually; we're recording this podcast on a Monday. By the time this podcast is out, my story will be out, and we'll see if they have anything to say then. But I tried really hard to get any comment from them, and I think if they asked, then I would give them all the links, and then they can decide what to do about them. But they were just not interested in doing that.\n\nAnd then we'll just touch on your last story very, very briefly. But yes, I just wanted to ask Sam for a moment. This last one is about payment processors and sort of the power that they have in the porn industry, right? And for those who don't know, well, sorry, I'll ask this to you, Sam. For those who don't know, what do we mean by a payment processor exactly? And why are they so important to the adult industry?\n\nSo, as Emanuel just alluded to, Pornhub has had this problem. And a lot of porn sites have to abide by the rules of payment processors. So, I mean, when we're talking about like the different like payment processors and gateways and banks, it's like kind of it ladders up through the institutions that we're talking about, but so, like, for example, Stripe has really strict rules against porn and sexual content. Visa and Mastercard stopped processing payments for Pornhub because there was allegations of abuse material on Pornhub. You know, it's like Chase has rules about not safe for work content at all content. It's because they're considered high-risk, quote unquote high-risk material. So in the same in a similar vein as gambling or guns, they place sexual content in a similar kind of risk category as as a bank, and then that trickles down to payment gateways and the processors and things like that. So, you know, it's like it's ideally, if it's working ideally, what you get is like these banks are not having to be accountable for abusive content like what Emanuel is talking about. What happens a lot of the time is the banks end up being like acting as like moral arbiters for porn. So you have a lot of like consensual adult content creators caught up in the rules against abusive content. These payment processors don't want to take the time to sort out the difference in a lot of cases and just ban it all. And we've been talking about this for years happening to like consensual and safe and legal adult content. And it's like these other platforms like Septai and some of the other platforms that are now having trouble with payment processors, they're [ __ ] around and finding out at this point. It's like this is you thought you could kind of just like get away with doing whatever, and you were above it cuz you were cool bros or whatever the logic is. I don't even know. It was making a lot of money, so surely it was too big for them to give a [ __ ]. But I think now they're finding out that the same rules apply to them.\n\nAnd I don't know. It's like it's we can't really put these things in the same bucket as legal, safe adult content. But they do a lot of the time have to abide by similar rules.\n\nYeah. And and it's coming for them now. And I and I guess just to wrap it up, Emanuel, what is what is the impact from these payment processors deciding they don't want to work with Civoti or another AI platform? Like what happens after that sort of action has taken place and what's going to happen now.\n\nVery quickly, I would just say I think last week I talked a lot about how the reason I was covering Civetai is that to me it seemed like a critical piece of internet infrastructure in the entire practice of producing non-consensual porn, and like what happens if you remove that? Where do people go? And something I saw people say after the Civetai announcement around real people is that they're just going to go to tensor.art, which is a site I covered like I think the first week we launched, but it's a site that's identical to Civotai. Basically, it's the same services, same UI, you go there, you download models, you can generate images, yada yada. A lot of people move their models there. For a while, Tensor Art had like a tool that even helped people import their Civotai models automatically, and on Friday, Tensor Art announced that they are getting the same pressure from payment processors, and they're no longer, they're saying temporarily, I don't know how they resolve this, but they're saying temporarily no more real people content. They've disabled this Civotai importing tool, and they're trying to come up with some sort of solution. I'm very skeptical that they can find a solution and still have the payment processors work with them because as I've said, sometimes even if you fix every problem, they don't want to come back. So I'm just going to continue to track like a hu that like there's a huge vacuum now in how non-consensual content is made online because of Civetai policy changes, and I'm just tracking where all this energy and all these people are going, and that's probably going to be some more reporting in the future.\n\nYeah, totally makes sense. Um, all right, we will leave that there. When we come back after the break, we're going to talk about one of Sam's stories about preserving history, very much in the vein of the Trump administration continuing to wipe things off the internet. But this is now sort of IRL archiving. We'll talk about it in a minute. We'll be right back after this.\n\nTime, skills, and money.

The headline is Save Our Signs wants to save the real history of national parks before Trump erases it. Um, first off, can you just give us a little bit of context of what is the Trump administration doing to national parks and the history around them? Like what's the issue exactly?\n\nYeah. So, like many things these days that um are just like bad news, dark news, um started with an executive order in March. Trump issued this order called Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History. Uh already off to a really promising start with that title. Um the order mostly like targets the Smithsonian Museum Institution and that network. Uh it makes some really bizarre claims about uh the museums being part of this like revisionist movement. um that they're trying to paint historical milestones in the negative light for acknowledging racism in American history, things like that. Um so the the order is mostly about that, but because it also mentions uh the Department of the Interior, that catches national parks and monuments in that net also. So, um I can just read part of what the the order says because it's written like so many of these things in a very kind of slippery vague way.\n\nUm yeah, I'm sure it was lured to Helen back, but um also very wordy.\n\nWell, was it? I don't know.\n\nI mean, who knows? you know, it's uh nothing was in all caps, so I'm sure it got at least one proof read, but yeah, it says um that the the Department of the Interior must take action um whatever that means as appropriate and consistent with law to ensure public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of Interior jurisdiction do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living, including persons living in colonial times. Interesting carve out and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or with respect to natural features the beauty abundance and grander of the American landscape. So I mean if we can use our contextual thinking skills, take action, I think we can assume means remove um or edit uh monuments and memorials and um plaques basically at national parks or anywhere that's um under the Department of Interior jurisdiction that say anything about anything other than how pretty the landscape and the monument is. Um, so and not disparage people, which would, you know,\n\n\nRules out quite a bit of American history if you can't really tell the truth about what was going on.\nYeah.\nSo, purely hypothetical situation, you can have a sign that says, \"Wow, trees look nice, mountains look good.\" But you can't say anything like, \"Well, the indigenous people of this land are XYZ,\" or something like that.\nIs that basically the thrust of it?\nOkay.\nYeah.\nI mean it's and again it's like this the order doesn't really use any very specific examples for the national parks but um given the the attack on like so-called DEI, um the way this administration has been moving up until this point we can assume that it means um you know things like talking about um indigenous people being slaughtered in this country um things like racism and civil rights um and all of that that actually built a lot of the um helped build a lot of the park system.\nUm black indigenous people played a huge part in excuse me building the parks um and you know were many of them were there first um things like that.\nIt's just like there's a lot of history going on in the parks that we just um are apparently no longer allowed to acknowledge, um environmental justice, um women in leadership, things like that uh that the administration has targeted in the past already online we can assume probably counts in this case too.\nSo yeah uh I mean I haven't really been covered uh covering any of the sort of removal of history by the administration.\nBut I don't know, that just drives me crazy.\nThe idea that you were going to delete history, Jason, I'm curious if this stuff would be foilable.\nLike theoretically, it would be.\nI think the crowdsourced aspect of it is very cool and like makes it a group project, but I but theoretically like the national parks offices should have copies of this somehow.\nLike they had to go get them printed, etc.\nAnd theoretically, all of this could be obtained by FOYA.\nUm, which is Yeah.\nYeah.\nI don't know if they brought that up at all.\nI I think that this is maybe easier than FOYA.\nI feel like FOYA is a roll of the dice at this point, but um you know a FOYA about this and maybe we'll file some would theoretically capture like um attempts to take it down or like alternate versions of the um like what's being changed, etc.\nLike if it if it were um responded to appropriately.\nYeah, totally.\nAnd um I just looked it up and got the email address or the portal for the National Park Service.\nSo we can do that or we'll do it through Mukrock or or whatever.\nUm but what these people are doing is sort of this other archiving project.\nSo with all of those problems and that context enter Save Our Signs, this campaign and launched um well what's the goal of this uh campaign Sam and who is involved exactly and how are they going about it?\nWhat were they doing?\nYeah.\nSo, um like seeing like the writing on the wall, so to speak, not to use a corny pun for this particular story, that was pretty good.\nUm the writing on the placards, um data preservationists from the safeguarding and research and culture project and the data rescue project uh launched this web portal called Sora Signs.\nUm they're asking people if you're at a park, if you're at a national park to just take a picture of pictures of um placards and signs and monuments and that um they see as they come across them to preserve them, to archive them essentially because uh they could be under threat.\nWe don't again we don't really know what's going to go on like the the take action line is very vague but um you know it's um it's something where they're the government is asking for um visitors to fill out this QR code survey to report signs that they think are negative.\nSo, it's kind of like a counterprotest to that saying, you know, if you're if um Trump administration is going to ask people to essentially snitch on signs that address um you know, anything other than beauty and grander of the American landscape and you know, flag these placards that could fall under whatever the administration's definition of negative is, then they're going to turn around and say, you know what, we're going to archive this and make sure it's preserved in case it goes anywhere, in case it um is removed and the negative quote unquote negative content must be taken again using the words of the the order take an action against by September 17th is what the order says.\nSo they're launching this to um basically say we have to hurry up and preserve this in case something happens to it um in the future.\nBut I mean the Trump administration has totally gutted the park service um at this point.\nIt's they barely have enough rangers to do basic um administrative tasks in a lot of the parks.\nSo, this is just another task piled on to rangers and um park workers that uh is silly and frivolous and totally wasteful.\nUm so, we'll see what happens actually in September if anyone is around to take action against this negative content.\nBut um that's their goal.\nSo it's um it's worth taking seriously.\nYeah.\nSo I totally understand why the response to the executive order is crowdsourced.\nYou need ordinary members of the public to go out and hey take a photo of this placard or signpost or whatever.\nTake a photo of that so we can archive it.\nIt's, I don't know, unusual, weird, funny that the government has to crowdsource that bit as well of the destroying bit because they can't even get the people to go destroy it in the first place or I don't know, that's ridiculous.\nAnd it's so far the responses to um the QR code survey that the administration has put up on signs to ask people to snitch on negative content um has been leaked to different outlets already.\nUm, and the responses that people are putting into this survey are really funny.\nIt's like there was one that was like respect respectfully go [ __ ] yourselves someone put in there.\nUm, the parks belong to the people things like that.\nUm, people are pissed.\nPeople do recognize a total frivolous waste of time when they see it.\nI think um rarely do people show up to the parks and say, \"Oh, this isn't, you know, perfectly optimistic about the beauty of nature.\nSo I want something I want my government to drop everything and do something about this.\nIt's um you know it's you're there for a learning experience and an educational experience as well as the beauty.\nSo um yeah, people are already and that would be something funny to foyer once all the once it's had some more time to marinate I guess the QR codes and the responses to them because I think people are trolling it at this point quite a bit.\nBut that's not what the Save Our Signs people are trying to do.\nThey're trying to actually preserve what's on the signs.\nYeah.\nI mean, we might be able to still um get some early on um and foyer them if if the National Park Service still has a foyer officer or public information officer at the end of the day.\nSo the the dead the deadline to take action uh to remove all of these um signs or or whatever potentially September and then it looks like the Save Our Signs program is going to release the photos that they've crowdsourced in October if I'm reading that correctly.\nIs there any indication of how many photos of signs they've got or how many people are are participating yet or do we kind of just have to wait and see whether people are trying to help help out here when October comes?\nI think we just have to wait and see.\nI mean I they launched on July 4th.\nUm we were famously out which is why we covered it a little late but um they were hoping to get people on holiday to take signs while they were out with their families and stuff but um I think it's a little early.\nIt's only been about a week since they launched the project, but it would be cool to see um to see what they get back to see um what they do with the data.\nThey're going to make it public like you said.\nUm they just are not totally sure how yet or they're still working on how that would work.\nUm but I think it's I mean I think it's cool to get public participation in archiving like this.\nUm I think archiving feels kind of um difficult or complex or unattainable for a lot of people.\nIt's like oh these sites are going down so there's this big archist um effort to preserve them or we have to kind of pull down the data and fill up a hard drive with it and this you know big effort that you have to be part of a community already to participate in a lot of the time is how it looks from the outside.\nUm, but this is a nice like entry point into data preservation and archiving.\nYou know, it's like you're outside already.\nYou can just take a picture and put it on this website and you're helping preserve a piece of history when it's under threat, which I think is I think it's cool.\nI think it's um a cool kind of muscle building exercise for people to uh participate in something like this.\nYeah.\nAnd as you suggest absolutely non-technical as well.\nUsually you have to be pre-technical to participate in some sort of archiving solution.\nYou have to download a browser plugin or scrape something.\nAnd this is just something you can do uh to archive IRL material.\nUm well I'm sure you'll revisit it in September and October and we'll file those foyers.\nUh but we'll leave that there for the moment.\nIf you are listening to the free version of the podcast, I'll now play us out.\nBut if
