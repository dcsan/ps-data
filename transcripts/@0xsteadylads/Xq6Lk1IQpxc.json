  "cleanText": "[Music]\n[Music]\nGM Lads, it's been a while. We're excited to be back with you. A lot has happened in the last six weeks since we had an episode. I mean, I don't even know where to start. The market has gone a little bit insane.\nWe can take a look here, but the key thing to note is Justin is proud to be the ETH guy once again. He tweeted. So, Ethereum is up 21% on the week while Bitcoin is flat. Um, so, it feels really good. It feels really good because, um, you know, I feel like 0xSteadyLads, we kind of capitulated at the bottom. Like I think we paused regular weekly uploads literally at the exact bottom and, uh, you know, for three, I think we've been doing the show on and off for two and a half, almost three years, and every week I get a guest on and I just get dunked on, like, why is this guy the ETH guy? Why is this guy the ETH guy? To the point where I was close to capitulating, you know, I'm not the ETH guy. Don't call me that. But here we are. Um, I was right. We're winning. Everyone's winning. You were right. They were wrong. You got a big check to show for it. Um, are you going to...\nThere's still room to run. Still room to run. Um, but as soon as we go to all-time highs, you're jumping off the ship.\nI'm going to... Yeah, I think my plan right now is after all-time high and after all-time highs, sell 5% of basically everything each day until I'm fully out. I've just... I can't roundtrip again. I can't go back to the lows and I feel good. I made the money I need to make. I'm fine. I'm good. Like enough is enough. You know, it's a passing of the torch. You know, the next generation can go through their bare market and hold on just like Justin. They can, you know, your story will be told to the next generation and they will go through like probably the dip from, you know, 8K down to 4K and they'll be...\nDo you think... Do you think we're back? Do you guys think ETH is surely hitting all-time highs?\nI mean, if not now, when, right? I mean, we have all these Ponzi vehicles working. Uh, Tom Lee, he's like the main character now. Uh, he's saying ETH is going to go to 10K because of stablecoins. I'm all for it. The chance Ethereum always had to turn it around because we've been talking for years, like, how is it going to turn around? I've been saying consistently, like, it has to be Wall Street. Wall Street has to adopt ETH and just make it the real, and it's well positioned for that because of the neutrality of it. It's been so neutral that it can just be taken over and it's cheap enough that it can still be, you know, bought up in large sizes. And the good thing for ETH is that now they're saying ETH is the Wall Street token and Solana is the Silicon Valley token, which is completely different than, you know, a year ago we were saying Ethereum is like the European Union, Solana is like the, you know, maybe that's the Wall Street token. So good job by just waiting it out and getting adopted, and now these Treasury Companies are just the beginning. I mean, the ETFs are flowing.\nSo you think... I mean, Solana said they were decentralized NASDAQ, but maybe it was ETH all along, and then to your point from many, many months ago, maybe Solana was never decentralized NASDAQ, it was decentralized Macau.\nYeah, I think it's a little premature, though, right? Like, so ETH/BTC is still like 70% off highs, and then if you go back to 2017, it's like 80% off highs, so like, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. The dunking is a little excessive now by, you know, people I'm seeing on the timeline, but it's looking good. It's looking good.\nI mean, it's literally almost done a 2x on the BTC chart, and BTC has done amazing. So, this is at least something. Um, if you're an ETH holder, and I don't know many ETH holders. Everyone I know has capitulated. I'm still holding my dusty bag. It's a medium-sized bag, so, you know, I haven't felt the need to do anything with it, but it's more of a let's see what happens. Do you think CT's like Crypto Twitter and our ecosystems positioning is relevant, or is it really just about the big money at this point? Like, does everyone, like, does Anom at some point have to come back and say, \"I, Solana or ETH looks good here, long ETH,\" and then, you know, like, everyone starts aping in, or is that not as important when we have the treasury vehicles, the ETFs, etc.?\nYeah, it's all about the stratified money, right?\nIt's not important. Yeah, it's not important. Um, I'm sure, you know, the Kobes of the world are riding the wave. You know, the old guns, they know, they know an ETH run when they see it. So that battalion is in. But I don't think that, you know, the new kids on the block are relevant or even going to get into too much ETH. I think some of the treasuries of the projects that are holding ETH are probably happy if they can sell some. Um, I mean, I don't know exactly how high we get. It does feel like the momentum is very strong. I saw one analyst, I think it was like the Citadel Securities analyst, he said it smells like higher than lower. And I thought that was brilliant. It really does smell... For those of us that have been in the markets for many, many years, there's too much momentum right now. Like the rate of increase can't be slowed down that fast where we just suddenly collapse. So it feels inevitable that, you know, it's higher because of the rate of acceleration here, but obviously, like, there's going to be some pretty steep corrections after that because whatever is happening is not necessarily the fair market price of every single asset, but, um, yeah, we do have a couple of guests we can talk to about this. Go ahead.\nYeah, I do like that line, right? It smells like higher, right? Uh, like sniff, sniff. Um, I think we all feel it in our bones, like, this is finally ETH time now. Then the question is, does it peak out at like 0.05 BTC, 0.06? I don't really know the answer to that. Um, a question I have for you guys is, like, you know, like, my mental framework is, I think once ETH breaks new highs on the USD pair, I think we're going to have like roughly three months until it's going to be over, or you want to be just selling into that. Uh, so I think we're like in the seventh, eighth inning-ish. Uh, but like, what do you guys think? Are we in this fifth inning? You know, just general thought dots on where we are in the cycle.\nMy macro take in general is that things are melting up after the Trump bill. So since the last update, you know, I really didn't think that we could go much higher because I knew that the Fed, the monetary policy, was not going to be supportive. So, and indeed, they haven't even cut rates. So they've been sticking to their guns. However, Trump has managed with one vote, I think, like, they need the advance to pass the Senate bill, they managed to get this bill through. And I think that has completely changed just the fiscal side of things. And we are in a period of fiscal dominance. The amount of money coming in from the government is ridiculous. I mean, these corporate tax cuts are not necessary, and they're just adding more fuel to the fire. I do think eventually, you know, there's going to be consequences that are very bad.\nWhat do you think the offramp is? Right? Like, so for me in my position, after ETH breaks all-time highs, I want to be DCAing out over a long period of time to probably dollars, right? Like, I think Bitcoin's obviously great here, but, you know, I don't expect it to go to 2x or 250k from here without a major correction, let's say. Uh, I think gold's very expensive now, right? Like, so what's the answer? Or is it just to hold dollars and earn the treasury rate? Is it to put it in the S&P? Like, if you're selling Crypto now because you made a lot of money, what are you buying?\nUh, I don't think gold is expensive. I mean, it's been flat. I was checking, it's been flat for like months now. So yeah, it did have like this 25%, you know, sudden runup. Uh, but it has been flat for a while. So, um, it will probably get a new leg. I would get some gold exposure. I do think Bitcoin is inevitable that it goes higher. So even if you're selling other alts, I would get some Bitcoin. It feels very early. So yesterday, one of the headlines we saw was Trump is considering an executive order to allow gold and Crypto to be put into retirement accounts. I don't know what Crypto that means. Is it back to the old days where he got elected and they're talking about doing a Crypto reserve? And is it Bitcoin? Is it... Are they going to put XRP in there? Like, what... What is going to be in retirement accounts? Is it going to be the Uber drivers retiring with XRP? So, um, so speaking of Crypto, speaking of XRP, uh, we have a resident expert. Um, so, Alexander Good.\nFeels like I got summoned just now. You're like,\nYeah, we willed you into existence.\nWhat's up, everyone?\nThe genie. The genie appears. Um, Alex Good, great to have you. So, is XRP going to be a retirement asset for Uber drivers is the first question?\nI mean, I would argue that we're seeing some evidence of that. I was just posting in our Discord that, like, you know, the 2x XRP ETF, which is just futures traded, uh, $150 million yesterday. Um, so there is appetite for, I think, XRP as a... I mean, if you also look at XRP, it's an older demographic than most coins, and that's true across countries. Like, if you go to the XRP Apex conference, there are a lot of people there who are, you know, kind of middle, more middle-aged demographic. In Korea, the meme in Korea, which I guess doesn't get spread around, is listen to your mom because the idea is that your mom bought XRP in 2017 and she's been telling you that you need to buy it for the last eight years, and now she's finally right. Um, so, so I do think there is like an activation channel, um, with XRP and retirement accounts, probably more so than some other coins.\nSo, it's going to be really hard to get an Uber from now on is what you're saying.\nI did want to bring up this epic thread that you wrote. I think it got a lot of attention. It's a very long thread, but the one thing that I loved is that you start thinking about the social contract and what, you know, how the world is changing, um, and how, you know, some of the assumptions that the current social contract is based on, once those assumptions change, we actually, like, we end up in a completely new paradigm and a new equilibrium. What... What started this rant? Have you just been thinking about this stuff for a long time and you just put it all on paper? Yeah, I think there was always a question for me of what happens after the Super Bubble. You know, the Super Bubble is this idea that, uh, you know, society is a meritocracy, but the reality is that every time the system blows up, the government always patches it back together. So, it's not actually a meritocracy. It's like, it's like all the guys who blew up the 2008 financial crisis all went to work at Cerberus afterwards and bought their entire mortgage book and printed hundreds of millions of dollars of P&L. Um, you know, I used to trade mortgage rates and like, you know, the guy who runs AGNC, you know, the big mortgage REIT, is like literally the guy at Lehman who blew the system up. And so there's kind of like this lack of faith in society. The question is, like, okay, is this thing all going to crash or are we going to come up with something new? And you know, the sort of teal argument is like, okay, well, we know what something new is. It's just the Chinese communist social contract, right? Like, we've got a pretty clear idea of what an AI-driven authoritarian society looks like in production right now. Um, and I'm like, that's depressing. Uh, I wonder if there's a better way to go other than, you know, communist authoritarianism after this thing, you know, kind of blows up. And I got interested in AI because of the religious activation of the average AI user. Like there was sort of the EAC movement originally, um, where people are engaging with AIs in a sort of kind of predictable way because when people are talking to AI, they're not talking to human intelligence, right? They're talking to something which is external to human intelligence, which already creates a kind of, um, spiritual feel to chat, which I think is why you're seeing all these threads on AI psychosis, right? Because people are engaging with ChatGPT in a way which is different from just a coding tool or different than just a social media tool. They're engaging with it deeply emotionally and almost like even related to advice. And so if you listen to Sam Altman, he's like, what are people using ChatGPT for, uh, the younger demographic? He's like, uh, you know, under 30 years old, they're engaging with this to get life advice a lot of the times. Um, and so you already have the seeds of a kind of normative system where you're engaging with a non-human intelligence for normative statements about how to live your life. And that's like the typical use case. And that's what's driving, you know, ChatGPT, the number one app in productivity. Like, as you probably are aware, like Anthropic has a much better model for coding. Um, and it's a just actually a better and more powerful model as well. Um, and it has just a tiny fraction of ChatGPT's usage. Um, yeah, I mean, let's get into some of the details of the thesis because some of it is kind of profound in terms of what will happen. Uh, in terms of what you just mentioned, people are using AI for, you know, more conversational and emotional things. Um,\n\n\nThere's been a lot of hype on Crypto Twitter. Like, is this like, uh, Grock waifu going to oneshot the next generation? Like, what, what do you see as the um, the emotional development of these kind of characters? Yeah, I had this kind of thesis about why um, AI is going to cause aggregate productivity to accelerate. Uh, and this is pretty related to it. My thesis was, uh, it's pretty pornographic, uh, for both males and females. Uh, for males, it's obviously the image and video generation. Uh, but, uh, you know, back when I was in advertising, like, one thing we learned was that, uh, uh, you know, personalization can just drastically increase, uh, engagement with ads. And I, um, you know, right when the AI video stuff came out, uh, you know, people always tell me I look like the guy from the office. And so I was, I like, I was trolling a friend and I put myself on a clip from the office using like one of these, one of these services where you map your face onto a video, and then I was like watching ads, uh, on, it was like on, I think it was on the New York Times. It was like a major display website, and I got an ad that was targeted with my own face on it. I'm like, oh, like that, that was, that was, that was kind of when I was like, oh, this is, this is, this is accelerated beyond what I thought. And so it's obvious that people are already, uh, personalizing, uh, uh, advertising. And so I'm like, okay, like, it's pretty obvious that, you know, chat GPT is deeply cash flow negative. Uh, you know, Elon is running this thing out of his personal account, basically. Uh, you know, XAI, I guess, is funded by venture at this point. But there has to be a view about how to fund all this stuff. You know, it has to be a view about how to get positive unit economics. And the best way to do it is to deliver addictive products. You know, that's like a well-known, um, you know, cash flow generating machine. And, and I believe that's like why all the companies that are at the forefront of AI development, you know, whether it be Bite Dance, whether it be Nvidia, whether it be Meta, all of them are excellent at engaging with the video game space specifically, right? Like, you know, it's, it's social media, video games, pornography, like these are all the, these are all the vehicles which AI can pay for the data centers. And so, um, you know, I, I got super bearish on kind of, uh, you know, societal progress and productivity growth because all of those things actually decrease your productivity. They don't really increase your productivity, and the people who become 10x engineers are actually like writing ad software and writing video games. So I'm like, GTA will be really good, but maybe we won't get robots. Just as a counterpoint, wouldn't you agree in your experience, like, that the top, let's say, 10% of people contribute 90% of the productivity to society, or like, there's a huge distribution here, whereas a small number of people are doing most of the work? And in your experience, because this is my experience, those people that are your overachievers that are actually making a dent and moving the way we're doing things, like, I, I don't see those people being distracted by these sorts of things. Like, I personally have never met anyone that I would think is a candidate to have like an AI girlfriend or boyfriend, right?\nYou don't know me, man. I'm just kidding.\nBut it's hard to get on board this thesis because like, people do say this a lot, but I just, I just don't know how much appetite there actually is for that. And then I, like, I think in Crypto, we have this tendency to get really doomer because we're kind of like aligned with the worse the dollar does, the better we do. This is the whole Bitcoin thesis. You mentioned earlier, like, I think you said something like, when this ends or collapses, like, isn't it possible and shouldn't it be the base case that, you know, things just keep going on as normal, productivity keeps increasing? Sure, there's some inflation, but do we have to be so doomer?\nI think a funny statistic about this, I was looking at, well, so like, Mark Benioff went on CNBC and he's like, 40% of Salesforce's code is written by AI now, and they're like, hm, I, I bet, I bet Salesforce's financials must be really it. And so I actually, like, you know, I pulled up Salesforce's AK. I'm like, wow, net cash flow from operations is only up 6% year-on-year, right? It's like, okay, so you have 40% of your code, which is written by AI, but you're actually not generating materially more cash flow. Um, so what happens if 100% of your code is written by AI? You get 12% operating income expansion, right? Like, it's like, um, that's not even really financially interesting, right? And so I think, I think the, uh, the, I think where I'm coming from is that people like us actually don't really drive GDP very much, right? We're actually like, um, uh, primarily speculative capital. Um, and when you look at the aggregates of, uh, you know, what has happened over the last 20 years, um, you know, basically, if you kind of look at the increase in the, in the national debt and unfunded liabilities of the United States, uh, it's, it's just vastly outpaced any net income growth in, in the stock market. And, and like, one, one sort of piece of analysis that I look at is like, what would happen if you increased the tax rate of the Russell 3000 to its 1960 highs, right? Because like, post-world, we have a similar, we have a similar fiscal situation to post-World War II, and we obviously have a completely different demographic situation. And, and like, you know, the answer was, even if you took corporate taxes all the way to the previous all-time highs, you would only chip away like one half of the big, beautiful bill, right? You would only do like one half of the deficit spending, and then not only would you only do one half of it, you'd also destroy all the net income growth in the United States since 2005, right? So, so basically, what that means is that, you know, the, the way to view, I view econ, like, you know, the, the economy is that it's been a giant unfunded fiscal transfer, um, from basically the currency reserve to the, to the ultra-rich, who are actually not increasing productivity. They're just, um, you know, they're just basically manufacturing cash flow to the proximity to the Federal Reserve. Uh, and so I just think like, like the, the configuration is stable because Trump is in power, and so I think it's going to accelerate, but I don't actually, like, I think that's like, you know, in the aggregate statistics, for example, like next year, US GDP growth is expected to be below 2%. Um, you know, when Microsoft started this whole party, they said, we're, we're investing in AI capex with the assumption that GDP is going to be growing 10%.\nYou're talking about like, re, real, this is like real GDP, like after inflation.\nYeah, I mean, uh, I think, I think, um, to touch on your point about the, you know, I, I talk often around how the inequality is just going to keep increasing, and it's like hyperdrive now. I mean, the, the holders of risk assets versus non-risk assets are hugely diverging, and if you have money in bonds because you're retiring soon and you're playing the 40/60 or whatever, you're just going to get destroyed over the next 10 years. And, um, there's obviously going to be a political cost in terms of, you know, voters being, you wanting to eat the rich again, and you know, we had the CEO that got shot by, by that, uh, kid, and then people were like cheering him on, like, this kind of stuff, um, is, is probably just going to get more and more entrenched then, and that seems very bad. So in essence, we kind of get back to like, what is the equilibrium? Is it we throw this like, you know, circus, uh, food, food, and circus to the to the masses and just give them like GTA 6 with like some uber hot waifu AI girl and just hope that they leave us alone to to do stuff, or like, you know, you know, like, what, what is the actual equilibrium here? It doesn't seem like to combat, Justin, like, I don't think it's doomerous. It's just like, there's a, there's an equilibrium we're clearly gravitating towards, right, Alex? I mean, the equilibrium is like, you know, what do you, you know, even the most recent genius act or a set of Crypto legislation is like, let's, let's cut the bank's capital requirements, let's enable OC for bank custody of Crypto, let's put this stuff in people's retirement accounts, like, you know, let's, let's pump asset prices as hard as we possibly can, um, uh, that's the playbook, right? Like, it's very clearly the playbook. And, um, so, I think, you know, that's going to keep being the playbook. I don't see Trump becoming a populist. I do think he's going to lose, I think the Republicans will lose power in three and a half years. Uh, because I don't think this will be popular. But in the meanwhile, I think it's like, you know, I think, I think that's like why XRP is mooning, right? Or going back to the original discussion, it's like the plan is to deregulate the financial system and to run this thing up as fast as we can in order to, uh, hopefully, uh, quote unquote, grow our way out of it. You know, I don't know if that's possible.\nLet me just like differentiate between the two monkey brains we have. We have one side, which is like, oh my god, like, this is what the world's going towards, and then the other one, let's just call it the our portfolio brain, like, you know, we have to still optimize our portfolio in the meantime, regardless of, you know, where we're heading. And, um, you know, we, we've talked about how bonds are trash, we've talked about how, like, right now, uh, they're just trying to pump stuff up as hard as possible for our listeners, and, you know, even, even for us, um, obviously, see, you, whatever Crypto we've been holding has been going up. We've been, we've all been burned too long by like, round tripping a bunch of stuff, and you know, there, there's, there's some desire to take some profits here and there, but on the other side, like, it smells like, you know, we have to go higher. They're just pumping as hard as they can. They just passed this massive bill. Like you said, the, the fiscal side of this is just so enormous. Um, does it make sense to try to just position into like, you know, more legit assets? Does it make sense to go like all the way into the the spectrum and try to find a blowoff top? Like, how do you think it, it makes sense right now?\nI still like the whole, you know, part of the reason I was into XRP was because I liked the political reflexivity element. You know, I, I think, uh, it's very, very clear the Trump administration wants Crypto to thrive in the United States, uh, because of their financial positions and they're in power, and so, um, a lot of the coins which were hated in the previous administration, whether that be XRP, whether that be har, whether that be XLM, um, where, you know, it's kind of like this, like, in institutional integration thesis, um, those coins are probably, you know, people forget, people don't care about them, or they forgot about them, um, and I, I think, uh, that's like an interesting, you know, the DeFi sector is another kind of permutation of that, and so there's kind of like this, like, basket of coins which relates to institutional adoption. Um, and similarly with equity, like, it's kind of already priced into equities. Um, I think my, maybe my contrarian take is that Bitcoin is not like the cleanest expression of, uh, of this kind of reflexivity bet. You know, there's like a lot of leverage capital going into it. Uh, but Bitcoin is like kind of well suited for like what happens after the mess, right? It's like, okay, like after we blow up the banking sector, then you want to own Bitcoin, right? Bitcoin is always like Bitcoin or like Silicon Valley Bank, you know, when it, when it imploded, that was like the first god candle of Bitcoin. People were like, \"All right, like, you know, Satoshi's back.\"\nSo, so do you think like we're like an Alt Season where Bitcoin's going to lag and then it's gonna, it's going to pick up after we kind of blow up?\nYeah. I mean, that there's, there's like the whole Bitcoin treasury meta. Um, you're like, okay, like, what's the thesis here? The thesis is that you can get equity capital plowed into um, assets. And you're like, okay, well, what's the price impact on Bitcoin? It's like, probably not, not as much as like an Altcoin, right? Like an ETH treasury company. ETH is less liquid than Bitcoin. Of course, an ETH treasury company is going to drive the ETH price higher. Um, so I think as we like rotate down the stack of quality, um, you know, the, the, the effects are more extreme. And so, so if we're going to do this type of financial reflexivity thing, the most, the worst coins are actually going to perform better, uh, in some ways.\nHow, how about meme coins? Like, what, where do you put meme coins in in this current, current, uh, runup? We're seeing a lot of mixed stuff. We'll, we'll talk about the Pump.fun ICO, uh, later, but, um, ICO, not IPO yet. We'll see. But like, where, where do those position? I mean, they're a little bit different than the like, quote unquote, institutional coins.\nYeah, I think they're not as good just because they, they have, um, actually, it was like, ironically, the Torres XRP ruling that kind of brought me coins formally into, like, okay, these are not securities, right? Like, that was like the, uh, the thing that got Coinbase, uh, off the fence about memecoins was they're like, \"Okay, like, you know, if there's an expectation of profits, we can list this stuff in the United States, even, even under the Biden administration.\" And so I, I think, um, I think they're interesting from, from a just very, like, like, I think there are some meme coins that have attention flywheels, right? So an example would be the Trump memecoin. Uh, uh, and similarly, I think Morad has done a very good job promoting a basket of meme coins in a way that's like capturing, capturing attention. Actually, he's like narrowed the basket, which I think is good. Um, but, you know, I'm not like structurally like, oh yeah, like we're in like a memecoin super cycle. I'm like, if anything, I think the market price action is telling us that, uh, there are a lot of coins that are not maybe meme coins that are performing very well.\nIs it basically that the amount of capital that these like, you know, Zoomer Dgens have is just not anywhere near the amount of capital that the the doctors and the dentists have, basically?\nWell, there's like a interesting dynamic. I think I, I tweeted an economist chart talking about wealth distribution in in our society. And now it's now the 10% of GDP is inheritance. So a lot of the, a lot of the money that's flowing into\n\n\nThe speculative markets is actually from rich kids. It's not from like people trying to make it, which I think is like what the what people want to tell the story. People are like, \"Oh, you need to hyper gamble your way into the the upper class is the is the story.\" The reality is probably closer to like the upper class as children are hyper hyper gambling their way into the lower class, right? Like that's like probably more accurate. Um so so that that's kind of like bullish on meme quotes, right? You know, that would be the that would be the flip side is that the inheritance money that's going to the kids in West Village who are paying 8K a month for rent and don't have jobs, like that's the stuff that's going like straight into Morat's portfolio. Um, Alex, before we leave you, I I do want to ask like about Crypto AI. Obviously, we had like a little cycle last uh, you know, last time. Um, what do you think is going to be the resurgence? Because I I I mean, I have to believe there's going to be a, you know, a big boom in Crypto AI coins at some point, but where do you see that coming from? And like, how do you see that category reviving?\nWhen you say Crypto AI, do you mean crypto?\ncoin that like as part of its token is meant to be like an AI coin. Uh I know Taiki Maeda was saying fartcoin was an AI coin. That was that was speculative but like you know\nuh\nyeah I I have I have a thesis kind of around around this. Right. So I I have two categories I really really like. Um um the first is AI backed stable coins. Um so uh you know essentially because of the big beautiful bill uh GPU expenditures are taxdeductible and that's a huge difference in terms of the um yield dynamics uh associated with like you know financing a GPU. So, there's a world where you get tax-free GPU purchases for startups and like a lot of uh venture money and and crypto is like kind of an ideal way to bring this on chain uh especially if you have a lack of regulatory environments around stable coin requirements which is like definitely the case and so so kind of uh that's one category where basically I think there's going to be all this money flowing in trying to chase yield buying GPUs or like quote unquote RWA but the RWA is the actual GPUs. Uh and then the second area um is uh I guess proof of work, right? And obviously I have a position here uh because you know I'm along my my brother's protocol. But I think the cleanest representation of crypto is proof of work, right? As we know from Bitcoin and there's no real reason why you can't secure a proof of work chain with uh AI calculation. Uh there's something that my my brothers developed called proof of logits. um it's it's essentially using AI inference to mine blocks and then validate them in a Merkel tree similar to Bitcoin, right? And then kind of the the final area which I'm excited about which is I guess mycoin uh which is Post Fiat is um everyone in crypto is pretty familiar with Dows and how poorly they are administered. Um and there is just a governance problem in crypto uh with centralized actors, right? Like so so so generally like the the problem with Dows is there's a guy in the middle making all kinds of sub-optimal decisions. There's no auditability for these decisions. And you know my protocol is kind of like okay can we take this governance layer uh make it deterministic and verifiable and use the mathematical properties of mode collapse with large language models to be like you know what here's an objective decision about how rewards are allocated and how validators are selected. uh and that that is how you know I I think like you know the contra would be like you know Bit Tensor's OG model where they're like okay it's like a super political process this requires AI to get good enough and I think this was part of your post where the it gets so strong and like all the AIs converge on like a shared truth that basically you can like human beings just kind of outsource what the truth is to to these things and they can not do it yet you know I've tried I was playing we had this market making game that uh we played last time on the show that Vicki brought us and I've tried different questions and sometimes you know the answers of Chad GBT to some of these questions is is not fully accurate but as we get better and better that's kind of where things like you're talking about and maybe not just Dows but like you know political decisions in general start getting made by people just agreeing that this is going to be a base truth that we can uh rely on. How how long do you think that's going to take technology-wise?\nI think it's all it's starting to get there on the more powerful models. They're they're already kind of converging on very reasonable outputs for for simple decisions. Um and uh more complex decisions will be like kind of a function also of context windows, right? Because like you know with a 200,000 context window on Opus or something like that, it's just not enough to pull in a lot of uh qualitative data and make make a decision even with like a 8K or something like that. But as context windows grow, the capability of these models to come up with kind of objective decisions in like a oneshock verifiable run is way better. And I think like the intuitive area for this, you know, the the crypto categories that are going to benefit the most are going to be like uh proof of authority, right? Because uh that's the area where there's the biggest centralization uh issue. um and any sort of crypto protocol with you know a big foundation in the middle uh will will have a lot of benefits from that. So so I'll leave it there and then that's foreshadowing to future future discussions.\nYeah and we'll have to uh we'll have to chat a lot more because this stuff is just going to keep evolving at such a hyper speed. Uh Alex, thank you so much for for coming on.\nCheers. Yeah, thanks for having me guys.\nCheers, Alex.\nAll right, lads. We have uh Santiago Santos here with us now. We got some interesting topics. We'll talk about the Pump ICO. We'll talk about uh you know this ever going on discussion about Bitcoin versus Soul versus ETH and then we'll talk about Treasury Companies. We have a couple uh segments and then we'll do pasta. But Santi, have you have you been expecting this sudden like explosion of the market? Like are are you are you uh have you have you had your seat bel seat belt buckled?\nI don't know, man. I I every time I've sort of been long enough in this game that I've lost any hope of trying to time this market, but you just can you're I think in my chair I just assume that any given day I wake up the market can be dramatically up or dramatically down and I'm just going to stay unbothered, moisturized in my lane. But the the the reality is like you could be a cynic or a skeptic in how like crypto trades. Like we can overintellectualize why these things are pumping and then someone pulls up the M2 chart and says this flows. Like don't overthink it. This is a lever NASDAQ. Call it a day. Everything in the traditional markets is hitting alltime high. Crypto people want to go off farther off in the risk spectrum. They've downplayed the geopolitical tension. They've downplayed the Trump uh schizophrenic tweets. So like the market just gets used to all of that and then you look past. So I don't know like are we pumping because the Genius Act got passed or because a lot of these like fundamental things that you guys are paying attention to that I re think that over like a 2, three, 5 year 10 year period. Yeah, absolutely. This space is going to 10x like we're going to be at a $40 trillion asset class in 10 years probably. And so the question is do you really want to just like overintellectualize or just be fancy in how you trade with leverage all this stuff? I have done it as a younger buck. I don't have any time to do that now. Um nor I think it it pays in the long term. Like we were just talking about before the segment. How many funds do you guys think outperform Bitcoin? They get paid 220 professional investors to think, breathe, try to get an edge over retail. How many of those guys do you think actually outperform Bitcoin and they have access to the early stage deals and all this? Is it a is it a skill issue or is it just the fact that, you know, the the it's stacked against them because if if Bitcoin is just, you know, trudging along as a pure asset and they have to get returns that beat it, I mean, they're probably doing better than uh traditional VCs, aren't they? I don't I don't mean depends on if they're AI focused or not.\nYeah, I think so. Like, well, it depends, right? If you're if you were a fund and you raised uh 2022, you're not. And if you're a traditional venture fund, but if you were if your vintage is before 2020 20 like before like the Fed funds rate went to four, yeah, you would like unless you did something terribly wrong, you should have outperformed the traditional like MVCA venture top tier. Uh but it even then I think a just a lot of capital is flooded in everyone like invested in venture and these deals and I think I think it does it dovetales into I think what you guys talk about in this segment like which assets are you going to pick there's just a lot of overhang like certainly if you invested like sub 50 million in an infrastructure project that is now trading at a billion like yeah okay you're sitting pretty but um there's just a lot of overhang that I I think even though we're pumping I would say that like there's still some projects that need to absor absorb a lot of the unlock. And so I think if you're just sitting here like one of the things that I'm paying so much attention to is okay if the if bit if for every incremental percentage increase in Bitcoin what is the beta of every other asset that you have farther out on the risk spectrum and are you getting compensated because now everyone comes out and says I'm a it's that time in the market where M is a genius and they say told you Deepen is now pumping, Ethereum is now pumping, everything is pumping. like, \"Yeah, but did it outperform Bitcoin?\"\nYou know, in my own experience, it's been really interesting. Like, when I, you know, started making more content and having the opportunity to angel invest starting 2021, 2022 seemed like a great opportunity at the time. But I'm very, I track this stuff very carefully. I'm very confident that just buying Bitcoin would have been much easier, much better return liquidity. And most of the things I invested in have not fully unlocked, have not started to unlocked, and there's just like uncertain about whether there's even demand for these assets to begin with. So yeah, I totally agree with you. I don't think it's at all surprising though. I mean, most hedge funds outperform the S&P. Most venture funds out underperform, excuse me, underperform the S&P. So, I think it's to be expected and I think um a lot of the edge and crypto venture is probably going to go continue to go away.\nYeah. And to follow up on that, I think, you know, I think most of us agree that you know, liquid is probably better than like cutting checks right now or like writing checks right now. Um and you said you're unbothered, right? Um and I'm sure you are. Uh but I think before we started recording you said that you own zero basically zero Ethereum. Um and I remember some time ago you said that you think you know Solana is going to flip Ethereum. Um and I like really like your reasoning right your logic for how you got there. But do you have any updated thoughts given that solely has slightly underperformed and Ethereum is finally producing like you know pumps right um it's no longer has this function like what are your thoughts there? Yeah, I mean I think it's still very much predicated on I'm looking at Solana is still hundred billion dollar fully diluted market. Ethereum is three times that I believe or more 430. So the question is like on a routed basis do you think that Solana should be 13 or 1/4 of the value of Ethereum L1 and I I still think that that's mispriced over a three-year period. I think that ratio continues to go up and to the right. Um, unless there's like some some the only thing that has given me pause is I think Solana finds itself in an interesting place where Pump.fun has now rage quit to some extent or to a full extent and and then hyperlquid has come around and if the thesis for Solana was it's the most retail friendly chain and you saw that because you have phantom the whole apparatus of like phantom pump and that ecos that that is just it has been the place where normies have just onboarded in the vast majority.\nYeah.\nIn addition to that, I mean, what are your thoughts that we're seeing like Wall Street is coming, but they want to have their own execution environments and that it seems pretty clear to me they actually do like the layer 2 model and do you think that diminishes the Solana thesis? Like why why do you have to go to Solana when you can use one of these layer 2?\nExcellent point. Look, I don't think it diminishes. I generally think that it's expanding the pie so it's not diminishing um on an absolute basis. I just think like you're you're probably alluding to Robin Hood launching an Arbitrum and you can look at Arbitrum's performance on a ETH basis and Bitcoin basis and that chart just looks nasty. I say this I say this licking my wounds as an early investor in Arbitrum. I and you would say look they build phenomenal tech. I do I do think like even even us Inversion we are going to launch our own chain. I think I think the the calculus for enterprises is clear in in institutions that they want to prefer their own customizable environment and they're going to do that either through an L1 out of the box like Avalanche allows you to or um you know Ethereum just has more Lindy um I think you know Black Rockck I think back in the day like last year they announced and they supported a couple of chains where they wanted to build and Solana was not one of them and I think a lot of that was you just had so much memecoin activity that you probably think Larry just thinks twice, right? Can that change? Yeah, I don't think it changes my uh my rationale as to why I think soul probably the soul ether ratio probably goes higher.\nUh\nyeah,\nun unless can't figure out fire dancer because if they can't figure out fire dancer and uh I'm not like technical gigabrain here, nor do I pretend to be one, but I am paying attention to that. I do think that the people within Salena are like a bit worried about hyperl\n\n\nYeah, they're definitely worried about Hyperlquid, and they're also trying to fight this stocks battle.\nThey got X stocks, and then you have, uh, you have, we talked about how savage, uh, Vlad is, you know, he's got his Cravat in can.\nHe's just showing up and, uh, putting on a spectacle.\nI think, um, you know, the initial volumes I was seeing on those X stocks are quite low, and the liquidity is still being figured out in terms of, like, is this a broker model, like, uh, and what is the demand exactly?\nSo there's a lot, there's a lot to play out there, but Solana, uh, probably needs to get out of just memecoin territory.\n\nUm, let's talk about the Pump ICO.\nSo I know you're, you're an early investor in Pump.\nYou're one of the lucky, uh, ones that I imagine the valuation is, uh, is still extremely good as a return.\nWe talked about not many things are returning.\nUm, there's been a lot of mixed comments and mixed, uh, reactions as to their launch.\nIt's a very unique launch from a market maker and just from a general trader perspective.\nI love being a part of the whole thing because it's such a unique thing.\nYou don't have a billion-plus rays going liquid day one very often.\nI think it's maybe like, you know, it's been forever since we had something like this happen.\nAnd it created these dynamics where even like market neutral funds were starting to get in on the action because you in essence had Hyperlquid.\nHad like hundreds of millions of open interest.\nAnd this is something we saw with the Trump memecoin as well.\nIt showed time and time again that if there's a new onchain launch with a huge amount of attention, Hyperlquid does become the venue for, um, most of the open interest at least at the beginning.\nI think there's a couple reasons for it.\nOne is they're, uh, they're pretty quick, you know, to shoot and and get the contract up.\nYou allow Americans, non-KYC, K, whatever.\nEveryone's just going in.\nIt just becomes like this, like, suck of liquidity, and liquidity gets liquidity.\nI noticed some of the major exchanges, I saw like BuyBit completely dropped the ball, and this, they, their maximum open interest was 500k.\nOn Hyperlquid, I don't think there was a maximum.\nYou can just, like, do whatever.\nBinance was a little bit smarter.\nIt was 12.5 million.\nSo, I think that's why, you know, they started to, uh, to catch up.\nBut there's so many aspects of this that made it fascinating.\nUm, the pre-market people trying to get allocation, and then they, they kind of got rugged on some of the centralized exchanges.\nThey, uh, they thought they got it, then they hedged, and then it went up.\nIt was chaos.\nDid any of you guys, uh, uh, I guess, like, as Americans, you're not supposed to participate in in ICO.\nYou have to go through somebody.\nI participated in the ICO and also long the perp.\nI mean, obviously, participating in the ICO went well, and then participating in the perp not so much.\nUm, personally, I think it's very undervalued here.\nI, I actually think, like, at some point before this all comes crashing down, it's going to hit 10 billion FDV.\nI think just looking at the top coins, like, I think Pump.fun deserves to be up there.\nI think it has a ton of mind share, a ton of activity, and also they're a very ambitious team.\nLike, I think going after live streaming is obviously like a huge challenge, but I think it's ambitious, and if bring up the chart because it's just been, it's been a fascinating ride since it came out.\nI think, um, it, it kind of traded around this 25% premium on the ICO for a while, where just even like the $100 million checks, this was, I mean, I don't want to get your thoughts on this, Santiago, because I was very surprised that the $100 million checks and the $50 million checks, this all on chain, they started selling tokens, I guess, because they're just like, oh, well, I'm up 50% in a week, I like, yeah, like, whatever, like, I'm, I'm just going to take some profit, and they, they sold significant amounts.\nSo, a lot of profit capture.\nAnd then on the 16th, we had this pump to 7 cents where they started doing buybacks.\nAnd as soon as the buyback stopped, we've just sort of been bleeding back down.\n\nUm, let's start with this, like, huge market neutral kind of activity.\nLike, what do you think about $100 million check selling in a week?\nWell, uh, I mean, you're a trader, right?\nIf you have the opportunity to clip that, it's, it's IR.\nI mean, you're going to take it in size.\nThere's, there's, I, I, you know, of course you take it.\nThe, the other dynamic here is, uh, I mean, funds, it's been a weird cycle.\nI think if you zoom out, um, if you weren't allocated to very specific assets, and by that I mean Bitcoin, Hyperlquid, and and Solana, or maybe like Fartcoin, you did not outperform Bitcoin.\nAnd so fund managers are feeling the pain.\nYou're thinking how much am I going to get cliff in December of Carrie, and I'm still underwater.\nAnd so I feel like it's just been a funky cycle, whereas maybe we're catching up to, like, where everything pumps.\nUm, but, like, you're gonna take the win, and and you're going to feel the pressure to take the win faster, and and so I think I'm just saying it doesn't help that, like, it's been a far more concentrated cycle in terms of returns, and so not surprised.\nI mean, the market's just going to do its thing, and and so I, I've generally try to shy away from the first couple of weeks or even months, like Hyperlord, for instance, if you have that chart, the airdrop, it airdrop, and of course, like, there was just a three-month period was kind of like, you had to, you had to recycle, you had to, like, parse through all of those sellers and absorb that, and then it just went, you know, of course, liberation day, like, it went all the way down to 10, but, like, that I would say December all the way to March, maybe even mid-mid-February, you had that what I would call trading and changing of hands dramatically are the air airdrop, uh, folks.\nPump is different, right?\nBecause you, you didn't have an airdrop, but you had big funds and and huge amounts of capital to the tune of what is it, 800 million that just bought at 4 and a half, so you know, and I, I would think it, you got to clear through that, right?\nAnd people are just going to continue to sell, and so it's so much money, right?\nLike, that's why, like, I'm so, uh, it's so expected, like, the trenches are, like, dying right now.\nThey're all, you know, they all went all at, like, 5 cents, and now they're, like, underwater, and they don't understand what's happening.\nBut there's literally billions of, like, there's $1.3 billion in profit, and you know, when it was at 7 cents, it's at billion, it takes a while to just absorb, and I think the team has shown that they do want to do buybacks.\nUm, we'll kind of see, like, how things shake out, but there shouldn't be this expectation that it's just like free money, and it's going to go up straight to 10 without any, any, like, Hyperlquid at least, like, uh, bounciness.\nBut listen, to be fair, like, it, they've done the buyback.\nI think they started doing the buybacks now.\nThey started, yeah.\nYeah.\nAbout $30 million worth.\nI think that that's important.\nLike, so my thing is, make an argument of why this thing can't convert in Hyper Liquid if it's printing the same amount of, uh, revenue, or and it's doing buybacks, uh, you know, why couldn't this be a $40 billion asset?\nWe very well may be in a situation in 6 months where this thing goes to 40 billion.\nI would not flinch.\nI, I think, I think, I think the Hyperlquid one is done, like, automatically, it just, it takes revenue, puts it in, and then it's the same difference, like, you know, trying to, like, ever raise as a trading firm versus trade, like, as, like, a, a firm that is, like, a software SAS company.\nYou see the difference in, like, multiples of, like, you know, AR versus, like, uh, and so, like, if people can reliably expect that definitely, like, this is going to go into the chart, then they start, I mean, the, the multiple on Hyperl is a little bit rich, by the way, like, on a fully diluted base, it's, it's a 45x, on, on a non-fully diluted, I guess it's like a 20 or something, but, um, if people can see that they have some mechanism that it's, like, more less ad hoc, and it's just, like, automatically just, just pumping it in, then maybe the multiple can grow.\nIs, is that, is that maybe, uh, how it's looked at?\nI, I, I think, I think so.\nI think if, if the buybacks are, like, you know, to, to the discretion of the team, then the Pump token just becomes a token where you just buy it when you know they fund the buyback wallet, and then you, like, dump into the buybacks, and then, like, repeat that process.\nSo I feel like right now the Pump token doesn't have, like, everyone's trust, right?\nIf they can do, like, maybe a million dollars of buybacks a day, and that's, like, predictable, then I feel like, you know, you can actually hold the asset, like, right now it's, like, still kind of murky, um, but I'm sure the team will figure it out, right?\nThey have so much money, like.\nAsk you guys right now, we're trading about 10% of the ICO price, about 4.4, 4 billion FDV.\nI'm long Pump here and thinking of adding, given that we're so close to this price point where there was basically, I mean, I don't want to say infinite demand, but there was clearly more demand than supply.\nDo you think at this point, like, this is a pretty attractive position to hold Pump or?\nI think psychologically, like, they can't let it, they can't let it go below four, like, so.\nWhat does, what does that mean, Jordy?\nJust put it back into the charts as we used to say or?\nWell, they have two, like, like, take you said they have, like, $2 billion or something, right?\nLike, I, I don't know exactly the amount, but they, they've made 600, and then they raised 1.3, I mean, you know, they're under attack by Bonk, whatever is happening in the Bonk ecosystem with, like, useless token and worthless token, there's, there's, like, all kinds of, like, launchpad wars going on.\nI think, um, they still have their, like, revenue, they have to just show that they're, they're, they're still taking care of their token.\nI think they have to do a simulation analysis.\nOkay.\nIn what version of this world does Pump underperform and Hyperlquid vastly outperforms, or like, I guess I would bucket this in, like, putting bit, like, there's a, from a portfolio construction, like, everyone's going to maybe allocate some to Bitcoin, and then what are the odds of of Hyperl vastly outperforming Pump, and how much flows does it take for a Pump to, like, 2x from here versus Hyperlquid, and a lot of, like, I, I've just, I'm not a trader, like, Jordy, you're the expert here, but I've started, like, over the years, just appreciated much more of the flows game.\nOf course, like, Ripple, in comes Ripple and, like, defies all odds.\nUm, I was just talking about, like, yesterday on another podcast of, like, why I think Ripple is probably the, your normie friend is buying Ripple right now is going to outperform you if you're in the trenches.\nBut, um, but I think Pump, um, I could see Pomp.\nKobe said it to me once way back.\nI heard from him.\nSaid something to the effect of, like, he or someone he knew made vid much, much, much more money on Litecoin than they did in Bitcoin because the catchup trade is that revenge trade and, like, much harder and pumps harder.\nSo if you miss Hyperlquid, and Pump starts developing this narrative that it's similar to Hyperlquid, to your point, Justin, that's a buy because the market's going to, it's going to just push it to that level, right?\nAnd and it all it takes is a couple of people.\nWhat what Hyperlid had going for it is just the the pristineess of airdrop community, everyone rallied, there's people that made a lot of money, and so you had these, like, very voracious people that just, but it's a great product, right?\nAnd the funds didn't have access, right?\nLike, Paradigm had to go by, uh, you know, after the launch, like, unless you were an active trader, you didn't have, uh, tokens.\nAnd so I think the one challenge, and I and I told the Pump team is just everyone's already going to have access from the, like, from from that 4 billion raise, like, basically everyone who really wants it in size even can get it.\nUm, you know, it turned out, you know, with things being shut off to Americans and UK, and they, they, they had to find other ways and and buy it on purp.\nBut, um, that's one challenge that's different from Hyperlid.\nEverybody's already in, and now everyone is just a little bit disappointed because they thought it was going to be like this, this amazing free multiex right away, which was not realistic.\nYes, like, asset can be priced higher.\nObviously, like, something that makes 600 million a year can be priced a lot higher than, uh, than 4B fully diluted.\nUm, so I think, I think what we're all aligning on is if they execute really well and get a good clean story from now, they have an opportunity to, uh, to do amazingly well.\nUm, and they'll just have to navigate, and they've, they've shown some good chops so far.\nI think it's a very young, chaotic team, but they have a lot of really good instincts, and they've shown that, you know, many times.\nSo, um, they're, they're in the trenches themselves right now.\nUh, they have to fend off all these competitors and have to fend off all the the FUD and everything going on.\nSo, uh, it'll be fascinating to watch.\nBut like I said, it, it was just so interesting to see, like, how divergent people thought.\nI was quite sure that the price was going to be, you know, in that, like, five, $6 range for a while because that's how much the market can absorb of immediate profit.\nAnd then from there, uh, I also knew it was going to sell out right away because once there was a pre-market, it was obvious that you would get the same funds that put money into Plasma.\nI don't know if you guys remember the plasma one, but they, they, like, they filled 500 million instantly, and then they did another 500, and that filled in the half an hour.\nAnd so once you start getting similar sources of onchain stable coins as plasma, it was kind of inevitable that it was going to fill up right away.\nSo it's kind of played out like I expected so far.\nI think now what matters is how the team executes and, uh, if they can get the trust that they'll be treating this as as a Hyperlquid.\nSo, um, fascinating one.\nI think everyone, everyone's waiting to see the the next parts of that movie.\nBut let's switch, um, let's switch a couple more topics, uh, while we have.\n\n\nSanti. So, um, the other rage is treasury companies. I mean, I'm seeing ones for like every shitcoin under the sun now in every country. There's like an Israeli one for, you know, I, I don't want to like buying a liquor company and realizing that the devs had infinite mint function.\n\nJustin thought that turns out that the docs allow the company to issue and dilute the out of you. Ah, you thought crypto FTV was bad.\n\nRepeatable proxy contracts also happen in Trafi. It's a feature, not a bug, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nAll right, but let's zoom out, though. I mean, people have been like wondering what's going to be the SPF of this cycle, what's going to bring down the cycle, and uh, you know, they were saying Sailor, but now we have like Sailor copycats, and we have a ton of them, and they're hyper accelerating, you know, the cycle. They're looking for, you know, this like easy money from the treasury markets because that, that, sorry, the equity markets. Um, Santi, do you think this is what's going to bring down the cycle? I mean, it seems like a candidate.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I am very vocal against treasury, um, companies in the sense of like, crypto just likes to push everything to the extreme. And look, I was, I've been surprised that Sailor and MicroStrategy have been able to pull it off, and I get structurally how they've been able to do it, basically in a way that they don't get liquidated by being levered long Bitcoin. And it's, it's very interesting and creative. I think, look, hats off to them.\n\nUm, the reality is, uh, there's only one Sailor, and the level of sophistication of MicroStrategy and how they've been able to structure this at in size is not how your typical, uh, you know, opportunistic, um, you know, low market cap operator sponsor is structuring these deals. A, they don't have the chops, and they're not very competent. Like, pretty much nine out of 10 people I've talked to, I'm like, I would not hire you. I mean, I'm like, excuse me, like, they can't explain things, are just like pointing out the MicroStrategy. Uh, look, can you make money to Justin's point? Like, absolutely. Uh, is Joe Luben's probably more differentiated? Tom Lee is probably more differentiated than your, you know, the vast tail end. But I, I do think it poses a challenge.\n\nLook, uh, the name of the company is a virgin. Of course, I'm ascribed to Charlie Mer and that, you know, Graham and like fundamental analysis. I don't think anyone here can justify the premium being sustaining over a prolonged period of time. It just won't. And the nasty part of it is that it unwinds, and it can definitely go negative.\n\nI want to like explain to like the viewers a little bit like the dynamic because it took me a while to wrap my head around it, and then I realized that, you know, Justin Sun's been doing this stuff all along. Um, I don't know if you guys remember some of like the stable coins that Justin Sun had double.\n\nThere were like, yeah, there was like a few of them, and they would sometimes de-peg. He would like not say anything. It could be some FUD. It would go down to like 90 cents, 80, 70 cents, and then he just like buys it back at 70 cents, and suddenly he's made, you know, 30%. This is like part of the potential play of these treasury companies, which is literally they can trade against the people buying in a perfect way because they have the NAV. If it goes under NAV, they just buy, like, they, they kind of, you know, break open the piggy bank, and they sell some tokens, so they make money. If it trades above NAV, they just issue at the monies. And so it's just free money, and the only thing that they require is just activity. They just require attention and people to trade. And as long as they trade up or down and there's volatility, you know, you can even do what Sailor does, which is, you know, harvest the volatility directly with converts. In essence, it's an attention game. If you can manage to get attention, and this is why like the Tom Lees, it's not that like a lot of these like visible people are more competent, it's just that they have, you know, they have, they have, uh, they have a lot of attention on them, and so they can drive trading. Like, you know, you got Justin on his, you know, his Robin Hood after hours selling and buying. I mean, I mean, Justin is one of the, you know, ones maybe can make money on this, but like a lot of the other participants, as long as there's participants, it's like what Santiago says is true, they're just gonna win, and everybody else is gonna lose. You're just, you're just at the mercy because, you know, you're not, you're not game of musical chairs.\n\nAs long, look, and Howard Marks has a, I love his letters, and at some point, I think he, he was like, listen, I know I've been bearish. I know I've been calling for the last five years that the market is like irrational, and he was like, I get it. You're an asset manager. You need a da, you need a dance when the music is on. Just make sure you have an action plan when the music shuts down, and you better, you better know where the exit is, and you better make godamn make sure that the door is wide enough to support all the other deents that are playing this game, and you know, cuz that was not the case when Terra Luna happened.\n\nWhat's the safety plan here? Do you think, uh, for someone that's trying to make sure they don't roundtrip their gains, like myself, would be one, one example of that? Do you think the play is to look at top 20 treasury companies, and the second one of them dips below NAV, then maybe you start taking profit? How do you think about that? Like, do these, you know, they go fine, and they explode all at once, similar to Luna, or is it, is it going to be something else?\n\nOh, I don't know. That's a billion trillion dollar question. Um, as I said, I, it would really suck if in five years time you said, \"God damn, you know that meme of like, son, are you winning?\" You're like, \"Yeah, you know, I was early in Ethereum, it Ethereum pumps to 15K, and somehow you lost money, or like, you know, because if the NAV is four times, right? Imagine if the asset goes up three times, and you're sitting there thinking you've done pretty because you bought all these, uh, treasury shell companies or holding companies, and, and you bought, and you unsuspectingly thought that it was going to track the price of the underlying. And maybe that might be true, but I guess it would really suck if you bought it at such a premium that you actually didn't end up making as much money. And so, yeah, is that possible? Is that an edge case? Very likely. I mean, it's true. To be clear, like myself, I don't would never hold these for the long term. I don't hold any at this moment now. And I think probably our listeners aren't as well. But I guess I'm wondering if it's going to trickle down into actually just regular spot, right? Like, if if Michael Sailor is underwater and MicroStrategy is below NAV, like, what, what does that do to Bitcoin? Like, presumably it's not going to be good. Maybe Michael, maybe Sailor doesn't have to sell, but maybe some of these other treasury companies that have stacked billions of dollars of Bitcoin are forced to. And, and like the fear that they might sell might be enough, right? It has, they don't even have to sell. Like, if people fear that they might sell, then people just like might start selling spot.\n\nIt's, it's a spiral effect that, that this is how the enemy gets crushed, right? Look at, look at UPEXi. And for full disclosure, I did a small position there. I did not contribute locked FTXL. I put in fresh US American dollars into it. Um, and look at the volume of that thing. This is UPEX UPXI. Um, and you know, they, they've now announced, uh, Big Brain Holdings has put like 150 million more of Soul into it. I've heard rumblings of like Joe's vehicle raising billions of dollars of locked FTX soul. Um, but like, look at the VNET thing is, uh, very different than the V that you have in Solana. So,\n\nI don't know, like, Jordy, I'm actually really curious to hear your thoughts on, like, do you, do you actually participate in these things, or do you, being a sophisticated person that you are, like, or would rather use per options or other mechanisms, cuz, cuz that's, I would argue that like the only, this is like a preying on the convenience factor of like, oh, it's a levered bet, and so, you know, I, I don't want to, in the case of MicroStrategy, like, you don't, you're not going to get liquidated, it's a levered bet on Bitcoin, and then some of these are pedaling the fact that they're going to, you know, do other things like staking services and validation.\n\nI don't, I don't even think it's a lever bet on Bitcoin, honestly. Like, none of these things are even levered bets on any of the tokens. They're just bets on the team being able to, like I said, just generate this sort of like ARB profit and being a, being able to like enter at a price that it's so weird. I hate these games with like the lock up again. You know, you like Panta, everyone's done a bunch of these, and they're all up like X multiX, and then there's like a six-month lock up, and what's going to happen when that lockup comes, and what's the liquidity on these things? I mean, uh, what, who's going to, like, who's going to market make and put bids and offers on these things once, once things start getting crazy? It's, it's kind of wild to me. I, I much prefer like the onchain economy. I'm much more of a, of a purist and a, and a token guy than these like, Yeah, they're saying soon we're gonna have like a tokenized version of the wrapped equity of the token. Like, it's, it's going to come like full circle.\n\nIt's, um, yeah, it's not something that we've participated in. We've looked at a few. I think the hyperlquid one that went out kind of made sense because that one is quite hard to get access to, um, and there are people that want to get access to it. Um, I think there's, there's a couple more that, you know, have a similar like reason to exist, but most of these don't. And I think it's going to be, you know, it's a fight for attention, like even for the Bitcoin ones. Uh, only a few will, will manage to keep enough attention.\n\nI do wonder if it does make sense in some of these countries. Uh, I think Nakamoto told us that they're, they're, you know, they're supporting in many countries now.\n\nYou got them all across the world in Scandinavia, and you know, there's, there's like, uh, in Asia, there, there's all kinds of like national stock exchanges that are going to have a Bitcoin company, and maybe for some of these countries, for some of these people, like, it does make sense, but it's like grayscale 2.0. I know it does feel like inevitably, you know, we, we'll be above NAV, and then it'll be under NAV, and then people are going to want to figure out how to convert it out, or I don't know.\n\nUh, I hope it doesn't blow up, but I do think that this probably continues for the next 6 months, and then who knows after that.\n\nLet's, let's finish on this topic then. Like, so, uh, obviously we're in in a massive mini liquidity cycle right now. Um, I've said before, like, I love how you just said that, which is like, you could massive liquidity cycle wasn't, why don't you just call it a massive bull market?\n\nJust caveat, he's a sophisticated individual. He's a sophisticated individual. Jordy's going to be right no matter what, right? Because if, if a market crashes tomorrow, he's like, I told you it was sophisticated, you know, like, like flows were just going out, brother in Christ, not it.\n\nMy, it's good.\n\nThat, that's true, that's 100% true, that I'm not, I'm not yet, I'm not yet convinced that it is a bull market. I, I, I, I think it, it is in some ways, but, but not like in a traditional way. Maybe I know you guys put out an episode that it's confirmed. Um, I, I think like we, we do continue to melt up in, in, in some of these assets, but, um, are we going to have like a whole year of things going up? I really, I really don't know. Um, so yeah, I think this is like a liquidity surge, and and we'll see like what it, what it turns into. But I, I guess this is the question then, like, we were saying earlier, it sniffs like up and then down, but it just sniffs like has to go up first. Like the momentum is too much. Um,\n\nyou said 6 months. Uh,\n\nis, Yeah, fair. Fair. Incredibly arbitrary. Uh, and I'd have no basis for that. It's just that it sounds nice, and uh, but I mean, the, so the interesting thing is Ripple is pumping hard, and I read a lot into that.\n\nWhy? has said differently. If you get 10 texts from people, normies, they're likely going to ask you about two, maybe three assets, uh, not Bitcoin. They're going to ask you about Ripple, Cardano, and so XRP, Cardano, and maybe some other random you never heard of, like Hideera or something like that. No, I'm, I'm dead serious. Do they ask you about like Maker or Hyperliquid? Maybe. Maybe Hyperliquid, maybe probably Fartcoin. You, I mean, like, it, they're going to ask you, uh, this is where I'm going. Three, three things are going to ask you, right? And I'm willing to someone make me a market, and we can, we can somehow collect information, right? But it's Ripple, Cardano, and Fartcoin, maybe Doge. That's it. Like, that's just, and, and look at the top 10 to understand. But, but those tourists don't tend to like last long, like, you know, the Doge cycle is not, it's not a long part of the cycle, right? Like when that stuff,\n\nhold on, but wait a minute, you talk about flows, you want to understand where flows go, they go to Doge, Ripple, uh, Cardano, and legacy coins, why? Because they've captured the mind share of an entire tourists that come and go. So in the summer, people go to Capri in Italy and the south of France, same thing here, most of the new flow, like crypto still continues to be a retail phenomenon. So I, I guess like, uh, I'm, I hate to to think like that, but the sad reality of crypto is that it's just a casino at the moment, and inversion, but I don't want to show my project. But nonetheless, if you just take that view, then\n\n\nYeah, of course.\nLike I'm not surprised, nor am I going to make a prediction that the top 10 composition is going to dramatically change because man, I was I was making a prediction four or five years ago that Cardano is going to drop off at the top 10.\nIt's now top 10 if you exclude Tether and USDC from that list.\nI mean, we we all recognize these things have this retail phenomenon, but it's so hard to touch this stuff.\nAre you actually long any of this or\nI don't I don't own any of that.\nI mean, I was full disclosure, I was an early investor in Hideera, but a long honestly long punch out of that one.\nI've owned and I've owned every I've had wallets that have owned pretty much all these things.\nYeah, I I I heard I heard I heard it like on your last show you're saying um now like 50% Bitcoin makes sense and that's quite new from you.\nLike what's changed there?\nWell, two things on a personal level.\nI just have zero zero time.\nI don't consider myself a trader.\nYou have to crypto forces you to think about risk management because if something grows to a point where you're going to make mistakes and that's the first lesson I learned in crypto which is coming at it from a venture standpoint I had to adjust to thinking as a trader purely for risk management reasons.\nThat's hard lesson.\nUm the other one now is I don't have time.\nI'm not actively trading these things.\nI'm 100% dedicating my time to building.\nBut I will say a part of me now thinks that Bitcoin is the ultimate meme.\nUh subtle but important things like in on Bloomberg you have the denominator now has changed to bill millions and now it's 0.1 Bitcoin you know and and I mean God you got to think that in the next 10 years Bitcoin is going to touch a million and it's going to be glorious and you it would suck that if you're here 20 25 and in 10 years time your kids say daddy daddy or mommy you're incredible you must be winning so hard and you're like, \"No, son.\nI bought um reststate derivative and you know,\nI get layer\nand your normie friend out there says, \"Dude, what are you talking about?\nYou introduced me to Bitcoin and and and I bought Cardano and Ripple and I'm sitting on a boat in the south of France.\"\nListen, I've seen this story time and time again.\nThe the the thing that you should always be asking you which goes back to how we started this discussion was how many incremental risk units are you taking for your expected return\nand in my calculus I think that Bitcoin continues to give you I now am of the mind that I can Bitcoin's become far and far less risky where I'm trading very little incremental risk units to get a pretty asymmetric return that to me that ratio is probably the most compelling ing of any other asset class out there.\nLet's go to pasta.\nJustin, you want to kick off pastas?\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, it's been obviously a great couple weeks for ETH holders.\nI've been very euphoric, excited, active in all the Telegram chats.\nI'm scrolling my feed and I see this tweet and my jaw drops.\nI'm super excited.\nI I'm euphoric, but I'm even more euphoric now.\nAnd I see that of Genny from Wintermute tweets, there is in quotes clearly almost no hashtag ETH available for sale on Wintermute OTC desk.\nI'm sending this to the group chats.\nI'm all excited.\nThey're literally running out of ETH.\nExchange ETH supplies at an all-time low.\nSure enough, I pinged Jordy.\nI was like, Jordy, is this is this true at all?\nIt's like, no, it's very easy to get new ETH.\nHe's just trolling and\nit's a troll, but he got he got ,000 views.\nSo, like, you know, very good engagement for him there.\nI think again he's learning the dark art.\nYeah.\nSo there there's no credence to this.\nThey're running out of coins on the exchange, right?\nThere's always more coins.\nThere is a lot of out there.\nThere no one's running out of\n20 million ETH out there.\nUh Taiki, what do you got?\nYeah, so I think you know maybe it was a month ago uh we had a main character, his name was James Win.\nUm and you know he was this Martin Galing long Bitcoin, right?\nUh he was getting all this attention.\nHe was really enjoying life.\nI think he gained a bunch of followers.\nYou know, he had a meme point he was chilling to.\nUh so I was like, \"Okay, he must be doing fairly well now, right?\"\nI mean, like everything is breaking out.\nUh and just if you can share my screen, I I found out that you know, James Win couple days ago, he was all caps going full short and then he deleted his account.\nUh so, you know, it's just, you know, never stop gambling, but just never get liquidated.\nSanti, do you have a Do you have a pasta?\nYeah, I do.\nIt's uh Well, no surprise.\nUh the\neveryone saw the CEO that was um caught.\nThere it is.\nJeff Park coming in Savage Street.\nHe said, \"My CEO would never cheat and it's that picture of the them, you know, in the concert.\"\nUm which I don't.\nYeah.\nThoughts on this?\nThat that I love when the mainstream memes kind of uh come into crypto.\nThat that uh that video was just so viral.\nUm\nit just ignited something in everybody.\nI saw\nall right let's finish up with my pasta.\nI know people have to run.\nSo I have uh you know how Kobe always like has a picture of some blonde person.\nHe's like this is not me guys.\nSo, this is the latest one, but there's like an amazing twist here that kind of ties into the AI conversation.\nSo, Kobe uh, you know, responds to like, you know, some some girl here.\nUh, he says, \"Please stop tagging me.\nLooks looks unlike me.\"\nOkay, the usual Kobe uh Kobe tweet.\nAnd then somebody says, \"Hey, Grock, does the original photo resemble Kobe or Jordan Fish?\"\nAnd then we have a neutral observer.\nThis is what we're talking about before.\nThis is like the the base truth.\nsays, \"Upon close analysis, Hunter Schaefer does bear a notable resemblance to Kobe Jordan Fish, particularly in facial structure, blue eyes, and fair features.\nThe similarities been more pronounced.\nThis was just like the most amusing thing I've seen.\nThis is amazing.\nSo, I think\nKobe down, what the\nCan you scroll down a little more, Justin?\nOh,\nwow.\nHe's apologizing.\nHe's like, \"Sorry, Kobe.\nIt is what it is.\nIt's why the meme endures.\nEmbrace the twin vibes.\nSo, um, you know, this is a little bit better than the, uh, what was that AIXBT kind of thing that that was talking on Twitter.\nI think Grock has leveled up.\nThis is like this is this is much much more enjoyable to read.\nI don't even uh I haven't seen that AIXBT thing on my timeline in a while.\nI I still follow it.\nSometimes like once in a blue moon teaches me something new.\nI'm like, okay.\nLike that's kind of Okay.\nAll right.\nCool.\nSanti, thank you so much for coming.\nUm, it's been a it's been a blast having you on.\nAnd lads, we don't know the next time, but we'll we'll try to make it shorter than the last one and be with you soon.\nTake care.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
