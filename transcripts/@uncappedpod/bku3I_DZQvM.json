  "cleanText": "No, you just have to like Stockholm syndrome yourself into being like, \"Well, I used to be someone who likes to build products, but now I love building teams,\" and whether or not I identified as that person as two years ago doesn't matter. Now that's me, and I believe it, you know? And then, like, when it changes, you're like, \"Now I'm this person. I love HR policy,\" you know, 'cause that's what the company needs right now.\n\nAll right, I'm here with Christina from Vanta, and I'm very excited for this conversation. Thanks for doing this with me.\n\nThanks so much for having me. Okay. So, what I want to start with is we are in a moment with AI where I would say markets are probably as promising but also as competitive as they've ever been. There's a lot of ideas that seem very green field, and the result of that is there's tons of startups going at them. And so, I think a very, very common founder experience today is you build a thing that makes a lot of sense, and you look around you, and there's 13 other companies also building something that makes a lot of sense. You've operated in a really competitive market for a really long time, and so I thought something founders could learn from you about would be operating a competitive market. So I want to start there. I guess the first place I wanted to go with it is the mentality I think that you've learned over the years that it takes to succeed. So can you talk a little bit about what's the mindset that you've gotten yourself to over the years?\n\nYeah, for sure. And a bit of, like, very short version of the history, which is Vanta started in 2018. We were the first person who did what we did. We had about two years where our competitors were accountants and consultants, and when we were selling to founders and engineers, that was wonderful. \"Would you like software? Would you like an accountant?\" Right. And then, and try to kind of keep it quiet about how well we were doing. Word got out, and then in 2020, when everyone was at home, lots of people started banning competitors.\n\nYou did try to keep it quiet for a while there, right?\n\nYes. And some of it actually was like, \"We know this is really good, and we know people will knock it off, so how far can we run?\" And your mindset was basically just like, \"Let's get as much traction as possible before people think that this is a good idea.\"\n\nYes. 'Cause people thought it was a terrible idea. No startups got SOC 2s. No one knew what, no one could spell it. It was just like, \"Why are you, like, seemingly nice people working on compliance? Like, what's, like, do you need some help?\" Like,\n\nAnd how did you know it was good? How did you have the confidence to know it was good enough that you should keep it a secret?\n\nBecause when you talk to peop, when you talk to founders who had this problem, they were like, \"I will pay you any amount of money, and I will crawl through any amount of muck for this.\"\n\nWow. It's like, \"I really want this thing, and I can't get it, and if you can get me there, I am all here for whatever you put me through.\"\n\nWere you getting customers with, like, a janky product?\n\n100%.\n\nDuring YC, a YC company that bought Vanta called it the brutalist white website.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. You know, that was, that was the brutalist white website sucked in a million ways, except it got people to their outcome.\n\nI guess you also had a very good why now, right? Like there, like a thing really happened, kind of, or like, yes, or did that just seem that way?\n\nIt just seemed that way. Like the why now existed in 2016, in 2014. I think, like, why was it '18? And I think it was 'cause generally, if you said compliance to an engineer, they ran screaming from the room.\n\nSo what was the first year it could have happened?\n\n'14, probably '13, '14.\n\nOkay. Yeah.\n\nSo it was a reasonable thing, but it was like, a startup could have done it for a few years.\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nAnd so that's actually, I used to love the why now question, especially with that USV. You're like, \"Oh, it's so intellectual,\" and like,\n\nWell, I didn't know that there was that gap in time between,\n\nYou're like, \"Yeah, yeah. I only have five.\"\n\nVanta was the first one take, which I guess you were the first one taking the first one, but like someone could have.\n\nYeah. There were a couple really manual solutions, but I think it was like, lawyers looked at the problem, compliance people looked at the problem, and they s, they solved it in just a different way than an engineer. Yeah. But like, we weren't particularly, you know, it was like anyone could have figured that part out. They just didn't.\n\nOkay. So you, you stayed secretive as long as you could, but then at some point, you didn't. You weren't secretive.\n\nYeah. Well, and the word kind of got out, and so, and then we got this, like, host of knockoffs, and you know, I think we went through, like, \"Oh, well, they're just knocking off,\" for, like, \"Oh, they took screenshots of Vanta and sent them to a dev shop in Mexico and got the product back and then said Vanta took two years to build this, and we built in two months, and like, they suck, and we're awesome.\"\n\nIs that how they said it, too?\n\nYes. Yes. Very surfer bro. You know, we, like, went through the phase of, like, \"Well, that won't work,\" or \"That's not fair.\" Like, and I think the thing it, you know, you learn is like, \"All is fair in love and capitalism,\" and it doesn't, you know, no one cares, and like, customer, like, customers are trying to solve the problem.\n\nY.\n\nAnd like, they don't care if you're first. They care if you're the best thing today. They don't care if, you know, you were secret shopped, and someone took screenshots and, like, ripped everything off. There's no referees in capitalism.\n\nYeah. Um, and you kind of want there to be one, but like, there's not. And I think you got to stop searching for one.\n\nAnd did you have a thing switch for you? Like, were you at one point looking for a referee, and then you decided?\n\nYes. And then you're like, \"There, like, what am I, you know, like, even like, if I had a magic wand, what would I con, like, what would the referee?\" And you're like, \"I don't know,\" you know, right? Um, I think you see, you see investors fund these, like, investors don't care, and you're like, kind of take it personally, and then you're like, you know, it's like, not, it's capitalism, like, it's not personal.\n\nYep. And so I think the, the switch was, eventually, it's like, \"Cool, we started this thing, but again, no one cares.\" I'm also kind of trying to deemphasize it. I mean, it's important internally, but it's also not, or not in a, like, rest on your laurels way. Yeah. Like, I think a lot of why I do, and a lot of us, like, software is 'cause it's so fast moving, blessing and curse. And you were like, \"Only as good as the last thing you shipped.\" Yeah. And so it's like, \"Okay, cool. What have you shipped for me lately?\"\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd like, that's how customers think, and that is great and terrible, but, like, also reality, and so you just got to go with that.\n\nYeah. What else from a mindset, you know, perspective, did you end up building over time, besides, like, \"All is fair in love and capitalism,\" which I think is, like, very, uh, that is, like, hard, hard-earned wisdom, but what else came to you over time?\n\nShipping velocity, uh, because I think also, you know, then the Vanta, and even in the Vanta of, like, a pre-competitive era, we, like, tried to get stuff right the first time, and so we'd write these long specs and do all this work, and then, like, take a long time to ship something, and then it was wrong, and not you through anyone's fault. It's just usually the first thing you put in front of a customer is, in fact, wrong. But we would, like, had spent six months on that, right? And then we get this kind of negative feedback, and then, and we're just like, very demoralized, and then customers, like, \"What have you shipped for me lately?\" Like, \"Nothing.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nRight. And so trying to get to, like, the frame, and I feel this way in my career, too. It's like, I very rarely, if ever, ship the right thing the first time, but I can usually ship the right thing by, like, the fourth time.\n\nYeah. And so did a team. It's like, \"How do you minimize the time between, you know, the zero with and the fourth?\"\n\nHow quickly can we get to V4?\n\nExactly. And like, V4 should be right, and I'll hold you to that, but V1, like, V1 does not have to be right. And like, trying to switch that mindset, 'cause I think we had a lot of people who are, you know, like, good students and done in school and want to get it right on the test and get it right the first time and feel that, and you're like, \"No, no, no. Like, that's the mental model of school, but actually not of real life.\"\n\nTotally. And trying to, like, flip that, too.\n\nCompetition is one of the, like, more, um, psychologically vexing parts of a startup. Yeah. Do you try to minimize how much you think about it or how much your team thinks about it? Like, what's the, what have you tried to cultivate for yourself, your exec team, your broader team about competition?\n\nI think there is, and this works kind of sometimes well and sometimes not. But I think for me, what I, when I'm at my best, what I try to do is, like, if a competitor is do, if the competitor is just copying, like, fine, but also there's a little bit of, like, \"How can we use that to our advantage?\" And we have, in some ways, where, like, \"We're going to call this new field this,\" and, like, \"Everyone's going to call it,\" and, like, \"Have we created a category now?\" Right? Like, there's, there's parts you can kind of weaponize for yourself. The other part is, \"Do something different, why?\" And I think it's trying to start from the, like, \"Assume they're smart,\" not, like, \"Assume they're idiots.\"\n\nY. And like, \"What do they know that I don't?\" And try to figure that out, and again, maybe you conclude they know nothing you don't in the idiots, but, like, I think it is a always a useful thought exercise, even if you've dismissed them the last 10 times something like this.\n\nHave you had it go the other way where you've ended up cloning something from a competitor, 'cause, like, yeah, they figured something out good?\n\nYeah, actually, um, there was a bunch of, one of our early competitors was really good at talking to our customers and finding out the parts of the product they didn't like it, fix them. It was particularly brutal, honestly, 'cause it was like, \"Oh, yeah, they just listen to our customers better than we did.\" And so that we were like, \"Okay. Like, that needs, that needs to stop right now.\"\n\nYeah. Totally.\n\nYeah. Have you learned anything about how to do, like, the go-to-market side in a competitive market? Whether it's, like, the way you, you know, position at the top of the funnel. I mean, like, you had, I think you've been running the, like, \"Compliance that doesn't talk too much\" billboards for a long time. Those still, like, the best billboard I've ever seen. It's after 2021 was its debut.\n\nIt's crazy. We keep it going.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat billboard's locked up for 10 more years.\n\nKind of, actually.\n\nI love that. Yes. But, like, what have you learned in sort of, like, the way that you structure your go-to-market when you're, I mean, most markets are really competitive, but, like, what have you learned?\n\nYeah. I think one bit is, like, man, AE confidence is so real and not as rational as, like, a EPD person, like, a engineer or PM would imagine. And that works on the way up, and it works on the way down. When the team is starting to lose confidence, like, you got to go fast, and you can't just go in with logic, and I think we messed that up for a while. Um, and it works on the way up, too. And but then it kind of becomes this, like, \"How do you build confidence amongst your sales people?\" game?\n\nHow do you build it?\n\nWhat we did, and this is all credit to our CRO, Stevie, was one of the, one of our issues with early competitors was they were actually so good at, like, secret shopping Vanta and, like, maybe exfiltrating, you know, like, they just, like, knew everything, and we knew very little. And I think we were also, like, very Midwestern, like, nice, like, \"Oh, but we're nice, and isn't it?\" You know, and, like, not, not good at competitive intel. And so the way we solved that was we put one or two people on every competitive deal, and they just, like, listened to all the call, or, like, they were in all the calls. They talked to all the customers. They talked to, like, RIP customers in both directions, and they just got smart about what was going on, and they figured out the talking points and the weak points and all of that, and then they got confident in winning, and it was one or two people, and then we started adding them to everybody else's calls, and then, like, a would be like, \"Oh, I want that person to come join.\"\n\nConfidence. Yeah.\n\nExactly. And like, \"When I add them, I win more,\" so, like, \"Definitely want them in,\" and then that, like, sort of osmosed out.\n\nThat's brilliant. There's also, honestly, probably something there is, we tried to do all this enablement with, like, enablement people and PMSMM and me and PM, none of it works, like, I mean, it works, and everyone tries really hard, but, like, sales people learn from sales people, and everyone else is, you know, not as good, doesn't matter, like, who you are or what you're trying to do.\n\nYeah, totally. Um, I want to go over to fundraising. I guess you started fundraising at your seed in, when was it, 2018? Is that right?\n\nApril '18.\n\nApril '18. You then, I think, if I recall, had, like, a lot of investors who wanted to talk to you over a period of time between then and your A. Yes. Can you just talk about, like, some of the stuff you did? I know we've talked about this before, but, like, what can you talk about in that period, how you made most use of that time?\n\nYeah. So I think, so for this seed, what we did was only took money from seed funds. The thinking was, or, like, don't take money from anyone who will write an ache, because we did the, like, post-YC, you know, raise your seed round in six days, y, crazy thing, and didn't want to choose a board member in, like, that just felt silly. Board members are, like, harder to get rid of than, you know, execs, co-founders, right? Like, ch, be be thoughtful about that decision. And then I did a, I can't remember who told me to do this, raised the seed round, then went around to all the A firms and were like, \"Hi, just introducing kindo, we just raised, no opportunity for you here, just want to say hi,\" and, like, put the first, like, put the first dot on the map, like, right after the round.\n\nRight after the round, like, within weeks, kind of thing.\n\nThe one week.\n\nWow.\n\nIt was like, schedule all of them, but to schedule them after it's done. Yeah. Um, and so just, like, just, someone gave you advice to do that.\n\nYeah. And it's like,\n\n\nPutting myself on the map, you know, nothing for you now, but like, here you go.\nI love that.\nIt also creates a very low-stakes conversation where nobody is thinking like that they can ask you about certain things.\nYou just can control that conversation so easily.\nI bet.\nYes.\nYeah.\nSo, did that was like, I honestly, there was this moment of like, we just like raised $3 million to do all this stuff, and we have, you know, two people sitting on a couch, like, we got, we got to get hopping.\nSo, there's something just that, and then at some point, 6 months later, you're like, okay, this is work, like, this is different.\nVanta feels different than literally everything else I've worked on in my career.\nIt is a true, like, pulling, like, the market is pulling something out.\nMhm.\nThere's a million things wrong, a million things going on, but like, there's something here.\nAnd then did not really talk to VCs.\nI think what started happening was there was like some amount of word of mouth among San Francisco founders about like, hey, if you want this, suck to, there's this Vanta thing.\nWe had this call response of like SOC 2, Vanta going.\nIt would start to come up with these companies, VCs.\nThey would start to talk to us, and look, it was like half, I was playing a game, and half was actually really busy.\nBut I generally reply and be like, \"Look, I am just too busy fielding customer calls.\"\nYeah.\nBecause I kind of like, I don't have time to meet with you, but it sounds like, you know, you know, this founder at this company, you can go talk to them.\nYeah.\nAnd like, look, an existing customer, an existing customer.\nAnd look, the thing you know, I'm trying to do is grow the business.\nAnd so if you have referrals for me, I mean, of course, I'll take them, but like, then go talk to them.\nTalk to them about the sales process.\nIf they buy, if they don't buy, talk to them about the process.\nLike that is better diligence and information than I could ever give.\nYeah.\nIf you want to see if Vanta is good, go try to send us a customer, see if they close, and then see if they're happy.\nYeah.\nAnd it's like that is better than anything I...\nAmazingly.\nSo that worked very well, you know, and I do think there was like a game, but I couldn't call it a game because I've been like, \"Oh, no.\nSorry.\nI'm just too overwhelmed by, like, you know, customers and dollars.\"\nAnd there's an implied dynamic in there of if you want to get time with me, send me a lot of customers.\nYeah.\nAnd it, and you have to kind of be careful to not sound like a total jerk.\nYeah.\nBecause I think you can very easily go to jerk territory, or like, especially if your thing isn't working, you know, it's like, they send you a bunch of stuff and like...\nWell, part of why that thing works is because that's an incredibly confident dynamic for you to be running.\nYes.\nYeah.\nWhich helps.\nWhich helps.\nAnd I think, you know, I think one of my pieces of advice for founders is investors are not people you should seek approval from.\nThey want to back people who are confident in what they're doing.\nYeah.\nNot people who are seeking their approval.\nAnd it's really hard.\nThere's a real dynamic where founders want investors' approval, particularly early, because I think, like, at least in my experience, it was like, before I had real customer traction, you're like, well, at least investors, you know, think that this is worth backing.\nSo that gives me something to hold on to.\nYes.\nAnd whereas I think, and I think I just, like, well, got lucky in lots of ways, but got lucky because early in my career, I worked for really good early-stage investors, and I kind of saw these pitches and be like, oh, no, this is not compelling.\nYou want to back the person who, like, believes in where they're going and that might change a million places, but can put one foot in front of the other and not look up and be like, is this right?\nAm I on the right trail?\nY...\nAnd so then I think it's like, okay, as a founder, how do you get that?\nAnd some people can just sort of manifest their confidence, which is great, and I'm very jealous of, and I've always been a, like, need to figure it out and do it to get confident.\nYeah.\nBut like, it sort of doesn't matter.\nIt's like, as long as you are, you are confident in the way you get confident doing that, and that makes the founder, like, much more compelling to investors.\nBut, you know, they should also just be, like, much more compelling to customers and, like, building said business.\nSo what ended up happening at your Series A or the round when you picked a board member, basically?\nYeah.\nSo it was that one.\nSo there was this whole, you know, had this whole framework on how we choose a board member, and like, did reference calls for people, and I had this spreadsheet, and I remember I did some of them over the holidays, cuz I was like, customers weren't, email, like, I just had time or time, and had this whole thing, and then literally ended up choosing an investor on board member who wasn't on the spreadsheet and, like, fell off the framework.\nHow'd that happen?\nI was not going to talk to Sequoia.\nMhm.\nBecause I mean, they're great, all the things.\nUm, but just actually in those, like, early days of, like, hi, you know, I don't have anything to, you know, I might have something to talk about you later, but I'm like, showing up today.\nY...\nThey were like, very politely, entirely uninterested, and just like, nice girl, bad idea, maybe she'll work at whatever company, you know, they were like, they didn't quite say that, but it was like, totally, totally...\nWere they sending you customers, or they weren't even, they were not playing along with that game?\nNo, zero.\nThey were just like, wondering that company's going to die.\nNo, very politely, though.\nThat's nice.\nAnd so I was like, \"Cool, like, I don't have to talk to you, you know, like, cool, great.\nAgree to disagree.\nI'm famous.\nYou don't, whatever.\"\nAnd then it was, uh, a close friend of both of us who was like, \"You're a big idiot.\nJust, you know, call Sequoia.\nWhat are you doing?\"\nAnd so had another mutual friend introduced me to Andrew Reid, and uh, he's great.\nI ended up going with him, and no regrets, but also no framework or like, framework left by the wayside.\nYeah.\nOn this podcast, I've talked to a bunch of VCs about in what ways they think VCs might be helpful, but I'd like to hear from you in what ways you think VCs might be helpful, uh, to the extent that you think that they are.\nSometimes, some of them, I think VCs, I mean, at their best, like all of us, like smart, motivated people who are good at their jobs, their jobs are investing, their jobs are not operating this, like, that is a, like, it sounds dumb and trite, but I think there's something deeply there, like, they are probably not good at running companies.\nOr if they are and are now doing, like...\nNo, they've now chosen to do something else and, like, don't want to run your company.\nYou speak this better than I can.\nYeah.\nAnd they probably couldn't run your specific company anyway, right?\nYeah.\nAnd so when you're looking to them for, like, or like, things they probably not good at is, you know, how do you, like, hire your first salesperson?\nHow do you compensate them when, like, Chili Piper starts riding leads under a couch cushion?\nWhat do you do?\nLike, that is not VC stuff.\nYeah.\nAlmost universally, or if it is, I guess Andrew, not like super, super early stage or some special thing, like something's probably off.\nRight.\nWell, they're probably capable of giving you an answer to that.\nIt's actually, I would think it's more like, you probably shouldn't need to, you probably should have other vehicles to get that support.\nRight.\nI think, um, recruiting support, especially in the early days...\nYeah.\nWhen you say recruiting support, do you mean sending you candidates, or do you mean closing candidates?\nI more mean closing candidates.\nThere's some sending of candidates, but I...\nDo you think that is a, like...\nDo you find the sending of candidates helpful, or do you think the closing of motto?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, like, there's some stuff there, and but I think in the early stages, and I think Sequoia's model is like, okay, we'll send you candidates up until this point, and then we will basically cut you off.\nDid you get candidates from that?\nI mean, did you get hires from that?\nVery rarely.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI also think in general, like, those are hard because the candidate you're getting from that lead flow is also going to 14 other companies, and then so then you're like, okay, you were like one in the, like, cohort, but like, how are you differentiated?\nDo they care?\nYou know, like, there's those are hard candidates.\nHow does the closing play out?\nSo, like, what's the way that, cuz I, that's how I most, you know, poignantly, I would say, use my board.\nI'm curious what that played out like for you.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo I think in the early day, there is a bit of, like, the brand and the, like, oh, you know, here you have person from Sequoia who's, you know, legendary firm from, you know, founding to IPO and whatever, you know, and like, let me tell you why Vanta is going to be the next thing we put on the wall.\nY...\nAnd of course, I, you know, I can say that, but like, is...\nThey seem like they're more external than they probably are, and they're very experienced.\nSo there's that bit.\nI also just think, and you again, you know this better, but like, in some ways, VCs just close more and get more practice because you're closing founders on deals.\nYou're closing people for the company.\nYou just have more reps.\nIt's just professional sales, basically, and there's like a lot of more practice, a little bit of point.\nI've actually never heard someone say it quite like that, but I think that's true because I mean, founders are also closing all the time, but that's like all VCs do, right?\nYeah, you're right.\nYeah.\nAs much as I kind of, we talked about this, like, hate it, and it offends the, like, rational person in me, like, VC brand matters.\nYeah.\nDo you think that's the top thing?\nYeah.\nYou think it just sprinkles a little fairy dust on everything and helps, like, self?\nI think just like, it's like all your conversion rates at every stage just gets slightly better.\nAnd this is for, like, candidates, for customers, for the next funding round, like...\nFor media.\nYeah.\nIt's like, just gets 10 to 30% better.\nOnce you had Sequoia, did it make recruiting a lot easier?\nYes.\nIn a way that we tal, but like, yes, in a way that I was like, kind of, I don't know, annoyed by, but like...\nWhat's the dynamic?\nWe'd have, I don't feel like a literal person, but you know, we'd have candidates, and we'd like, approach them, and uh, Young Vance was a little funny because we raised our Series A at $10 million, but we'd be like, hey, we're the seed-stage company, but like, we actually have all this revenue, and like, do you want to come work with us?\nAnd we're YC, and someone be like, no, you know, and then, like, and then, like, the next day, no, like, have fun over that next...\nYeah.\nAnd then, like, the next day, we, like, announced the series from Sequoia, like, 50 and 500, and then, like, the following day, we, like, followed up and can...\nYeah.\nExactly.\nAnd you're like, we are the same company, right?\nExcept now you have a higher 49a.\nExactly.\nLike, now it is the worst economic deal for you.\nRight.\nBut like, if you want to outsource your judgment to Sequoia, like, I guess I'm here for it.\nYeah.\nRight.\nRight.\nDid you experience it as, like, a one-time pop, or have you experienced it as, like, a durable lift?\nDurable in a, and again, a way that I think I wouldn't have expected, but the, like, the brand and Halo Glow continues.\nAnd I should also say, like, I think Sequoia is very good at what they do, and I'm very glad we work together, and like, all of that, like, there's real stuff here, very real stuff here, and the brand Halo just continues, just dominates.\nYeah.\nIs there anything on the actual help, besides closing candidates, that you get a lot of value out of, or that you even on a personal level particularly value?\nNo.\nOn the recruiting sense, we get back channels, and sometimes have, you know, their team, you know, sort of, they are very good at knowing sort of everyone in the valley.\nUm, it's something they pride themselves on, but it's true.\nAnd so they are very, you know, there's someone we're talking to, and like, we don't have a lot of mutual connectivity and curious to talk to, you know, like, they...\nSomeone on the team knows...\nThey're very good at at doing that.\nThere was a period when you're like, trying to raise the company's profile, and again, to the emails that don't get replied to, you know, you email, like, conference or reporter, and they're like, you are one of 9,000, and you know, next, please.\nWe would like partner with Sequoia, and like, Andrew and I would like do our conference, and they, like, we got on the conference stage because I, Andrew, you know, because Sequoia, right?\nAnd I was just like, the tag along, but there was some of that where that helped, too.\nThat makes sense.\nI guess on the recruiting topic in general, maybe now unrelated to investors, but with your own recruiting, what have you found over time that that's changed for you or that has been important for you?\nBut like, if you go back, you know, and you think about, like, how you recruited when you were a seed or Series A company...\nSo bad.\nI guess something changed.\nYeah.\nBased on that, I think in the early days, we were trying to be very frameworks driven and rigorous, and everything was bespoke, like your VC spreadsheet.\nExactly.\nYes.\nAnd it's like, you know, it's a little bit, you like, you hire, like, the first person in every role, so every role is distinct.\nYeah.\nBut we had had these, like, crazy, like, multi-day interview loops that were like, we would send someone through a, I don't know, tough mutter, you know, and like, wonder why candidates dropped out, and you're like, well, that's cuz we asked them to, like, I don't know, do an obstacle course.\nI will say the people who got through, like, man, were they down to...\nThey were really down.\nUm, but like, in retrospect, you're like, wow, we made that really hard for candidates and us to, like, unclear ends.\nEngineering recruiting, you just, you mess it up every two years, no matter what.\nIt is hard, it is both hard and doable, and you just have to do it since my talking to someone last night about this, and then you, like, figure out engineering recruiting for a bit, and then something changes...\nWhat changes inside the company or in the market, or what?\nBoth, like, inside the VA example, we for years just hired general...\n\n\nAnd then like a year and a half ago or so, like, okay, cool, we have a G, we should have a generalist pipeline, but like, man, we have, you know, we have, we should give people barely know we use GraphQL, bad technical such, whatever. We need people who know GraphQL, you know, and like we should have these like separate pipelines in a way that this doesn't happen in design or sales or marketing, cuz like the tech stack changes in market. You know what? I think what it is is like engineering recruiting, I mean, to is just harder than all the other roles and that timelines are longer, and so when you break the pipelines, you just, it takes longer to get them stood up again. Did you do work trials at that? Yeah, in the early days, we don't, we don't now. We do are gener especially for like leadership roles of many sorts. We generally do just send them a bunch of data and information from what the role would be and the project is usually like, so, uh, we dumped the Google diver stuff on you, like, what should we do? And like, there's very binary responses to that. There's people who are like, what do they want here? Like this madness, and people are like, oh, well, this is illuminating at least, you know, when I can opt in or opt out, but we try to do very specific example recruiting our CRO, so it's three years ago, her thing was, we sent her seven gong calls, top reps, middle pack reps, bottom reps, we're like, here's your team, what do you think? Oh, wow, and you're trying to see, like, can they tell from the gong calls after kind of, and also, like, this is literally the team you're going to get handed, like, if you want to, if you don't like this, like, let's just get that out now. Yeah. Like, and so we don't have to, you know, be like, oh, we have various skill sets on the, you know, you're like, here they are, y, and like, again, this is this is the the range. Yeah. She stood out for many reasons, but part of it is she watches those and she's like, oh, here's what I saw. Here's what we do, like, you know, like, unfazed and like, very cleareyed and broke it down. Have you been like the type of CEO who wants to like be in every loop forever, or did you let that go at some point? To what degree do you distribute decision-m on recruiting? Yeah. Yeah. So actually, back to the early days, we had a principal interview. Yeah. You know, Vanta interview, and I did those probably up until we were about 50 people, all of them, and then like, I did have a team intervention where people were like, Chris, you know, you are spending too much time on this, stop doing it. Y, and so I like distributed it. I should not have done that. I think you should go through two or maybe three team interventions. Yeah. Not the first one. You don't give it up after the first. At least the second. So I should have hung on to that a little bit longer. Like hung on till 200 people. You think, like, when, when do you think it's at, like, what's your now assessment of, like, when it's like enough is enough? When you're spending probably more than a day and a half of your five days. Yeah. On it. And when did that come for you? See, I didn't get there cuz I, I capitulated after the first intervention. I see, which is probably like three-quarters of a day. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe you could have gone twice as far. Yeah. I think you should like at least wait for two interventions. But then what I started doing six or nine months ago is now I do do that for every director plus candidate. Mhm. So, I like reinserted myself, and they can't get in without your blessing. I'll do non-blocking notes. Then like they're truly non-blocking, and it's like, here's what I saw, if you as the manager, I wouldn't do this, but I'll support you. Yeah. And like, here are the gaps, and like, if you as the manager, like, think you got this, cool. I will hold you to that. But if you want to make this call, like, when you do that, does it usually go through or not go through? Yeah. It's a good, like, are they actually non-blocking? Um, yeah, exactly. Or people like, I probably shouldn't do it. Usually they're like, I shouldn't do it. Yeah. Has it, ignoring them, should go through? Yeah. Has it ever happened? It's gone through and then it's been good. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. That's a good sign. Yeah. Yeah. No, more people should like, Yeah. You do a lot of angel, or you do some angel investing, let's say, at least when you're thinking about if you want to back a founder versus if you want to hire somebody. Obviously, you're looking for both people to be talented and capable and, you know, whatever else, but like, how different is the texture of what you're looking for? Pretty different. Yeah. Um, cuz I think there's a lot of like how we work stuff at Vanta that have like kind of been baked into the culture, and you know, there have been very talented people, actually, some of how we get the questions and the pieces of the printful interview is you like the very talented people who don't work out at the company and trying to tease that apart anyway. So there's like a whole thing there that I just like don't care about when you're angel investing, cuz people don't want to work at Vanta. They don't have to work with me, like, doesn't matter. They can, you know, go do themselves in the, basically the culture, there's no culture interview, basically. It doesn't matter. No. Does that make it easier then, because at Vanta you need to both be good and you need this? I think so. Yeah. So you'd invest in somebody before you hired them, basically. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. Because I like deeply, there's like lots of ways to build these companies, and like Vanta, you know, I think there's a, it's a like meta version of the the gong call sales example is like people should just know what they're opting into. Yeah. And we try to do that in every process and be like, this can be for you, it can not be for you, but here's what it is, and it's kind of not immovable, but like, it's not going to turn 180 degrees. Whereas like somebody can build a company in a totally different way. Have you basically learned that a talented person who doesn't fit the culture, just it doesn't work out anyway? Yes. Like you've tried it and it just doesn't go the way you want it to. Yeah. Or on either direction. Yes. And so I think, you know, one of the things in probably two years ago, we tried to get better at this, but was like, just be hyper transparent about what the thing that's in the interview process and hope like smart people will sort themselves out. Someone that works sometimes, that doesn't, but like that's I do think we owe that to candidates. Yeah. I think one of the one of the sort of interesting sort of secular things that's happened to Vanta and you is you started a company at sort of the tail end of cloud SAS bull run. Great. And then the world's all AI everything everywhere all the time now. And so I'm curious how you taken the moment and how you basically are running things, given that you have this obvious thing that comes in and you obviously have to adapt, like, what are like, what are like the main things that have happened for you running the company? There is a lot of hopefully like AI encouragement and excitement across the company, and that is both in like how we work, like, are you know, engineers using insert tool here, what are we building for customers, and I think, you know, really broadly, you know, like, we've got half of folks who are like totally down and half of folks who are a little like, I have a job and it's really busy, and like, you want me to do what now? Like, can I just do my thing here? Yeah. And so it's like, okay, how do you, how do you bring those together? Um, and like, what are the carrots? And so, but I, I think at the my level, leadership level, there is just like a ton of, uh, conviction that like, this is real. Does it matter for your product or does it matter for just what you're the way you're building, the way you're doing go to, like, I think it matters a ton for our product because so much of compliance is taking information in one format and putting it in another. Yeah. Right. Like, actually, and so there's just, and like, I think the pieces of compliance will not change, but like, will you have to, you probably, you or Eric, like, write your own policy documents. Isn't that like kind of, you know, you're like, \"Yeah, and you also used to carry your pictures, or at least copy paste them and hope they're right or something.\" Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And then you're like, if you had, if you want to know what was in them, you would read them. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. Now you can just get the summary. Exactly. You know, but like, literally, like, we have all that stuff in the product now. That's a very small example, but I think it's a concrete one. And so it's like, yeah, there still be policy documents, but like, how will they be created? How will they be disseminated? How do you know what's in them? How do you keep them in sync with everything else? Like, that is all AI. How much AI are you consuming just like other AI products just to run your company differently across everything? We're, we're in an AI procurement boom. I hope I don't say this in a million emails. Yeah, but a little bit. We used to be much stingier, and I think, if you're selling an AI product, here's Christina. I know Christina, advanta.com. Please don't. But I think the thing we have actually, like, now is large enough company where you have to somewhat be thoughtful here. And so what we're trying to do is like, okay, let teams do what they want to do and procure the tools and then have a forum for which it's like, it kind of runs and be like, okay, now we all come together and be like, oh, we bought five meeting recorders, cool, let's, let's figure it out, and but like, do that incrementally along. So do you prefer people to, would you prefer that AI gets to you bottoms up, that the best product wins through the team, rather than somebody trying to come sell you top down with no usage? Yes. Yes. Now, because I think we, we were trying to do the top down, no usage, and we're not making good tooling decisions. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And like, again, I can like critique and be like, oh, we should think more like PMS and our procurement, but like, that is not where the effort goes. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to use basically as much as possible, like, Yeah. Okay. Yeah. There was actually a, this is kind of a cute phrase, but we were going back and forth about how many chat GBT licenses we have, because chat GBT licenses were like kind of expensive, and Gemini is free. Yeah. And like, so can we just like be stingy about chat GBT licenses and make everyone use Gemini, basically? And the answer is no. Um, it's not worth it. Yeah. Well, so it's like unused chat GBT licenses are very expensive. Used ones are actually pretty cheap, right? And so it's like, okay, can you like get the energy focused on like getting the licenses used versus like being person? What are some of the, I was about to ask this question in an obnoxious way of, like, if you had to start a startup right now, what would you start? Which I'm going to ask a different way. What pieces of software do you think that you could be or should be consuming that you're not yet? Like, what are some of the areas of the business at Vanta that you think should be AI? I think go to market systems is a Rube Goldberg machine constructed by like seven different tools. Yeah, that's what we had. We had like nine Bizops people holding it all together. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. And it was like, once it gets to that system, they're going to grab this ball and put it over here. Exactly. Exactly. And it's just kind of nuts cuz you're like, \"Okay, if this were engineering, like, or this does not exist in engineering, it would be unacceptable. It would be entirely unacceptable. It would unacceptable a decade ago.\" And so like someone should fix that. Yeah. Can you say a little bit more about though? Like, can you, don't you, don't have to name the vendors, but like, name the parts of, like, maybe the parts of the funnel you're talking about. Yeah. Like, I don't even mean the marketing. It's like someone goes to vanta.com and is like, \"Okay, I want a demo or I want Vanta.\" And then like, how does that get to a sales rep or how does that get to closed one? And like, oh man, we got, we got the ball, the balls are going into the tubes or onto the floor. Yeah. I never understood why it had to be so messy. Like, I get that it's kind of complicated and, and then you have like race conditions between the tools, and you're just like, how does anyone put up with this? Everyone puts up with it. Kind of nuts. Okay, that's good. What else? Um, collections, contract terms. It is like the least favorite part of everyone's job, including the like the our customers, right? I think AI would be really good at that. Yes. Like parsing the document, doing the perpetual reachouts to people. Yes. And like we've got some of it, but it's, it's like rules based and doesn't work, and people miss the emails, and like, and then it's like heightened emotions, and like, oh boy. Support kind of, or like the like, I something is not working or in support, the customers just reg. You're saying that the the chat bots are not working well. Is that what you're saying? Some of them. Yeah. Uh, or I think we have some of that, and then I think we have, uh, or is it the the tooling around them and like the reporting on it? Is that the issue? I do want a lot of this stuff to go further. So one thing we have built is just like custom GPT for like the Vanta tone of voice. We call it Elmabot because Elma is our name. But you know, it's like our our copywriters can only do so much, and so how do you kind of vantify the writing? And I think that's works very well for marketing copy. I kind of want it for like all support tickets and honestly, like all customer coms. Y, um, do you think sales will get AIFI somewhat? I think there will be reps, but like even like we actually, I think are quite good at enforcing Salesforce hygiene amongst our reps, you know, so like it works, but like, how much time these folks spend, you know, filling out command plans, and look, there's a part where you're like, you do\n\n\nActually want them to know the command plan, cuz that's what they're supposed to execute on.\nHave you had any luck with like AI SDRs?\nNo, we haven't really tried.\nWe've tried a little bit, but we haven't.\nWe're not a good.\nYeah.\nSo, walking up the like hierarchy of SDR tooling.\nYeah.\nWhat else?\nAnything in like security or operations or anything like that?\nI think the like security operations center, the like other sock.\nYeah.\nNot talk to frustrating space, you know, like the old way to solve that is put a bunch of people in the room, in a room, maybe in your company, maybe outsource that, like look at alerts all day.\nYeah.\nUm, and then like the 10 years ago Dropbox way was like write a bunch of rules and like kind of, but I think there's a bit of like, okay, that was like the rule writing phase.\nHow do we just AI what is important?\nWhat is not?\nAnd that's hard, and you don't want to mess it up, but like turns out, you know, again, hardworking people working all the time, staring at alerts all the time, also mess it up.\nYeah.\nAnd so how do you do that?\nWhat about like marketing, very top of funnel?\nAny has anything like changed there?\nLike the LLM SEO stuff, whatever you call it, AIO or whatever people call.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nI don't know that thing.\nYeah.\nIs I think like very real.\nWe actually see impressions on our keywords dropping.\nUh, it's like we might have like the same or higher impression share, the same or higher like CPMs or CPCs, but like overall seems like search volume is dropping, and like we see that in our SEM spend.\nThat's really crazy.\nYeah.\nAnd your assumption is basically that's all just gone to LLMs.\nYes.\nYeah.\nYes.\nThat's just like a whole new work stream, I guess.\nIt seems like, and you probably know the tools better than I do, but when I kind of poke around, it seems like a lot of the tools or work is like you just repeatedly run the same query in a bunch of tools, and then you know, like write down where you know, like how you do, and then you rerun it the next day, and you rerun it.\nYou know.\nI'm sure someone will build a bot thing, but like, oh boy.\nIs there anything else in like HR, like people stuff, or anything in finance or...\nOh, we did something like maybe moderately controversial.\nI'm curious for your take was we actually encouraged and wrote a, built a like, or prompted a, a custom GPT, but for managers to use in perf reviews to help them give feedback.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think that's good.\nAnd yeah, because it's kind of like, I think my, I don't know, my general thing, you have much smarter ideas, but like my general thing on proof reviews, it's like 360 and perviews are super helpful if you actually do them.\nIf you kind of do it halfway, it just ends up taking 60 hours from everyone's time and being terrible, totally.\nAnd so like, you know, you either need to go like all in or like all out, and so how do you get it?\nMy whole thing with performance reviews is basically it's like what you're trying to get to is a shared agreed, you know, nugget of insight about what could better.\nAnd maybe that takes 3 hours to get there, maybe takes 30 minutes to get there, maybe it never gets there.\nBut I think often times doing the work to get there is important, but really what you need is just like a consolidated insight that both the manager and the person being reviewed are like, \"Yeah, that is something I need to get better at.\"\nYep.\nSo, however you get there, however you get there.\nYeah.\nAnd like get there and get it clearly articulated and like that thing.\nIt's not so dissimilar from like the way a lot of consumers are using AI for like kind of like borderline therapy or just straight up therapy type uses where it's like, you know, maybe the humans better in some ways, but just getting to the like, here's an insight that's useful.\nYeah.\nIs worth a lot, right, right?\nAnd like I can read it and like think about it and agree or disagree, but like, I got it, just has to be a useful insight, but if it gets there, which it seems like in a lot of cases it does, it's it's really good.\nThe last topic I want to go to is, so you're what, seven years in, eight years, something like that.\nWhat's the founder sort of mindset that you've, you know, settled into?\nNot that you're settled into one, and I'm sure there's still...\nYeah.\nTurmoil and evolution, but like what is the inner game journey that you've been through?\nYeah.\nUh, two things.\nThe like trope of like a do you just go faster is deeply true.\nAnd I think the lived experience is like, you know, kind of every day you, I don't know where, like I feel like I only halfway know what I'm doing, or like it's a new skill.\nAnd so you're, you never feel like you're like on it, right?\nI feel like I'm totally on it.\nBut then every once in a while I'll like go back and you know, someone's out.\nSo I'll like do the one-on- ones with their manager and be like, \"Oh, I can do this now.\"\nRight?\nAnd the first time I was managing or managing a manager, I didn't feel as comfortable, but like I got, I did learn something.\nAnd you have these kind of moments.\nWe did one of like talking to an early stage founder and you're like, \"Oh no, I, I have a point of view here and I adamantly believe.\nMaybe I might wrong, but like I've learned something.\nYeah.\nSo there's some of that, even if in the day-to-day you're like still and like, well, I haven't done this before, but here we go.\nYeah.\nAnd then I think there is a, all the like, there's like different types of COs are like the job changes, and your job is to like make the build the product and then build the company and then build the team or team, whatever it is, you know, some order, some order, not, probably team, company, now they say that out loud.\nAnd like those are very different, and there's like, oh, different types of people you enjoy, different things, and like, I think in some way that's true, but I also think I don't, my, you know, joke that's kind of not a joke is like, no, you just have to like Stockholm syndrome yourself into being like, well, I used to be someone who likes to build products, but now I love building teams, and whether or not I identified as that person as two years ago doesn't matter, now that's me, and I believe it, you know, and then like when it changes, you're like, now I'm this person.\nI love HR policy, you know, cuz that's what the company needs right now, totally.\nAnd like, you know, joking, but not like figuring out how to be like, this is the game and the puzzle and like the journey, and I need to take joy in it, cuz otherwise I will just like be sad and burned out and unfulfilled, and like this is not sustainable.\nDid you have a part of the journey where you um, were both doing things that you didn't enjoy and hadn't yet figured out how to like control your own like mindset and emotions like that?\nYes.\nCuz I imagine at the beginning, I mean, who doesn't love, I mean, everybody loves building a product.\nEverybody loves getting that early customer rush, like that stuff is just like objectively fun.\nYes.\nAnd then there are things that are like debatably fun, and some people might love them, but not everybody loves them.\nYes.\nYeah.\nAnd I think it's especially in the early days because like for me, the first version of this was, okay, we have this product and company and like recruited a couple engineers and I have to go like do all of go to market and both do it and recruit people, and I didn't know how to spell go to market, like kind of actually, and so it was like, I got to do this, everyone else is counting me on to do it, and like, wow, am I bad at it because I've never done it.\nYeah.\nAnd like kind of raking myself over the coals for that, and then sort of being like, okay, right, I'm bad at it because I haven't done it, my job is to get good fast, yeah, right?\nLike it's it's trajectory, not you know, anything else, but like kind of reframing that.\nDid you do anything to get that sort of like self-control that you're now at of being able to say like, I like this because I told myself I'm going to like that?\nLike was there like, you know, somebody you picked this up from?\nWas there, did you like read a bunch of like Buddhist books?\nDid you like something, you know, like what did you do?\nThat I think very few people have that kind of ability to tell themselves that this is how I'm going to feel about this thing.\nYeah.\nI think a bit of, for me, it used to be runs.\nI went long.\nIt was like four miles, you know, but it was just like, and I live by going Park, and you're like, also when I'd get really frustrated or pissed off, like go run, usually at some point there was like some something, we have a mutual friend, Jay Zack Stein, who is like very, I think it's a very helpful, like playback sounds like what you're saying sounds like this is a thing, you know, like a like prompting on self-reflection, and then I think also just talking to other founders, right?\nAnd then you talk to the folks who are like, oh, I'm supposed to rebuilding the company, but like I still just want to build the product, and like I'm really annoy, you know, and I'm annoyed and I'm unhappy and just kind of being like, well, that seems bad, you know, but like I get it, right?\nAbsolutely.\nWell, um, Christina, this was really fun.\nThank you for taking the time to do this.\nIt was a, it was a blast for me.\nThank you so much for having me.\n",
