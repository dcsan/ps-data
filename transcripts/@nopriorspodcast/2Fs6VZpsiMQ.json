  "cleanText": "[Applause]\nHi listeners and welcome back to No Priors. Today we're joined by two of the key folks behind one of the most compelling developments in AI this year, Alpha Evolve. Pushmeet Kohli and Matej Balog worked on this autonomous coding agent that uses Gemini models and evolutionary search to discover new algorithms. It marks a major leap in AI's ability to contribute to core computer science and math and perhaps sciences beyond that. It's not just a stochastic parrot or a boilerplate generator. It has shown what you might consider technical creativity in the way that move 37 did with AlphaGo, something humans hadn't done before, even in thousands of years of play. It might even be a real step on the path to self-improving AI. Push, Mate, thank you so much for being here.\nThank you for having us.\n It's a pleasure.\n Congratulations on the success and the launch of Alpha Evolve. Can you give me a brief description of what it is broadly?\nYeah. So in maybe one sentence, Alpha Evolve is an AI coding agent that is able to discover new algorithms that are able to make new discoveries on open scientific problems and at the same time those algorithms can be so practical that they are already deployed in key key parts of Google's own infrastructure.\n What is the origin story of working on this particular form of coding agent or this problem statement?\n So we are not new to this space of algorithm discovery. Um, as you might know, the the mission of all of Google DeepMind is to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity. And the way our particular team has been doing it for years now is to look for ways how AI can discover new algorithms. New algorithms are everywhere around us. So this is a very very important question and can have very high impact when we can discover algorithms that solve important computational problems with higher efficiency than what we have been able to do so far. And kind of the first breakthrough we had in this space was um in 2022 when we released a system called AlphaTensor. And so that was a system that was an AI system using uh reinforcement learning that for a very specific but uh fundamental computational task. So multiplying matrices for the first time showed that AI agents can discover better algorithms that than what humans had been able to do before them. Uh so this was the the first system that gave u weight to this idea that indeed with AI we'll be able to go into this superhuman region of algorithms that we as humans have not been able to discover ourselves.\n How do you differentiate um Alpha Evolve from like AlphaTensor and fun search and some other um projects in the sort of lineage of this?\nOne way to also describe uh what we have done is if you look back at the history of uh DeepMind and uh and see a number of sort of projects that have come even before uh we started working on computer science. our earlier sort of work. Uh and if you go back to uh the project on AlphaGo where the AlphaGo agent was able to beat the world go champion in the game of Go. And what one was the remarkable sort of uh thing uh in in that uh agent was that it was able to explore this amazingly large search space of all possible sort of go positions in in such an efficient manner that it can sort of come up with what is the optimal move at that time. Right? And that really surprised people um both uh go professionals as well as scientists. Scientists believe that that u event would come much much later because it was a very hard problem. And so um what that gave evidence for is that is the ability of these large scale uh neural networkbased systems to be able to reason and do very efficient exploration in these large search spaces and come up with amazing new insights about uh the particular domain. And in then in the game of go I mean there is this move called move 37 uh which is a very creative new move that uh the agent discovered that was not in the go literature right that uh really surprised the go professionals. So in some sense uh we asked ourselves the question that if you have an agent which can do very efficient search in the domain of go why can't you use the same kind of philosophy to search for algorithms in the space of algorithms and in fact uh that sort of was the underlying basis of the work on our our first sort of attempt at that problem which culminated in AlphaTensor. So how we structured uh the algorithmic discovery uh problem is we looked at first a very important problem and uh that problem was matrix multiplication. It is a problem that is ubiquitous in computer uh science. It's one of the key fundamental operators that underlies not only computer science but also neural networks and machine learning and neur and and AI. We said can we find a way to improve matrix multiplication algorithm. So there's a history of matrix multiplication which is very interesting uh for people who might be interested in it like uh it's a even though it's such a fundamental operator um people thought that the the complexity or the time it takes to multiply two matrices is order cube.\nMhm.\n And around 50 years back, more than 50 years back now, uh a German mathematician Strassen came up with this very counterintuitive construction which showed that in fact the complexity was not uh n to the power three or what's not cubic where n is the sort of dimensionality of the matrix. bit lower and so and that was a very counterintuitive sort of result and um and but it stayed for more than 50 years and until sort of AlphaTensor came up and we said well can we actually improve this result and uh remarkably we were able to show that that AlphaTensor while uh by having this amazing ability to do search in this very large space even much larger uh than the space of possible go moves was able to come up with this amazingly new algorithm which which improved things. But then the question was well we now have proved the thesis that you have these uh super intelligent agents which can go beyond what uh human computer scientists uh have been able to do. But can we generalize them? This is sort of AlphaTensor was very smart but uh was only sort of purposefully constructed for the matrix multiplication problem. Can we have build a agent that is more general? Both more general in the sense of it can handle more more general problems but can also uh search in the space more naturally in the space of programs rather than in the space of uh very specific uh sort of operations that were required for matrix multiplication. And that was the origin of uh sort of the first uh attempt uh of of us uh with fund search which was an LLM based agent which for the first time by searching in the space of programs showed that you can come up with completely new solutions like and this and made the first scientific discovery from NL NLM and Alpha Evolve is basically an extension of of that\n I'm very inspired by um the idea I think as many people are that uh AI will actually have creativity does actually have like technical creativity as you are describing as one way to conceptualize this where you're you know outside of the patterns that we already know as engineers I want to go back to some of the mechanics here um and the limits to generalization and how to think about automated evaluators and and a lot of different topics but you know when you think about these problems s that are clearly like economically valuable and interesting like matrix multiplication the potential efficiency of it. What is your intuition for uh why you know those those solutions have not been found before? Is it simply like the search space is too large or people in this field were complacent in that um they believed a certain solution was like the maximum efficiency or because uh clearly there's there's value to be had here.\nMy sort of opinion on this is basically that if you look at the structure of the of the algorithm what Strassen produced was quite sort of uh ingenious. It was not a natural thing that you would sort of think of and that is uh that was for only 2x2 matrices. As you sort of go to larger sizes the space is so huge. The constructions are not sort of something which is very natural. These are very involved and integrate in integrate intricate sort of constructions that uh would be very hard to discover by chance.\n So it's quite interesting that it is it has this very special struct uh structure but it's not something that is that comes naturally or or uh to to a human computer scientist.\n Just to add to that so I definitely agree the the search space is just uh unbelievably vast. the solutions are maybe non-intuitive and the third thing I want to emphasize is that I really believe the people who worked on this in the past were definitely not complacent and in fact the the problems we chose to apply Alpha Evolve to in the first instance uh both on the scientific side and the practical side we we deliberately chose problems which have been worked on for a very long time by the very best people so on the on the scientific side since we're talking about matrix multiplication this has been a known open problem for decades and and many people have been have been working on it and similarly for the the the practical applications that that we that we mentioned in our Alpha Evolve release in key parts of Google's infrastructure again like these are things that have been heavily optimized inside Google because they are so important and so by having a system like Alpha Evolve or any other um uh discover something new on these problems I think that's as strong a demonstration as I can imagine um of the fact that this is indeed something that is new because no one found it before and also it is something that was not easy to discover because those results stood for such a long time and have been worked on by yeah such uh such strong people.\n I noted that this is not a comment on the you know broad efforts of the computer science industry to date on matrix multiplication or data center optimization. I I think this is a good moment to try to demystify what's happening under the hood for a broader set of people. Um can you can you walk us through a concrete example of how Alpha Evolve actually evolves code and say let's take the example of trying to optimize um data center scheduling right what does the step-by-step process look like from initial random code to final solution that saves millions of dollars of of power\n I can walk you through that uh so the user of a system like Alpha Evolve they basically specify what is the problem that they are trying to solve so that's the most important thing and you specify by providing what is called an evaluation function. What this function does is um whenever there is a proposed solution for solving the problem, you're able to tell how good this solution is. So you basically define what makes a good solution for discovering an algorithm for scheduling jobs on a data center. This evaluation function could be something like a simulator of jobs in a in a data center that given an algorithm for doing the scheduling, it simulates how good this algorithm is. So that's what the user provides and this is a simulator you already had.\n Yes. So that's a simulator that we already had. Um and I would say it's something that is quite natural to have in in many in many domains because you know whenever you want to innovate on something you need to have a way of telling okay is the innovation actually good or not. So so it's a very natural object to to have at least um in principle. So you define the what by providing the evaluation function and then Alpha Evolve fills in the how. So that that that's the job of uh of our system and you can do it in two fairly different ways. One is you tell Alpha Evolve I have no idea how to solve this problem. Let's start completely from scratch and let's try to be creative and come up with something completely new. So that's one option you can take. Another option you can take is um actually we have already worked on this problem for a really long time. here is a very strong initial solution that we can provide to the system and you can start from here and that's what we did uh for the application to discovering new algorithms for uh for scheduling jobs in a data center. So Alpha Evolve takes this initial solution and then it on a high level it combines the creative power of large language models to propose like creative new ways how to improve that solution. the strictness of the evaluation function provided by the user that is able to actually filter out the things that uh that work from the ones that don't. And then this is wrapped inside an evolutionary algorithm that makes sure that we kind of discover the whole space of um of algorithms in that region so that we don't commit to a very specific type of solution early on, but instead we maintain a diverse pool of potential solutions over time. Maybe we combine ideas from different uh different solutions that are already strong until we actually have an algorithm that's so strong that we are happy to happy to deploy to a critical part of Google's infrastructure. Let's say and intuitively um not in the machine learning sense but in the evolution sense you have different generations where you're getting closer to an optimal solution.\n Yeah, that's right. Like you would expect that in each iteration of evolution, what you're doing is you're looking at the previous iteration, looking at the maybe the strongest solutions you have and then trying to be creative about how can I combine ideas from those solutions or maybe bring in completely new ideas to to come up with something even better and so yes, each generation gets stronger and stronger.\n How much scaling are we talking about? like is there um a way to predict how many generations it take or how do you you know constrain the the number of iterations that um the model can use.\n So there are two parts to your question. Uh one is about okay how does scaling work and then how can you predict it. So for the first part this is actually a really nice feature of Alpha Evolve that it can adapt to the difficulty of the problem. If you ask Alpha Evolve to find a solution to a problem that's actually unexpectedly easy then it will just do it very very quickly like almost immediately you will have the solution but if you ask it a problem that's really really difficult and by really really difficult I I mean like really difficult maybe an open question that has stood for decades in the sciences or like you want a practical algorithm for really high value application in Google then you you you would of course expect this is not an easy problem, you might need to spend um longer time considering different solutions, exploring the space, combining ideas. But what's really nice about Alpha Evolve is that it is able to sustain this scaling in a way that it keeps improving over time and it keeps improving for so long that you can make discoveries on this level of difficulty like know breaking decades old scientific challenges or discovering high value algorithms. Now I I I know it maybe sounds sounds trivial that if you you know wait longer you get better results but in practice that's actually um like a really difficult thing to build automated agents that are able to sustain this this continual improvement without plateauing quite quite early.\nThis is I think a nice feature. There was a second part to the question about predicting how many iterations you will need. Um so that is something that that is actually not so easy because it's like asking a priority. Do you know how difficult this question is going to be? And especially in the sciences, that's something that often has a very surprising answer like very trivial quest\n\n\nIons can turn out to be extremely difficult, and vice versa. But the nice thing is that you have continual improvement if you run this system. And, um, as long as you can run it, you can expect to get better and better results, and you just have to see where this gets you.\n\nIf you think about the coding agents that general developers have access to and are increasingly using today, one frustration with them is on relatively trivial problems, um, it is set out to do autonomously. It will get lost in and blow itself up or plateau, as you said. Um, uh, in frustrating ways. Like, can you talk about if you think there are implications from AlphaEvolve to these other general coding agents?\n\nWhile large jungle models and coding agents are getting much better in their understanding of code, uh, they're not perfect, right? So they do make mistakes. The other sort of element is to think about what is the task that these agents have been assigned. Um, mostly, if you are asking an agent to solve a particular task or write a particular program, you are providing a specification. You are specifying the task either in natural language, or you're saying, \"Well, I'm trying to do something completed,\" right? So it's not a complete characterization of what you want; it's a partial specification of what you want. And the agents then try to solve the problem and might get lucky and or might and might get the right result, or they might hallucinate and get the wrong result. And the issue is, how do you know what, so whether the result is right or wrong? And that depends on having a good evaluator. That's how AlphaEvolve solves the problem. So in some sense, we are able to leverage the hallucinations for a beneficial purpose, right? So the creativity and the wrong answers that AlphaEvolve can somehow come up with, how do we know that they're wrong? They might be very good; we just don't see them in that way. And which is why the role of the evaluator is really important, and how do we even do the evaluation is very important because when you come up with a new idea, um, should you try to explore that idea much further, right? Or how deep should you go into stress testing that idea? Should you try that idea out on a few different instances or sort of a thousand different instances, or really stress test that the idea actually works for the whole, uh, thing? This is one of the interesting parts of, uh, AlphaEvolve. Getting that balance right is really important so that you can look at where are the creative solutions, how can you sort of filter out the ones that are promising, and then use them later to refine the search process to get the final solution.\n\nIf evaluation functions, automated evaluators, are, um, really like such a limiting constraint here in terms of what we can get, um, agents to do, any intuition from this project or others on how to overcome that? Like, can models get good at helping us create automated evaluators? Should we imagine simulators that are better for lots of different domains? If I, you know, lame product manager, putting in incomplete natural language spec to coding agent, uh, should I work with an assistant to like complete that spec? Do I use traces? How do you, how do you think that gets solved?\n\nThat's a really, really great question, and I think, uh, you can view it from two perspectives that I think will happen at the same time. So one is that, yes, currently the strict evaluation function plays a key role in AlphaEvolve, and one takeaway you can take from this, I thinking about the future, is that it shows the really high value of having these evaluators available because in many cases, it might be that you have a really important problem, but you don't actually have a very precise definition of what makes for a good solution. And one takeaway you can have from a system like this is that if you actually do build a very precise evaluation function, then this unlocks the possibility of having an agent like AlphaEvolve discover something that's way beyond what, what, let's say, humans have been able to discover, or your best developers have been able to discover. So that, that's one takeaway. But the other takeaway that I'm maybe even more excited about from the research perspective is that we don't actually think this is a conceptual limitation. Okay, so today we have this was maybe the easiest way to get into this game of discovering new things by looking at problems that already come with these very precise evaluation functions. So that's just a natural first step to take. But I do believe that this assumption can be relaxed in very significant ways. And in particular, you already mentioned one example where maybe language models themselves will be able to evaluate whether proposed solutions look promising or not, or whether they fail in some particular ways. And indeed, there is, um, parallel work from Fleet Maidwell called AI Co-scientist, which demonstrates this very clearly, that, uh, if you, if you propose ideas in natural language, then you can get language models to provide meaningful critiques and identify the ones that work from the ones that don't. So I really do see a lot of hope on relaxing this assumption. And then even in between these two extremes of, um, you know, strict evaluation that exactly tells you how good a solution is on one end, and then, uh, natural language evaluation by a language model on the other end, there's a continual spectrum of, um, simulators and, um, auxiliary evaluation functions, which are maybe not perfect, but as long as they are correlated with the true signal, then we can build the algorithmic scaffolding of the evolutionary algorithm around this in such a way that we still make meaningful progress, and maybe it will take a few more iterations, but we can still still go really, really far.\n\nSo just to add what Matej sort of mentioned, I think, uh, the one of the takeaways is basically that, uh, LLM-based agents like AlphaBall, especially when we structure them in this way with population-based, uh, sort of, uh, search, right, with the evolutionary approaches, they are extremely effective in searching. They can search very convincingly and very effectively in very large spaces, and come up with, uh, very counterintuitive, uh, new solutions for important problems, problems that, uh, we have studied for many, many years, and sometimes in, in, in some cases, decades. Uh, so that's one. The other sort of element of, uh, the evaluator, like, as Matej mentioned, there is work on using other sources of for evaluation. So you don't have the perfect evaluator, even for AlphaEvolve, uh, even if you have a simulator that's not a perfect evaluator, right? Because you are sort of going to evaluate things on, uh, a specific distribution of problem instances. You might want to sort of, uh, prove certain properties of the solution, right? You might want to say that the solution always, uh, has certain performance. So if you want to prove certain properties of the solution, that will, that might require sort of other work, right? You might have to have a proof agent which sort of tries to approve, uh, certain properties of the solution. While on the other hand, you have these LLM-based evaluators which, uh, can look at the solution, and you don't have, uh, nobody has built a simulator, but they can just have a guess on how good that solution is. And in fact, that approach also works very well, and we have shown that, uh, uh, this AI Co-scientist, uh, which we have used for hypothesis generation, it basically uses a multi-agent sort of setup, and where LLMs themselves are able to sort of figure out that, uh, uh, certain hypotheses are better in terms of novelty and significance and impact and should be propagated, right? And that whole process, uh, ends up, and this might be surprising and counterintuitive to some, of producing much, much, much better results than the base large language model, right? So you are really able to discover new information beyond what the large language model itself alone was able to produce.\n\nThat begs a question, which I think is like one of the biggest meta questions proposed by this sort of work, which is like, do we get self-improving AI, right? Um, one of the things you demonstrated with AlphaEvolve is you can optimize the systems used to train AlphaEvolve, right? So you have this, you know, 23% speed up in part of the training infrastructure. Um, if I recall correctly, are we now witnessing the early stages of recursive self-improvement in AI, and you know, what do you think the implications are if that's true?\n\nUh, I think in some senses, uh, sort of yes, but at the moment, what we have seen is basically improvements in computation time. So, uh, what AlphaEvolve has been able to do is basically make training more efficient. But you can ask the question, can you make the training, uh, you can, can you improve the training process such that the underlying model is not only, uh, sort of, uh, uh, trained faster, but is actually fundamentally better in certain cognitive tasks? And that is something that has to be validated still, right? But, uh, it is a direction that is definitely very appealing and something that is being sort of actively sort of looked by many people.\n\nDo you have a reason to believe it won't work?\n\nNo, it it should work. But as, as we sort of mentioned, that having good evaluators is an important element, right? And so having a sort of evaluator which can say, \"This proposal that you have just suggested for me to improve the training process will yield a good result.\" So if you have that kind of evaluator, uh, then it will work. That there is no reason why such an evaluator does not exist, but, uh, we need to sort of work on building such evaluation functions.\n\nMaybe just one thing to add to it is that, uh, like I would also agree that we are maybe seeing the first sign of self-improvement, but one also needs to be very specific about what we have shown so far. Like, as Pushmeet mentioned, it's the speeding up the training of the next generation of the Gemini model, so the feedback loop is is fairly long, at least currently, maybe on the order of months, but there is, you can call it self-improvement for sure. Maybe the big question that many people are curious about is how does this extrapolate into the future? And you can have different types of self-improvement. One is where you get maybe just a one-off benefit, like the model improves itself once, and that's it. Another one is, okay, the model keeps improving itself continuously, but maybe the improvements get, uh, marginally smaller and smaller and smaller, and you converge to some limit, or maybe the improvements will will keep accumulating up and up and up, and that's a big open question that, uh, yeah, we don't have an answer to today.\n\nLet's take that projection to other fields, and obviously these are all interrelated, but, um, one of the things Matej, you're really excited about is just how, uh, AI applies to these sciences. Um, when you think about new mathematical constructions, improved solutions to, you know, open problems or problems that looked solved, you know, to humanity 50 years ago, um, what do you, what do you think the implication is in, in different fields? Like, is it a fundamental shift in how scientific discovery or mathematics gets done?\n\nFirst of all, yes, I I'm super excited working in this area of using AI to accelerate the sciences because in a way, it's the most exciting application of AI that I can imagine. Like, like what, what could be more valuable or exciting to advancing the frontiers of human knowledge? So, so yes, that that is definitely there. And then, of course, in different, um, fields of science, the speed of progress or the advance you get from AI, uh, might be slightly different. So in AlphaEvolve, we've primarily focused on mathematics and computer science because these are the domains where it's the easiest to get these, um, automated evaluation functions. Like, you often get them basically for free. That's not to say that you cannot get them in other branches of science. But in math and computer science, it's just, it's just, um, they're just most common. If you think about biology or chemistry, you want to design a molecule, then, um, you can have an evaluation function again in the form of a simulator or a predictive model that, given a candidate molecule, we'll make a meaningful prediction about, okay, is this actually going to work in practice? And then if you are in this regime, then again, um, AlphaEvolve would be applicable, and and we are only talking about the version of AlphaEvolve that we have built today, and these are problems that we can, uh, address today. Um, but we don't think that, uh, the journey of AlphaEvolve finishes here. We have, uh, many ideas about how to make this system, uh, more powerful and more broadly applicable, and I'm I'm fairly confident that we will see many applications across many branches of science. And then this is only talking about AlphaEvolve. There are many other agents, Pushmeet mentioned AI Co-scientist, and and many others that, um, I'm sure will keep transforming how science is being done across the whole spectrum.\n\nYeah. So I think broadly, if you look at it, right, science is, uh, a lot of science involves searching, right? Searching for the right idea, searching for the right construction, searching for the right, uh, sort of solution, the right drug candidate, and so on. And in some sense, like what, uh, scientists have been trying to do is sort of somehow make that, uh, process repeatable, right? There at the moment, there is still sort of an element of, uh, uh, serendipity to some of the discoveries. But we are, as we move towards, uh, sort of rational material discovery or rational drug discovery, uh, you are sort of seeing, uh, computational approaches and very systematic evaluations playing a much more important role in many areas of science. Uh, and I think as, uh, that work propagates, you will have systems like AlphaEvolve which will be able to search in those spaces and use these evaluations much more effectively. So it's, it's like you can sort of see this as a tool that will give scientists a superpower in their ability to search over very complex and sometimes, uh, counterintuitive, uh, sort of solution spaces.\n\nWhen I think about one logical, um, extension to this approach, it is, um, let's say, evaluate like automated evaluation in the real world, right? So lab, you know, a bunch of robotic arms doing experimentation if you're, um, screening molecules for something. What do you think the role, let's just say like very near-term, um, if that vision is true, um, of the human scientist or engineer is? Is it the problem framing, like determining the evaluation? Is it constraining the, like, giving some intuition for like a starting point or a search space? Like, what, what should the human scientist be good at from here?\n\nThere are many sort of elements, right? First of all, as we were, as we have been talking about a lot, the role of the evaluation function, right? So that needs to be defined, like, what do we really, how do we want to assess these solutions? But then there are many other sort of elements as well, right? When we are, uh, trying to find a solution, it has to have certain properties. What are those properties? Right? Giving hints, uh, giving sort of, uh, for example, if you're trying to discover, uh, a new drug, you want to make sure that that drug sort of treats the disease but does not kill the patient, right? It has sort of, uh, uh, its side effects are low, right? Or it can be what is what is the delivery mechanism for it. So there are so many different, uh, requirements that, uh, a solution might want that might need to satisfy.\n\n\nAnd some of them are encoded in the evaluator in function evaluator, and some of them you might want to hard constrain them in the solution, right? And so, can you specify those so that, uh, an agent like AlphaEvolve can take that into account while it is, uh, thinking about how it exposes the search space or how it constructs, uh, the solutions that it will sort of generate? These are all sort of very interesting places where human input might be required, but especially as we look at many different types of domains. So, yeah, I think we should definitely see this as an amazing tool for scientists, for computer scientists, mathematicians, and this is in fact, this has been sort of our experience as well, that in the right hands, it is a very powerful tool, right? So, like mathematicians who have tried to explore it, and, uh, and they, they have been able to specify what are the solutions that, what are the types of solutions that they're looking for, they can be much more, uh, uh, productive and much more sort of effective in finding, uh, the solutions. I just wanted to highlight that, uh, even though we have, uh, been describing AlphaEvolve as this kind of autonomous agent that does things on its own, actually in practice, using this agent often turns out to be surprisingly collaborative, and we have seen this in particular, uh, with mathematicians that we have collaborated with, um, and there are a few reasons for this, uh, but one is that, um, AlphaEvolve is an agent that doesn't just give you the solution, it searches for an algorithm that constructs that solution. And so, depending on how you, how you set up your problem definition, often it's actually the algorithm that's even more valuable than the solution itself, because the algorithm, it tells you how to construct the solution. So that means you understand what are the, what are the ideas that go into building that solution, and maybe especially, or definitely, it's true in Mathematics, that's what, um, that's what people really care about, to understand the nature of our, our universe and, uh, know, build up the understanding of fundamental ideas. And so it's actually often not interesting almost at all what the solution is, but what you care about is how you, how you build it. And so we had a firsthand experience collaborating with multiple mathematicians, and it's been really fascinating to see where we would, would share with them the, the output from AlphaEvolve, and, um, they, they would be like really fascinated looking at the code that that it found and trying to understand, okay, what is it actually doing? And then understanding, oh, okay, this, this is doing this, this is doing that, and now I can see why, why if you put it together, then it leads to a really good solution. Yeah, like I can also confirm from my own personal experience that looking at the, at the code or the algorithms that the system finds, it's, it's often a really interesting experience because it's, it's code that kind of like looks, uh, humanlike, like it's something that you could have written, but would you have thought of writing it in exactly this way, and then trying to understand, okay, what exactly is it doing? Um, that, that's a really interesting experience, but at the same time, it's one of the key strengths of, of the system, not only for scientific applications where you can look at the code and get some understanding out of it, but also for many of the practical applications. It's, it's hugely valuable that the, the artifact you get out of AlphaEvolve is a, is a piece of code, and then you deploy that piece of code. And so before you do that, um, experts, engineers who have worked on that system can visually inspect that piece of code, understand it, and make the final decision of whether it's going to be deployed. So it's in a completely different league from, let's say, considering, um, using a neural network to make decisions in some production system where you kind of need to trust that the neural network is going to always behave in the way that you hope it will. With the code, you can look at it, understand it, and make the decision yourself.\nI might add that, basically, uh, not all code is interpretable by, by humans, right? The solutions and the programs that Alpha finds are sort of interpretable by, uh, human, uh, programmers. So, uh, so this is going to be a very interesting area of work in the future as to when you find these solutions, what can we learn from them. This was very interesting, like as Matej was sort of mentioning, this was a very interesting experience that we had working with Jordan Ellenburgg in the first, in the earlier version of AlphaEvolve when we were working on the capset problem. The programs that it discovered had this very interesting symmetries that, um, that mathematicians did not know about. And so, so not only the solution was, uh, mathematically interesting, but like the actual sort of con construction, but the algorithm for, for producing that construction had, uh, the structure of it was interesting in itself. For listeners who are thinking about, um, accessibility or implications for themselves where they're not professional mathematicians in collaboration with AlphaEvolve, what are the considerations in making some of these capabilities more broadly available?\nWe want to make, uh, these capabilities accessible to, um, as many people as we can, uh, to the wider community. Uh, now we, we have started a trusted tester program where we have asked, uh, people to submit proposals, and what we intend to do with, uh, that program is to figure out what are the right ways in which people can really leverage, uh, Alpha. So we have internally used it across Google, but as you know, it requires certain things, sort of the need for a function evaluator. As part of the trusted testers program, we are going to be evaluating AlphaEvolve on a bunch of different, uh, types of, uh, applications, and that will inform our future, uh, release strategy as to how do we make it more broadly applicable. The second sort of element is that not only you need the function, the, the evaluator, but you also need a significant amount of, uh, computational resources, right? Because it's not just one single LLM call, it's, it requires a significant amount of, uh, uh, function evaluations, depending on the difficulty of the problem, right? If it's a easy problem, then you can do it very quickly, but if you really are going for some very hard problems with a very large extended search space, and you want to spend a significant amount of time searching over it, then how do you build the overall system that can that people can sort of, uh, uh, can use effectively and efficiently? That's the other sort of thing that we'll be thinking about.\nLast question for you both. Is there, um, sort of practical application within Google that you think will be interesting that you haven't tried AlphaEvolve on yet? In this, uh, white paper, we try to think about holistically when we look at the computational infrastructure of Google, what are the the key parts in this infrastructure to demonstrate that AlphaEvolve can make discoveries across the stack, not only in one part of it, and that it can make discoveries that are highly valuable. And so we try to cover the entire spectrum. So, so we show that AlphaEvolve can improve the efficiency of the data center. It can contribute to hardware design, and it can contribute to improving the efficiency of most important pieces of software that, uh, that are being run inside Google. And like one intention here was to demonstrate that this is a really versatile tool that you can apply across the spectrum. And as Pushmeet was saying, this is a tool that is already available inside Google, and it is being, being used for, for many, many problems. Uh, there are quite a few exciting ones. I, I'm not ready to share about the particulars, uh, yet, but, uh, as you can imagine, there is so many exciting computational problems in a, in a, in a place like Google, uh, within AI and also outside, uh, that yeah, I'm, I'm sure there will be many, many really cool results, um, coming in the future.\nI think that's a great note to end on. Um, Pushmeet, Matej, anything we didn't cover?\nNo, I think that will great.\nThank you guys so much for being here. Congrats.\nOkay, great, thank you very much.\nFind us on Twitter at @NoPriorsPod.
