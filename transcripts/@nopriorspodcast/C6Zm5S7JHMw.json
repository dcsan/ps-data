  "cleanText": "Hi listeners, and welcome back to No Priors. Today's guest is Dr. Fei-Fei Li, a pioneer in computer vision and deep learning. She created ImageNet, the groundbreaking data set that helped spark the deep learning revolution. Dr. Li is a Stanford professor and the co-director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute. She's also led AI at Google Cloud, advised international policymakers, and recently co-founded World Labs, a company dedicated to developing spatially intelligent AI.\n\nFay, thank you for joining us today.\n\nWell, thanks for inviting me. This is going to be fun. So, you have made extraordinary contributions to science and policy over the past two decades. I'll start with the biggest question: why start a company now?\n\nBecause in my heart, I want to build. I see this as such a critical, fun, and exciting moment to build some extraordinary technology that everybody can use. I believe so much in spatial intelligence and the kind of 3D world models that can empower so many people, as well as so many use cases. I think that's just—it's going to be really exciting, and I can do that with an extraordinary, very extraordinarily brilliant group of young technologists.\n\nI want to come back to the people you're working with because I know some of your co-founders and was trying to convince them desperately to start a company a while back, and then they were like, \"Oh no, we have a bigger mission now with Fay.\"\n\nWhat is spatial intelligence? Can you define it for a broader audience?\n\nSpatial intelligence, to me, is the ability to understand, reason, and interact and generate 3D worlds. Because our world, fundamentally, no matter how you say we can project it, fundamentally is 3D. It's 3D because physically it's 3D, and digitally, if there is a true 3D representation, then we can make a lot of things happen more easily, whether it's designing, creation, navigation, simulation, or the experiencing of AR/VR. All this, to me, is part of spatial intelligence. And again, I think what really excites me is humans have spatial intelligence; it's part of our core intelligent capabilities. Animals have spatial intelligence; the entire journey of evolution is deeply intertwined with the evolution of spatial intelligence. So it's so fundamental; without spatial intelligence, AI would be incomplete.\n\nHow does that translate into what you're doing with your company, or is there anything you can share in terms of what that means relative to what you're building?\n\nYeah. So we're tackling one of the hardest problems in AI, which is actually making world models that are fundamentally 3D. Because once you can crack that problem, you can unlock a lot of spatial intelligence problems. So we are the first company we know of that is solving this 3D generation foundation model problem.\n\nI have many questions, but since you are describing this 3D's criticality to just sort of understanding the world, does that imply you feel that the world models that World Labs will create, or others in academia or in companies, will someday be realistically accurate—like represent physics and understanding of the world that we can do many more things with?\n\nYeah, it should be realistically accurate or plausible. So you can create a fantastical world, but it should be plausible because the geometry and the physics of it need to be plausible, and that is fundamental to spatial intelligence.\n\nDoes that imply you have a particular point of view from a neuroscience perspective of how fundamental visual—I mean, you've always been a leader in computer vision—but in how important visual intelligence is versus, let's say, large language models and textual intelligence?\n\nI actually do. I think from a neural and cognitive science point of view that spatial intelligence is a really hard problem that evolution has to solve for animals. And what's really interesting is I think animals have solved it to an extent, but not fully solved it. It's one of the hardest problems because what is the problem an animal has to solve? Animals have to evolve the capability of collecting light in something which we call eyes mostly. And then, with that collection of eyes, it has to reconstruct a 3D world in their mind somehow so that they can navigate and they can do things, and of course, they can interact. For humans, we're the most capable animal in terms of manipulation. We can do a lot of things, and all this is spatial intelligence. To me, that's rooted in our intelligence. What is interesting is it's not a fully solved problem even in animals. We, for example, for humans, right? If I ask you to close your eyes right now and draw out or build a 3D model of the environment around you, it's not that easy. We don't have that much capability to generate extremely complicated 3D models until we get trained. You know, there are some of us, whether they're architects or designers or just people with a lot of training and a lot of talent, and that's a hard thing to do. And imagine you do it at your fingertip much more easily and allow much more fluid interactivity and editability. That would just be a whole different world for people—no pun intended.\n\nAre there other big areas like spatial intelligence that you feel haven't been as developed as they could be from a model perspective, or other sort of missing gaps that you think, in general, as we think as we build this sort of AI future, we should focus on over time, or people should build out? I was just wondering, in addition to sort of 3D and world generation, are there other big problems like that? Because it feels like there are a few big things that we've solved for over time and other things we're working on. We're sort of solving language. I would say language is solved to a huge extent, and 3D, to me, is as critical and difficult as language. So what else that's not solved? I mean, the entire space of emotional intelligence is something that I don't even know how to begin to solve. I know a lot of people who haven't solved it. So that's when AGI is achieved.\n\nI can tell you the training data for that is not going to come from Silicon Valley.\n\n\nValley people. Don't underestimate Silicon Valley. Yeah. So, I'll put myself in this bucket, but I think we probably need a broader set of people. Yeah. No, I agree. But these are the three big buckets, to be honest. That's I don't know. What do you think, Elon and Sarah? I think it depends a lot on what you encapsulate in each model. So I agree with your framework in terms of those three, and then certain things like, um, you know, the spatial intelligence. I'm assuming also delves into different types of physics simulation and simulations of the world, and that, you know, like those are big areas that I think a lot of people aren't working on that I think are really interesting or important. So, um, and there's the macro and the micro scale of that. The microscale eventually becomes material sciences and other very different types of things from what you're talking about, where it's more molecular modeling or—yeah, right—and also somewhat goes outside the current definition of AI, which I do think they'll be empowered by. Of course, there's robotics, but robotics is very much a system integration problem as much as a, um, you know, even if you look at animals, it's not just the compute in the brain per se, right? Yeah, a lot of these things seem much more distributed in terms of spatial intelligence relative to specific systems that animals have, and in some cases, it's to your point, not as centralized as one would think. So it's very interesting to start thinking in terms of those models of more distributed intelligence across an organism versus a CNS. But, um, yeah, I think it's very interesting stuff. You've also done work in this field of robotics and like physical intelligence. I think of the data hierarchy for, you know, robotics foundation models and actuation as, you know, people want to, of course, use video, right, because that is what is available to us. There's a big question on like simulation and how much you can get from that today. Perhaps people do not see the future of the quality and the physics that are going to be available to us, um, and then there's, you know, close to embodied, uh, like different forms of tea op, and then like embodied data collection. Is that the hierarchy you have in your mind, or do you think people underestimate simulation and World models for the future?\n\nYeah, great question. First of all, I, like you say, I do work in robotics, especially in my lab at Stanford. I have no doubt that humanity will move into an age where we cohabit with robots, and also the world—the world robot is not humanoid per se. Robots are taking all kinds of forms and shapes. Actually, a few years ago, my lab wrote a really fun paper about morphological intelligence, where the morphology of an agent actually can change by optimizing the tasks they're trying to achieve. So, so we should be a little more imaginative than just human humanoids. Having said that, how to train robot—uh, you mentioned this whole data—some people call it data pyramids or data cakes or whatever. I agree. I think it's going to be a hybrid of many different forms of data. I also think, uh, simulation is underrated. It's, um, actually it's not underrated by a lot of experts and people in the field. If you look at a lot of robotics companies, they are working on simulated, uh, simulation and synthetic data. I also think we have to be, um, also aware that unlike language models or even unlike, um, spatial intelligence foundation models, robotics is a highly multimodal, um, um, uh, system that I think what is truly underappreciated in my opinion is haptics. There's so much, especially if we want to do manipulation, not just navigation. I think haptics data and the ability to really integrate haptics into vision and perception and spatial, uh, data is absolutely critical.\n\nOne thing that you said that I thought was really interesting is, um, how many different—what what are the different morphological forms that a robot may adapt or adopt? And, um, there's sort of two counterarguments people make in terms of the potential future. One argument is that, um, from a supply chain perspective and managing builds and scale of manufacturing, you're going to have many fewer form factors. And the other argument is the economic value of specialization is very high and therefore there'll be, you know, thousands and thousands of different form factors as we move to sort of a robot-driven future. Do you have a point of view on sort of where we're likely to land between those two viewpoints? I think we're going to gradient descend into optimization of productivity and efficiency. My hypothesis is that the requirements of different tasks are so vast that having very few form or or sticking with one form is energy inefficient, and a lot of tasks can be done and should be done by much more energy-efficient form factors. Just an extreme and trivial example: If we put robots underwater, they should not be in the shape of humans. They better be in the shape of fish, right? Just think about energy efficiency. And the same with flying. I don't think human form—our airplanes are becoming more and more robots. And so I do think there's going to be diversity.\n\nRobotics is one potential application for the future. You're a scientist first, um, but also, you know, did the Twitter board, involved in startups. Um, what are the near-term commercial applications that you can imagine for generating 3D worlds? I believe creativity is a vastly, um, exciting area where humans can be superpowered by, uh, by, uh, AI and by spatial intelligence. And here I draw an analogy with software engineering. If you look at today's success of LLMs in software engineering, including applications like Cursor and Windsurf and all that, what you see is a lot of collaboration between AI and humans, and then the collaboration comes in different levels of skill sets and all that, and I think creativity will be similar, is that whether we're talking about designers, 3D artists, VFX artists, or even marketing talents and and game developers. There's so much need in co—uh—in designing and creating 3D space, and this is fundamentally such a hard problem even for the trained skilled, uh, people that having a collaborator will be, uh, extremely, um, fun if we do it right. And so I see creativity as an area that is really exciting. I also do think, um, that, um, a lot of what we're waiting for for Metaverse or XR, AR, VR…\n\n\nIs content creation. I understand hardware itself needs to continue to evolve, but I also think software—we're looking for content creation, and that lends itself so naturally to 3D modeling and 3D, or generative spatial models. That's another interesting area to look into. Do you have a strong point of view on whether or not World models are an interesting answer to scalable RL for more generalizable agents? I actually do think this is, as I said, AI is not complete without spatial intelligence because humans interact in 3D worlds. In the digital world, we need all kinds of interaction. You know, take design as an example; it's deeply—when we are thinking about design, there's so much we are optimizing for in our mind's eye, whether it's beauty, efficiency, optimization, or whatever it is, and that lends itself pretty naturally to RL settings. What are the biggest challenges in trying to go down this path of designing and training World models? I imagine one is—you worked on images, you worked on video, but we have images and video, and we don't have lots of 3D worlds in a format I assume you're building.\n\nYeah, data is absolutely a challenge. You're totally right about that. To create World models, 3D foundation models, we require more and more sophisticated data engineering, data acquisition, data processing, and data synthesis. I am envious of my NLP LLM colleagues; the data is so abundant on the internet, and we don't necessarily have that luxury. So that's definitely one challenge. Another challenge is that 3D—this is kind of ironic, right? Every one of us uses 3D every day in so many settings. Basically, you open your eyes, and the whole life that you experience is 3D. Even when we type on the computer or stare at a screen all the time, it's still not as easy a form factor to deliver in the hands of people compared to language. Language is just so easy, and it's also a very active form; it's not a passive consumption of viewing. Nobody wakes up and says, \"I'm just going to sit here and watch 3D.\" So that creates challenges for productization and how to do it in the right way.\n\nWere you ever a Second Life player or anything? I'm not a gamer, but my kids love Minecraft. I was going to ask you if there was a world you want to experience or imagine. That's a great question, Sarah. I would love to see worlds I don't see—for example, zooming in and in into microscopic worlds or going into the inside of an engine. I know theoretically how it works, but seeing it with my own eyes, experiencing it, or—you might laugh at this—I want to be inside a dishwasher and just experience what that is. All this can be done virtually if we manage to create World models of anything.\n\nI think we both want to talk a little bit about your past career and maybe some insights for anyone doing research or trying to have an impact within AI. Right before this, I asked Andrej Karpathy what I should ask you, and he said, \"Fei-Fei Li is really magic about ambition and thinking about data. You should ask her about her PhD and the creation of that ImageNet data set because it's instructive.\" So I have to ask you about that. First of all, I have to say it's always the greatest thing when you're a student is—you're more well-known and achieving so much more than you can. It makes me so proud of Andrej Karpathy. I'm surprised he remembers my PhD work. So, yes, it's true. It goes back to 2003ish, and the world was just barely scratching the surface of the internet, and data was not much of a thing. But doing computer vision, my PhD work was really trying to get object recognition to work—calling out cats and dogs and microwaves and chairs and all that when you're presented with a picture. We were beginning to hypothesize that data matters, but we had no idea there's no scaling law. We had no idea how far data can go. All we wanted is if we have a machine learning algorithm, whether it's a neural network or—Bayes at that time was very popular—or support vector machine, we need some data to train, and there was no data to train. As a PhD student, you want to graduate, and my advisor, Fei-Fei Li, was like, \"Well, curate a data set.\" I was thinking, \"Yeah, I do need to curate a data set because every data set out there is so tiny; I'm just not convinced.\"\n\nPetro and I were just talking—is it 15 different things or 30 different things? Then, God forbid, the PhD advisor said the three-digit number 100. I was like, \"That's a lot of work,\" but deep in my heart, I know he's right. From a mathematical point of view, pushing the model to generalize, we need enough data at least. So I did write about this process in my book, *The Worlds I See*. I stumbled upon a dictionary somehow—it was for my own English study—the Webster dictionary, if I'm not wrong. It just kind of randomly has visual depictions of some words. I don't even know what rule they follow. Some are flowers, some are bicycles, some are dogs. I was like, \"Okay, this is actually—you can call it a cheater or a tool.\" I grabbed 101 of those words, and that really made my PhD advisor chuckle because he's like, \"Ah, yeah, you just want to do one more than I asked for to dare me.\"\n\n\nSo that's what I did. And I gotta say that I still remember I downloaded, or you know, tried, you know, from Google. Google was so new at that point, and the Google image search was so terrible at that point, compared to today. I had to do so much cleaning. At some point, I got so desperate I just asked my mom to clean the images because I wrote a little interface on the computer. She doesn't know computers, but at least she knows click-click. So she helped me do some of that.\n\nI mean, you've had one of the most storied careers in AI, and to your point, many of your students have similarly gone on to do really great things across the field, across industry, across the world. Um, what are two or three moments that you think of when you think back on your career today? And obviously, there's still a lot of career to come, but I'm just sort of curious. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of things that you did in terms of image and visual recognition-related systems and all that, but I'm just sort of curious, like when you think of the last 20 years, what stands out the most, given everything that you've done?\n\nOh, thank you for asking that question. Of course, ImageNet is one of those—ImageNet consists of multiple moments: from the early struggles and being told I will not get tenure, to actually realizing Amazon Mechanical Turk comes to the rescue, to the moment of AlexNet winning. Also, a couple of years ago, I was at an event in Toronto with Geoffrey Hinton, and he said publicly how defining that was. He was almost a little bit apologetic that ImageNet was not as recognized as neural networks. So that journey is very validating. And for scientists, the validation is not about recognition or awards. It's that you made a difference—like that conjecture that no one believed in, that hypothesis that no one believed in; we were able to make it happen. So that's one thread. Just to make sure for any people from the business world that are not familiar with it, ImageNet was a large-scale data set with millions of labeled images across thousands of categories—not just 10 or 15. Fifteen million labeled images.\n\nThank you, Fei-Fei Li. That led to amazing breakthroughs in deep learning, in particular AlexNet, and lots of progress in the field of—yeah, it drove a lot of machine vision forward. And I actually remember, in 2016 or 2017, I used to show a slide which was the history of AI, or you know, back then it was CNNs and RNNs, and just GANs were kind of going. I had ImageNet and AlexNet as like one of the seminal moments of this very small number of events that really defined AI progress. And obviously, now we have transformers as part of that and maybe diffusion models or something, but it was such a big breakthrough.\n\nYeah, thank you. Another moment I'm very proud of was actually Andrej Karpathy and Justin Johnson and their dissertations. It's where, in my opinion, for the first time, language and images converged by captioning and writing stories of the visual world. It was significant for me for two reasons. One is that I literally thought—I kid you not—at the end of my PhD, I thought if I can live till 100 years old, that was the problem we might be able to solve, which is storytelling of pictures. So I entered my career, like my first year as an assistant professor, thinking, okay, I'm going to do ImageNet to solve object recognition, and then I'm going to spend the rest of my entire career solving this problem of storytelling. And then, by the time Andrej Karpathy and then a little later Justin Johnson entered my lab—that was around 2013-2014, the beginning of deep learning—and then suddenly the combination of sequential models at that point—it's LSTM, it's not transformer models, but LSTM and CNN—just blasted open the image captioning work. My work was the first, together with Google's, that was out of the door, and that was really—to me, I almost had—it made me so proud. I almost had a crisis, which is like, what am I going to do for the rest of my 70 years or 65 years? So that was really exciting how fast the field has evolved.\n\nCan I ask you one more question about this, just because you have made this amazing progress very efficiently? You and I have talked before offline about how you feel it's really important for there to be moonshots and creativity in AI research beyond very large, funded corporate labs, let's say. You pointed to several moments that came from creativity and research in academia. What advice do you have for people about whether or not there's still opportunity for that, or you know, it's all just 10 billion dollar training runs from here?\n\nMy singular advice, and I still say that in my company and in my lab, is be fearless. I think scientists and technologists and entrepreneurs have to be fearless. You know, eventually you have to figure out, do you need 10 billion dollar runs, or then you come to Sarah to ask for funding? Probably a lot of both. Yeah. Um, or you have to figure out, I don't know, data. Sometimes fearless is this very interesting position where you're somewhat delusional and crazy, but somewhat just rationally bold. And it kind of is in between because if you're too rational, it's not courageous enough. You're not identifying problems that are big enough. But if you're completely crazy, then I don't know, there are so many things that can go wrong. So be fearless, be courageous. To me, that is—even as old as I am—that's how I feel. I started my startup, World Labs, because I want to be fearless and solve this problem of spatial intelligence as part of problem-solving.\n\nYou've worked with some of the best AI researchers in the world over time and best engineers. How do you think about that in the context of your company? Like, what sorts of people are you trying to hire? Are there open roles currently? Undoubtedly, it's an amazing team. I'm just curious what sorts of folks you want to add and how you're thinking about that over time. Yes, we have open roles and we…\n\n\nI would love to hire the best engineers, as well as product thinkers, at this point for our company. So, if you're an engineer or AI researcher or product talent out there, passionate about joining the most talented team and solving this problem, please join us. So, who do we hire? First of all, we really do hire for diversity of thinking. And this is where, you know, you call us an AI company, but if you look under the hood, we've got computer graphics experts; we've got computer vision experts; we've got data experts; we've got generative AI experts; we've got machine learning infra experts; we've got optimization experts. So, it's actually really important to hire a diverse group of really talented people because a problem as hard as spatial intelligence is not a homogeneous problem. It takes talents of all kinds of backgrounds to solve it.  I also look for fearlessness. How do you identify if somebody has fearlessness in their background or in their thinking processes? It's in their background. You talk to them; you can sense someone is fearless. You can sense what drives them. You can sense the questions they ask. If they start asking you a lot of things about, I don't know, how to get this done—and I mean, of course, you have to ask those questions because you want to get it done—but if you sense that it comes from the point of view of being scared of solving that, then that's not fearlessness. But those fearless people, they are creative; they're ambitious; they're not afraid of the uncertainty or the unknown. And I really love that. We try to make a business of doing business with fearless people and hopefully those that are technically creative.\n\nOne last broader question for you because I think an important part of your work has also been thinking how to bring more people into AI. You co-direct the Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute. What is your most optimistic view of what human-centered AI looks like several years out from your last set of predictions?\n\nThanks for asking. In fact, that is another point of my career I feel very proud of: the founding of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute (HAI) and also the continued movement towards that way of thinking. I want to build a world where AI collaborates and empowers people. I still believe our human world needs to be human-centered, where love, relationships, and prosperity across all communities are really important. Justice and all these are really important values, and I don't think any piece of machinery, whether it's AI, an airplane, or biotech, should take those away. But with those critical values in mind, having AI to empower us is really important because there are so many unsolved problems. One application area I worked on is healthcare at Stanford. If you look at healthcare from drug discovery to curing diseases to diagnosis that can reach all people in the world, to treatment that can be accessible to all people in the world, to the whole healthcare delivery, how to make aging better, how to take care of chronic diseases, how to deal with mental health—all of this. We do not have an issue of excessive humans; we're lacking help. We are lacking scientific discovery; we're lacking diagnosis; we're lacking precision medicine; we're lacking safer and more effective ways of healthcare delivery and aging help. And that's what I believe. I think AI is a tool to help people.  I and [another person] are collectively invested in a series of companies that I hope will be useful here, from a bridge to open evidence to LA. But as you said, there's a huge spectrum of problems, and honestly, I've been less optimistic about the adoption of technology in healthcare for the last 15 years, but it does feel like this time it's different and actually massively net good here. I actually started a digital health company before this, and my hope is finally a lot of the things that people have been talking about for decades will come to fruition, and it seems like AI is a great delivery mechanism for that.\n\nWell, thank you so much, Dr. Fei-Fei Li. It was fantastic. This has been inspiring and great to hear a little bit more about World Labs as well. Thank you. Thank you a lot. Thank you, Sarah.\n\nFind us on Twitter at @no prior pod.
