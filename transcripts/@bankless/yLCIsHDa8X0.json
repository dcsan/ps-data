  "cleanText": "Welcome Bankless to the round table. We're back in session today. The man with glutenous glutes, ZeroX Bread guy. Good as you. Hey guys. And today at the top of Ethereum's most wanted list to Jon Charbano. Joe. And then of course the world's most zen DJ Andy 8052. He is out golfing. So it's just us two today. Bread. John, good to see you guys. Uh we ripped it with Ryan Shan Adams last week, but uh it's good to have two of the boys back in session this week. I want to get this week started off with kind of just an overall vibe check. Um there's like a lot of activity. There's a lot of buzz. There's a lot of engagement going around in crypto. Animal spirit. Yeah, animal spirits feel present right now in the crypto industry. There's two tweets that are kind of echoing around. One from intern state of the crypto markets. They say IPOs are back. Apps are generating revenue. Crypto IPO going parabolic. Bitcoin tapping all-time highs, stable coin growth with no end in sight, and then Bitcoin accumulation vehicles popping off left and right. And then another tweet from Anom saying, \"Appetite for crypto exposure has never been higher. Various entities alongside Sailor buying multi-billions of Bitcoin. Circle is a lot of this same thing. Circle IPO 25 over subscribe 5x and open. Plasma $500 million ICO filled in two minutes. Ply market and X integration. And then also the United States government actively pursuing regulatory clarity. A lot of reasons to be bullish. I feel pretty bullish about the second half of this year. I feel like the second half of this year could get frothy. That's not my base case, but my base case is like at least a slow grind up. So, I want to kind of get a sentiment check from you guys about what you think uh the next like, you know, second half of this year will look like. Oh, that's tough. Like, you know, like we've all seen the structural bullishness that was in place for this to happen, right? It's it went all the way back to like the ETF imposs like like the the uh loosen regulatory frameworks or like just hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey like there's there's appetite for this thing. So like I think we've all loosely like thought directionally this would happen but in a volatile Trump market like there's like the path was never going to be a straight line up. I still don't think like it's not going to be just like oh we're just grind up from here it's going to be fine guys. No like something is going to happen over the next six months that's going to scare the be Jesus out of us but then we have to look back to stuff like this and go like guys we're fine. like there is there is some fundamental structural stuff that like is uh is bullish for us and we need to stay aware of that. But yeah, like this has always been kind of what we were hoping for just like it will it will pull up. It's just it's not going to be it's just going to be a slow grind. I'm I'm confident of that. So I'm hearing a neither affirm nor deny any. I'm holding my options there. My options are they're expired at the end of the year. I think those are a good move. Uh but yeah, man. Like I I know I'm going to have to white knuckle probably for a few weeks between here and there. Okay. So So you're saying by the end of this year we will be higher than we are today. And in addition to that there will be one of those big tweets from that one Twitter account that says like $500 billion has been liquidated from the crypto markets in the past like two hours. Like one of those course because we're feeling this like we're we're rattling off lists of like guys it's a new paradigm. And then like that's when everyone's like they long at the top and then I I just did it last week. I told you like I entered my first per position. I longed at the top and the ass fell out. So like okay like you know what okay got to grab this thing for a little bit. Re revisit these kind of lists and say like guys we're fine. Like some of these things will carry out and I think it's going to be no different. John, what do you think? I was listening to a podcast yesterday where they brought up super cycle more times than more times they made me comfortable which which is more than zero.\nUm yeah, I I I mean I broadly agree. If this administration is good for anything, it is good for volatility. Uh there's going to be periods between now and the end of the year where we question everything probably back down on the downside. I just wouldn't be surprised by that. But at the same time, the just broader setup for the space is really just great right now where I mean back back on the just higher level of I mean where where is the administration? Where are politics? The environment is just so much more positive where I mean we saw in the past week I mean like the the SEC was having a bunch of the industry leaders come in um and talk about the industry like they want to openly engage you know people were retweeting the tweets of Paul Atkins do you think we're represented well in those those instances where they pull people in to actually have conversations because like that's always been the question right it's like you know in the past we've we've had those conversations but it was you know SPF and it's like ah that's that actually did more damage right right I think we're represented incredibly well this time around. Yeah, I I would say that we were represented very well. My my partner uh at DBA was one of the speakers that they had at this event, uh Michael Jordan. So, you're obligated. So, John says, \"Yes, we are represented.\" I think we represented really well in Washington. Um but it it really is just an amazing tone shift to see the SEC and other regulators that are very actively reaching out to us because they want to engage. They want to get this right. Um, and we see that in the enforcement actions, the guidance that they're giving where last year it was they were sending enforcement actions and the past week we are looking at the SEC tweeting out how DeFi fits in the American spirit and we want to respect self custody for us. That that's still just a crazy shift for me to see in the past year. Um, and on the legislative front, we're obviously seeing strong progress on the the genius bills moving forward for stable coins. We'll see where market structure bill goes after that. Hopefully that gets pushed forward. But very broadly, the macro setup is there. This is being accepted as a real asset class. The FRA framework is being built for us to actually be able to mature the industry. So the onus is really on us to build the products that take advantage of hey you can go build mature real products now like please go do that. Um and I I think that we are starting to see signs of that as well in the industry and then you are seeing the institutional demand for the product as well. um as evidenced by we we'll talk about this later but the the Circle IPO which was the biggest left curve mid curve between you know what what was the right take on this IPO versus what was CT saying about it going in and it's it's very fitting too I feel like I've seen a lot of tweets over the past few months or so six months plus where a lot of people that you talk to who speak to more institutional investors and people who are looking at crypto from the outside larger money managers and the like versus you compare their sentiment to what is CT sentiment has just been the widest gap that you've ever seen. Um, and I think something like the Circle IPO was a very representative of that where everyone on CT for the past few weeks was just mega bearish on this. It was ah like the margins are compressing. Coinbase makes all the money on this. Like how do how do you justify this valuation and then they list it, boom, 25x overs subscribed, the thing rips 5x over the next few days and like here we are. Um, do you think it's because it's so simple? Like what like why why to pull this apart? I think people really want stable coin exposure. Um I I think it's really really I think it was really that simple. I I it's a narrative trade. It's a narrative play. Like there's I think we would all be in agreement that the fundamentals of the Circle business does not at all justify its valuation.\nI agree with that. And then I I mean there's some degree of fundamentals versus what is the short-term price. you know, if you bought the Grayscale Bitcoin ETPs a few years ago because that was the only thing that you could access and you wanted to express a bet on Bitcoin, was that a bad bet or a good bet? Depending on where you bought it, I mean, it it was a bad bet in the sense that I mean, you're paying twice what is the underlying literally worth? But you had the right macro bet and over a long enough time horizon, if that's the only way that you're allowed to express your bet, maybe that is a rational thing for you to do. um as someone who is able to take much more, let's say, nuanced and directed bets on I think there's going to be a lot of stable coin growth. What are the protocols I want to invest in to profit off of that? Whether that's DeFi projects or what other early startups, I think that there are better alternatives. But the reality is for a lot of people, they they do not have access to those alternatives. They don't have the sophistication or the desire to invest in those alternatives. They see this is the big regulatory stamp approved. This is the nice whitelisted white gloved stable coin provider and they're a public company now. I can go buy this thing. Is it expensive based on you comparables? Yeah, it is. But I really want exposure to this thing and so people are going into it. I I I think it's that simple is I I think there's a scarcity effective. People really want stable coin exposure. Um and there's limited opportunities to do that particularly in a public markets way. So people I think people just really really wanted exposure to that.

Coinbase is like $65 billion and Coinbase has like 30 or 40% of the revenue coming out of Circle, out of USDC. And so there's just a huge mismatch here. Like why why would Circle be valued at $25 billion when like Coinbase is valued at 65? And like yes, you could just be like, I don't I don't care what it is. I want stable coin exposure. Circle is the only thing I can do to get stable coin exposure. Therefore, I'm going to slam by. To me, like I can't really differentiate that between somebody being like, yeah, like I want to I I want access to blockchain technology and uh you know, banks running blockchain technology are the future. Therefore, I'm going to buy Ripple. Like the disconnect between fundamentals and actual like reality is just so large here. Like you're I'm John. I'm guessing you're not buying Circle. Brett, you're not buying. I don't think anyone on crypto Twitter can like justify buying Circle at a $25 billion valuation. And so what one half of me is like, well, you know, we all just mid-curved it uh because the thing to do was to clearly to buy at least in this moment of time. But then also I'll I'll like project forward, you know, five years be like, well, will it justify itself then? like like may maybe we're not maybe we're not right now. We're just early. Uh but then also like being early is also being wrong. I don't really know how to think about it. I think it's mostly commentary on just like the the size of our our ecosystem, right? Like like one like yes, we have awareness of all these these comps within the ecosystem that we can look to like tether and say like look tether is is dunking on circle in every measurable like factor and like we have awareness of it. We can't get exposure to it but like we have awareness of it. So it allows us to like look at it say it's not the best, it's not whatever. And then just like the relative capital size of players in our ecosystem to the gargantuan trad world, like the public markets, right? Like this could be this could be the splash on effects of just like a bunch of people in that market that just want to get exposure to it.\n\n\nAnd as Sean said, this is the only thing they can do.\nSo, it's just like, yeah, they can pump this thing to 26 bills, and like that's not really that big of a deal to them in their market, cuz it's like this is what we can do, and this is like the splash on effects of our capital size relative to us, where it's like that's a big thing.\nLike this, like all of this was a crazy move.\nUm, and yeah, we couldn't move it quite this to quite this degree because our we're just a small fish, right, relative to the global markets.\nYeah.\nSo, one of the funny tweets I saw, someone did the math of, I don't remember the exact number, but it was basically if you take the current multiples that Circle's trading at, and if you throw that on top of Tether, like, oh yeah, we get, we get an implied valuation of like a trillion dollars or something like that, right?\nAnd so, do you actually think it's worth that?\nNo, probably not.\nUm, and so I, I, I do not own any exposure to Circle, um, right now because I, I, I can't justify the current prices based on, you know, what I think are reasonable expectations.\nBut you're not.\nYeah, I'm, I'm not shorting anything in crypto.\nI, I, I have no plans to do that at all.\nUh, like they, they are a great business, and I wish them success.\nI mean, that's separate from, you know, what, what do I think the short-term price is going to be.\nUm, but even as someone who doesn't hold any of it, the sentiment has been super positive around crypto around this, and as it should be, because I, this is a great, really healthy sign for the industry, showing, hey, there is a lot of demand for this.\nThis is something that people take seriously.\nThis is another step in the maturation process.\nIf we have another big listed public company, what is this very likely to do for all of those other crypto companies that were considering going public at some point in the medium term?\nMaybe they were thinking about going public next year.\nThose timelines are probably being pulled up.\nI saw one of the tweets was it was Gemini.\nGemini, I believe they were pulling forward their timeline to looking to file.\nThere's a number of other exchanges and other operations.\nThe race is on to go public right now.\nYeah, this was a very clear sign, hey, the market's open now for this.\nAnd so that is, that is super healthy and really, really positive for us to see, and that has trickle-down effects throughout the rest of the funding, um, and startups and all the other products in crypto that are downhill of that.\nIt would be interesting to see the price performance of Gemini post IPO because Gemini is an exchange.\nSo it's going to get comped to Coinbase, not to Circle, but it's Circle that is the firing gun for Gemini's like being okay.\nLike it's, it's we're good to go.\nAnd Kraken is going to be the same.\nLike Kraken's probably making similar moves.\nUh, and as a coin holder, I was excited for Circle to go live because I was hoping that that like positive valuation would blow back onto my coin bags, which didn't really happen.\nAnd so, there's an interesting justosition there of like, oh yeah, Gemini, Kraken, chomping at the bit to go public, but their comp is Coinbase, not Circle.\nAnd so like I don't, I don't know if the market's going to give them maybe unless there's like a fresh chart premium for you IPOing.\nI, I don't know.\nI, I don't know if that exists in TradFi.\nUh, what do you guys think about that?\nI broadly agree.\nI, I, I think the really, really strong demand right now is for stable coins in particular.\nAnd that's the niche that Circle was filling.\nAnd so I, I don't think that these other ones are going to fill that exact same gap.\nBut nonetheless, I still think it is a very healthy sign that you have just showing, hey, there is market demand for institutional grade crypto products right now.\nUm, this is something that institutional investors want to be investing in, um, now that we have all the clarity.\nSo, it, it's a good sign nonetheless.\nI, I agree that it's, it would be even better if they were the third biggest stable coin issuer to go and IPO right now.\nThat would probably be the thing that you want to do even more.\nBut, it's a positive sign nonetheless.\nAnd how well they go will be a good indicator though of how broad this demand is and what how does that bode for other crypto companies that are potentially considering because I, I assume that it's, it's very possible Gemini or someone like them is next in line, and so we'll see what the demand there versus how isolated was this just to crazy stable coin demand, which is possible.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean how many, we are 6 months into the Trump presidency.\nSo like Coinbase went public 2021, really before the Biden, um, SEC crackdown on crypto.\nSo they just got in right before that gate shut, and then we had just, you know, four dark years, and now, you know, Trump comes in, uh, opens up the gate, people start to go public, and now, now there's like kind of a lineup, right?\nSo, uh, MicroStrategy also was able to finagle their way into like becoming a Bitcoin acquisition company because they were already public, but now like Joseph Lubin and ESP, and like there's another Ethereum acquisition vehicle company, and now there's like Bitcoin copycats, and it's like soul strategies, uh, and now there's also Circle and then, um, Gemini and Kraken and Anchorage, and I don't know, Chain Analysis, they all want to go public.\nSo there's a growing number of ways to get crypto exposure or potentially soon, uh, by maybe by the end of this year, early next year, there will be like a pretty like rich number of ways to get exposure to crypto in TradFi and without even like having to actually to go into the crypto industry, which is, which is kind of interesting.\nI'm curious as to like how that market equilibriates when there's a variety of different ways to get exposure.\nAgain, even in addition to the ETFs, too.\nUm, and you don't even have to like join the industry.\nYou can all just do it from like Robin Hood or your brokerage, whatever.\nYou had me curious, like obviously we all know Circle and Tether, the two biggest, or USDC and Tether, the two biggest coins.\nLike, okay, like what is the third biggest stable?\nIs is there another stable coin IPO on the horizon that we could like even like realistically look towards, and there's basically nothing.\nLike there's market caps.\nYeah, there's market the market cap for Tether and USDC are 150 billion to 60 billion.\nThe next biggest, which is Athena's USD, is 6 billion.\nSo like the falloff is a 10x below USDC, and then like then it's die, sky dollar, BlackRock builder, then even like World Liberty Financials, like US dollar or whatever the hell it is.\nPaxos.\nPaxos is like a stable coin whitelister.\nSo it's not going to have infrastructure.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut like it's not going to command any sort of like premium that Circle did.\nOkay.\nSo question for you guys.\nUh, two like $160 billion dollars of stable coins on Ethereum and ETHBTC is like, you know, I, I have seen, uh, uh, tribally indifferent profit maxis be posting about the ETH BTC ratio.\nLike it's been flat for three months for the first time in two years.\nStable coins dominantly on Ethereum.\nWe know this.\nUh, but then also Bitcoin dominance is just creeping up and up and up and up.\nI put out this tweet which for some reason like triggered a bunch of people.\nUh, max pain is 75% Bitcoin dominance and no altcoin season.\nAnd for the record, we are at 64% Bitcoin dominance.\nGoing from 64% to 75% is a big move.\nUh, it's like a much larger move than going from like 40% to 50% because that, you know, as there's less, as there's more Bitcoin dominance, it's harder to become even more dominant.\nSo, uh, there's a lot of people like interpreting this tweet differently, but like for some reason, I feel like there's some horseshoe phenomenon where there you have like stable coins on one side and Bitcoin on the other.\nAnd when stable coin growth is big, it validates, it goes all the way back around and it validates Bitcoin.\nAnd then like the Ethereum, the pro Ethereum side of things, it's like, well, no, Ethereum is the stable coin blockchain.\nThere's $160 billion dollars of stable coins on Ethereum.\nUh, Brad, what do you think?\nI, I hate that I keep like going back to this, like ETH technology can be great for stable coins.\nIt doesn't necessarily mean ETH the asset goes up.\nLike that's the problem.\nThat's the problem.\nLike there's, there's structural stuff in place that like the SCOP Bitcoin bulls can, like people are just going to buy it cuz because you always think there's going to be a next buyer, right?\nYou always think the next buyer is the nation state or it's the government or it's the whatever, someone on a treasury, like it gives everyone confidence to buy this thing because you can peg the next buyer on that thing, where it's like ETH is delivering all these technical properties that are [ __ ] awesome for stable coins, right?\nLike it's great, I want to have my assets there, it's credibly neutral, it's decentralized, but like I don't need to have ETH the asset in order to like not in size in order to have my stable coins be settled to and transferred in and denominated in, uh, on Ethereum mainet.\nIt's like without high velocity there and like bring execution back to it.\nLike I think that is the, the unfortunate truth is like I can say, yeah, stable, stable coins are on Ethereum, that's [ __ ] great.\nLike they belong there.\nEthereum is awesome.\nDoesn't necessarily mean their asset has to go up.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThere's a difference between like a stablecoin exchange and a stablecoin vault.\nAnd Ethereum I think is a very big stablecoin vault.\nUh, and I don't, I don't know how much like DEX stablecoin dex volumes there are.\nI mean there, there are definitely an ample supply, but enough to generate fees.\nJohn, what do you think?\nThe perfect test case.\nIt's, it's kind of funny.\nI mean, we, we, we just debated, uh, Ryan Burkman's had actually tweeted out, um, pulling out the tweet.\nIt was what was it a couple days ago of Tether makes billions a year on their ETH business, but their BTC Maxis and Alt L1 launchers.\nMeanwhile, ETH's on track to become a multi-trillion dollar asset without a Tether bid.\nUm, let's see if Tether ends up foaming ETH when they see BTC is the first but not the only special snowflake.\nUm, to which I replied, or they're the perfect example of why Ethereum providing value does not equal ETH capturing value.\nUm, Tether is the quintessential example of they have built a gigantic profitable business which in large part does use Ethereum with a bunch of Tether there.\nThey use the chain obviously very, very heavily.\nUm, and you can go Jack Pal's tweets and you know what is Tether holding?\nIt's, it's Bitcoin and gold.\nUm, and so it is that still very barbell of, hey, we, we can use the chain, but still kind of just be Bitcoin maxis.\nUm, and so where does that go in the future?\nUm, if there's increasingly even more stable coin issuance on Ethereum, is that positive for Ethereum enough?\nUm, my people debate this one all the time, like how positive it is for your chain if there's a bunch of RWA on there.\nMy gut is it's, it's still positive.\nUm, it's just that we do have to realize that there is a difference in value acrruel between, hey, someone puts, uh, hundred billion dollars or whatever, some crazy number of t bills dollars, whatever, that's sitting on this chain, it's, but it's it really is just idle capital that's not moving, maybe a sex has it offchain or whatever, this is just, you know, a money market fund that someone has a bunch of money just sitting there, and the offchain issuer is just clipping all the money, versus we have a bunch of money on chain that's high velocity capital and is being traded a lot, is actively producing a lot of fees.\nThose, those are obviously qualitatively different, um, and do have quantitative results on, you know, what, what is the value capture for the base asset, um, and so Ethereum is more in that former camp of a lot of the capital there is, it's winning in the size of capital, and it's not currently winning in a lot of the velocity of capital metrics, things like trading volume and a lot of user metrics, and so it's definitely still positive in my mind to be winning the institutional capital and a lot of big money going there, but it's, it's definitely not a one-to-one comparison, um, and so looking at it simplistically, I think just doesn't hold up.\nObviously, I ju, I just like, I hate that like everyone's tying winning or like success to just like raw dollars.\nLike the, the price going up.\nLike that's what's like, that's the, the fight everyone's having, right?\nIt's like it, it's doing great.\nLike it's service, like it's doing all of these things.\nIt's servicing its purpose.\nLike it has this crypto ethos.\nLike it's doing all of that.\nBut everyone views it as a failure because price isn't going up, and like unless my bags are going up, like this thing sucks, right?\nLike, and like that's, that's not really the case.\nMaybe, maybe there's an acceptance where it's just like, and like I've talked about like the compression lower of like all these infrastructure plays, like you know what, maybe all these things will serve their purpose and like facilitate app growth, and like all of them will kind of just like sit where they are.\nThey don't all have to go up infinitely for this to be a successful thing, and like if that's a like the future of this world, like maybe that's just how it's going to play out.\nI think there's like two common trains of thought which will put you in two different conclusions depending on which one you are.\nThere, there's one that is like, okay, in one to two years, there's going to be 10x as much real world assets tokenized on Ethereum as there are today, and uh, then like the the ETH bull will say, and just by proxy of that, ETH will be bullish, just by association, just like at some point BlackRock is going to have so much uh, assets under management on Ethereum that they're just going to want ETH by proxy of that, and people in their orbit will also just want ETH by proxy of that, you know, how much demand does that create?\nUncertain.\nUh, maybe not a whole lot, but like still like 10xing V World assets on Ethereum is going to, you know, have a huge halo effect around the Ethereum brand and Ether, the asset.\nAnd that's bullish, and like I think that's somewhat true.\nI agree with that.\nI think that's mostly true.\nUh, and then there's like I'll like the John Charos, which is like show me the mechanism for how it captures value, and if it's not there, then I'm buying Bitcoin.\nAnd I kind of understand that too.\nLike the one's like a\n\n\nA little bit of a narrative play.\nIt's a little bit looser.\nIt's a little bit more about belief about the network and the growth of the network.\nUh, and then the other one's a little bit, no, like, no, show me, show me the burn.\nShow me the value accrual.\nI want to see the burn.\nUh, and it's like, you, I, I also, I see that one, I see that one as well.\nYeah.\nBoth are going to happen.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBoth are going to happen.\nBoth are going to happen.\nWhat do you think about this tweet from D's?\nD's, I consider a good faith, uh, profit maxi, tribally indifferent, uh, trader who's in it for the vibes.\nUh, he's tweeting out the ETH BTC ratio, and he just goes underwater beach ball.\nUh, what do you, Jon, when you see the tweet?\nWhat do you, what do you see?\nUh, the, the chart looks good to me as someone who doesn't understand charts at all.\nI, I remember the last time someone asked me on a panel, like, what, what do you do for technical analysis or whatever?\nI don't, I have never drawn a line on a chart in my life, and I do not intend to draw a line on a chart.\nNot what I do.\nYeah.\nSo, like, I hate that I can draw lines on charts and it makes me feel smart.\nLike, I can, I can do it.\nI was like, \"Hey, that actually did.\"\nI do feel smart when I draw lines on cards.\nIt actually did bounce whenever I drew this thing.\nAm I good?\nUh, I think part of it is like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nUh, I, I don't ascribe any of that stuff here.\nLike, just because the lines there doesn't mean [ __ ], right?\nIt's all, it's all like backwards looking to where, like, oh, it invalidated the line, therefore my entire thesis changed.\nI no longer give, think it's a beach ball under water.\nI think this thing's going to this crater, the center of earth, right?\nSo, it's like, it's always going to do that.\nSo, he's trying to be a little predictive here.\nUh, but yeah, I, I also still just agree that, like, you need structural [ __ ].\nLike, you will have the splash on stuff that you're talking about, and but you, like, it's all about conviction that you can instill in people.\nLike, that's all it is.\nYou need to instill conviction in people like Jon, right?\nWho, like, he needs to see material things, and you need to instill like conviction in people who are just like all vibe space and like, yeah, man, it feels good, like, everyone's having a great time on the chain, like, I'm going to buy it, cuz all my homies are buying it, like, so you need to service all of these things.\nIt's just the, the Jon's of the world, and like, I'm starting to get into this camp.\nIt was just like, I need to see, I need to see more of, of like, structural stuff in place of value accrual, and it's just, it's just not there.\nThe one thing I am getting starting to get a little bit pled on, and I even wrote about it, I think today in the response to the the debate thing, is like, we're talking about these nation states, what, like, if they, if everyone's going to come on chain, right?\nWe have all these ruas, like, everyone's starting to put more and more money on chain, like, Ethereum is like the place that most people would trust their, their a large amount of assets to be okay.\nCool, like, if you take that a little bit further and say, like, well, smart contracts on Ethereum still aren't like totally trustless, and like, in an adversarial environment, like, I don't want someone, I don't want Tether or Circle to be able to unilaterally freeze my [ __ ].\nSo, it's like, if I, if I have to accumulate ETH, and I want to, like, I want to put assets on chain, or if I have to accum, if I have to accumulate assets on chain, money on chain, I'm gonna accumulate ETH because it's the only thing that, like, is truly like credibly neutral, permissionless, pristine, as Justin would like to say.\nIt's like, it's the thing that no one has control over.\nAnd I, I do appreciate that outside of, like, maybe changing some inflation numbers periodically, but that's few and far between that, like, that, that gives the scaries to some people.\nBut, generally bullish, not bearish.\nYeah, those changes.\nYeah, I point it out.\nI would agree.\nYeah, I would agree.\nLike, minimal inflation relative to the entire market.\nSo, like, so then, like, the next question is, okay, what is, what do we think the global appetite for something like that is going to be on the long run, right?\nIf we think everyone's going to bring their assets on chain, we're talking 10 trillion, tens of trillions of dollars potentially.\nOkay, like, if you want to do that in an adversarial environment, are they going to accumulate ETH to sit there and hold on to it because that is the one asset across all of these chains that is like the best place to just like store your value, right?\nWhatever to, like, not, not have to worry about third party risk or counterparty risk, maybe.\nUm, but is that enough to pump the price to Vala?\nI don't know.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI do think in the future when, like, central banks are counterparties to each other, that will be done on Ethereum, like, without negotiation, right?\nLike, if, if, if North Korea wants to do, do a deal with, like, you guys, like, look, man, like, they spin up a smart contract.\nIt's publicly viewable.\nIt's like, I don't want, I don't want anyone to be able to intercept this [ __ ].\nThey're going to probably do it on Ethereum.\nLike, that's, that is the place where that entity has to do that thing for, like, some high stakes [ __ ].\nIt's going to take, like, it's probably going to take place on Ethereum mainnet.\nNot going to do it on Base, right?\nBase is going to rug me and it's going to steal all my [ __ ].\nIt's not going to happen on, on Bitcoin.\nIt can't even [ __ ] do the thing.\nIt's not programmable.\nOkay.\nIt's not going to be Solana because of whatever reason, right?\nSo, like, now the question is, like, how much value is that?\nRight?\nI don't, that's, that's the question.\nLet's talk about hype really quick.\nGot the hype chart.\nWe hit, uh, $42 with hype, which is, I believe, an all-time high.\nI was talking to a, uh, crypto Twitter legend, uh, who will remain unnamed, but they said, um, there are, they're bearish Soul because of how well Hype is doing.\nUh, what do you think about that line?\nBearish Solana because how, how good, uh, Hyperliquid is doing.\nJon, what do you think?\nSo, I mean, just disclosure, I've said this a bunch of times before, but we, we own both.\nWe, we own both Hype and Soul.\nUm, I, I, I think it's fair to say that Soul is definitely starting to see at least the early stage difficulties that ETH has had over the past few years, which is, I mean, the, the largest part of it is, it's really hard to move an asset that's hundred billion plus.\nIt takes a lot of, you really got to show me something, um, to convince me, hey, there's a lot of upside left on this thing.\nAnd so, I mean, very simply, looking at Soul and Hype, I mean, what are the metrics that you can look at?\nObviously, one of them is just like fees generated in some form.\nThey're both like pretty comparable right now.\nUm, so Soul's been running a bit ahead their rev relative to, like, hype fees, really.\nSolana, uh, is generating as much fees as Hyperliquid is.\nYeah, they're, they're in roughly the same ballpark.\nI think the ballpark has usually been that Soul is generating rev of, like, closer to actually a billion dollars annualized.\nWow.\nUm, possibly a little bit more.\nAnd Hyper, I thought Hyperliquid would be running circles around them.\nOh, no, no, no, no.\nYeah.\nNo, Hyperliquid is still behind Soul on, like, actual, uh, fees to the chain.\nUm, and then Hyperliquid is in the ballpark.\nIt's usually been in the 600 to 700 million annualized.\nObviously, these numbers fluctuate up at times.\nSoul has been much higher, especially, but that's ballpark.\nI believe where they are right now is Hyperliquid somewhere in the ballpark of, like, 600, 700 million, um, annualized, and then Solana is, like, closer to a billion dollars of rev.\nUh, Solana Rev was 1.4 bill last year.\nYeah.\nWow.\nLike, that sounds right.\nYeah.\nSo, it's, it's in the same ballpark, but Soul is, like, definitely higher.\nUm, and the, the, the other part that's notable on that, and this gets into the, you know, apps versus platforms point, is if you look at what people are paying to Hyperliquid, it's not the Hyper EVM that's generating still at this point, even though people are talking about it, effectively a dimminimous amount of fees, certainly relative to hyper core.\nUm, the vast majority of this is at the app level.\nThat is what people are paying for.\nUm, versus on Soul, obviously, these are platform level fees, this is rev, and on Solana, where is most of the money going?\nIt's going to platforms like Pump, it's going to Axium, it's going at the app layer.\nSo, there's certainly a lot more economic activity that's happening on Soul.\nIt's just this, this, this Soul versus Hype is very emblematic of the current big meta question of platforms versus applications on on top of them.\nWhat is actually going to be the revenue generator going forward?\nWhat is sticky?\nWhat really owns the user?\nUm, so that it's, it's very much a bet on that kind of split.\nUm, and we, I mean, even in Solana, I mean, this is why we've also been investing increasingly at the application layer, not just at the protocol layer as well, because that is where I think a lot of the stickiness is, and a lot of users are going to gravitate there.\nSo, part of it is that of just, you know, do you build a first party application versus a totally general, general purpose platform?\nUm, and then the other part of it is just sheer size.\nYou know, Soul has hit 100 plus billion.\nAnd so people very naturally start looking for, okay, what, what's the next trade?\nWhat's the next Solana?\nUm, people always want to hit, you know, what, what was the next Ethereum after Ethereum, you know, went at $80, that was solid at.\nPeople are saying, okay, what, what, what's the next?\nLike, you got to hit the next one.\nUm, and so people kind of, like, are naturally always looking for that.\nHype is in a relatively good position for people just, like, psychologically want that kind of trade.\nUm, and these are two of just the big applications and platforms in crypto that just currently are successful and people are using a lot.\nUm, so Hyperliquid right now is at $40 billion versus Solana is $95 billion.\nSo, obviously, still a gap, but not that large of a gap.\nAnd so I think the universal question that I'll ask as a representative of the hype sidelined tribe is, is it too late to buy hype at $41, at $35 billion, cuz, like, that doesn't make me feel good.\nLike, I feel like I'm just top blasting everyone's, like, you know, $10 purchase that they bought during, like, the, the tariff scare.\nIt depends on what you think the, the general growth is going, like, the Yes.\nJon is doing great at comparing, like, what is going on with Hyperliquid feed generation versus the Rev of Solana, but, like, Rev was created as, like, a proxy to try to figure out demand for, for the actual block space on Solana, and then, like, to try to, like, determine, okay, there's, what's the value accrual here, right?\nThere's, there's clearly a bunch of activity going on on the chain.\nHow much of that is going back to, to the native asset Solana?\nLike, do you apply a multiple to that?\nLike, you know, all of this stuff, whereas, like, 100% of the [ __ ] that's being generated on hype is, like, I think it's 97% of the, the actual fees are going to hype buyback, and that's instilling a lot of conviction, and then, like, you think about a dollar generated by hype revenue is worth, like, I don't know, 5, 10x more than a dollar worth generated by Solana revenue because it just goes straight back to hype buybacks.\nYeah, cuz some of that goes to, like, what we're going to have the Pump ICO soon, like, so, like, some of that's going to be going to the Pump token eventually, I'm assuming, has some component, like, some of it goes to Geto, some of it goes to, like, the, the Photon, you know, trading bot, so, like, it gets dispersed amongst a bunch of things, whereas, because Hype has created the, the tier one application, right?\nThe native app, like, basically all those fees go directly to just buying hype the token, right?\nSo, and then now it's kind of becoming a cult thing where, like, a lot of the actual applications being spun up on the, the hyper course or the hyper, hyper EVM side are kind of doing a similar thing.\nIt's kind of like an honorary burn.\nI don't know how long that'll last because everyone's just going to profit max.\nUm, but, you know, that's it's kind of a thing.\nSo, you know, I was top lasting the whole last, like, I don't know, 3 weeks.\nSo, I, I bought from, like, 26 up to, like, 36, um, over the last few weeks.\nSo, I anticipated going a little bit higher.\nIf you think it's going to continue to grow its moat.\nThey're talking about, like, now, uh, a bunch of other, uh, a bunch of other DeFi, or not D5, but blockchain native applications are buying tickers and trying to do their launch on hype specifically as opposed to, uh, doing it through centralized exchanges.\nThey're talking about, you know, doing, uh, unit to bring on much more assets.\nThey're talking about HIP 3 is the big thing that everyone's, uh, um, discussing lately because it allows more and more, uh, units, or not units, more and more assets to be brought on chain to be traded.\nSo, like, if you think it'll continue to grow just by, um, it being the virtue of it being a good product and people wanting exposure to hype, then, like, yeah, you can expect more revenues.\nWe should expect more bullishness, which expect price to go up a little bit more.\nAt least that's, that's my thesis.\nI generally don't have a very strong opinion usually on value distribution mechanisms.\nI, I think in most cases, it doesn't make a tremendous difference whether you're taking in fees from users and using it to buy back and burn the token versus distribute it directly to stakers.\nI think there's a meaningful difference if you're redeploying it for growth.\nYou know, if you're taking those funds aside and using it to grow the protocol, but if you're returning it to shareholders in some form, whether it's a buyback or staking, I, I don't think there's actually a tremendous difference.\nIt's just a company doing dividends versus buybacks.\nIt's not, it's not a huge difference to me.\nUm, I, I think the bigger difference when you're evaluating platforms versus application level fees, um, and this is something we've swayed back and forth on.\n\n\nUm, Bread is, I think, the more important point to me is the, depending on what type of activity you're using to generate um these fees, revenue, you may take a different view on how sticky those are, um, and how much headroom they have to grow. And so you would apply potentially different multiples on them. Um, simple classic example would be, you know, if you looked at Ethereum fees back from a few years ago where it was generating, I mean, the annualized run rate was something crazy. It was like $20 billion a year. Um, but where was all of that coming from? It was just a [ __ ] ton of congestion fees. It was super, super high base fees. You know, people were just like paying $500 to get a UNISWAP trade done. Like, obviously, that is not sustainable activity that you, like, you could project forward in any reasonable way whatsoever. That's like, obviously, going to go away at some point. Um, versus, I would say, there's a higher degree of sustainability, um, to a general purpose platform where, you know, users are paying right now a fair amount of priority fees in MV, and this is where uh, Solana value primarily is right now, compared to ETH. The base fees are dimminimous, effectively, um, and there's a meaningful amount of priority fees in MV. So I would say that's generally a stickier source of revenue compared to high base fees. It's, I would say, it's a little bit more durable going forward, but at the same time, apps are trying to eat into that margin, too. Um, and if there is too high a margin on priority fees in MV, well, then they'll leave and go make their own chain if they're not able to internalize it on your chain. So, even that's not perfect. Um, and then I think generally the stickiest thing is going to be if you just have a killer application that people love to use. Um, and there is a big market for that to grow into, you will put a different valuation multiple on something that has, um, revenue that you might assess to be a lot stickier, a lot more durable, and a lot more headroom to grow. Um, so that that does make a difference in what type of platform you're looking at. You know, what what is the quality of this revenue that you're actually getting, and you know, how can I forecast that forward? Um, so that that end up does end up looking pretty different on a platform versus an application level. Imagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language.

This first one is Hyperlid's market share around uh D5 per so DEX pers. Uh, it's already at 78% market share in the DAX landscape. Going from 78 to 88% is like pretty hard, and then also you're only growing that much more. Like, so like to growth is tapped out on death dex per. So like where does Hyperlid even go from here? Like how does it get any bigger than this when it's already at like 80% of market share, and like congrats, you've won when like your number two competitor is other, like it's just the other category. Like you, you just won, you just won dexes, but like you're also, you're also done. Like there's there's no more market share for you to go to. That's the bearish case for Hyperliquid. The bullish case is looking at Hyperlid versus Binance Per volumes where um, weekly Hyperlid volume, I think, has peaked out at 11% versus Binance is 88%. Hopefully this uh June dashboard is correct. Uh, but if you just look at Hyperlid versus Binance being like, well, it's only got 11% of Binance's market share, that's a whole lot of fees left on the table. It could just, if it goes 50/50% versus Binance, it's gonna 3x its fees, and all of a sudden that 40 uh billion dollars to Solana's $95 billion does look pretty like justifiable. But I think it's really a function of just like how well can Hyperlid get Binance traders to migrate over to Hyperlid, and why haven't they, why haven't they already, like, why haven't they by now? I don't really, I'm not a per trader, so I don't really know. I don't know if you guys, either of you, have any like information here. Yeah. So the difference or the edge that that we had at Mega that like is encroaching specifically on what Hyperlid is maybe losing to some of these centralized exchanges is that the centralized exchanges are just like, they're more performant, right? They don't have blockchain backends, they don't have to deal with latency, they don't have to deal with block times, so they're very, very performant. And the the most is a uh downstream of like needing consensus, right? Takes time to actually like agree on something, which then makes it then true. Like they do some stuff to to get around that, but for us, like if you have, or this is L2's broadly, if you have a chain that has a centraliz or a predictable block builder, right? Then you can collo colllocate next to this thing. Then you can start to encroach on some of these performance numbers that uh that centralized exchanges actually can can tout, right? So like this is this is uh uh like a comparison against GTE, which is our one of our uh applications building on on Meg. Like they're working specifically with market makers so that they can colllocate next to our sequencer so that, you know, the latency round trip for them to actually execute this stuff on chain, if it's cheap enough, is, you know, in singledigit milliseconds, right? And because you can afford that stuff, or because you can, you can uh get some predictable outcomes from from the construction. So like if volume is the metric that just says like these are the things we want to capture, and we want to bring that stuff onchain, uh, this this is a vertical that we're actually trying to push for because Hyperlid may not ever be able to approach on that because yeah, they have, they have a distributed validator set as an L1, right? If you're doing that, then you necessarily can have a little bit of delay for for achieving consensus. So, um, you know, will they ever be able to eat into GT, because of that that fallback, we, or not GT, but for uh, uh, Binance, because of that that latency fallback? Who knows? But that's the that's the vertical that they're they're pushing for. So what you're saying is this gap between the like 75% market share that Hyperlid has on the DEX side of things versus the like 9% market share that has versus Binance. That gap is the latency of the the iPhone market. Yeah. It's just saying like, like, like this is volumes, right? Volumes are going to be mostly dictated by these very large players that are doing high frequency trading, trading, you know, tens to hundreds of millions of dollars pretty consistently. And they do that stuff because there's some properties that they can count on. Whether it's it's not too expensive for them to execute the the order. They can get rid of toxic flow. They they have latency expectations for like interacting with the thing that is actually taking the order. Uh, and it's like, will they ever leave the confines of a centralized exchange that can say, look, bro, you can get your order on chain for free, or not on chain, but you can get your order in the order book on chain, or [ __ ] I keep saying on the order book, uh, in single digit milliseconds for free. Like, will they ever leave that environment to go to a public uh uh uh ecosystem like Hyperliquid that it costs money to put your order on? You have to deal with toxic flow for ordering, like, like, will they ever opt into that? Maybe not, because the performance is not going to actually really be able to keep up on the latency side with um with a centralized counterpart. But like maybe the middle ground becomes a construction like an L2 where you these market makers can colllocate next to a sequencer, which is the block builder, doesn't have consensus, so you don't have to worry about the delayed block time. It's much more predictable environment. Well, I'm going to agree with half and then disagree with half. Um, I I I agree the half that matters is the centralized exchange side. Um, I I I don't agree that latency is actually the determining factor here or the reason why users or market makers are primarily on these exchanges. Um, I I think the the very direct risk to Hyperliquid is primarily that, for example, uh, you can imagine per getting legalized within the US and having a regulatory framework around that in the short to medium term. Like, there's clearly regulatory and institutional interest in that happening. Um, and then the question is, okay, Robin Hood and Coinbase have per now. What do you use? Um, do you use Hyperliquid or do you use Coinbase? Um, I, I, as a US citizen, do not use Hyperlid. Um, but if I were to hypothetically use a per platform in the United States in New York, um, I, I would probably have to use one that does not KYC and take my documents in the way that Binance does. So you, you could imagine some of those users may be using Hyperlid now, but they might go use Coinbase or Robin Hood, um, should that option present itself to them. Um, I, I don't think that's a latency consideration to them. I, I think that's just the fact that they own the user and they're a good product, and I, I trust them with my funds. Um, and and empirically, I mean, most users are getting their face ripped off when they trade on Coinbase and Robin Hood. Uh, like that they're not paying these cheap fees for best execution. Um, and market makers are increasingly, to my understanding. I mean, the big market makers really are on Hyperliquid, and it is quite profitable flow. Um, and it's not entirely clear to me that reducing latency further, based on where they are, is actually going to meaningfully improve execution. Um, particularly within the fast batch fast batches where they do have prioritized um and free cancels, um, which does help the market makers a lot. Um, so my understanding is like that they are trading there now, all, all most of the meaningful ones, and they are doing well, and users obviously love it. Um, the the bigger issue to me is the regulatory clarity that comes around perks. Um, and then you assume that all the major players who are currently being held back right now, do they come in and squish the market? Does Coinbase come in? Does Robin Hood come in? And do they win the market now that that is the best available option to most users? Um, does Hyperliquid still have a product market fit after that? Do we have a regulatory event with Hyper in the future? Do you think? Obviously, you just called out like the KYC, like not being a requirement for company to operate on J. I mean, this is a risk to them existing right now is that the there is very unclear regulatory clarity for, I mean, pretty much all decentralized uh DeFi protocols, but I mean, especially someone like Hyperlid, um, that obviously is not KYCing and is a is a somewhat decentralized network, but this is all the stuff that gets into like the market structure bill, too, of and a lot of the legislation and that and that regulators are thinking of is what is a sufficiently decentralized or sufficiently mature network, like what, what exactly is your definition of that, um, that allows you to operate differently than a centralized counterparty. Um, and that's all TBD still. So, yeah, it's it's certainly a risk for them. It strikes me as like a tether versus Circle debate with how their approach to the market where, like, everyone has funded hyperl specifically of like, oh, unregulated exchange, you're doing all this stuff, and there's no KYC, you're going to get FUDED, which is like, that's what's been pushed back against Tether for the longest time. It's like, oh my god, they, like, they don't have any, like, audits, you can't tell who's doing what. Like there, like, there's just a lot of opakqueness to the actual system itself, but it, like, because it just, like, asked for forgiveness as opposed to permission, it got an incredible amount of network effects and like, like, like it's all throughout the ecosystem now. I wonder if it might be similar with hyperl, like they, like, yeah, it's probably not like the best way to go about this thing if you're doing it by the book, but like they've undoubtedly, uh, like we're like 75% market share, right? I think it's crazy. Like, if, if they continue to go down that path, does it get to a point where it's just like, &quot;All right, we'll ask for forgiveness, pay some dollars, and then we're, we're on our way.&quot; I don't know if that's the right comparison. Um, the, I think the better comparison, because Tether didn't, hasn't done anything illegal. Like, there's nothing wrong about like Tether's business. Like, you can call it shady and opaque, but I don't\n\n\nI know if there's any pointing of fingers of anything actually illegal being done there. I think the much better comparison for Hyperliquid is BitMEX, which did get in trouble for violating the Bank Secrecy Act and not KYCing their users and being, uh, just like, laissez-faire about users on their exchange, and they were an absolutely centralized exchange. And, like, again, all the laws that pointed towards BitMEX being illegal, I don't necessarily respect myself. I think those are bad laws that should go away. Uh, but those would be the same laws that would be pointed to Hyperliquid. And so I'm not sure that the Tether versus Hyperliquid comparison is apt. Yeah. I think it's more just like, like having a dollar backing every dollar on chain kind of situation where, like, everyone always questions of, like, if you're going to be doing this thing, this is how you should be doing it. If they claim that they're, there's someone that has a dollar for every dollar, but they have not done any proof of reserves up to this point. Like, that was always the FUD that I had always seen. It's just like, look, they just, they, like, the bot would go off on X where you'd see, like, oh, Tether just printed a hundred gajillion dollars, and it's just like, did you just get 100, like, do you actually have that money or trillion dollars printed at the Tether Treasury? Yeah. So, like, you would see that stuff, and, like, like, is that, like, illegal? Like, like, I don't know what their claims are, like, what, like, all the regulations are, but, like, it's the same tactic in my opinion. Something that's kind of like, okay, like, we're starting to get into a territory that's whatever, but it's undoubtedly been good for their network effects. Let's get into the last topic of the week. PumpFun planning a 1 billion token sale coming in a $4 billion valuation. So, this is a combination of an airdrop that I think has been more or less confirmed along with a billion dollars of sales from private investors and then also sales on exchanges to, like, retail investors. I think at an ICO. I'm actually a little bit fuzzy on the mechanism, but this is the news that went around the, the shot heard around the ecosystem. I think that the reactions to this have been mixed. This is obviously very pricey. Uh, so the individuals who are able to get in into this PumpFun sale are coming in at a $4 billion valuation. So it's already priced in pretty well. Growth is already pretty priced in. But otherwise, like, the exciting thing is that a PumpFun token is confirmed and then a PumpFun airdrop is, like, all but confirmed. Uh, and so it's a pretty big moment for this ecosystem. And then there are different takes, of course, as you would imagine. Some people are pointing at this being bullish. Some people are pointing at this being, like, well, this is the end. This is the top. Uh, and then also other people are saying, like, why do they need $1 billion for, um, that, which is all, which are a whole other thing. I think the one thing of note is, um, PumpFun is going for a, like, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with some very big web2 gargantuans, like Twitch, and it's going to try and be, like, a creator streaming platform, uh, that just has a token, uh, aside with it as well. Well, as, like, presented front and center, but it's interesting to see PumpFun, the, the long-term, the endgame for PumpFun trying to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with a streaming platform, uh, which is interesting because they're really leaning into, like, the creator economy side of things. Uh, Jon, what's your take when you saw this? The immediate reaction, uh, for myself, which was mostly a counter reaction to when people were on X, uh, I, I, I saw a lot of the stories at first were quite a lot of the reactions to first were quite funny, saying this is extractive of, oh, they've been extracting for the past year or two, and now this is their What do they need $1 billion for after they made $700 million in cumulative revenue? Like, that, that was a big reaction. Yeah, it was just quite funny to me of crypto is the most, you know, we're supposed to be free markets people in the world, and then they will call it extraction unironically when you have the most successful consumer app in crypto, which users pay willingly to use, um, pay them money, and then they also sell a share in this profitable, uh, protocol, um, openly at a price that, like, anyone can participate or not participate in, and that's extractive. Um, so I, I, I don't think it's extractive. Um, I, I understand that obviously a lot of people don't like memecoins. I mean, my view on this has been very consistent for a very long time of I think people just really overintellectualize the hell out of memecoins. I don't think they're that complicated. They're fun. They're mostly a new form of gambling. Just like, be direct about that. That's cool. Um, casinos are a real market in the real world. I mean, this is effectively the, I mean, a native onchain casino as it stands right now. I mean, obviously also hopefully this progresses into more real productive assets and stuff like that over time, but memecoins right now, and that that has product market fit, love it or hate it, like, this isn't, this is a protocol that has had serious product market fit over the last year, has generated a ton of money. Um, and, like, actually makes sense. Um, and so just, I mean, like, it, it's, it's emblematic of that trend that we were talking about before again of, you know, what, what are the interesting areas in crypto of, you know, this progression from fat protocol thesis to fat application thesis. Obviously, Solana and PumpFun are right in the middle of that, of that has been the hot chain, and this has been the hot application for the past year or so. Um, and where it's, it's similar to Hyperliquid where I think it's running at a comparable revenue, uh, run rate to Hyperliquid over the past year, like, quite consistently again of I think they generated something like $700 million over the past year. Um, which is ballpark about, like, half of what Solana has been doing. Um, so I mean, obviously anyone can do their own, like, look at the asset themselves, like, every, everyone free to make their own interpretation. Um, but it, it's, it's not hard to see why people are, like, looking at PumpFun and interested in it as one of the very few incredibly successful applications that we have seen in crypto. Um, that has a lot of product market fit right now. Um, and yeah, to that point of that, you know, going on and competing against a lot of web2 incumbents. You can imagine that's where a lot of capital needs would come from. It is not cheap to go take on, you know, Twitch and Binance at the same time. You, you know, you can go look at what are the top streamer contracts. You can go look them up online. Like, they're gigantic. Um, and they're very much aggressively going after this blend of this inevitable collision course between social and finance that is, like, very, very directly coming, and they are very much right in the center of that, trying to build out this social and streaming platform, really owning the user and then financializing all of that and having the trading infrastructure around that. That's a very big vision. It's a very expensive vision to build out, which they've done a very good job at over the past year. So it's, it's understandable what they could use the funds for. You guys have $100 to allocate at PumpFun at $4 billion or HYPEUSDT at $40 billion. How do you allocate that $100? Oh, all, all into PumpFun. 10x cheaper. All into PumpFun for sure. I don't think, I think HYPEUSDT can do a 2x or 3x.\nKobe was calling for 150 today. Kobe was what? Called for 150 HYPEUSDT. He's like, I think 120 to 150 makes sense, but I don't know when or how it gets there. Kobe's very long HYPEUSDT. Uh, that is a 4x. That's a 4x. And so I think at Kobe's size, like, 4xing is pretty good. Uh, but, like, PumpFun, if I'm, if I've only got $100, like, I'm throwing it on the smallest market cap thing possible, and $4 billion, that seems fine. And a fresh new chart, you know. Jon, what would you do? Uh, no opinion, no investment advice. Everyone, everyone do what they please with their own money. Um, I, I, I think both are great, successful applications. Like, I, I, I understand the investment case that people are making for both of them. I mean, the, the very simple thing that you could do is go, go look at what, what are the big money makers in crypto over the past year or two. Um, it's these two protocols head and shoulders above everyone else at the application level. It's Solana, and then maybe it's, like, Tron, and then you take basically a big leap down at that point, and then you have, like, Ethereum and Sky and a number of these other protocols that are great. But I mean, and even a lot of Solana's revenue came downstream of PumpFun is because of that. If you look at the correlation, if you look back, I've seen people, people, uh, post charts about this. Uh, if you just look at the correlation of, uh, PumpFun fee revenue over time and SOL rev over time, they're very, very highly correlated, which is unsurprising. And so I, I think that's the interesting comparison, too, that a lot of people will make, um, is in many ways, obviously, Solana is, at least at this stage, highly reliant upon a lot of speculative trading, a lot of memecoin activity, um, and in many ways, this is the clearer value expression of, you know, hey, I think that memecoin activity is a real thing. I think that this is a, you know, a actual sustainable application that people like to use. Um, what, what is the right level to express that view? Um, and PumpFun and Solana are obviously the two different layers of that, the application versus the platform layer. I, I think that's a very interesting comparison that you're going to see a lot of people making. Um, and obviously, you've seen a lot of people speculating also over the past few days, you know, hey, is this why SOL is underperforming lately? You know, are people taking that view? Um, very literally, where are people going to get capital from to put this in? You know, you could imagine a portion of that is going to be people who are selling SOL. It's a lot of the same audience. Um, it's, it's this very fat particle thesis to fat application thesis, um, trend that we're starting to play out here where people are getting very interested in the applications that generate a lot of money again. Jon, Brad, it's been another week. Really appreciate you guys coming on and giving your thoughts. I always learn a lot.\nBanklessation. You guys know the deal. Crypto is risky. You can lose what you put in. But nonetheless, we are head west. This is Frontier. It's not for everyone. But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
