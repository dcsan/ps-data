  "cleanText": "Bankless Nation, we have a special episode for you. ETH is catching a bid. These are the 10 most bullish ETH charts. We've got Mike Nadeau on today's episode. He just released the Q2 ETH quarterly report, and we picked out the five most bullish charts. We're going to talk a little bit about them.\n\nMike, how you doing, man? You feeling bullish?\n\nI'm doing great. Feeling good.\n\nRyan, how are you today?\n\nPretty good. I'm looking at this ETH price, uh, 3,255 at the time of recording. Now, this is still well short of all-time high. And I'll also remind folks this is also short of what we hit in December, which was 4,100, I believe, but still there's some momentum going on in Ethereum right now. Uh, do you think some of that can be explained by the fundamentals you're seeing in the Q2 quarter and coming out of that?\n\nI think so. Uh, I hope so. We went through the earnings call yesterday. Today I think, um, just kind of hitting on some of the key points that, you know, we didn't share. We don't share opinion when we do these earnings calls. We want that just to be data only. Um, today we're going to go into, I think, a little more meaning, you know, try to shine a light into what's going on behind the scenes there and, and maybe a little bit, little more of a forward-looking, uh, call as well.\n\nYeah. A few things going on this week, I think, with respect to treasuries that's been really, um, heightened this week. But what we're seeing is ETH going up on days when Bitcoin is actually going down. So that happened a couple of times this week. And I haven't seen that in a very long time, Mike. I, I don't even recall seeing it this cycle. There have been days when Bitcoin was up a little and Ethereum was up a lot more. And those have been few and far between. But I don't think I've seen many days this cycle where Bitcoin one day this week, I think it was maybe, uh, yesterday, Tuesday or Monday, Bitcoin was actually down 2% on the 24-hour, uh, period of time, and, and Ether was up like 4%. That doesn't happen every day. Huge shift. Huge shift there. This is what I've been looking for. You know, I've been, uh, probably pretty early for calling this. I think a lot of people have been, have been early calling this, this kind of shift in the ETH/BTC ratio, but it does feel like we've bottom. We've been at like 5-year lows there. And like you said, like we haven't seen one of those moves where actually Bitcoin was down and ETH was up, you know, four or five% over the last 24 hours. So to me, like this is what I've been waiting for. It does feel like we are at the very early stages of that, that rotation from BTC to ETH and then potentially, you know, a longer, longer tail as well there.\n\nIt's interesting to see that it seems like institutions are leading this or the institutional bid might be leading some of these, um, price increases. I saw this just yesterday. Peter Thiel buying a 9.1, uh, % stake in Tom Lee's ETH Treasury company. So you guys know the, the Tom Lee ticker, BMNR. That's just an ETH treasury basically, and, and Peter Thiel's revealed bought 9% of that. I think some of that is, is driving the momentum here. So, we're going to cover some of the most bullish, uh, this is probably selecting the most bullish or the more bullish charts that came out of your ETH Q2 report. There's some other charts in there that you should absolutely take a look at in order to get the full context for how Ethereum is doing. Some charts with like, you know, revenue down, of course, fees down, DeFi, uh, layer 2 usage up, but this type of thing, what we're going to dive into today are some of the more bullish elements, and it all comes from the ETH Q2 report. You can access the full reports free on the defireport.io. There's also Dune Boards accompanying all of this. And before we dive in, want to give a shout out to the Q2 ETH report sponsor that is Bit Digital. The ticker there is BTBT. It's a public company. They just went all in on Ethereum. They sold their Bitcoin. They used to be a Bitcoin mining company. And they added a $132 million raise. They're holding at the time of recording over a 100,000 ETH right now, which I think positions them at number two or three on the strategic ETH reserve charts as far as Treasury. You guys can learn more about them at bitigital.com.\n\nAll right, Mike, let's get into some of the charts. Uh, let's talk about the institutional adoption story, and I think that's got to start with stable coins. Tom Lee calls, uh, stable coins crypto's chat GBT moment, and he's on CNBC talking about it just about every day. What are you seeing when you look at this chart on Ethereum of stable coin supply? This is our first chart in the ETH bull chart, uh, story we're, we're, we're telling today.\n\nYeah. No, it's been, it's been a breath of fresh air to see Tom Lee on, on CNBC. You know, he's a very well respected in the financial community going on telling the story, talking about stable coins, talking about stable coins as the chat GBT moment for crypto. Um, and so this is, this is a big part of the story I think for Ethereum, and we've got the Genius Bill that, that looks like I was looking at the Polygon odds earlier. I think that's at 95% passage for this year. Um, I think consensus view is that that will pass sometime this, this summer. Um, and so this is to me one of the biggest moments not just for, for like Ethereum, but for crypto, uh, at large. I think everybody's going to understand stable coins. I think anyone who's been in crypto understands the, the power, uh, of stable coins. And this is, this is going to come to the masses. And I've actually been working on a report where we're going to go through some of the impacts of this bill and, and kind of what it can mean for, uh, fintexs. We know like probably every fintech is going to be launching stable coins soon. We know there's going to be impact on the banking sector, and they're probably going to be forced to launch stable coins themselves. Um, and, and you know, there's just, just what this is going to do in terms of, you know, e-commerce payments on the internet, uh, global, you know, financial inclusion. You know, bitcoin was supposed to be the, the vehicle to do that, but I think stable coins are actually the vehicle for, for, um, financial inclusion. I was actually in, uh, Argentina and Buenos Aires for about five week, five, five weeks last year, and, you know, over here in the states, I would say this is not intuitive, like why do we need stable coins? This is not something that's intuitive to people that have bank accounts that live in a economy where there isn't like super high inflation, but everybody uses stable coins, uh, in Argentina, and it's just, it's just intuitive for them to do so. So I think this is a huge, this chart is, is, you know, in a, in a secular growth pattern here. It sort of leveled out a little bit in, in Q2, but, but looking for this chart to really take off potentially after this, this Genius, uh, bill passes.\n\nSo, this chart shows about, uh, ending Q2, 140 million, a billion in stable coin supply on Ethereum. That's, uh, the majority of stable coin supply, and you're expecting that to, uh, to increase as well. On the Genius bill, actually, you know, Trump, Trump has called this crypto week. I think they're, they're hoping to get it passed and pushed through this week. Now, there were some issues, um, you know, in, in Congress earlier, but, uh, with the vote, and I think Trump is working to crow the remaining holdouts in his party to get this across the finish line. So, there's a decent probability that not only does it pass this summer, it actually passes this week. And if that passes, this means more stable coin, uh, more stable coin supply on Ethereum. And like even, I, I, I was looking last night at a headline, uh, Mike U. Jaime Diamond, who's infamously not a crypto supporter. He said even Jamie Diamond is like, even JP Morgan is looking to double down on stable coins. Jamie Diamond, his quote was like, I don't quite understand what people use these things for, but we're going to be there in a big way. It was something like that. So we've already got PayPal, we've got Circle, we've got BlackRock, and of course, you know, uh, cryptonative companies like, like Tether doing this. I think we're going to get all of the big banks to deploy stable coin strategy on the back of the Genius bill as well.\n\nYeah, I, I agree. And, you know, I'm expecting Stripe to, to potentially launch a stable coin here. I just think, you know, when you really look at, at kind of what's, what's coming here and, and through this bill, I think, you know, another piece of this is something that I would love to see is, is payroll. Uh, and, and it's kind of like how do you get everybody to, to get a crypto wallet and start to use this stuff? And I think there has to be some sort of forcing mechanism to do that. And I think payroll is potentially that if you can pay people faster, right? Get away from this weekly or, or, or bi-weekly, monthly payroll. Um, we'll see if, if that comes, you know, within the next year or two or so, but got to get stable coins in everybody's hands, get them moving onchain, and I think, you know, you're going to see some of those, the, the onchain economics for Ethereum really improve. It's got 51% of all stable coins in crypto currently on the L1. The L2s have another 4 to 5%. So around 55% of all stable coins are in the Ethereum ecosystem. So yeah, this is a big, uh, a big moment. We've even seen like Walmart talk about potentially launch, like, so even like major, like retailers are looking at launching stable coins. So huge, huge moment here, this Genius bill. I think when you go back to the last cycle in '21, there was a bill that, that, that made it through the OC, or there was some ruling with the OC related to stable coins. Um, and Ethereum's bull run sort of kicked off at that moment. So potentially, uh, another catalyst here with the Genius Bill.\n\nYeah. And I guess the, the theory is if the institutions are deploying stable coins, maybe they also want to buy ETH as part of their, uh, their deployment strategy on Ethereum. Uh, this is another chart that's showing, um, activity on Ethereum, which is notable. These are active loans on Ethereum and L2s. And this is a, a good-looking chart. It's basically all-time highs. Why is this significant?\n\nThis is significant. It's just showing more trust, more confidence in, in using the, using DeFi within E within Ethereum. We've seen the stake rate is also at all-time highs in terms of the percentage of, of ETHN circulating supply. So to me, this is just showing, um, not only confidence in the protocol itself, but actually like people are, are in the markets. They're, they're looking to get loans. They're looking to access DeFi. Um, there's probably more sort of rehypothecation looping happening. So you just have more, more activity. This to me is a signal that, uh, there's demand for to, to access DeFi and take risk and do things with collateral. And it just sort of showing me that the ecosystem is, is igniting a little bit under the hood. We just got, you know, that that's a nice looking chart. That's really kind of the full picture over the last 5 years or so. And we've just kind of pushed through like the all-time highs from, from last cycle. And, you know, I've got a feeling that Charlotte's going to go much, much higher in this cycle.\n\nWe're up, um, 98% versus prior year on active loans on Ethereum. Another reason I think this is significant is because it dovetails with the treasury strategy. Okay, so all of the billions of dollars and this basically, you know, a three to five-way race for who, which of these, um, publicly traded treasury companies can, can acquire the most ETH, right? And they're not going to stop at a billion. I think what a lot of them are doing is they're actively deploying this ETH as a productive asset inside of Ethereum and inside of the, the wider Ethereum economy, which means we could have a, uh, a DeFi sort of afterboom effect on all of this because thinking about these treasury companies, you're, you're sort of thinking about actively managed ETH funds and where are they going to generate yield? Staking. That's kind of the, the risk-free rate. But then after that it's going to be in some of these lending, uh, and borrowing protocols like the a of the world, for instance. Uh, so I think that that, that's going to be an interesting story to watch. Real world assets onchain. This is another part of the institutional story for Ethereum. Just, uh, almost hockey stick-like growth. A very, very clear ascent line here from last year. We're up 205% on the year in terms of real world assets on Ethereum. What is this showing you?\n\nYeah, another good-looking chart here. Um, it's telling me that, you know, more, more assets want to come on to Ethereum. You know, I think as we go here, the key thing to get this chart to sort of really hockey stick off, we've got 7.5, you know, billion in assets right now. I think that's going to go much, much higher. But to me, it's going to be stable coins and, and, and most likely equities at some point here. We know Robin Hood is, is now building within the ecosystem. And so, you know, just getting more assets on chain is, is the first step. And then getting those things moving, right? So, if you get more real world assets on chain, we just showed the active loans and DeFi, that's, that's more assets, that's more collateral that's going to make it into DeFi as well, people are going to want to sort of create capital efficiency out of, out of that, those assets on chain. And so I think there's just like this reflexive sort of process here where as more assets come on chain, more things go into DeFi, more things, you know, are used as collateral, you get gas fees moving, it impacts the burn, we, you know, the whole thing starts to take off, and, and crypto markets are incredibly reflexive. Sometimes what actually kicks that off is the ETH price itself, right? So ETH price moves, people want to get on chain, there's more people coming on chain, and then all these other fundamentals actually kick off behind that. It's sort of the opposite of how it works in, in like traditional finance. Um, fundamentals usually come first and then the asset moves. So, uh, that's what I'm looking for with just seeing the price action of ETH over the last month or so and then seeing the fundamentals improve on the back end of that. What's, uh, so interesting about real world assets as well is how large, uh, the volume could actually grow in terms of assets on ETH because we\n\n\nAssets are at such a small amount at this point in time. Like, we're celebrating the growth because, you know, it's from, from a, um, an 0% basically all the way to 7 billion right now. But that's just a drop in the ocean of all the real-world assets. When you look at treasuries, when you look at stocks, I mean, this could grow hundreds. This could grow into the hundreds of trillions.\n\nIn the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance.

Visit uniain.org or follow uni chain onx for all the updates.\n\nOkay, so that's ETH usage. We're seeing some institutional adoption there. How about purchase of, um, Ether, the asset? This is chart number four. So, we've been through the first three bull charts here. Chart number four is ETH ETF, um, assets under management. And we've seen some really strong inflows here recently. And we ended the quarter actually with, um, ETH ETF, um, assets under management at all-time highs, didn't we?\n\nWe did. Uh, and that's so that data goes through 6/30 that we're looking right at right there. Just the updated numbers. So, we had 4.1 million ETH, about 3.4% of the supply as of 6/30. That's already up to 3.8% uh, you know, 2 weeks later. Wow.\n\nAnd we're up to 4.6, uh, million ETH, uh, in the ETFs. This is somewhat, I think, of a, just hasn't been talked about so much. I think, you know, the ETH ETF has done, done really well. I've got a few more numbers here just to kind of highlight that. So, so net flows, you know, since inception for the ETFs now 5.7 billion for ETH, um, that's about, that's more than 10% or sorry, more than 20% of what, uh, Bitcoin's done. Bitcoin's got done 50 billion. I think a lot of people were actually sort of bullish on Bitcoin saying it was going to be 5 to 10 billion or so in the in the first year. We're already up to Yeah, blew those records away.\n\nUm, and so, you know, you've got 5.7 billion already for, for ETH.\n\nUm, we've got, we just mentioned 4.6 million in total ETH assets. Uh, if you put that in dollar terms, that's 13 billion in the ETFs. Uh, and we've, like I said, we've had 1.2 billion in, in inflows just in the last few weeks. So, yeah, here's the, here's the net flows chart, and you can see like on the right side there, we're starting to kind of get to those levels that we saw in Q4 of last year. So,\n\num, so ETFs look, looking good. Seems like institutional investors, this is a line that Tom Lee has used of like, um, Ether being the next Bitcoin. He's trying to put that out there to show what's possible. Uh, what if Bitcoin follows something like what, uh, what if Ether follows something like what Bitcoin just did, right? With, uh, respect to the ETF flows. This is, um, a new story that kind of emerged in Q2 but has just continued momentum into Q3 is the amount of ETH held in Treasury. So, am I, I think I'm reading this right. Almost a 6,000% gain.\n\nYes.\n\nUh, in terms of the amount of ETH held in, in treasury. Some of this is, most of this is public treasuries, right? That, that, uh, investors can buy in US capital markets.\n\nCorrect. Correct. Yeah. This is, you know, this is obviously picking up a lot of steam with what Tom Lee's out there. Um, we've got Bit Digital, number two added, I don't know, over 100,000 ETH, sold all their Bitcoin. Um, so this is, this is a very interesting story to me, and I mean, I mean, you've seen Joe Luben on CNBC from Sharp Link, you know, talking about, you know, basically putting a bid, uh, on the token and just the importance of this. Like, I think this is something that people don't talk as much about. But Bitcoin has just done a better job of this with Michael Sailor being out on TV almost every day, on podcasts every day, just telling the story and also going out and buying the asset. And we're seeing, we're seeing that from the Ethereum community now. I think this is, this is, you just can't ignore this. It's like, it's very important, I think, just to see these sort of shifts in, in the market, and we're seeing one right now.\n\nUm, and so, yeah, this is another bullish, bullish indicator for me. I think that the shift is if ETH can cross that chasm into becoming kind of a, a store of value type asset recognized in similar ways that Bitcoin is. That's the, that's the chasm it's trying to cross right now. And it took Bitcoin like over a decade to cross that chasm. And ultimately, it essentially, that was sealed, I feel like, when, when Michael Sailor started buying and convincing all of the rest back in 2020, and so maybe something similar is happening to Ether around here, uh, along these lines, uh, circulating supply. So, what is ETH's issuance policy showing us?\n\nYes. So, yeah, as you mentioned, you know, store of value and, and, and looking at that as, as also a compelling reason to buy the asset, and this is, this plays right into that. So, circulating supply, um, we're up just, you know, .18%, and in Q2, that's during a quarter where blob fees were down 80%. Right? So, that's blob fees are 100% burned, right? So, that burn is going to offset, offset the issuance. Um, and also base fees are, are burned. And so, those two factors are what are going to drive sort of deflationary token economics for, for Ethereum. And to me, what's, I think what's bullish about this is that you had a quarter, uh, in Q2 where the on-chain economics were, were, were significantly down because of the Petra upgrade. Um, and so as that's playing out, the supply is still, you know, it's still under what Bitcoin is doing in terms of, terms of inflation.\n\nSo, it is kind of an interesting when you start to look at that and you say, okay, this thing, um, has very interesting token economics that, that work with the protocol, they're not fixed, but even when, even when on-chain activity is way down and you have network upgrades happening, the, the supply still is not like exceeding Bitcoin's, the issuance is not exceeding Bitcoin, that is interesting because now you've got something that's looks like it's sort of a store of value asset like, like Bitcoin, but we know ETH also has the yields, right? And so, and then these ETFs, I believe there are applications out there that, that we should see one of these go through towards the end of the year, um, that are going to allow some of that yield to be passed to the ETF holders. So, that is interesting when you maybe you've already been in the market, you've been buying Bitcoin and, and you buy the Bitcoin ETFs, now you're looking at this setup, maybe you want to rotate some of that and capture some of that yield if that product is available. So, I think, I think the store of value piece is interesting because then it pairs nicely with the fact that you have yield, and Bitcoin doesn't have yield.\n\nYeah, it's fascinating as investors start to understand this because Bitcoin is kind of like fix, fixed supply, of course, like 21 million, and there shall be no more. Whereas, um, ether is kind of like fixed issuance at least on the year. It kind of oscillates. It can't go higher than 1.45%.\n\nAnd if you annualize this, this looks at about like the 0.45% level in terms of its, uh, annualized issuance, which is less than Bitcoin right now. Bitcoin is something like 0.85%, something along those lines. If you look at other store of value like gold, you know, one to, to, uh, 1.5% uh, in new issuance every year depending on the, on the price of gold. So, that's fascinating. And I'll remind folks, too, um, if you weren't here during like 2021 and that bull cycle runup, um, Ethereum did not have a strong monetary policy at that time. It was pre-merge. People didn't really understand what's happening. Recall that the merge actually happened sort of after the the summer of 2022 crash and then September, the, the merge, uh, happened. And now, uh, Ethereum's issuance policy, monetary policy is much more hardened than it was. It's definitely not well understood yet as the, you know, Bitcoin's is, but, um, could become understood this cycle, and there's certainly some supply dynamics working in Ethereum's favor. Okay, this is another supply sync type metric, which tells an interesting story. This is the percent of supply in smart contracts, Ethereum smart contracts on chain. Uh, this number is down, um, at least to prior year, but you can sort of see a, a growth trend here. What does this tell you?\n\nYeah, so, you know, this is telling me, so we're at like 43% of the supply that's, that's currently in smart contracts. So, it's, that's 43% of the supply is on-chain. Uh, and so it's telling me when you're seeing that line go up like that over longer periods of time, it's telling that generally speaking, people feel more confident, you know, pushing their assets into DeFi, into staking contracts, um, and, and using the protocol, using their assets as collateral with within, within the protocol. So, to me, this is, uh, this is, this is, this is bullish, um, and it just shows that, you know, there's more applications, there's more things you can do with your assets, uh, on chain, and, um, you know, I, I expect this to continue to go up, continue to rise over time. That, um, slide in graph pairs nicely with this, which is the ETH balance on centralized exchanges, and that is at all-time lows, almost all-time lows. It's, uh, an 8-year low here on the chart, so ETH supply is bleeding off of exchanges, it looks like.\n\nYeah, it's kind of like the reflection of the, the chart, you know, we just showed where, you know, assets are coming on-chain. They're, they're, they're coming from, uh, centralized exchanges for the most part. And so, yeah, this is sort of just the other side of that. It, it's, you know, I think this is bullish from the perspective of not only are people moving assets on chain, but they're moving, if they're moving assets that were sitting on centralized exchange and then they're putting that into staking contracts. Like to me, that's a little bit more of like, I'm, I'm committing capital to the chain. I'm probably more of a long-term holder, more of a store of value type investor if I'm putting stuff into, uh, into staking. Um, and so if that's happening, then you just have less of the asset available for sale on exchanges as well.\n\nSo, the bull case to be, uh, told, I guess, at this point, just maybe summarize, we're seeing some institutional adoption by way of stable coins certainly and real-world assets that should accelerate on the back of the Genius Bill. Uh, and then we're seeing an institutional bid start to come through. We're seeing that in ETH ETF flows and then also these treasury companies as the narrative is propagated by people on Wall Street, Tom Lee, Joseph Luben, uh, those types of folks. And then we're seeing supply dynamics stronger than they have been in the past for Ethereum, both in terms of a, a hardened monetary policy with, with very low issuance. Uh, and then also, you know, ETH being locked up in these smart contracts and bleeding off of exchanges.\n\nSo, that sets us up for the question that all investors, I think, want to know at this point is just like, well, is ETH cheap, though? Like, is now the time to buy? It's had, it's had a recent run. Where were we at like $1,500 a couple months ago? Something like this.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay. So, now we're, we're close to, we're double that, uh, at this point in time. Um, have people missed it? What\n\n\nIt's the fair market value of this asset? And you've got a story to tell here. So, this is the MVRV Zcore. What is this telling us? So, this is market value to realize value, um, Glassnode data here. So, shout out to Glassnode. This is looking at really, you know, what is the, the, what is a proxy for cost basis of all tokens on the network. Glassnode does a really good job of analyzing this is just the onchain wallet. So, it's not factoring in ETFs or assets on exchanges, but essentially, you know, calculating what is the cost basis based on coins moving, uh, of these wallets and then comparing that to the historical, you know, average cost basis of the network. So, at the end of the quarter, we were at like 0.3 in terms of the Zcore. That's like the standard standard deviation from the historical norm. And the, the five-year average is about one. So, you're still looking like actually pretty fair value. You know, at the end of the quarter, we, we've continued to move up, uh, in price here over the last few weeks. So, that this number is currently, uh, at 0.8. So, it's getting closer to that like, you know, five-year historical norm. But, um, as you can see in the, in the chart too, this has done a good job of, of sort of highlighting good entry points to, to buy the asset. And then also, um, when the market's getting overheated, the, the, you know, market value is going to detach from that sort of historical, uh, that average cost basis of the, of the coins on the network. So, looks, it looks pretty good, uh, still to me even at these, at these current levels from, from historical norms. So, if we're at 0.8, um, now, and one is kind of 1.04 is kind of the historical norm, right?\n\nYeah. Uh, we've also seen bull markets that get far above one, going to like, um, you know, three and four. When, when do you feel like things start to get overheated on the MVRV index?\n\nThey're not yet, but when we get to like twos and threes, do you start to say, \"Okay, this is, this is, um, animal spirits?\"\n\nYeah. I think for me it's looking at a number of different factors. So, this is one of, this is certainly one of them. Um, and we have, I think, a chart coming up here. We look at the long-term moving average. So, the 200-week moving average is another indicator that, that we'll be looking at. I would say right now, like with that 0.8, and you just mentioned, like, we have had a pretty significant move here over the last, call it, you know, two months or so, two, two, three months. And so, if you look at some of the more shorter, shorter-term, we, we don't really trade ETH, but like we look at some of the more shorter-term stuff, you're looking like a little bit overheated, uh, right now. So, maybe we'll see a pullback, but on the longer-term stuff, you can see that these look like fair value zones. So, this is another one that we look for, kind of the confluence of not just MVRV, but we look at 200E moving average. There's a bunch of other factors we're looking at, but this one, um, we're also just kind of looking, you know, typically the price will bottom when you, when the, when you get close to that 200E moving average. We actually broke through it pretty significantly in the, the tariff, um, sell-off earlier this year.\n\nBroke through to the downside.\n\nTo the downside, yeah, sorry. Um, to the downside, you can see there that was like the biggest move below the 200-week moving average. It looked like a very good, you know, potentially a generational buy opportunity there. And we've since rebounded off of that, but we're just kind of above the 200E moving average. Now, it's around 20, 2500 currently. So, we are, we've start, we're starting to detach from that a little bit, but, um, as you can see that it, when you get into a bull market, you do detach from that, that purple line there. And we haven't done that just yet.\n\nImagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language. That's Mantle Banking, an all-in-one fiat and crypto account.

I don't think people are paying as much attention to this as maybe they should. Why do you think people should pay attention to this?\n\nYeah. So, this is, um, shout out to Token Terminal here. This is ecosystem TVL. So, you know, it's got not just TVL in, in DeFi, but it's got stable coins and, and so it's a, it's a larger TVL number to kind of holistically look at the, the, the ecosystem. And what we can see here is like the price just, the, the market value tends to collapse to the, the ecosystem TVL during, during the bare markets. Um, and so you know that to me it's almost like a, we're try, we try to find ways to do like comparisons to TRFI type metrics, and book value is one we've been trying to figure out, like, what would be the book value of the chain be, and this is one way to, to think about it. And it's interesting to me that, you know, when the price has collapsed down to what we're calling book value ecosystem TVL, we've seen a bounce each time, each time that's happened. I did some, uh, bull market math here, Mike, in, in my tweet thread about, about these, uh, charts. And the bull market math was like, let's say hypothetically TVL grows to $1 trillion on Ethereum, and we're at what, uh, this looks like under, under 300 billion right now.\n\nRight around there. Yep.\n\nAnd you could see that happen with the growth of stable coins. Let's say that gets to, uh, 500 billion or something like that. That's totally possible. Real-world assets gets to a 100 billion, and then all of the cryptonative assets kind of like pump. You could see, you could do some math and get to the 1 trillion amount. Uh, and then if you multiply that by some of the higher, uh, TVL multiples, market cap versus TVL, like a 2.5, then you get numbers like ETH equaling 20K. All right? And so that's how this math can kind of work on the, on the bull side. Of course, we don't know what's going to happen, how much TVL will actually, uh, be deployed on Ethereum, but, um, this tells a story. You got to, we got to watch that purple line, I guess, in the, in this bull cycle.\n\nVery interesting. And then of course, you know, once you get those stable coins in, that is setting a base, right, for, you know, in, in the bare market as well. So, this will be very interesting to keep track of this. But yeah, that's a great way to, to think about, um, potential valuation, uh, as more assets come on chain.\n\nWell, that's great. Those are the most bullish charts we could pull from, uh, the, the DeFi Report, ETH Q2 report. So, you can access all of that on, uh, the D5 report.io. Um, Mike, there's one other thing. There's some other charts with another story here that we, we didn't cover today, but I want to get your general sense because there's a way you can interpret it in a, in a bullish fashion, or there's a way you can interpret it in a more bearish fashion. And what I saw in the ETH Q2 report is obviously revenue was down. So, fee revenue was down for Ethereum. Um, you know, MEV revenue, all, all of that cumulatively was down, which meant that real yield was actually down relative to the last bull cycle we saw on Ethereum, let's say. And, um, just like in general. And part of the reason why is because Ethereum with its PCRA upgrade has been expanding block space supply. Not on layer 1 so much, although it's starting to do more of that in, in incremental ways, but certainly on, uh, layer 2. And so, layer 2s haven't like been paying as much as they should, maybe to some, not been paying their, their fair share. And, uh, there's a narrative out there that that's because layer twos are kind of, you know, taking usage, taking business, taking me, taking fees from Ethereum mainnet, and they're quote unquote parasitic to Ethereum. Okay, so that's the bear take. You see, you see an asset, and you see real yield down, you see rev down, and you're like, okay, like what's going on? We could be bearish here. The L2 thing, maybe that's not so good for, uh, ETH value acral. Okay, but then there's the bull case you could take, which is to say that all of these upgrades are efficiency and productivity upgrades to the Ethereum network, and essentially the, the blob space increases. Well, that's stimulus to the Ethereum economy. What you also see in the charts from Q2 in your fantastic report is massive increase in usage for Q2 for layer 2. So, active addresses are up, uh, you know, transactions are up, there's more users, more transactions. Now they're paying less, but maybe that's a good thing because we are, uh, onboarding more people, effectively locking them into the network effect of the EVM and into Ethereum, and that will translate to more rev later or more ETH holding, more store of value usage of Ether, the asset. And that's the more bullish take you could have, which is like, no, this is layer 2 strategy, like, working pretty well as designed, and ETH is essentially going to make it up, make up for revenue in network adoption, you know, more users and, uh, being exported as a store of value asset. So, there's the two sides you could kind of look at the Q2 numbers with. When ETH price is going up, there's a tendency to be like, oh no, the bulls were right. You know, when ETH price is going down, when it's 1500, you're like, okay, L2s are parasitic. The whole thing was a bad idea. What's your take on this as you sort of weigh the, the bull case and, and the bare case on the, um, L2 numbers and the, the yield numbers for Ethereum coming out of Q2?\n\nYeah, my, this is a great, I mean, this is a great topic to, to explore. I mean, my view on this is that the road map is going as planned, right? I think, I think that's, that's pretty clear when you look at the, the growth of L2s, when you look at the, the value, you know, why, why did Coinbase launch, it launch an L2? Because it's valuable for their business. Why is Robin Hood doing it? It's, it's good for their business. So, to me, the story there is like, if you're, if you think of, I know Ethereum is not a business, but they do have a product, and they need people to adopt that product. Um, that you have product market fit, right? So, to me, that's important to, to start with. And then the next piece of this, and anybody who's ever started a business knows you start with product market fit, and then you have to get your pricing, and you have to find ways to, you know, build leverage or deal with competition, and Ethereum's in that, that process right now. And so, as the L2s, you know, come in, and they adopt Ethereum, if you can build a network effect and continue to provide really good services to those L2s, I believe the economics will sort themselves out, and, you know, the, the, the margin that the L2s get, like, will hit whatever the market says is appropriate. And that's just kind of how it should, it should play out to me. Um, so that's my view. Like, it's, it's absolutely true that the, the real onchain yields are down. Ethereum is in this transition period right now, but if, if you have product market fit, you should have pricing power, you know, later on. And we could probably do a full episode on native rollups and kind of what the path to do that is. But that's kind of my view on this. And this, it's up to the Ethereum Foundation, up to Ethereum community to execute, uh, on this and, and find that equilibrium where, where the right amount of value is making it to Ethereum validators and to ETH, ETH, ETH holders as the L2s, um, obviously get lots of value off of building on, on Ethereum.\n\nWell, we may be early into the ETH rotation. Uh, certainly we're not sure yet. I, we haven't seen the price moves to fully justify that. So, it's still a little bit early, but Mike, thank you so much for providing these, uh, these charts for the community. We certainly appreciate it.\n\nYeah, thanks for having me, Ryan.\n\nGuys, we'll include links to both the, the DeFi Report Q2 where you can access all of this and also the Dune, uh, analytics report so you can see all of this in real time as it evolves. Got to let you know, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier.
