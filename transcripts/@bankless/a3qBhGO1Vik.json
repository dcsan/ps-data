  "cleanText": "So my question to you, Joe, do you have what it takes? Can you become the Michael Saylor of Ethereum? Well, I don't, I don't think I need to answer that question directly.\n\nBank Nation, we have Joe Lubin. He is the co-founder of Ethereum. He's the CEO of Consensys. And most recently, he's now the chairman of a publicly traded company. It's called SharpLink Gaming. A company designed to purchase Ether, the asset, for strategic treasury purposes. Joe, welcome back to Bankless. Thanks, guys. Feels like I've been here recently. Uh, but the vibe's a little different. Yeah. You know what? Last time we were here, I was just looking at this. It was uh, just over a year ago. It was May. And I think you were in the process of getting sued, getting nasty grams from the SEC. At least Consensys was also suing if I remember correctly. Yeah, that's right. I think that part was the part that worked out actually. I think we're on the the the offense actually. Why don't we actually start there then? The ecosystem won that one. Okay. So, what what happened with that? So, last time we talked, uh, Gary Gensler was on his rampage. Consensys was kind of the next, they were actually talking about it. It seemed like they were intent on making Ether the asset a security as well. That was some of the implication in their wealth notices. Yeah, there was a an inquisition underway, um, uh, driven uh, by uh, President Elizabeth Warren. Um, uh, she, she and uh, the progressive wing of the Democratic party, um, preferred to, um, have large government and and granular control over all human activity. Uh, simultaneously, uh, the bank lobby, uh, some big banks that uh, preferred to keep winning a rigged game. Um, they, um, made strange but uh, but happy bedfellows. Um, uh, so Jamie Diamond and Elizabeth Warren, uh, in sync on some some actions and uh, and they all felt that uh, this new technology, um, for decentralized protocols, um, which would enable disintermediation of lots of systems and empowerment of people and communities, uh, was antithetical to to their goals. And so, uh, Chair Gensler, uh, was essentially deputized to stop disintermediation, uh, to maintain control of all the things. Um, and the way they intended to do that was to go back on on what Bill Hinman, um, um, the director of corporation finance, uh, at the previous SEC, uh, had said about Ether, that it's commodity, not a security, and uh, and they went back on several things that the CFTC had been saying for a long time. Ether, commodity, not a security. So they secretly uh, seemed to recategorize Ether as a secret security. Um, and then they proceeded to do all sorts of enforcement actions. Um, an inquisition which forced many companies, including our own, to pay tens of millions of dollars, um, hundreds of millions uh, in some, um, the lawyers to produce documents, uh, to defend ourselves, uh, for things that they were insinuating that we were doing. Um, when it got to the point that uh, that they were, um, subpoenaing and inquisitioning just independent researchers, uh, to try to figure out uh, who to pin uh, this reclassification on. Um, uh, then we, um, we got active. So we thought we might have to sue the SEC at some point, uh, uh, based on a few years of of that sort of activity. And uh, we eventually ended up pulling the trigger. So, we stood them in the great state of Texas. Um, and we pretty much tried to put them on their heels to answer our question, uh, which is, \"Do you consider uh, Ether a security or a commodity?\" Um, and they, they did some fancy work. And so, they said, \"Oh, we're bad. Uh, we're not actually investigating uh, or we're going to stop investigating uh, your ecosystem. We're going to stop harassing researchers.\" Uh, and so, uh, by doing, and they sent out a letter, sort of apology letter, because they, they were forced to to make a direct statement. Uh, and then the, um, the judge in that case, uh, felt that that was sufficient and uh, and uh, our case wasn't ripe enough uh, to be seen in that particular court. Uh, and so he said, \"I can't look at this in Texas anymore.\" Uh, and so immediately after that, uh, the SEC sued us in Brooklyn. So they got, they got on the E train, I think. Uh, they went from uh, one, one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction, the one which they lost to Coinbase in. Um, so they moved to a different jurisdiction. They sued us uh, there for basically the same thing. Um, and uh, November 5th happened. Uh, Chair Gensler resigned. Um, the complexion of government actions towards our industry has profoundly changed and uh, and so that uh, ended up uh, getting settled. Like did the the wells notice, all that, did it evaporate in a puff of smoke? Uh, so they sued us, um, based on the wells notice, um, and ultimately we, we basically won, uh, we achieved our agenda in the first action and the ecosystem won. Uh, it was liberated uh, to a certain extent and uh, uh, and then they settled. We all settled. So the other action just disapproved. Have you met with the new SEC chair? What's kind of the new SEC administration like? They're outstanding. I haven't met with with Paul, but uh, I have uh, interacted with Hester on some occasions. Uh, she's a superstar and uh, I think we love the SEC. Um, did you just say we love the SEC? The SEC is uh, uh, is doing really healthy things for the United States of America and the world and uh, very reasonable things uh, for our ecosystem. Um, uh, people on our policy and legal team uh, interact with them in a positive, constructive manner uh, quite regularly. So uh, it's a pleasure uh, to to work with them. Wow, what a 180 change. I, I, I'm just curious if you could maybe project forward. So let's say November had a different outcome and we got a similar administration to the one we had last time. What do you think? How, how do you think that world would have been different? That kind of reality exists maybe somewhere in the multiverse. Play that reality out. It's really hard to know, but we were very convinced, um, that we would win in court. Um, that the uh, judicial arm of government uh, would end up being relatively independent and rational, um, and you know, do the right thing and and set uh, our ecosystem on a healthy course. Uh, I think it was the goal of uh, Gensler and Warren and others to slow us down, uh, to to try to inject some things, to co-opt our industry, perhaps, and and you know, just try to do, um, ridiculous and egregious things in case they might end up being able to win. Um, so the, um, spacing on the name of that, that project, uh, Gary, Gary's pet project, uh, uh, that uh, was already set up to treat Ether as a security. That was weird. This feels like a different timeline. It feels like we're not, not living in that world anymore. I've reclaimed those brain cells. I don't, Yeah, exactly. I just like, let's leave that in in 2022 to 2024 and let's talk about the future and part of the future is this new publicly traded company that uh, we mentioned in the intro. The ticker is ESBET. So this is on the NASDAQ. I should probably, um, take this moment as uh, our GC Matt Corva has suggested. I should probably say something to the effect that uh, nothing I say here with respect to SBET, the strategic bet on Ethereum, uh, should be considered forward-looking statements. Um, and I'm just talking big picture about why Consensys was excited to to be an investor. Uh, I'm certainly not uh, licensed to to offer financial advice. I, if there was a license to offer Ethereum advice, I'd probably be qualified. Okay. Okay. Well, disclaimers out of the way. ESB is the ticker, a strategic bet on ETH. I guess it was SharpLink before. Can you talk about It is. It is SharpLink Gaming Inc., but everything I'm saying is hypothetical. Okay. Tell us about this. So, tell us as we understand it, there's the press release is, is basically it's, um, a uh, former, it's a gaming company, still is a gaming company. So, uh, affiliate marketing uh, for sports betting, things like that. Okay. And the the pivot here, the change here or the the new capital raise is all about setting up a strategic treasury around Ether, the asset. I believe $425 million maybe to start. What's the strategy here? What's what's this uh, vehicle actually doing? Yeah. So, it's two-pronged. Uh, one, uh, because it, it has its own mandate. Um, uh, it is very interested in making use of web3 primitives uh, to enhance uh, what they do. Uh, so one could imagine, again, this very hypothetical, um, prediction markets could be uh, relevant, um, to sports betting, maybe more granular uh, kinds of propositions. We like to do peer-to-peer things uh, in our ecosystem. Um, I'll, I'll say no more on that front. Um, and the biggie is that they're, they're really excited to uh, to bring Ether uh, onto their balance sheet, about $425 million worth of Ether initially. Um, uh, they're very excited to to stake it, to restake it, uh, to participate in DeFi. uh, and uh, uh, essentially uh, Michael Saylor in his strategies strategy uh, is doing some very interesting things with at the market sales of shares uh, with the convertible debt offerings. Um, uh, he's able to create financial instruments that uh, that uh, um, are attractive to different cohorts of investors, like certain kinds of bond investors. uh, attractive in the sense that he can dial up or dial down the ratio of risk uh, to return in in different kinds of investments. Uh, so we will look to do, hypothetically, we'll look to do some of those things and uh, and we can do so much more. Um, so uh, Saylor has this notion of Bitcoin yield, which is the amount of Bitcoin exposure uh, for every, every fully diluted share uh, of the shareholders own. We have this notion of yield in the Ethereum ecosystem. It's called just earning Ether, u, based on staking your Ether and stuff like that. So uh, we're going to stick with that definition of yield. Um, and I'm thinking there might be another definition like ether concentration or something like that uh, where uh, we keep doing these, these different activities and if you own one share, uh, then you would see the amount of effective ownership of ether uh, continue to grow through the actions of the company. So as I understand these acquisition vehicles, there's two sides of it. There's a pool of capital, which you guys are starting with $425 million that's going to turn into Ether that's going to be put on the balance sheet of ESB. And then there's the kind of the financial alchemy, uh, the Michael Sayloring of uh, the deal structure to make sure that just more for him, Bitcoin for you, Ether comes into the balance sheet at, you know, a managed risk. And so there's like two different ways to grow this effort. Growing the balance sheet. So getting more investment, getting more people uh, to getting more ETH on the balance sheet and then also the financial alchemy. Can you talk about uh, both of those independently? So 425 million to start. How do you just get, what's the strategy for growing that pool of capital? Yeah, so they're not very independent in my mind. Uh, one fuels the other. Um, and so we, we take in investment uh, from uh, different kinds of actors, VCs, etc. In our space, Consensys led that investment round. What we're doing next is uh, uh, ATM at the market sales of shares. Uh, so uh, through a broker dealer, you can just sell, um, I was going to say tokens, but you can just sell these shares uh, to retail uh, to institutions directly. Um, and it was kind of funny that I was going to say tokens because another thing you can do is you can tokenize equity. Um, so imagine, um, a company uh, that has a strategy like this, tokenizing a portion of their equity, making it available uh, in a popular wallet potentially uh, for end users to purchase. Um, there's this notion of of token gated perks or admittance or things like that. uh, in the traditional world, uh, the DTCC uh, operates, uh, company that's think is called Seed and Company and Seed and Company owns all the shares, uh, owns all the the publicly traded shares and uh, and there's I think an IOU between them and your brokerage and then between your brokerage and you, uh, so you don't really own your shares. Um, and that all happened for good reasons. There was a a paper crisis and we had to shut down the stock market a couple days a week cuz the messengers couldn't get the the stock certificates uh, around. But imagine now that uh, that we can know exactly who owns a token uh, that has ownership of a share. Uh, so there really exciting things that uh, that we think we can do with that. uh, uh, imagine any of the companies in the orbit of of this company uh, could uh, offer perks or privileges in different kinds of contexts.

One of the reasons why MicroStrategy's strategy is what it is is because there's always been this premium for MicroStrategy stock, uh, compared to the NAV, right? If it's not, it's not a trust, but it holds a bunch of Bitcoin. But MicroStrategy stock, the value of MicroStrategy has always been higher than the Bitcoin that MicroStrategy owns. And this is what gives Michael Saylor the room to issue more shares and then turn those issued shares into revenue and then buy more Bitcoin with it. Now, I think we could spend hours debating and unpacking why there is exactly a premium. I'm not sure anyone truly knows why there's a premium. One of my answers is that because Michael Saylor is kind of this larger-than-life figure who has done a fantastic job promoting Bitcoin to the world in this very big way. And that's kind of what I think it takes to really, uh, allow ESBET to work its way up to become sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor. So my question to you, Joe, do you have what it takes? Can you become the Michael Saylor of Ethereum? Well, I don't, I don't think I need to answer that question directly. Um, I think what Michael Saylor's done, um, is truly remarkable. Um, I've had the privilege of being able to talk to him three times. Uh, he's been very generous with his time. Um, he congratulated us on ESBET. Um, and he's just, uh, he's a superstar in what he does. He's been incredible, uh, for the Bitcoin brand. And I think it's actually much more that's going on than just his cheerleading. Um, I think it is, there are structural things, um, that are in place in economies, uh, based on geopolitics and things like that. Um, and I think we're in a paradigm shift. You may have heard me say that, uh, once or twice before. Um, and the paradigm shift is enabling, um, structural magic, um, potentially to happen. And so if you go way back, um, World War II, uh, US emerges from that, uh, with the dominant, uh, military and industrial complex compared to the rest of the world. Uh, Breton Woods, US becomes a reserve currency of the world. Um, and these structural advantages, uh, turn into, uh, unfair advantages for the US where it trades a lot of kinds of paper for goods and services, uh, from companies around the world. Papers, dollars, and treasuries. Um, it sets up this feedback loop where countries like Japan, China, etc., uh, have to do something, uh, with that paper, um, and they don't have the decap industries, uh, financial industries to make good use of that. So they end up feeding it back to the United States. And so you get, uh, a lot of cheap money for the US to keep building itself. And so one structural trade that happened there was interest rates on treasuries just dropped for 30 years. Treasuries go up for 30 years with prices. Um, another structural thing in the US was, uh, the weakness of the Japanese yen, uh, driving, uh, 30 years of different kinds of carry trades, borrow GPN, um, invest in something higher yielding, uh, and so I believe that, uh, um, as we come to the end of one super cycle, um, we're smashing against the rocks right now, um, and the start of the next super cycle, which I think will be dominated by decentralized protocols and AI, at least in the first couple decades. Um, you have this migration of the economy, um, because it has to, uh, to decentralize rails. So the United States politicians just demonstrated that austerity is just not a thing in the US. We don't do austerity. Uh, Scott Besson takes that, he pivots. He says, \"Okay, we're going to grow our way out of this debt and deficit mess.\" What that means is, um, the old economy is going to fall apart in pieces. Um, we're seeing jitters in Treasury markets, um, and we're going to rebuild on the new economy, uh, the decentralized protocol economy. And so, uh, we are seeing the US government, uh, get behind our technology. Um, you'll see them paving the way, uh, for hopefully stable stablecoins and market structure will happen sooner rather than later. Um, and they're going to use the technology, um, because that's how they grow. We are now seeing, uh, with ESBET and other projects, we're seeing TradFi being onboarded to DeFi. Um, because these things are so, let's think of them, to use a silly phrase, as perpetual motion machines for a little while. Uh, where, um, because there's more demand, uh, for Ether and Bitcoin because we're, we got more applications on this new kind of decentralized worldwide web. Um, so more usage, uh, price appreciation is likely to be significant. Tom Lee, uh, a couple days ago said Bitcoin 3 million. Um, it's a interesting number. Uh, so there's a lot of people that believe price is going to go up. Um, you're sitting with your shares and you're seeing the ether concentration go up, uh, when more and more people, uh, invest in this company that you're invested in. Um, and what do Wall Streeters care about? All they care about is making money. Uh, and so if they see this thing working for a while, if they hear people in earnings calls, um, talk about the details of Ethereum and the details of DeFi and this particular strategy, what are they going to do? They're going to become expert, um, in our technology just like we did for different reasons. That's why I feel very much is the story of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, is that it was kind of a megaphone. I mean, I remember when he started this, um, bit the price of Bitcoin from a market cap perspective is something like 200 million. So, similar to the market cap of Ethereum today, and he started this in 2020. I think Wall Street kind of thought he was crazy. I think it sounds like magic and opium and scheme and yeah. Does right. And what he continued to do with his strategy is just like, uh, I mean, every couple weeks, every month, we'd put like dollar cost average in, dollar cost average in. And now I'm looking at, I'm looking at this, uh, that the time of recording, he has almost 600,000 Bitcoin. There's almost 600,000 Bitcoin on the MicroStrategy balance sheet in the Treasury. It's worth about $61 billion. If you talk about Bitcoin going to the millions, I mean, we're talking about a very large company. I guess my question for something like ESBET is, do you think that ESBet, that kind of a vehicle for Ether, the asset, can grow as large as MicroStrategy has in a 5-year time range? So we're at about the same, you know, market cap now. Do you think that, uh, ESB can do basically what MicroStrategy did? Sure. So, um, first, more props to Michael. Um, two things that he's been focusing on is focus, like, uh, be narrowly focused on Bitcoin, um, and ensure that that focus brings volatility to the asset, uh, to the share, um, because he's trading volatility in different forms. Um, also, to answer your question, which I kind of avoided, yes, I'm going to be very loud, um, and consistently out there. Um, for a couple years, I, we were in a blackout period because the SEC was trying to pin, um, this scheme, uh, to sell unregistered securities, uh, to Americans on Consensus. So, uh, we had to be quiet. We used to, obviously, uh, champion it there in the lot in our marketing and in everything we did. Um, so one thing you're asking there is, um, is Ether going to flip in? Um, another thing you're asking is ESB going to flip in strategy? Let's think about it this way. I, I, uh, was inspired last night, uh, to, um, to retweet, uh, something that Robert D of Ian Lair, um, put out. Um, and I was thinking, um, we're, we're trying to frame, uh, what, what the valuation model for Ethereum and Ether is. Um, discounted cash flow, we can discount that for a bunch of years, hopefully. Uh, that's, that's not a healthy way to look at things. Uh, people think of, uh, Ethereum as an operating system, the next operating system of the world. Um, but, uh, I'm really loving the idea of framing ether as framing trust as a commodity. Uh, we, we frame information as a commodity. Um, so lots of virtual commodities are out there. Um, if we think about how much value, um, sprinkling some ether dust or chunks of ether or a, a, an ether diamond, an ether trust diamond, um, onto a transaction, onto a relationship, onto an agreement, uh, on the Ethereum blockchain, um, the kind of facilitation that that brings, the kind of guaranteed execution that that brings, um, what does that do, uh, to the value of each one of these transactions, uh, or processes? I think it's more than 10% increase in value. I, I think it's kind of hard to have to imagine, is it 100%? Is it a,000%? Um, and so if you do that to the world GDP, um, and if you recognize that, uh, you're packing more of these transactions into each unit time, more of these agreements are easy to make, um, packing them into each unit of time. Uh, if you bring the power of compounding into that, uh, then you're just creating, you're compounding more and more value. Uh, so gold 2.0, really valuable. Uh, I think Tom Lee said $23 trillion above ground gold right now. Um, what's the size, what's 100 times a thousand times the size of global GDP, uh, running on Ethereum rails? I think ESB's going to, um, drive a lot of that. Okay. So let, let's, uh, let's pull those two pieces apart and go into more detail. I mean, the first is kind of valuation and how you think about valuing Ether, the asset. There's been a lot of conversation about this, like, recently in kind of the crypto circles, and, um, I think, you know, some people are advocating, you know, discounted cash flow because of the way, you know, staking yield is, like, okay, so, and others are saying, no, look, this is a monetary phenomenon, this is a, like, a commodity, it's commodity money, it's a store of value, it's just like Bitcoin, don't have different rules apply. What's your answer to this? How should Ether, the asset, be valued? I think, I think the money premium, uh, comes from the nature of trust. Uh, so if Ether is seen as the gold standard in trust, um, the highest octane, uh, grade of trust, uh, then it should have a very high monetary premium. Um, and I think that's going to dominate the valuation model. How there's, there's, there's memory, like, uh, there, there's a ton of meme power in Ether. Um, Bitcoin is still the biggest, uh, memecoin on the planet. Biggest, most valuable meme coin on the planet. It has, uh, store of value utility, uh, but, uh, you know, just like the US dollar, um, there's a lot of, uh, meme power in it. How do you communicate this narrative to, uh, Wall Street? So right now, it seems like, uh, Wall Street has this idea of Bitcoin as kind of gold, doesn't need cash flows, just the number just goes up, right? Whereas with, uh, Ethereum and Ether, the asset, different rules apply, at least right now, it's some kind of a tech platform, maybe it's like a high-performance growth equity, they are looking at DCF models and cash flows, not all of them, but at least some of them. How do you kind of change that narrative or that model for either the asset in Wall Street to them? So it is difficult. Um, Bitcoin has an easy-to-understand value proposition. Solana ran up, um, impressively on the back of the main coin phenomenon for better or worse. Um, and Ethereum has always, uh, been the good middle child, uh, building, uh, scalable infrastructure for the decentralized future. Um, and you know, uh, we can, uh, say things like it's civilizational technology, but it's, it's a big thing to express, which is why we at Consensus have been doing a lot of work to, uh, um, writing out thought pieces. We're going to put out this idea of trust as commodity, uh, quite measurable. Um, uh, but bottom line, um, I don't think we need to work too hard anymore, uh, to educate Wall Street, uh, because we're going to demonstrate, uh, that there's this, uh, sort of magical perpetual motion flywheel thing going on. Um, you do have to believe in order to, uh, appreciate this, um, uh, this, you know, what ESB can do. Uh, you do have to believe that, uh, there is a paradigm shift, that we are moving from, um, an old system, a dying super cycle, to a new system of the world. You have to believe that, uh, Ethereum will be the dominant foundational, uh, digital asset settlement layer, uh, and also, um, web3 primitives on Ethereum will be a big part of web 3, the really centralized worldwide web, but, uh, I think it's going to be the simple things that that gets Wall Street there. Watch, watch number go up for two or three quarters. This is, this is funny. This is very similar to what my brilliant, uh, podcast co-host says. Uh, B, basically, number go up is Bitcoin's marketing, right? The, the number, the, the price point in the ticker, that's what gives all of that flywheel effect and and that faith to Wall Street investors everywhere. Can, can we talk about the last two years of ETH price performance? And I know David and I have given our perspectives on, uh, why, uh, ETH performance has been lackluster. Maybe not compared to the dollar, but compared to Bitcoin, certainly on the ratio, and also you mentioned, uh, you know, little brother networks, like, you know, the Solanas of the world and other smaller market cap alternative layer ones. Why do you think ETH has been in a malaise and, uh, is that about to change? Well, it's already changed quite significantly. There, there's a lot of organic optimism in the ecosystem right now. So, it's been a long slog. Uh, a lot of people put heart and soul into it, and, um, it's hard building civilizational infrastructure. Um, you need to build layer after layer of functionality and scalability. Um, and you know, we've always been building for the future, and I, I think the future is pretty much here. I think, uh, we've hit our broadband moment, uh, in the sense that we're horizontally and vertically scalable. Uh, block space is affordable. Block space is very affordable. Uh, user interfaces are good. Uh, they're going to get great as we infuse AI into our wallets and into our user interfaces. It hasn't been safe or smart, uh, for companies to use tokens, to issue tokens, to participate in DeFi in the United States. It hasn't been smart at all, uh, for the best and the brightest builders, entrepreneurs to build applications for end users, for consumers and enterprises. Uh, but now it is, and, and it's just so much, um, better, um, so much less toxic, uh, to build of, by, and for the community, uh, rather than build in an adversarial relationship, uh, to your user, which is the traditional economy and web 2. Uh, so, uh, the best and the brightest\n\n\nWill come are coming to build in our ecosystem. Ethereum has been additionally in what I have been calling an awkward adolescent period where it built great technology, knew it wasn't scalable. Tried to figure out ways to shard itself to bring scalability. We couldn't get that done. So we threw it open to the world in a divergent pace. We had some optimistic people. I know you guys are very optimistic people, build rollups and then we had some ZK people do some research. We did a lot of research in Consensys. We thought it was five, maybe eight years away before it would get practical to build a ZK rollup. But things moved incredibly fast, astonishingly fast. And so our R&D team turned into our Linea team, our Linea ZK EVM layer 2 rollup solution. And essentially we built all these layer 2s. They have not been accretive to the Ether token. So that there has been some extraction of value into the layer 2 rollup ecosystem, but that's fine. I think it was perfectly reasonable for Ethereum layer 1 to step back and enable them to have pricing power and build out their domains. They did come up with exciting technology. We're now in a convergence period where projects like Across and other kinds of technologies are going to enable layer 2s to talk to each other better, twos to talk to layer 1 better. SDKs, programming through AI interfaces are all going to make building on Ethereum pretty seamless. It's going to be less about fragmentation going forward. This is especially true when Glamsterdam comes around, probably sometime, but let's hope it's mid-2026. It's a hard fork right after the next one, the Fusaka hard fork in Glamsterdam. We're going to see an enshrined native rollup technology. We believe that our own technology, Linea, is the only standing viable ZK EVM technology that can be donated to the Ethereum protocol. Every execution client syncs to it right away. It is as it's equivalent to Ethereum. Can take your Ethereum code at layer 1 and run it unchanged at layer 2. So we believe we're going to be able to beef up mainnet very significantly. And we believe that through various mechanisms we're going to see layer 2 support layer 1 much better. We in particular are going to be doing a TGE in the not too distant future. We're going to be rewarding our LXP, our very patient LXP token holders. Points breaking, by the way, do people know this? Is this news? Well, I'm not going to put a date to it, but I I think we've hinted at it on X. Fair enough. Fair enough. And we're going to reward those people because they they put a lot of work into helping us build out and and burn in our network. And we're going to do something in the tokconomics that is very directly supportive of Ether and layer 1. We're hoping that that is a mechanic that other layer twos will follow and other applications too. A lot of this is about Ethereum the technology, Ethereum the platform, which has been just one of the more interesting stories I think from the tech side of things in the crypto space to follow how Ethereum scalability challenges have been faced and then solved. But I want to turn the conversation back to kind of the main character here, which is Ether the asset. Both Ryan and I here had the same aha moment independently, I think about Ethereum and Ether the asset when we both deposited Ether into Maker Dow and we were able to mint a stable coin programmatically with smart contracts. And that was just this big breakthrough moment for me as an end user of Ethereum and its smart contracts and some of his applications that I could deposit ETH, deposit this asset that was native to the blockchain, deposit it into one of its smart contracts on the blockchain that we just call Maker Dow. And there was a button that I could press that I could mint die and I could mint half of the value that I deposited. So it deposited about $1,000, minted 500 die stable coins. And that was like a power that no one had ever given me before. No app, no Robin Hood never gave me that. No financial institution never gave me that. I never had the ability to mint my own asset. And it all came from the value of my collateral, the value of my deposit because kind of like how you said with your trust diamonds analogy, diamond being the the logo of Ethereum, Maker Dal could trust me because I had deposited some ether into the account and I was able to mint die. And so, so that that's the thing I think that really pilled me and Ryan about DeFi and the idea that Ether is this like collateral asset and Ethereum is able to mint its own create its own DeFi depository economy. And actually what I see you doing with SBET with your strategic bet on Ethereum with SharpLink Gaming is you're doing the whole collateral reserve thing without in the trad contracts, TRD legal contracts, but it's still nonetheless a treasury asset for ESB. Maybe you could talk about like why Ether the asset is a good treasury asset for companies like ESB or people who are just interested in Ether as a as a collateral on their balance sheet.\nYeah. So, Bitcoin is a good treasury asset. Ether is a much better treasury asset because it's so productive and yielding. It is another analogy, it's the fuel, the oil, the gas, the electricity that powers applications and storage on the emerging decentralized world computer. So people are going to need it just like they need a reserve currency in the current world to buy oil and and wheat things and there's so many ways to earn yield on this productive asset that I think it'll be the token that just keeps giving. What's nice is with I guess with ESB if you guys are able to stake it that this is not available in ether ETFs right now, right? The staking features are not available. I don't know. Currently no. Yeah, currently no. We think it's a few months away. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, do you think that there's room for other but also we'll be much more aggressive than than they can be while still maintaining prudent risk levels. One of the things that was also beneficial about Micro Strategies, you know, strategy Michael Saylor's play is not only did, you know, did they engage in the strategy, but they pilled others to do it too, right? you know, and so like GameStop I think recently bought just bought 4,000 Bitcoin put on the balance sheet and there's others with this strategy. How many espets do you think can exist? And what is the the path to get others to adopt Ether on their treasury? Is this kind of like a business development effort? Do you lead by example? Do you have to evangelize, be very loud on X? You have to put AI memes together with, you know, Ethereum blue logo the way Michael Saylor does? What's the plan here? Yeah. So in the '90s and in the as there were web studio companies also called interactive companies, companies like Razerfish, March 1st and they built websites tradition traditional companies and they put information on those websites and and then they brought them into e-commerce. So we believe that there will be at least one of these in any nation state that has a stock market of any significance. And probably more than one cuz it's going to be really exciting to implement different versions of how to accomplish this kind of onboarding of ether to treasuries. What Consensys is going to be able to do is we're going to take our wallet, our different components. We will have a stack for developers, web two developers, web three developers, a stack for enterprise, you know, a stack for financial institutions. We will help enterprises on board tokens to their treasury. We'll help them issue tokens. We'll help them set up in Ethereum layer 1 DeFi and Linea DeFi. We're actually going to put a pretty giant amount of Ether onto Ethereum and onto Linea cuz we will have a very vibrant DEX setup there very soon. And we can help them set up homesteads, safe spaces where where they can operate on web 3 where they can make use of different kinds of web primitives like decentralized identities and badges to identify who their employees are, who are members of different teams. We have a debit card that is a very exciting product. Essentially you can put some instead of the normal dynamic where you send your whole paycheck to your bank in order to use your debit card and they immediately start earning yield on your back and you don't earn any yield for the whole month. But instead of that you you put your salary on into your linear account and you're earning yield up to the minute that it is debited. So any sort of transaction across the the global masterard network can just take some stable coin or some ether, don't use ether, just use stable coins out of your out of your line account. We're working on a payroll system so we can close the loop on that so we can help companies issue payroll through then yeah through blockchain networks. So this is a playbook that we can help lots of projects do and and like Sailor who's handholding a bunch of other companies will will want to do a lot of that. You brought up Consensys of course and and Consensys is a a company that that you founded that's basically building tools up the stack on top of Ethereum and other crypto networks. But particular focus and attention on Ethereum. I know there's been a lot of speculation and talk and rumors about Consensys actually IPOing at some point in time and I'm sure there's like if if I I'm sure you have regulation against what you can say about this but I I'm curious. We were talking earlier about the regulatory tailwinds that we now have. You said the SEC was fantastic to work with. We have the circle IPO that's happening in in a matter of days at the time of recording. That will have already happened by the time folks get this. We we've had Galaxy IPO recently. Is now a good time for crypto companies to IPO? And can you say anything specific about Consensys on that? Well, yes, now is a very good time for blockchain companies to IPO. And no, I can't say anything specific about Consensys on that.\nPerfect. Imagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language.

I maybe want to talk about a discussion that Dave and I have been having and was even a debate earlier on this podcast. So much of kind of the the treasury strategy I feel like for for Micro Strategy or for ESB or for any Treasury organization that intends to stack cryptocurrency and collect it, it's really about the store of value use case of the underlying asset. And it's been said to us, David and I have have been Ethereum bulls for a very long time. It's been said to us, hey, ETH bulls, you got to give up on this whole store of value thing. And the reason is because Bitcoin has already reached escape velocity as a store of value asset. It is a special snowflake and then everything else is in a different category. Everything else is maybe a DCF type model. Has to earn fees. It's kind of a high-tech equity. It's not a special snowflake. So, there's Bitcoin is the special snowflake. Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Everything else is the seven dwarfs. It's not Bitcoin. And so, it doesn't get monetary premium. Is not a good store of value. Obviously, you seem to be rejecting that with your your strategic bet on Ethereum with SBET. Uh can you tell us why is is Ether the asset also a special snowflake? And like if you think so, why do you think that? Well, anyone who tells you that there can be only one store of value has an agenda. And you know, there's gold, there's diamonds, there's real estate, US dollars, for however many decades. And and all these things aren't guaranteed stores of value. So, I don't know if I would want to be a special snowflake. Snowflakes are brittle. Along can come something that has a lot of productive utility and yielding power and if you squint\n\n\nBitcoin has been going up for about a decade and is likely to keep going up. So, while it may be very volatile in both Bitcoin and Ether's case, both are outstanding stores of value on a sort of civilizational scale. So, again, we're back to the flipping discussion. In my mind, Ether is likely to be a more powerful store of value in my opinion than any other digital asset. And before we get to a flipping of Ether of Bitcoin, we have to get to multi-trillion dollar status and cross that trillion dollar line with Ether the asset. What do you think that's going to take? What does Ethereum need to do to become a multi-trillion dollar asset? We need end-user applications. Really, our best set of end-user applications are in DeFi right now. And we'll work to bring more to consumers and to enterprises. But I think ESBET is going to drive a trend where it is going to be seen as safe and acceptable for people and organizations to dip their toe in. And you mentioned being blown away by the power that Maker gave you, but just doing a simple transaction, sending $1,000 to somebody in another country and watch it take a few seconds and cost you nothing. That's mind-blowing for a lot of people. So, we need to get a lot more people to do that and then enable a lot more people to and especially organizations to participate in DeFi once that gets rolling further because we really don't have a lot of users in our ecosystem that aren't crypto nerds, finance nerds, or art nerds. Once we get real companies starting to benefit from the technology, I think it'll pick up steam.\n\nJoe, there's ESPED is not the only acquisition vehicle going after Ether. There are at least a handful of others. Some that haven't been announced yet, but you're there's a growing number of these acquisition vehicles. Now, anytime that there's multiple acquisition vehicles going after the same asset, it's splitting the efficiency of the lending market. So there at least with the way that Micro Strategy works is there are people who are willing to lend money to Micro Strategy and Michael Saylor and that sucks up some of the amount of available capital Micro Strategy does for any versus any other Bitcoin acquisition company like Micro Strategy. So it's a little bit more efficient if multiple acquisition facilities like ESP or any other facility looking to acquire Ether would join forces and merge together. Is that a future that you see? How do you I don't know if you're in discussions with any of these that that you might be aware of or are unannounced. But where do you think this future goes? Because I don't think you're going to be the only one entering the game. There's going to be two, three, four more. What do you think about this? I think there'll be a bunch trying it out. So I think we will all be mutually supportive as well as competitive and I do think that there are different ways to bring ether on treasury and so may appeal to different audiences, different use cases. In our particular case, we believe that we're thought leader, we're we've been the Ethereum company. We will be the Ethereum company for a long time or Ethereum first pan ecosystem company will drive thought leadership. So we will enable retail and institutional investors to have the top professionals at Consensys, at Galaxy, at Parfy, at ESP. We'll bring in the professional investor approach to this and so we from a competitive perspective we think we're in pretty good shape. But we will also I think want to collaborate and support a bunch of these companies. I do think you're probably right. I think there'll probably be some consolidation after a while.\n\nWe mentioned maybe the Bitcoin ETH ratio has seen a bottom, at least a local bottom. It's, you know, it's shown some momentum recently here recently. Hard to know how long that will persist or whether we're due for another dip or what's going to happen, but there does seem to be a momentum shift with respect to sentiment around Ethereum and particularly I'm noticing that in the Ethereum community there's been some big changes was very cool, very well-received, but even before that there's been changes at the Ethereum Foundation. We've got new executive directors, new leadership, a clearer, more focused roadmap it seems at least it's been communicated as such. We've got other third party groups like Etherealiz, I believe is in front of Congress as we're recording this and he's talking about Ethereum. He's talking about decentralization. These are things that it's felt like Ethereum has not had in place before and has lacked. And I'm wondering your reaction to this. So changes the EF, you know, institutions that are still early but like Etherealize, are you feeling that momentum change? And and how do you view all of this? Yeah. The change has been organic over the last little while. It's actually been going on inside the Ethereum Foundation for perhaps a year where they've been thinking about how to reorganize and interviewing people etc. been in discussions with leadership, a whole bunch of them, and I'm so excited with how they have reformatted themselves and and how they're approaching their major goals and and how they will interact more actively with the world, whether it's developers or or potentially policy people and governments. I think the Ethereum ecosystem is back in a pretty big way. If you think about the long trajectory of this adventure, I have likened it to how Google had done years and years of of bleeding edge research in AI. amassed all the best talent, built some truly brilliant things, domains like chess, etc. But they had a lot to protect first of all. They had a lot to lose. They had no clear indication that if they exposed the world mainstream to this profound new technology that it would go well. And so they needed a young upstart like Open AI who didn't have that much to lose to sort of create a sense of urgency for Google. And Google's just crushing it right now with Gemini, Notebook, LM, etc. and they're ju they're just going to keep crushing it cuz they've done so much good work. And I really feel like that sounds like the Ethereum ecosystem. We have the best and brightest, the best technology. We've been building for a what felt like a distant decentralized future. And it took a young upstart or or some loud Bitcoin maxis to to wake us not not really from a slumber but but from this idea that the the future is distant. I think it's it's really now and and I'm very confident that that ESBET is going to make that very clear to to Wall Street and then soon Main Street.\n\nSpeaking of now, we're also on the cusp of some stable coin legislation maybe going through under the Genius Act. Of course, Ethereum is home to a lot of the stable stable coins, the majority of of stable coins in terms of value and I believe also volume. Is this going to be a near-term catalyst for Ethereum at all or do do you think this is kind of a sideshow? Oh, yeah. I think I think once we get stable coin legislation, it's going to be a real shot in the arm for Ethereum and and for the ecosystem. I think stables backed by assets in centralized institutions is a great vector for growth and adoption. I'm also a little concerned about it. I think what we really need to see is Ether to go up in price very significantly and Bitcoin to go up in price very significantly because they both represent decentralized bandwidth, economic bandwidth. It's possible that one of you even invented that that phrase. I didn't invent it. Is that you, David? No, that's Ryan. That's Ryan. Oh, sweet. I'm Money Langos. He's economic bandwidth.\nGot it. So in terms of maker, we can have pure natively decentralized stable coins and we need that because we can't rely on you know centralized institutions potentially pulling the rug out from under us. So fingers crossed Bitcoin 3 million, Ether follows it, quart million, quart million and there there there will be ways to keep Bitcoin where it is where the bit the maxis like it and still make deployed in in DeFi on Ethereum. I for one am very much looking forward to that future of an Ethereum resurgence because I think it's a very boring unfulfilled world if what we have the focus of crypto is just Bitcoin on one side without the kind of the DeFi and centralized stable coins on the other. It's kind of not why we're doing this whole bankless thing. So hopefully Ethereum gets some more wind under its sales and maybe your bull posts will be part of this Joe. I look forward to seeing those on on Twitter because what I heard in this episode is a renewed commitment to get loud about Ether the asset. I I got a new job.\nWell, we will see you on Twitter then. Joe Lubin, thank you so much for joining us today on Bankless. Awesome. Thank you guys. It's fun. Guys, got to let you know, of course, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
