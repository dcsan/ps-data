  "cleanText": "[Music]\n[Applause]\nThere it is.\nHuge congratulations to Circle for being crypto's second biggest IPO.\nCoinbase is the first.\nThey didn't technically have an IPO, but details.\nUh, so we have our second big United States company going public, uh, and trading.\nRyan, first, uh, Circle shares were sold in the IPO at $31.\n$31 the day before.\nDo you know what Circle is trading at right now, about 1 hour into trading?\nOkay, I saw something about this, but it's significantly up, right?\nSo, um, I don't know.\nHas it doubled?\nIt has more than doubled.\nI'm looking at it right now.\nIt's trading at $88.50.\nIt also hit a peak high of $103, which is just crazy.\nSo almost a tripling out of the gate.\nA, a tripling out of the gate of the evaluation of Circle.\nI can't load this chart.\nIt's like it's breaking the charts, David.\nThat's why the charts broken.\nJust type in CRL.\nThat's the ticker of the Circle Internet Group, Inc.\nApparently, that's our company name trading on the NASDAQ.\nWow.\nJust a green line straight up.\nBig, big green line.\nYeah.\nYou're Well, you're going for a weekly candle.\nAnd let me tell you, it hasn't, it hasn't been trading for a while.\nI'll do the, um, I'll do the, uh, how do I do shorter time?\nTake click the W and go down to one minute.\nThere you go.\nUh, $20 billion is the valuation that Circle is trading at.\nPeople were initially pricing it at around six, six or seven billion currently trading.\nI mean, we're just, we're one and a half hours into trading.\nSo, you know, who knows?\nBut it's coming in at $20 billion.\nThey got to feel smart for like rejecting the Ripple offer, rejecting any Coinbase offers in the 6 to 9 billion, uh, range to just go in with his IPO.\nSo you have a lot more shareholder value here.\nYeah.\nWell, so far we, this, they, they still have like lockups and all that kind of stuff.\nSo things still need to play out, but yeah, they're coming in at a juicy, juicy valuation, which I mean, this sets the tone.\nThis sets the tone.\nA lot of people are saying, &quot;Oh, this is now going to be the starting gun for a variety of further crypto IPOs.&quot;\nI think people are looking at Kraken.\nUh, there are other companies that people are looking at.\nEveryone's talking about Bankless going public.\nUm, no one valuation.\nYou know what they are probably talking about after our episode last week?\nThey're probably using the word stable coin summer to describe this price action.\nOkay, I told you it was going to be stable coin summer and you said, &quot;How can people make money on stable coins?&quot;\nThe answer was right in front of us this entire time.\nThey just had to buy stocks.\nYeah, I've seen people's screenshots of their IPO purchase requests in Robin Hood and and other venues and they only got like oneird of it failed, one half of it failed.\nBut if you got any amount of Circle stock in the IPO buy, you are up like 2x.\nSo congratulations.\nI'm surprised that there's this investor appetite for this.\nLike this is surprising to me.\nIt is a little bit surprising to me and I'm like of two minds about this.\nUh, Circle is just the only good meaningful way of getting stable coin exposure for Trafi.\nThat is it's the only like valid, uh, conduit for stable coin exposure for we've been telling them they could buy ETH.\nETH is a stable coin platform.\nThe most stable coins are on ETH.\nYeah, that's right.\nETH not available on the NASDAQ though and apparently that matters.\nOkay.\nAnd so yeah, if you are bullish stable coins and you would like to have exposure to stable coins, you know, Circle is now trading on the NASDAQ on excuse me on the NYSE.\nUh, and so that's that's a way to do that.\nAnd so maybe you can read into this $20 billion valuation, this 3x higher valuation than than what people predicted because Wall Street is a super bullish stable coins, which we know they are.\nUh, and that's that's what's happening.\nThe other half of the story is like the story of Circle Economics, uh, which I don't know if that totally is defensible at a 20 billion dollar valuation because their income, their profit was like $130 something million over the last year.\nSo how does, how is $130 million of income justifying a $20 billion valuation and they still have that Coinbase deal where they split like almost half of the revenue or something or third of the revenue with Coinbase.\nYeah.\nAnd so I don't know if the market's disconnected from reality.\nMaybe Circle has plans to like clean this up and make the better economics, but I mean I know when you compare this to Tether, which I would love to see Tether go public, but that's never going to happen.\nImagine, right?\nI mean, for cryptonatives, we've always looked at sort of the income statement of Circle versus something like Tether.\nAnd as you said, I mean, Circle, it's got all of these, uh, additional costs here and it has to do this revenue share.\nIt amounts to a net income of 156 million.\nEven though they have h, how many, you know, billions in stable coins out there, not only billion, not only is tether like double that size in terms of the amount, triple in terms of the amount of stable coins issued, it's also, I don't know, like five, six billion a year in terms of profit is just like in a cash cow, incredible, like the number of employees it has, it's got, it's like one of the most profitable companies in existence these days and of course it'll never go, um, public in US markets.\nBut, uh, you, you can imagine if it did.\nYeah.\nBut nonetheless, this is just a monumental event for the crypto industry.\nLike I said, it's the second big United States company to go public.\nThe first IPO, Coinbase floated shares, which is like a different mechanism.\nUh, they actually did Circle actually did an IPO.\nUh, Jeremy Lair tweeted out, &quot;I'm incredibly proud and thrilled to share that Circle is now a public company listed on the NYSE under CRC.\n12 years ago, we set out to build a company that could help remake the global economic system by reimagining and rebuilding it from the ground up natively on the internet.\nSo, you also just have to sit back and reflect that this is just yet another huge milestone for the crypto industry.\nSo, congratulations to Jeremy and all the circle team.\nYeah, and I wonder if this will trade like based on the genius, uh, bill and that going through Congress if that will be reflected in the market price and this good way to educate Wall Street on that.\nWhat, what's this take that you included here?\nYeah, this is, uh, from David at Blockworks, Blockworks Research, I think Blockworks Advisory.\nYeah.\nHe says, &quot;With Circle going public today, one thing that the entire world is underweight on is Coinbase's venture portfolio.\nSpecifically, because he's calling out that there's a bunch of Coinbase investments that would not ever go, uh, liquid with a token, but instead will go liquid on the NASDAQ or at the NYSE.&quot;\nAnd so, he thinks that this is also a starting bell for like a valuation of a lot of Coinbase's venture portfolio.\nAnd generally venture capital, more companies, more crypto companies going public on public markets is always going to be good for u VC and he says that I would, I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase Ventures non-token portfolio is valued at 10 billion in two to three years now that the market is likely valuing it at zero today.\nI think the, the stock market, the, the traditional market does not understand the value of Coinbase ventures as a part of Coinbase equity.\nWell, I was, I know you, you, uh, follow Coinbase stock in like on a daily basis.\nYeah.\nSo, wait, was this up on the, the Circle IPO down?\nKind of.\nNot really.\nI mean, we're also dumping right now.\nI just got the notification that Bitcoin is below 103,000.\nSo, goodbye James Win.\nYou're out of here for the fourth time.\nUh, coin is down.\nIt was up.\nI don't know if it's trading at any sort of relevancy to Circle right now.\nWe got a lot more to talk about on the weekly rollup today, guys.\nUh, tariffs are back.\nAlso, a tax bill deficits are causing some tension in this Elon and Trump relationship.\nOkay, I don't know if that chapter is coming to a close.\nWe'll talk about that.\nAnd also, how Ray Dalio thinks you should position your portfolio as a result of these tax deficits.\nWe'll talk about that.\nRyan's going to bring you the very sophisticated macro takes.\nI, in contrast, have some macro memes for you for all of y'all.\nIf you guys talk about the breakup, aren't you?\nYeah.\nI'm going to talk about Well, I'm going to talk about the memes.\nWe're going to talk about the memes.\nI got some memes to show you.\nUh, Pump.fun wants to raise a billion dollars at a $4 billion valuation.\nBut the real news here is that a token is confirmed and I think an airdrop also confirmed.\nGot to be.\nYou can't have a token without an airdrop in these times.\nYeah, at least Pump.fun needs to have an airdrop.\nUh, and then also the Ethereum Foundation rolls out a new special forces team called Protocol along with some strategic restructuring and also new information about their treasury policy.\nSo, we are now getting Treasury policies from the EF, which is appreciated.\nYeah.\nAnd, uh, we got to talk about this, too.\nTrump, did the Trump team launch a crypto wallet that Trump knows absolutely nothing about?\nThis was the weirdest story of the week.\nWhich, which part of the Trump teams in the Trump universe launch is launching what product?\nWe don't really know anymore.\nWe got to, we got to figure this out, but we'll get to the bottom of it on this rollup.\nDavid, there's a meetup coming up that you wanted the Bankless Nation to hear about.\nThis is, uh, beers with Banklist in FRAX.\nWhen is this happening and where?\nYeah.\nSo if anyone is coming to PERMISSIONLESS, any Bankless listener that is coming to PERMISSIONLESS, we're doing a meet up with FRAX.\nUh, that is in Brooklyn.\nJust said that.\nFRAX.\nYeah.\nEmphasis on the FR.\nThat's good.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThis is happening at TA Beer Company.\nGreat beer company.\nUh, so we just rented out the place.\nWe're going to have free beers for all you listeners out there who want to come and get free beers.\nUm, and so there is a link in the show notes to, uh, register for the event.\nIf you are a Bankless citizen or a FRAX community member, you get priority access.\nUh, and I will see you all at PERMISSIONLESS.\nAwesome.\nTell me about markets, David.\nWhat's Bitcoin on the week?\nYou said dumpage earlier, and I'm kind of scared to look at this chart, but I'm going to.\nYeah, I think I need to go actually update my numbers.\nUh, looking at co Bitcoin right now, $103,0001 150, down 3.2% on the week.\nUh, Ether, Ryan, what?\nRyan, what did you do last week?\nWhat?\nI believe you, I believe you called for $3,000 Ether last week.\nY we are looking at 2567 just a little bit outside.\nWe are down 3.4% on the week.\nThis is just I got I got cocky.\nAll right.\nYou were glowing me up.\nYou were telling me about five, five week streak.\nEvery week I've been back.\nEth has been You're supposed to be the coolheaded one.\nI was super coolheaded and then I just got overly excited and in the moment I blurted out 3K.\nI wasn't planning to do that.\nIt just came out and now look at us.\nYou tried to manifest a little too hard.\nYeah.\nYou know, I'm going to be much more humble on rollups going forward.\nOkay.\nAnd I'm not making a price call this week.\nUh, it's kind of sad to see what like what's causing this dumpage, David?\nI don't know.\nI mean dumpage.\nWe're at Bitcoin's at 103,000.\nSo is that dumpage?\nI don't really know.\nCircle's up though.\nLike I mean are they, are they selling their Bitcoin and Ether and they're buying Circle stock?\nIs that literally what's happening?\nYeah.\nEveryone is dumping their assets to buy to pump Circle up to $20 billion.\nWe got, we got a total crypto market cap of 3.35 trillion down, uh, like 1% from from last week.\nBut also we got a mover of the week.\nOh, actually wouldn't call this a mover.\nWe have a crypto token launch.\nWe have these all the time.\nWe, we talk about them.\nWe celebrate them when they're in the trades, but we get them all the time.\nL3olanza, which is a ZK co-processor, uh, startup coming in at a whopping $1.25 billion valuation.\nThey just launched their, uh, for, uh, ZK co-processor, which is an extremely hard thing to like describe in a sentence.\nYeah, ZK cope, uh, processor.\nI can barely say it like so explain that one like and I thought infra was dead, right?\nThis is sort of niche.\nThis is deep, deep tech infra Ethereum infra and it's already 1.2 billion.\nYeah.\nA co-processor is like you know how blockchains all re doo their own computation and all the nodes do all their own computation.\nThis is kind of like not that the opposite of that where you just have one person do the ZK, uh, computation and then you can just show your work around.\nAnd I think it's like more generalized rather than like we talked about this for enshrining the LAYER 1 as a ZK rollup and that's how Ethereum will scale and I think this is like similar to that but more generalized.\nOkay.\nUm, but yeah 20% float so you know 80% is still locked but coming in at a $ 1.25 billion valuation.\nSo congratulations to L3olanza and L3olanza investors.\nL3olanza I believe L3olanza L3olanza I don't know.\nUh, tell me about these, uh, memes though.\nOh yeah.\nI got I got some memes for you.\nOkay.\nSo, you know the big beautiful bill that's going through Congress.\nI do know that.\nAnd actually, okay.\nBig Beautiful Bill.\nI It's always in quotes whenever I read it.\nThis is the tax bill that's going in Congress.\nOkay.\nI thought they were quoting Donald Trump who's calling it the big beautiful bill.\nDo you know that's literally the name of the bill, David?\nYeah.\nIt's literally the name of the bill.\nThey're calling it.\nYes.\nYeah.\nI had no idea.\nIt's literally a congressional bill.\nIt's called One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\nThat's the name of it.\nYeah.\nAnd so this is this is going through Congress.\nIt's it's kind of like I guess Donald Trump.\nIt's Donald Trump's budget.\nUh, it's Donald Trump's\n\n\nIt's like a big, big deal. It's his proposed budget. The bill is a meme in itself. Like the title of the bill, it's just like, what are we doing here? We could unpack all of the details of the bill, but that's the beautiful thing about memes. There's actually a lot of information here.\n\nOkay, so this is the Better Call Saul Mill meme where he's just like presenting a board to people, and the board says, \"We cut spending by increasing spending,\" and it's Donald Trump's face. Then, if you go to the next meme, and it's Donald Trump showing documents to this interviewer. This happened, I think, in the Trump 1.0, you know, confused. He's like, \"I have a plan to cut spending.\" And then he shows the papers to the interviewer, and the paper says, \"We're going to increase the spending.\" And the interviewer is just super confused.\n\nAnd then here's Elon Musk. So this is when this becomes drama in the White House. So, uh, this is the train running into a school bus meme, and the school bus represents money that the Doge has saved the government, and then the train just ramming through that thing. It's Trump's big beautiful bill. So apparently, the Trump's BBB is going to add something like $2 trillion of budget deficit.\n\nOh, you have the numbers. I have the numbers. I did the research for this section. You've got the memes. You've done the research. I've got the memes, but the memes are better. I don't even think I need to explain any details. It's literally what's happening.\n\nBut okay, does this also imply some kind of tension in the Trump-Elon relationship? The Trump-Elon relationship is totally broken up. Okay. Should we play this? This is Donald Trump. Elon is out. Bessent is in. I'm going to play this clip. Donald Trump, uh, he said the most beautiful things about me, and he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. He's talking about Elon. \"I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. I'm very disappointed. I'm very disappointed.\" Yeah. And he did do a lot for Elon. He got into the Tesla. He shilled Tesla. He did that whole \"everything's computer\" meme. Oh, brother. Elon did a lot for Trump, too, though. Okay. And in fact, he was, uh, did he though? Oh, he did. That's true. That's true. Yeah, he did do a lot. Taking credit for getting Trump elected, basically, in another tweet that I saw recently this morning, also getting Republicans, both the House and the Senate. Yeah, this was true.\n\nI did see this tweet from Elon Musk about the big beautiful bill. Uh, he's saying about the bill, \"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. You know you did wrong. You know it.\" Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Holy [ __ ]! Let's get a little spicy out here. Wow. Wow. Yeah.\n\nAnyway, anyway, so my big takeaway here is that, okay, other than the Elon-Trump drama, which is always hilarious, uh, is that even despite Elon Musk, who is an insanely good operator, no one can argue that he has made massive companies, he is a process engineer, he knows how to do process and organization. Elon Musk went toe-to-toe with government bureaucracy, tried to cut spending, tried to lean up the government, and lost big time. Like, did not actually save any money. So if Elon Musk cannot get the government to lean up and be more efficient and save money, no one can. And without that, like all Trump is doing is like, \"Okay, you know what? F it. $2 trillion more deficit. Uh, and then meanwhile, I'm also gonna issue a Bitcoin ETF with one of my companies. Uh, so Bitcoiners are always right. Bitcoiners are always right.\" That's another thing we should talk about. That is what he's doing.\n\nI, you know, there's so much you could say about Doge. I mean, of course, Elon Musk was, he was doing the cuts in the executive branch, right? The existing government operations. And the big cost of the future are really entitlement programs, aren't they? It's like that's, you know, so he wasn't even tackling the things that needed to be cut.\n\nThis big beautiful bill, you are right, it would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years time. Okay, so because this bill has both, uh, tax cuts, right, which decreases US revenue, and it also has spending, uh, spending cuts as well. And so if you kind of like add this together, it amounts to a $2.4 trillion deficit. Uh, the odds of it, so it passed through the House already, like the last week of May. And the odds of it getting passed the Senate, they're saying, are about 50/50 there. There's four Republicans in the Senate who might flip over, not get it approved. But Trump wants it. He's like, \"Get it on my desk. I want to sign this thing by the 4th of July. This is the biggest tax cut and spending cut in history. It's a big beautiful bill,\" right? So, I mean, like, did anyone seriously think any government from either party, Democrats or Republicans, was going to reverse the deficit, uh, problem that we have? Like, was there ever any hope of that? Was anyone ever serious about that?\n\nI was hopeful. Yeah. I thought they started off this administration pretty serious about that, and I was like optimistic. It's like, okay, we're doing the pain thing, which if we're ever going to get back on track and have like fiscal responsibility, it's going to take pain. And like that sucks, but I guess I guess we're doing it. And I can't really complain because it's a responsible thing. And I was on board with that. And turns out, no, it wasn't. It never was. Yeah. I didn't think it would, like, I was not as hopeful as you were, David. I was super bearish. I know that they were talking about it, right? But they wanted to appear like they were doing, not actually, uh, go through the pain.\n\nDid you see Ray Dalio's post about this? So, he's coming out with a book, and he explains it this way. So he compares it to a household, and, uh, the US right now, this year, revenue to the household is $5 trillion. That's what the US makes in tax revenue. Okay. Expenses, the stuff it's spending, $7 trillion. So if you take, and plus the US as a household has a lot of debt out there, about $30 trillion of debt, or six times its revenue. And for actual households in the US, so if you're a US citizen with a household, you are about $230K in debt. That's your portion of the $30 trillion of US debt. Yes, you are a household. $30,000 of debt. Yes. That's yours. That's a United States citizen. Yes. That's right. Wow. Yeah. And the, so the annual interest on that debt is about $1 trillion, of course. And some of the debt comes due, right? Because it's debt, it's got a term, about $9 trillion comes due in the next little bit. Okay. And the hope of the US government from a, from a, um, fiscal position is hoping that creditors or others will just like relend to them, re-lend, renew the terms, keep doing it, which they have so far. So Dalio says, he just sums it up. He's like, \"This is the current condition.\" That's it, David. $230K in debt. And, um, you know, what do you think he says? What do you think his portfolio prescription is for all of this? Knowing Dalio the way you know, not bonds. Yes. Yeah. Whatever. Not, doesn't say Bitcoin. Did he say Bitcoin? Yeah. Okay. So, yes. I mean, he said Bitcoin before, so it's not the first time. Can I give you, uh, I would have expected him to go straight to gold. I know, but I've been reading Dalio. He's been talking about this for years. We've both been talking about it for, like, we've been talking about stuff for. Yeah. He's, yeah, sure. So, uh, this is what he says. \"I suggest diversifying well in asset classes in countries that have strong income statements. I don't know where you find those. And balance sheets and not having great internal political and, uh, external geopolitical conflicts.\" Again, I don't know where you find those. Sorry, Dalio. Underweighting debt assets like bonds. Basically, you know, he's saying bonds are [ __ ]. Sell bonds. And overweighting gold and wait for it, and a bit of Bitcoin. A bit of Bitcoin. What do you think he means by that? Do you think over or under 1%? It's a bit, you know, so that's up for you to define. I mean, for some people listening, that might mean 50% plus. Just a, just a little bit of your portfolio. Just a little bit. So, are we talking like Michael Sailor or above or above or below Michael Sailor's level of Bitcoin? Come on, though. This is notable. I mean, we've been doing this podcast for, for how long? And now, Dalio's, we've always been wondering, \"Hey, you're on the gold train. Why are you not on the digital commodity train?\" There he is with Bitcoin. Yeah. So I remember in the 2021 cycle, we talked about Dalio a lot because that's when, you know, United States did the helicopter money and all that kind of stuff, and we were, we were just saying, \"Ray Dalio, say Bitcoin, just say Bitcoin,\" and he was like gold, and we're like, \"No,\" and then we would say, \"But he actually means crypto assets, he doesn't just mean gold,\" and sure enough, we were right, just had to wait for it.\n\nAll right, coming up next on the opposite side of Ray Dalio and Macro, we're going to talk about Pump.fun getting ready to launch a token. Uh, and then Ethereum is in front of Congress this week. So, what was said in front of Congress and who was representing, and also the SEC giving clarity on staking, ETH staking? What's downstream of all of that? But first, before we get there, we're going to talk about Uniswap, our sponsor. It's a browser wallet. It's a mobile wallet. It's the best place to do DeFi. Let's go hear from Uniswap right now.\n\nUniswap is your gateway to a more efficient DeFi experience. With Uniswap, swapping and bridging across 13 chains is simple, fast, and cost-effective, helping you move value wherever, whenever. Thanks to deep liquidity on the Uniswap protocol, you'll enjoy minimal price impact on every trade. And now, Uniswap V4 takes it even further. Swappers benefit from gas savings on multihop swaps and ETH trading pairs, while liquidity providers can create new pools at 99% lower costs. The best part, you don't have to do anything extra. Each trade is automatically routed through Uniswap X, V2, V3, and V4, so you get the most efficient swap without even thinking about it. Whether you're swapping, sending, on-ramping, off-ramping, or bridging, Uniswap's web app and wallet gives you the tools to unlock DeFi's full potential on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Uni chain, and more. Use Uniswap's web app and wallet for a more efficient way to use DeFi.\n\nImagine verifying yourself without handing over personal data. No hacked databases, no unnecessary personal exposure for airdrops, and no AI bots ruining community governance. Meet Self, the onchain identity verification protocol built for privacy and control. Self protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to confirm your identity safely. Users prove key details like age or citizenship without revealing sensitive personal information. Self never stores your data. It only generates cryptographic proofs. Here's how it works in three steps. First, register and verify. Use the Self app to scan your biometric passport's RFID chip. Self verifies authenticity with zero-knowledge proofs. Each passport creates one unique identity. Second, you can share proofs privately. Third-party apps request identity proofs like confirming you're over 18. You can also link proofs securely to public wallets for airdrops or governance participation. And then last, secure verification. Apps validate your proofs instantly onchain, like on Cello or offchain. Audited by ZK security, the Self app is live on iOS and Play Store. Visit self.xyz and follow Self protocol on X.\n\nPump Fund wants to raise $1 billion via a token sale, which would include a public sale. So Pump Fund doing an ICO for a token, okay, at a $4 billion valuation. So they want to raise $1 billion. They want to grow a $1 billion treasury and launch their token at a $4 billion. And this is an ICO. You said there are still, we're still getting, looking for more details. I think what's happening is that they are just like talking to VCs, talking to potential investors, trying to find, is this coming from investors or is it going to be, is there going to be some sort of a public sale, you think? Uh, I'm, from what I'm reading, what I've heard, and also what is, uh, you know, reported on by Blockworks again, is also talking to what they said, two sources with knowledgeable knowledge of the matter, um, said that there is looking to be a public sale and an airdrop. There's a Twitter account who tweeted out, \"Pump Fund launching pump token in the next two weeks. Airdrop for users confirmed as well.\" And then one person says like, \"Are you laring or give me, give me sources?\" And then this Twitter person says, \"Nope. Source close to the team confirmed seed investors already know.\" And so if, if they are looking to raise $1 billion, they're going around to investors in the space and showing like terms and talking about terms. And so that's how this would ultimately get to some news reporting agency like Blockworks. Uh, and so a loose confirmation of an airdrop, loose confirmation of a $4 billion dollar valuation public sale. Uh, what do you think about $4 billion for Pump Fund? What do you think about that?\n\nI was going to ask you the same question, David and Ashley. Okay, let me give you some more comps here first, and then, uh, get your answer in mind, but let's, let's compare it to Circle. Okay, they were hitting the bell earlier. So, uh, the app Pump.fun has already generated $700 million in cumulative revenue, cumulative revenue on a very small team. So you got to imagine the vast bulk of that is actually\n\n\nProfit. We said earlier what's uh annualized Circle doing these days? 150, 140, 150, 150 million. All right, versus let's call it, you know, 600 million in uh, you know, annual profit for Pump.fun. Okay, Circle, what did we say? $20 billion. Pump.fun, $4 billion. Which is the better deal, David? Which would you rather buy today? Pump.fun or Circle? When you put it like that? Wow. Pump.fun seems like really cheap. I don't, I don't know what the And so the the revenue for Pump.fun has come down. They made a lot of their money and with like, I think that their peak revenue was around the Trump memecoin launch because that's when all meme coins just like went absolutely gang busters. Uh, looking at more recent time frames of revenue, Pump.fun has made $6.5 million of revenue over the last 30 days and that annualizes out to $78 million if this dune board that we're looking at is accurate. So $78 million of less, less than say, let's say they have, they have like $8 million of cost. Very slim team. Maybe it's less, maybe it's more. $8 million. They're making $70 million a year. Sure. So durability of the revenue is a question, isn't it? Yeah. For $4 billion valuation at $70 million of revenue annualized, that there's a gap there. Well, it depends what you think, right? So like, um, h, what's the moat? You know what Pump.fun kind of reminds me of uh, to be honest? Like, I'm not sure. So I am not convinced of the durability of memecoins. It's certainly durable this cycle, but if, and I think they will persist. Don't get me wrong. Meme coins will always be a thing, right? But you have, I, I sort of think of Pump.fun as open, almost like the OpenSea of last cycle, right? You had NFTs, OpenSea was dominant, looked unstoppable. What happened? Well, NFTs went down. You had other competitors like Blur launch, do things a little bit differently, uh, you know, suck up some of that liquidity and also the NFT market collapsed, right? Easy. Like, and so the dynamics around meme coins in crypto, you're, you're taking some bets on the future here and there's so much disruption that could happen in terms of like the market dynamics or new entrance. It's really hard to think about like that versus buying a Circle. Not that we're seriously, you know, like considering these two things, I suppose, but I, I just have questions about the durability of this lead and the durability of the space. I, I think the comparison of Pump.fun to OpenSea in 2021 is one that many people are are making. Uh, and this is a, so we have a bullish tweet and and a not bullish tweet. Uh, Vanna Charmer Mossi, he was on Chopping Block recently, great episode. Uh, he, he made that point, uh, of just like, this is, this is more of a flash in the pan. Uh, this is more of a one-time meta. Um, I'm not totally convinced. I think that, I think there's two ends of the spectrum here. There is 2021 OpenSea, which like raised at a $13 billion valuation at the absolute top. Uh, and they, I don't think they could even be valued at like half a billion right now. Uh, and so, so there's that, there's that end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is like, this is actually 2013 Coinbase actually. Memecoins do have incredible durability across time. You know, Dogecoin has been around for a long time. Memecoins were not, you know, created by Pump.fun. Uh, memecoins have been around, Pump.fun has really like captured it and so it's actually much closer to 2013 Coinbase in which meme coins are here forever and there are meaningful attempts at dethroning uh, Pump.fun. There's believe, there's virtuals, there's other successful, yet they've, they've had some success. Yeah, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say not success. And so there's actually going to be always a consistent interest in funding Pump.fun competitors because of the durability of meme coins. And so that's the bullish end of the spectrum. I, I'm somewhere in the middle. Uh, I think $4 billion is kind of, kind of rich. I don't think the $4 billion token is going to make any like investor at $4 billion valuation. You're not going to like 10x that, you're rich off of that. How do you get to 50 billion from that? How do you get to 100 billion on that? So this is uh, the the bullish tweet. It's been about 8 months now and I hope you're starting to see the vision for where Pump is headed. They're going after platforms like Twitch and Tik Tok. It's only a matter of time before creators realize they can monetize far more effectively on Pump. That's the take. That's interesting. Placing Pump.fun shoulder-to-shoulder with Twitch and Tik Tok, I think is interesting as a content platform where it's actually content first more than token first. I think that's really interesting. The problem though is just like how much, how much do you get from that if you're a creator? I mean, there is something um, extractive from your community about meme coins or there certainly can be and oftentimes the incentives lead towards shortcuts, extraction, people feeling burnt. Everyone wants to buy the memecoin so that it goes up, right? But when it goes down, it sucks. No one wants to collect the memecoin. Meme coins are not collectibles. Yeah. If you're a creator, you launch something, it goes up, you're amazing. It goes down, you're hated. You are hated. Get off the internet. They hate you. Right. Like it's just very volat, what do you think the uh, aggregate market cap of all Pump.fun meme coins is? Like if you had the market cap of all them, add them together. Just the Pump.fun ones. Not just the ones pumped on. Yeah, exactly. That's right. I would get five billion, something like this. Yeah, pretty close. 4.5 billion. 4.5 billion. Same as the market cap of the platform. Yeah, that's interesting. I don't know what that tells me. That's, that's, I also don't, It's interesting. I also don't know what it tells me. I think uh, BNB, uh, somebody was, I posed this question to Twitter. BNB is actually like far worse in the sense that the valuation of BNB is massive. BNB, Binance chain thing. Binance chain. Yeah. The aggregate value of Binance chain. You know, people call this a casino. Binance chain is a casino. Um, people, the the value of all aggregate tokens on Binance is like one-tenth the value of BNB itself. But granted, Binance exchange buys and burns BNB and so you're actually investing in like Binance revenues too. So maybe it's not a very good comparison. Real hard to compare Circle and BNB and Pump. Compare Circle and Pump.fun shoulder-to-shoulder. Let's, let's throw in, you know, a bank like JP Morgan. Compare that to um, well, let's talk about the Ethereum Foundation update this week. So the pro, a protocol special forces team. All right. So some people saw this tweet um, from the Ethereum Foundation announcing protocol and they were like, \"What? Like, what is protocol? You guys protocol?\" like question mark. What, what is protocol? Uh, protocol, I, I think is just the name of a very slimmed down research and development team that has been categorized into three swim lanes. Three lanes, you know, you know, the Verge, urge, splurge, all those are gone. There are now just three. They're still there. We just don't talk about, they're still there, but like, this is not what we're talking about. This is not how we're presenting it. Uh, what they are now is first track, scale the layer 1, led by Tim Beiko and Onsgar. Okay, second track, Scale Blobs, led by Alex Stokes and Franchesco Diamato. And third track, improve UX, led by Barnab and Josh Rudolph. And then Donrad is the person orchestrating all of these things. So he's kind of like the head of these three independent teams. Each team is only two people and then Donrad is the guy at the top. And this is the Ethereum development team. This is the people dictating the next steps of the protocol. Love it. Uh, and the EF wrote in the blog post, \"The process of shipping protocol is messy, asking us to respond proactively to demands that are hard to articulate and even harder to fulfill. This moment may be Ethereum's best shot at deploying not only our technology but our values at planetary scale. Uh, and this announcement also came with a reduction in staff and so there were layoffs from the Ethereum Foundation.\" Tim Beiko wrote, \"As a part of this reorientation, we have also revisited our team structures. We'll be doubling down on some areas and reducing efforts in others. This resulted in us deciding to part ways with some efers whose skill sets no longer matched our priorities.\" So, uh, yeah. Okay. Remember when I'm going to invoke uh, he who might not, might not, must, must not be named by the Ethereum community. That person is, there's so many of them. Who are you about to say? There's some money. That's one of them. Yeah. When we had him on the show, we were like, \"Okay, Kyle, like, what do you think we need? Like, what does Ethereum need to do?\" And he goes, \"Yeah, Ethereum needs to go into war mode. Like there needs to be, Didn't he say fire people? There needs to be fire people. Yeah. A wartime CEO needs to come in. It needs to like, people need to get fired. Well, didn't he also say fire retalic somewhere else or am I misremembering that? Did he, I'd have to go back and rewatch. Anyways, I'm seeing Donrad being elevated to a position of very strong leadership, people being fired, laid off, and the organization being restructured to be able to, as Tim said, uh, ship code, uh, ship technology at a planetary scale. It's good. That's what I'm saying. I think this is good. This is like, uh, you know, um, to, to me, this is Tamas coming in. This is absolutely Tamas. This is Tamas. He's bringing organizational executional firepower, a thing that the EF, for all of its great things, and there are many great things about the EF as a piece, it was missing, to be honest, not executing on things, particularly the road map, not having clear timelines, communication, and he's just putting names accountable and leaders accountable for specific deliverables, and these deliverables are exactly where Ethereum needs to go and the technology is there if Ethereum could just execute on this road app, likely things are going to go very well from here. Yes. And there's still a big if, but I'm starting to see mounting confidence here, right? Like this is, this is a good sign to me. Uh, scale L1, scale the blobs, improve UX. These are all the things that and now we have a team that's executing on it. It's called protocol. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I do these kind of hightouch episodes uh, that require like multiple guests being stitched together. So I, I'm doing Ryan interviews with each of these teams for like 20, 25 minutes each. Going to stitch them together. Hopefully Donrad gets back to me on Telegram and says yes, I'm down to be the co-host cuz I'm going to get Don as the co-host because he's the guy. Uh, and so I'm trying to make that episode happen. So bear with me. That would be a fantastic episode. Not the only news coming out of the EF. Uh, so the EF has also released a new Treasury policy. So we're finally getting some clarity about the EF's Treasury. because it has some ETH in its in its treasury. It has some ETH in its treasury. Yes. Uh, the big line, I think we intend to reduce our annual OPEX roughly linearly over the next 5 years ending at a long-term 5%. So the EF wants to spend just 5% of its treasury every single year. Uh, down from 15% where it is now. Uh, in addition to that, the EF will seek to earn acceptable returns on treasury assets. So they're going to invest, make their assets more productive. They both have uh, stablecoins and ETH as well. They're going to invest in a manner consistent with Ethereum's underlying principles and also quarterly reports will be a thing. So, we're going to get quarterly reports uh, with going back to the that investing their ETH uh, topic. They want to support nent DeFi protocols to help develop privacy features and they're going to like allocate deposit their ether into DeFi protocols in order to get a yield but primarily emphasize what they are calling DeFi punk protocols. So, what's D5 punk? I'm so glad you asked. Uh, DeFi apps that prioritize security, uh, being open source. Financial self-sovereignty. I think we would call that banklessness. Uh, tech solutions over trustbased solutions. So no multi-sigs, no reliance on legal coercion as recourse. Uh, active deployment of cryptographic tools to protect civil liberties. Not sure what that means. Uh, and then also privacy. So the EF is trying to make their capital productive by also leveraging what they are calling DeFi punk. uh, DeFi apps, which I think we would have always called these DeFi apps, but the word DeFi has kind of been diluted that they needed to remake. Yeah, you, that makes sense. DeFi punk is just DeFi 1.0. We're just calling everything DeFi these days. Hyperl, that's DeFi. Sure. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. I would say just a refresher, how much, how much ETH does the EF hold? Like, I'm just recalling this from memory. If someone were to make me guess, I would say it's like, it's pretty low compared to other foundations as a percentage of supply, right? Something like 1%, it might even be less than 1%. Now that amounts to a lot of money because ETH is just so massive in terms of uh, size, but it's not very much as a portion of total ETH supply. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, if this Google search is correct, uh, the foundation's total treasury is about $970 million, uh, $790 million in crypto and $180 million in non-crypto assets. I'm guessing that's, that's dollars. Yeah. Uh, so less than a billion dollars. Yeah, less than a billion dollars. They really have to make it last, I guess. You know, it's good though uh, for them to, to like roll out these policies. Quarterly reports is going to be really nice. Yeah, I have a conspiracy theory. I like to challenge all other layer 1 foundations to issue quarterly reports about their financials. Maybe they will because I have a little bit of a conspiracy theory for you. I think part of the reason the EF is doing more of this transparency. I mean, there's lots of reasons. Cultural change, all of these things.\n\n\nIt's all good. They realized they woke up from their slumber, all of these things. Part of it, I think, is the SEC is no longer on their throat. Oh, I definitely think that's true. So, they can actually add more leadership and more coordination in the space, including things like quarterly reports. In the past, if they did a quarterly report, you know, Gary Gendler would point at that, bring it into a court case and say he was already snooping around trying to say that Ether, the asset, was a security, that EF is kind of like a, you know, centralized corporation. And if they had a quarterly report of some kind, he would bring that. I would be emissible in court and he'd use it against them. I think this is part of the reason we're seeing more leadership. I think you're absolutely correct. There's also a story of like Vitalik is just not an operator. He's just not an executive. And so, it's a little bit of both. You definitely see Tomas fingerprints on this. Uh but also on this one, Shawe, this is Shaw's work. Uh so, if we're gonna tip hats to, we also have to tip hats to Shaw. Amazing. Um, let's tip a hat to Vitalic here. Actually, this is him commenting on Ethereum layer 1 scalability. How fast should we see a lot of these changes to the L1 that have been talked about in the last couple months? Yeah. Okay. Uh, so my view is like generally I think we should scale L1 by about 10x over the next year and a bit based on delay. Why the in a bit? Why why not be more ambitious here? Uh, no, year would be great. It's great just to see this rep prioritization and this like can do attitude of scaling the layer one just permeate around the Ethereum culture. I've been I've been pushing for this for a while now. Like I went back and forth like last year I was like yeah we need to scale the way know the path that we're on. It took me a while to like get dug into this like conviction around scaling. I've been I've been pushing different parts of the Ethereum community for the last like I don't know two three months. I was in the daily great discord like fighting with them and they were like no we we we can't do this like the engineers you don't know anything David that the engineers don't know and then you see the engineers start saying yeah we're going to scale the layer one I'm like thank you it's just an attitude thing it's just an you can we can do things we can do there's there's also there is also there are some trade-offs with scaling too much but I feel like the the um Ethereum researchers know they got the get out of jail free card now which is zk tech is really catching up and so that's going to allow massive scale here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was a conversation in the BANKLESS discord from Centauri, one of our BANKLESS citizens who said to get a tenants X increase in a year we need to pressure larger operators to change the gas limit on their nodes. Which brings us to this tweet from Victor Buunan who is a protocol specialist at Coinbase and he says, \"Hey, so Coinbase is once again one of the first large operators to signal the increasing gas limit. People used to bully us to go faster, but guess it's now it's our turn to bully others. So he tags Lido, P2P, Figment, Helm, Chorus, and say, \"Yo guys, it is time to increase the layer 1 gas to 60 million.\" Right now is at 36 million. Let's get it up to 60 million gas on the layer 1. So there are people from LA who are listening. There are people from P2P who are listening. Uh you are requested the gas. You're requested to pump the gas. Do it. Let's do it. All right. We got a lot more coming up. David Sailor, Michael Sailor found a way to raise more money to buy Bitcoin. I'm shocked. Yes, he did. Which couch cushion did he look under this time? Yeah, who knows? Did the Trump team launch a crypto wallet? Some say yes, some say no. Maybe we'll find that up for debate. Also, David, SBF, his story. It's headed to Netflix. We got to talk about who's playing SBF's role and also Caroline's role, of course. All that and more.

MANTLE, bridging tradi and defi so you don't have to. Tweet from Michael Sailor. Strategy today announced the launch of a stride. That's a ticker symbol strd. A new perpetual preferred stock offering available to institutional investors. All right. I thought I thought Michael Sailor already had a stock offering and that was called Micro Strategy MSTR. Now he's got STRD that he's releasing. What's going on? Explain this. Yeah, it turns out he also has STRF which has already been trading for a while. So we were trying to understand what's going on here. So Micro Strategy MSTR is the common stock and you know how you know how like Pendle kind of unwraps tokens and allows you to express different um different different ways of having complicated equity stuff to me in DeFi crypto language. Yeah, but it's a little it's a little bit like that. So if you are maximally bullish Bitcoin and you would like to express that bullishness with MST with Micro Strategy, you would buy MSTR. You would buy the common stock. Sure. STRF is a 10% like coupon, a series A perpetual strife preferred equity. So it's it's this thing that exists in this like no man's land between equity and a bond, a corporate bond. It's preferred. So if common stockholders get wiped out because some you know something real bad happens the preferred equity owners are able to get paid out first. They get paid out first. Okay. Yes. Exactly. And so you as a STRF preferred Strife preferred equity owner. You get paid a 10% coupon or 10% like dividend yield a fixed 10% cumulatively. That's the benefit. So if the board skips a payment because it doesn't make any make any money, it piles up and you will get paid that payment that you are owed later. Okay. It's at the top of the equity stack. So like you said, uh if um if anything, this gets paid out first. It is the most safe, most defensible. This new thing that he that Micro Strategy is issuing is STRD, which is closer the third thing, the third asset. So he has Micro Strategy, he has STRF, now he has STRD, not yet trading. It's a 10% series A perpetual stride preferred. So it is junior. It also pays 10%. But if Micro Strategy cannot make a payment and it does it misses a payment, you do not get that payment. You do not get that payment later unlike STRF. And so it's also junior to STRF. It's also junior. And so if Micro Strategy gets wiped out, you will also get wiped out because now you won't be getting any more payments. And so this is like it's a little bit sus out the creditworthiness of Micro Strategy. So I think if something breaks in Micro Strategy, this thing will get wiped out first. Like this thing will go to zero first. Uh STRF will go to zero last and then Micro Strategy just trades like a like a company. So the reason he's doing it is so that he can sell this new Stride uh shares basically and raise another what 250 million or so to go do what? What's he going to do with 250 million? I don't know. You know, buy buy a few bitcoins here and there. And so yeah, he's got these two additional credit vehicles that he can sell more in and if the market perceives him to be creditw worthy, the price of these things will go up and he'll be able to sell more. Okay. So for an investor, did I did I see Dylanair over here on Twitter call these kind of like junk bonds? It's the the the Stride is kind of like the junk bond version. Yeah. The the most recent one that he issued. Yes. Yeah. It's kind of like it's junior. you're not getting the the guaranteed payments, you know, it's like I don't know. It seems maybe some investors will want this, but it seems the worst of a couple of worlds here, right? Cuz you're not getting it in this really interesting way. He's issuing a 1,000year USD Bitcoin swap and buying the Bitcoin upfront. The balance sheet itself is extremely delevered. And so he's using whatever capital, whatever dollars he has to pay loans in order to buy Bitcoin upfront so he can get it as from he can pull forward the future as much as possible. Yeah. And then sell that future into Bitcoin. And then assuming that it appreciates, it'll be totally fine. So long as you don't get overleveraged and so long as number keeps going up, it'll be totally fine. I know that. As long as number goes up, it I mean, even if number goes down, he's also still fine. Probably he made a bad bet or a worse bet. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, all right. Let's talk about Trump. David, I saw a tweet talking about a new crypto wallet that the Trump team launched. I went to the website. This is kind of what you see on the website. All right. There's It's like Trumpwallet.com. Guys, I don't know if you should go to this or not because I I don't even know if it's real. I I actually thought it might be campaign. Okay, it is real. Anyway, the news was, this came out of crypto media sources like Bitcoin Magazine, etc. that Trump had launched a crypto wallet where you could buy, sell, trade. The Trump token was featured um inside of the crypto wallet and it was like the Trump version of a crypto wallet in case you like you're done with UNISWAP and MetaMask wallets and you just like you wanted your Trump wallet, you know, cuz you got a hold of your crypto in the Trump wallet. So that was the news and then something funny happened which was the sons of Donald Trump, Eric and Donald Jr. started denying that this thing was real. They denied affiliation with this whole thing. And so the the launch of the Trump and wallet got community noted saying the Trump organizations have not have distanced themselves from this. Right. And so crypto media started reporting on this. Mainstream media started reporting on this. Funny though. Magic Eden the uh it was originally it was an NFT platform right on on Salana. Now they're maybe doing more things. They started doing Bitcoin ornamentals. They bought Slingshot wallet. Yeah. Yeah. They said that this was real. In fact, they had helped um you develop this in partnership with Trump and when pressed guys hey they're saying it's not real. The the sons of Trump are saying this is not real. Magic Eden said no it's real. This we really have a deal with the Trump organization. So I left the story here. They said they are partnering with the Trump memecoin team which is I mean the same people as well. So Eric Donald Jun Eric's tweet he says that World Liberty Financial and that group which he's a part of has nothing to do with the Trump wallet and that's not anything to do with any Trump organization. Okay. But they do have something to do with the Trump memecoin. Right. But apparently has Yeah. Apparently this is a Trump meme. This is not a world liberty financial wallet. This is a Trump memecoin wallet. But they imply Trump has nothing to do with it. this Trump organizations have nothing to do with this. But that's not quite true. Somebody in the Trump organization has something to do with it and did indeed roll this out. Magic Eden, which is a legit company, uh, is doubling down on the fact that this is real and it would be ridiculous for them to like launch a Trump wallet without actually being able to claim that to be true. Here's Donald Trump Jr. saying the Trump Organization has zero involvement with the product product. Eric and I know nothing about it. They that they know nothing about it. So, What is the URL? Do you know what the URL is? I think I thought it was Trumpwallet.com. I'm going to Trumpwallet.com and it is giving me a site cannot be reached. Okay. So maybe maybe it's maybe the wrong\n\n\nURL.\n\nAnyways, uh, unrelated but also related, I saw this tweet from Molly White, which I think kind of explains everything, and it is a uh kind of like an org chart map of all of the different Trump entities and all of their crypto dealings. And wow, it kind of looks like spaghetti. Uh yeah, and there's like an unknown associations and there's known associations. And so you got World Liberty Financial, you got the Trump memecoin, you got the Trump NFTs, you got the Melania NFTs, you have some people who are part of the Melania NFTs plus World Liberty Financial organization. You have other people who are part of the memes and then like different part of the Trump meme coin, or it's just a kind of a mess. And so I kind of am not surprised that somebody in Trump's orbit and influence and part of his companies like goes and pioneers a Trump wallet and a different part of the Trump cryptoverse is like unaware of that happening because I think they're all operating on under their own initiative, and somebody just decided to make a wallet, and the other side of the Trump cryptoverse is like, \"I didn't know about that.\" That must be it, right? The the website and the offering said it was the official Trump wallet and the official like, you know, Trump memecoin wallet endorsed by Donald Trump. They said this explicitly. This is the president of the United States, right? As like a big media empire, world's most powerful man. You wouldn't want to put that out there. No way. If you didn't really have some sort of permission there, right? And if you're going to lie about that, you would you would launch and then rug a memecoin. You wouldn't launch a project that you... I thought it was... I thought, \"Okay, this is Lazarus Group or something like this,\" and like this is kind of a, you know, they spun up a website, this is not real, they've hacked Magic Eden's account. It's really hard to unbundle what's going on. What's interesting about this spaghetti mess here is I do actually think Trump has some legitimate projects here. I keep hearing that the World Liberty Financial team is like a pretty solid team. They're building a treasury of crypto assets, like they're doing protocol. They haven't gotten hacked or exploited, or I haven't lost any money. That could actually be something. And then you have other areas, which is like the Trump memecoin and like whatever that is. And then you have Trump wallet, and you have Melaniacoin, whatever that is. And then there was also, you mentioned earlier in the episode, Trump Media, which they're the Truth Social parent company, I believe, if I'm understanding this correctly. They are rolling out a Bitcoin ETF as well. So, they're registering for a Bitcoin ETF, which a Bitcoin ETF product is, you know, legitimate as well. So, what do you make of all this? You know, I'm... You said the World Liberty Financial is legitimate. I'm going to the worldlibertyfinancial.com place cuz like, you know, it's supposed to be an app. It's supposed to be like an obvious fork. Yeah. There's just a token sale website. I keep hearing that like people telling me that there's like a team. They're kind of like crypto legit, you know? I... I don't know. I... I've heard that, too. And I was like, \"Okay, I, how do I can I go get yield in this?\" And turns out you can just buy WLFI. Yeah. Um, anyways, what do I make of all this? Uh, Trump is a franchise, you know, like I... I feel like there's that um there was that guy behind Elvis, like Elvis's promoter, who just franchised the f out of Elvis and sold everything Elvis branded and made Elvis like a bajillionaire. I feel like that's just what's happening. And they're just realizing that with crypto, you can do a crypto, you can do a Bitcoin ETF, you can launch coins, you can launch NFTs, you can launch a DeFi app or just do everything. Literally doing all the things. Doing a doing a wallet. Yeah. Just like make every business possible, put Trump's name on it and sell it. See what happens. See what happens. See what happens. Yeah. Just like one corner made the wallet before a different corner who also had another idea cuz like the other part of this is that Donald Trump Jr. said like, \"No, we're making a wallet out of World Liberty Financial.\" And so you have competing Trump project products, and they're both wallets, and one's coming from the memecoin and one's coming from World Liberty.\n\nDon't know what's going on. Do you know?\n\nSo the the the Clarity Act is uh, you know, being presented in in front of the House these days. And this is the new market structure bill, right? Yeah. Okay. This is the new market structure bill. It's the successor to FIT 21. You guys have heard us talk about this, right? This is defining what's a security and what's a commodity in crypto. We need this bill. And there's congressional hearings going on this week, and it keeps coming up. Maxine Waters, of course, you know, talking about the Trump coin, all of, you know, the Trump Trump's activities in this. It's coming up. And in fact, I don't know if you saw this clip, a CNBC interview clip, uh, with Donald Trump Jr., and the interviewer asks him specifically about the memecoin. This this is the clip lead into some of the other things, the memecoin. Is that okay for your dad to have a memecoin? I think of listen of of course when you know when he did that before he was in office, he did these things. The reason we got into crypto and we're all in on crypto and we're doing American Bitcoin and we have World Liberty Finance and USD1 was because there was a time and probably I'd been on this show where there was I could call any single banker in New York City. They'd pick up the phone. I'd be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden they wouldn't take your call. You couldn't get financing. We were debanked. And what I realized and my brother realized because we were the recipients of every subpoena imaginable was that, you know what? We were actually just the top of this sort of pyramid scheme that we didn't realize we were a part of. That the financial system was totally undemocratized because we had a certain balance sheet and whatever. We could kind of do whatever we wanted. The regular guy was messed up. Now we were all of a sudden in the shoes of the regular guy that wouldn't be able to take advantage of the markets. And we said, \"What's the solution for that?\" The answer is crypto end of memecoin. Masterful. Why? Why did you launch a memecoin? Well, let me tell you about this one time we got debanked. We got forced into crypto, and you know, we needed crypto, and so never mind. I don't think he's had meme once in that. Oh my god. A complete masterpiece. It is funny. It is funny.\n\nDavid, let's talk about Sam Bankman-Fried headed to Netflix. What are we getting here, David? Apparently, apparently getting a one-season series on SBF in the fall of FTX. Uh, which I am just waiting on the edge of my seat for as a a big TV person. This not a documentary. This is an actual kind of I don't know. Uh, you know, I remember like The Social Network. I think it's something like that where it's like a documentary but with acting and a story. It's a true story of what like a true story. Yeah. The the altruist is what they're callous. The alt, which is a huge just punch to the face of effective altruism. Yeah. Yeah. I would... I think that has to have a big overarching story. They're going to name it that. The actors portraying the uh the people as we know them, Anthony Bole, who I'm... I'm not a movie person. Uh and then also Julia Garner. And these two individuals I would say are pretty... they are beautiful people. And Crypto Twitter was not happy about that. That's not... have you these choices. The the resemble the real... the contrast between the beauty of these actors and what we know SBF and Caroline to be uh was not what people wanted because I think people... people want to make fun of Sam and and Caroline. Yeah. They got hurt pretty bad, didn't they? Yeah. Yeah. Look... look at this one. So here's one uh Bella Ramsay is what others were saying in Jonah Hill. I feel like Jonah Hill as Sam Begman-Fried is kind of perfect though.\n\nBut I love Jonah Hill is the problem with that. You like him too much? Yeah, I like him too much. Yeah, he's too good. Oh, there you go. I mean, it's unfortunate. Like, if you're an upstarting young actor, like, do you really want your first role to be Sam Bankman-Fried? I don't know. That could be a fun role to play. So, he's he's such a character. I... You know what? I hope he goes on a crypto podcast in the series. In the in the series? Yeah. Do you think... you think the Eric Vorhees uh Twitter episode will or last will be in there? Which means there could be someone playing you, David. There could be someone playing me. Oh, no. I'm not... I don't want that. You don't want that. But if you had to pick someone to play you, who would it be? Oh, um my doppelganger, which is uh what's his face? Toby McGuire. Oh, Toby McGuire would make a perfect David Hoffman. Yeah. Yeah. The people always called me Spider-Man. Yeah. Who would I be then? Uh, who is your Joseph Gordon-Levitt? That's... That's who I'd want to play me. Yeah. Yeah, that'd make a good R. He's... He's not as attractive as you, but... Yeah, I can see that. I could see that.\n\nDavid, uh, we're looking for some talent as we wrap this show up. So, we got some jobs. If you're interested in a job, what do we got? Uh, work at Bankless. Two... two very big jobs. These are not entry-level jobs. We are looking for uh, a BD sales lead. So if you are in the BD sales ecosystem of crypto, you know, every single company that's in crypto, you have contacts, you have a rolodex, we are looking for you to do sales for Bankless, mainly sponsorship sales. Uh and so if you are interested in that, there is a link in the show notes so you can apply. And then we are also looking for a growth manager. Uh so somebody who understands uh podcasting, understands youtubing, clips, uh distribution, virality. Uh we have uh a Bankless but also Limitless, our second podcast, which is doing very well penetrating into AI and Frontier Tech, and we need to step on the gas on that. And so if you would like to add fuel on top of a very hot fire, we have a killer podcast AV production team. Uh we have bunch... we have me and Ryan as as guests, and we have access to... we have access to some of the best guests that are coming on both Limitless and Bankless. If you would like to add fuel to that fire either on sales or on distribution and virality, uh, click the links in the show notes to apply.\n\nAmazing. And because we didn't get a chance to see it there, actually Ethereum was mentioned in Congress today in a congressional hearing. So I... I feel like we should play that as the moment of Zen. This is VC from Etherealize. He's coming on next week. Actually, they're dropping some big things, but we'll play that clip uh after I read this. Of course, you know, crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us in the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, Deutsche Bank, UBS, and many more are already building on Ethereum because it is the most secure and most decentralized settlement layer in the world. As a result, $140 billion of stablecoins, $10 billion of real, useful tokenized assets, and institutional-grade financial applications live on Ethereum.\n",
