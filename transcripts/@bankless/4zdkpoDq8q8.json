  "cleanText": "Bankless Nation, we got Jon Charbonneau and Ryan Berckmans on a debate today.\nUh, we're debating a handful of topics that all point towards each other.\nWe're going to go through four different questions.\nWe're probably going to touch on all of them if we have time.\nIs Ethereum special versus alt layer 1's?\nIs Bitcoin a special snowflake?\nHow should ETH be valued?\nAnd is ETH over or undervalued?\nRyan, welcome to Bankless.\nThanks.\nGood to be here.\nAnd Jon, also welcome to Bankless.\nHow's it going?\nI would like a clean fight from both of you gentlemen.\nShake hands and let's get off to the races.\nRyan B, I'm going to throw this one to you.\nIs Ethereum special versus alternative layer ones?\nWhat do you think?\nAbsolutely, David.\nThe world is coming on chain.\nWe're going to level up the whole global economy and boost productivity by applying both onchain technologies as well as decentralization.\nUh, it's going to increase wealth, and while uh many different chains can provide the same things such as ERC standards, uh the transactional model, uh giving all users public and private keys, uh you know, so that uh you can kind of level up the the privacy and interaction model, it's really only Ethereum that uh provides the level of neutrality to serve as a global hub so that the entire global economy can be brought on chain uh with an acceptable level of risk.\nSo yes, Ethereum is absolutely special, and what we're seeing now is the uh gradual process of rerating Ether, the asset, up towards Bitcoin to reflect that uh you know, distinguished status.\nJon, same question to you.\nIs Ethereum special versus all L1s?\nUh, I would say no.\nAnd I'll also just dovetail off of that last point of I don't think that ETH has been rerating closer towards BTC.\nI think it has been consistently rerating further away from BTC over the past few years.\nUh, and I think that's actually a pretty strong reflection of what my general view is, which is Bitcoin is the only chain that is of any of these layer ones that is actually special.\nAnd what I mean by special there in a more literal sense is that Bitcoin is the only chain in my view that gets to just play by a different set of rules from everyone else as a product of it.\nIt's obviously very directly going into this.\nYou know, we the core asset is money.\nThis is what we are trying to do.\nWhat matters there is story and network effects.\nThe practical reality is Bitcoin is the only one that was first and that has this built up great story.\nThe network effects, this isn't my opinion.\nThis is the, as I was saying, the market has been saying this for several years up through everyone to the most powerful government in the world is saying, \"Hey, this is the special one.\nThis is the one that we put in reserve that we accumulate.\"\nAnd then all of these other ones, they're in a different bucket.\nThey fight amongst themselves.\nUm, and so I I think Ethereum is very firmly in that second bucket where everyone else has to play by the rules of you need to win as a tech platform effectively, try to get everyone to come deploy and build on you.\nYou can't wait for them to come to you.\nUh, and I think that has been at the core of a lot of the problems that Ethereum has had over the past few years is that it acted like it was in the Bitcoin bucket, which brings this sort of assumption, which makes sense if you are Bitcoin, that everyone will necessarily come to you and build on top of you because you are the best asset, you are the money, they must come to you because everyone wants your asset.\nUm, and I think we saw that reflected in a lot of the sort of malaise around Ethereum scaling compared to these alt one competitors looking at these types of attitudes of ah, maybe we don't really need to scale execution that much ourselves, the rollups will do that for us, maybe we don't need to scale DMD DA that much ourselves, you know, IDA and Celestia and any trust, they'll go do that for us, maybe we don't need to scale our consensus, you know, espresso and ag layer and all of these other ones, like they'll go do that for us, and it's fine because ETH is money, and like we're going to be at the center of this, and restaking is going to secure everything anyway.\nUm, and I think we've seen pretty firmly the market has rejected that over the past few years and said, \"No, you were in the same bucket as Solana, Celestia, Monad, Hyperlid, whatever else.\nYou need to win as a tech platform.\nIf you get complacent, you will lose.\nBitcoin is the only one that can afford to move very slowly, active this money, and kind of everyone necessarily comes to you.\"\nSo, in short, I I don't think anyone is special outside of Bitcoin just because it is so clearly in this bucket of it is elevated, it was the first one, it is this story, it is money, it has all the network effects.\nEveryone else is in very much a ship or die bucket where you need to win as a tech platform first and then everything else is downhill from there.\nYeah.\nAnd you know, I I think Jon makes a great point that Ethereum's price versus Bitcoin has been catastrophically collapsing over the past few years, and the reversal really only started in the last few months, and we're at the very early stages of that.\nAnd the timing for the reversal is not uh a coincidence.\nIt's not accidental.\nIt it is fundamentally driven by the fact that Ethereum's underperformance financially and in terms of sentiment and as well as in terms of L1 uh demand growth over the past few years has really been driven by three separate issues.\nThe first issue was that the uh previous US administration was extraordinarily hostile to onchain technologies, and uh their war was really a a de facto war against Ethereum more so than uh BTC.\nBTC was uh uh an an a lucky beneficiary of the fact that the war was primarily aimed at chilling onchain growth, and that's caused Bitcoin to appear to be more special than in fact it will seem to be when onchain is a thousand x larger.\nSo that's the first issue.\nThe second issue is that the Ethereum community had a really significant uh un you know, set of unforced errors.\nWe we weren't telling our own story.\nWe weren't going to market fast enough with new business development initiatives like Etherealize.\nIn fact, as we sit here recording in about uh an hour and a half time, Vivec Raman of Etherealize is going to be testifying to Congress on the importance of digital assets, you know, on Ethereum.\nAnd so uh h our set of unforced errors as a community uh exacerbated that natural problem of the previous administration really coming after onchain growth.\nAnd the third problem for Ethereum these past years was the extremely violent transition to our scaling model of L1 plus L2 scaling.\nUh, this this was uh externally violent in terms of how we uh communicated it and how we uh supported our community's transition with you know, technologies like uh like interop, for example, serious interop to make all of Ethereum uh feel like a single user experience really only started about a year and a half, two years ago, should have started four years ago at the dawn of interop, and so uh the the transition to L1 plus L2 scaling has been uh really, really challenging and violent.\nAnd of course, you know, that that that episode culminated about a year ago when Ethereum launched Blobs with Denun, and L1 gas prices plummeted, uh which was like always the plan, but due to uh a lack of communication uh and a lack of uh you know, I think uh ecosystem leadership on our part, uh people were like, \"Oh my god, Ethereum's given away the farm.\nWe're closing the business.\nWe've given it all to L2s.\"\nBut it's just not the case.\nL L2 cannot do what L1 does in terms of driving credible neutrality and counterparty risk minimization and distribution, and L1 can't do what L2 does in terms of inventiveness as a marketplace of global solutions and to scale politically to give the world's you know, operators the opportunity for control and customization on their own terms.\nSo, both are needed.\nAnd, you know, when it comes to demand growth, it's incumbent on us to not just build it and expect the world to come.\nWe have to get out there and meet the customers where they're at.\nUh, and so I, you know, I echo Jon's concern there around making sure that we're not just sitting by idally waiting for folks to come to our ivory tower.\nAnd so, you know, Bitcoin has done an incredible job selling the uh the meme of Bitcoin, the asset of Bitcoin.\nAnd, you know, Ethereum does not need Bitcoin to fail to win.\nBut ultimately these negative factors that have caused Ethereum to underperform both in terms of growth and sentiment and price action are fundamentally uh reversed.\nNow we have things like the new executive directors at the Ethereum Foundation that are doing a fantastic job, you know, you know, re-steering the ship, and so in the coming years as onchain and gets a 1000x larger and the whole global economy comes on chain and the world's central banks and institutions pile on to real world assets and you know, once they bring the assets on chain, they're going to say, what are we going to do with them, they're then going to have DeFi, and so all that growth is going to naturally diminish the importance of Bitcoin that can't compete in that onchain space.\nUh, and then that will that will really open the door to greater focus on all of onchain, but Ethereum will win the line share of growth because neutrality creates wealth.\nAnd that is what is really going to propel Ethereum, you know, to the top of this asset class.\nUh, maybe not the top.\nWe don't we don't necessarily need the flipping to win.\nUh, but, you know, that's really going to cause us to rerate from, you know, today's Ethereum dominance is like what is it?\nI don't know, like single digit percents, you know, you know, much much closer up to where Bitcoin's at, multi-trillion dollar asset.\nSo, I think we actually agree in some meaningful sense on looking back what some of the issues have have been historically for Ethereum and where the messups were and then I'd say differ probably in the interpretation and forward-looking guidance on where those go.\nSo, basically stepping through those three points.\nI mean, one one is the regulatory war.\nI I actually agree that it that probably disproportionately benefited uh BTC at least as a share of the field um relative to ETH and Soul and all of these other crypto assets.\nI'd say it probably hurt it in the absolute but helped it in the relative sense versus these other crypto assets.\nBut at the same time, that war wasn't directed just at ETH.\nAnd in fact, it was actually directed more at ETH's competitors than ETH itself.\nETH was not the one that was being listed as a security in these lawsuits.\nThat was soul.\nThat was these other alt L1 assets.\nAnd yet at the same time those alt L1s and their assets were gaining on Ethereum throughout that period where they were actually subject to even much harsher uh regul regulation and actions against them.\nSo so I don't think we can explain away Ethereum's underperformance uh ju just based on that.\nI I don't think it holds up.\nUm, and even when you look now going say okay, let's say forward looking, everyone's friendly now, should this help Ethereum, what we're seeing even on the BTC side is we currently have the most crypto friendly administration like ever right now.\nYou know, they they're onchain doing the most degenerate stuff on all these different chains.\nAnd at the same time, even that administration is saying very explicitly, no, BTC is special.\nThis is the one that goes in the SPR.\nThis is the one that's in a different category.\nEveryone else is fighting amongst yourselves.\nAnd so that's great that regulatory guidance will get better.\nThat that will help these assets, but it's certainly not going to help ETH as a relative share and it's not going to help it against Bitcoin.\nUm, and looking forward, I mean, what do we see also as far as, you know, even though all these alt platforms are growing, what are people gravitating towards money, not just the administration people, what do we see the asset that people want to hold amongst global uncertainty that we have right now, people are not, you know, chilling ETH as this is what you hold in the in the midst of these tariff wars and the trade wars going around the world, you hold Bitcoin, we see the usage of that growing on chain, even I mean something I was poking fun at yesterday is what happens if uh if BTC surpasses ETH on case, like is it is it a bitcoin L2 or an ETH L2 right now, and fundamentally the reason that's happening is people demand fundamentally BTC as an asset, um, and so you see the BTC usage on chains like Bass and many other Ethereum chains actually just going up and to the right on track to eventually surpass ETH, um, and that's because that is fundamentally the asset that people want, and then you build the tech from there, versus Ethereum has been much more of a it's used on these platforms because it was just the thing that was there in the beginning, and now as these barriers break down, people will gravitate towards the asset they want.\nUm, as far as the stronger go to market.\nUm, I I agree that Ethereum is getting better at these things.\nI've been super positive on all the changes like the new EDS at the EF.\nI think they're great.\nI've spoken to them a bunch.\nLike love the people that they put in.\nI'm sure Etherealize will do great work.\nUm, again, it's just still just it's a forward-looking comparison of okay, but how do we stack this up against the competition?\nWhat is Solana doing?\nYou know, they have the Solana Policy Institute.\nThey they have the Solana Foundation and Labs and all these organizations around them that are incredibly competent in these areas and are already ahead of the game.\nAnd it's not like they're slowing up and letting Ethereum just catch up to them.\nSo, they're already in a lead, and I think better positioned to generally take these actions are probably going to compound that lead.\nUm, it's the same story on that third point of the transition to L1 and L2 scaling.\nI I agree that the right things are happening now.\nI mean, I I I genuinely think that the EF and a lot of the people in the Ethereum community are saying all the right things and starting to prioritize more a lot of the stuff that I would have liked to see prioritize earlier, but the time to prioritize to prioritize them was earlier.\nEthereum isn't in this just, you know, magically dominant position anymore where it can just compound its lead.\nIt it has actually like materially lost its lead in a lot of these areas too.\nIf you look at the alliance D startup data, where are most startups going?\nThey're going to Solana over Ethereum and Ethereum L2s even in aggregate.\nYou see the same thing in the electric capital developer report.\nYou see the same thing in onchain rev.\nYou see the same thing in\n\n\nOnchain application revenue.\nAll of these metrics are actually shifting to a meaningful degree to these other chains already.\nWhile at the same time, these chains are like 100x ahead on scaling and compounding their scaling lead more.\nSo, I think it's great that Ethereum is pivoting towards doing the correct things and prioritizing better.\nYou know, we're going to scale more aggressively and do these things, but still the practical reality is they are still orders of magnitude behind and increasing their rate of iteration at still a slower pace than all these others.\nSo, while you are doing the right things, I think going forward, the market is still pricing ETH as, you know, many times larger and more successful than these other ones, while it is actually behind on the categories I think that are going to matter and are going to be predictive looking forward of success where we're going.\nYeah, I think that there's a big difference between technology and institutions, and there's Ethereum, the technology, in terms of the PDF protocol spec driven by the research community.\nThere's Ethereum, the technology, the clients that run the software that I can go spin up my own vanilla empty new copy of Ethereum and EVM chain anytime I want.\nAnd then there's Ethereum mainnet, the institution.\nAnd when we look at things like some of the growth patterns you're describing, such as the Electric Capital developer report from some months ago that talked about how there was a majority of new developers were on Solana.\nWe dig into that data.\nA lot of it is, you know, young developers in emerging countries, which is not to say that though there's, you know, some developers are more important than others, but it is to say that what will drive the next big leg of Ethereum growth is going to be institutional growth.\nIt's going to be folks who are looking to make serious long-term investments that are not incentivized, that they're not, they're not going somewhere because they've been paid to go there.\nThey're going somewhere because it's the best next step for their business, and these folks are doing serious diligence, and overwhelmingly, they, when they're free to choose, they end up on Ethereum, and it's going to be those companies that bring their own, you know, massive sets of distribution.\nAnd so, as we look forward to, uh, you know, for example, Kraken recently launched equities on Solana, you know, that that was an incentivized launch.\nAnother good example would be all of the corporate L2s on Ethereum.\nWe have things like Sonium, Immutable X, Base, like, yeah, there are OP governance token grants, but that's not why they launched them, and the thing about OP governance token grants is they're not there to dump them; that's like a strategic reserve they're going to keep and they'll probably never sell and they use to vote.\nLike these folks who are building on Ethereum, they're not there for the incentives; they're because of the serious institution, because of the accumulated network effects in developers tooling infrastructure.\nAnd so, when it comes to things like Solana's metrics, like you said, that you said Solana, for example, is like a 100x further ahead in scaling, but Solana has basically never done more than approximately, uh, I haven't looked at the latest numbers for some months, maybe about 1300 or 1500 burst TPS, you know, with a relatively high failure.\nLike L2s are going to be doing more than that inside a year.\nSolana is not going to be the cheapest chain or the fastest chain.\nAnd so what's left?\nWhat's left is this for them, an ecosystem that they have done an admirable job building that has excellent grassroots developer programs, but lacks the kind of neutrality and robustness that's going to drive institutional adoption.\nAnd it's really that institutional adoption that is the big prize because the whole global economy wants to come on chain, and it simply can't do so if it's too risky, and it's going to be Ethereum that's the right home for that.\nWant to get Jon to respond to all of that, but I don't want to lose sight of kind of the overall question that that David posed to both of our debaters here, right?\nAnd maybe this is not just the first question, but also the second.\nThe first question was, is Ethereum special versus alternative layer 1's?\nThe second is, is Bitcoin special?\nAnd Jon's answer to that, Ryan, for Bitcoin, seemed to be, well, Bitcoin is special because of narrative and network effect, particularly around this, you know, store of value monetary phenomenon.\nSo I want you maybe for a minute, Ryan, to crisply answer the question because I, I, I don't know that we have yet, if you're saying Ethereum is special relative to all alternative layer ones, are you saying it's special like Bitcoin?\nAnd why is Ethereum special?\nAbsolutely, Ryan.\nBitcoin is special because of the immaculate conception and the very high degree of neutrality that, combined with its consistent, excellent job done by its supporters over the years, has created this incredible penetration into kind of global consciousness and a very high level of aggregate confidence.\nEthereum is as special, but not in an absolute sense, but on a trajectory to be as special, but in a different way.\nWhat makes Ethereum special is the very high degree of decentralization and neutrality that we have pursued that has over time created this incredible community of talent and eyeballs that is creating a public institution that the world's entire economy can build on.\nAnd similar to how Bitcoin might have been able to have a true peer if that peer had started early enough and done a good enough job, Ethereum could have had a true peer had they started early enough and done a good enough job.\nBut just as nobody can match Bitcoin's oification and and neutrality, nobody can match Ethereum's institution building and neutrality and and suitability as a global hub for economic activity.\nSo yes, both Ethereum and Bitcoin are special, and they both stand alone in their respective categories.\nSo, walking through the different points there, um, I'll kind of go through them in order that we talk to them that I, I mean, the first one I'll push back very, very strongly on because I just think it's a straightup double standard is we're saying, \"Oh, no, everyone is going to Solana just because they're being incentivized to do so.\nUh, but all the people are building on Ethereum and it's not because of the incentives.\"\nWhen, when literally the primary example is, I, I don't know if Kraken was incentivized at all to launch on equities first.\nYeah, they may very well have been, which is totally fine.\nThey were also given a gigantic OP grant to deploy Inc. in the OP super chain.\nI don't think the OP grants are perhaps the strongest counter example of this.\nAnd you look at stats like 59% of stablecoins being on Ethereum.\nThat's over 90% excluding Tron.\nYou start to realize that the depth and breadth of growth is predominantly unincentivized.\nYeah.\nAnd so let's get into that point next because I, I think this is this is one of the big metrics that you always use as like Ethereum is ahead in total app capital and like the real money is there.\nI agree that the real money is literally there today, but what what we need to care about is one, I mean, what is that capital doing?\nIt's doing very different things on these both chains, and I'll argue it's much less valuable what it's doing on ETH.\nThe other part is where are we going in the future?\nI just do not think it holds up at all that, oh, the institutions are naturally all going to go to ETH, and they're not going to go anywhere else.\nWe just don't see that anymore.\nThe institutions are clearly very comfortable deploying on these other places like Solana.\nNow, you look at whether it's the Biddle fund or any of these things, they're deploying these on every chain, and then the users just going to gravitate towards where they're going to go.\nAnd if the if users continue to gravitate towards these other chains and they deploy those products there, then that is where they're going to ultimately end up getting more usage over time.\nAnd we see this with real, you know, real stablecoin financial products going forward too.\nWhat is the biggest thing that was hyped recently is is the Stripe stablecoin financial accounts that they were deploying.\nWhat are the two first two chains that they are supporting for that is Solana and Base because those are the chains that institutions, these are B2B like large corporate customers, that is what they're going to use because these are the two reliable chains that give them scale and ubiquity and just just access that are like well plugged in.\nIt wasn't Ethereum L1 even because it is it is not there on the scale and it's not forward-looking.\nThe majority of that money that is sitting on ETH today is largely idle capital, which is not moving around, is not high velocity, is not generating a large rev.\nThis is just the default place that, for example, exchanges just leave billions of dollars, and then they're just like sitting offchain like this is not the same flows and meaningful activity that is going to these other chains going forward.\nAnd that's what actually matters.\nUm, as far as the point of, you know, Solana is not going to be the fastest or the cheapest going forward, I completely agree with that.\nLike that, I'm also, I'm not here just to defend Solana to be clear.\nI mean, like clearly we do own Soul.\nWe're positive on it, but we also do own a lot of these other new competitors, stuff like hype for this reason.\nLike there are going to be competitive advantages that people are going to have over Solana.\nThere are going to be faster, cheaper chains.\nI don't think that most will work out because I think you need a real 10x unlock to actually surpass and provide a real value proposition like Hyperlquid.\nI don't think it's winning just because of scale.\nI think it's winning because it has a great app.\nUm, but let's say even that happens, like, like other places are going to scale.\nThat's great.\nIt's not Ethereum is not going to be that place that's going to be 10x better than Solana and a lot faster and cheaper.\nUm, we're like, maybe it's going to be some of the L2s, and then we get to the question of, okay, what are we actually calling an L2 and how does this actually accrue value to ETH?\nI think that is also like super unclear, which I'm sure we'll get into later.\nUm, but yeah, broadly, I think if we just like look at where usage is going going forward, I don't think that we could just like blindly say like all the institutions are just going to go to ETH and like nothing else matters.\nLike I, I don't think that we just see that in the data at all.\nI think we're like starting to see very clear the exact opposite trends starting to play out.\nIn the wild west of DeFi,

should expect their retail and institutional growth to continue moving forward.\nSometimes my colleagues in Ethereum like to say things like, now we've defeated Solana or now Solana is is dead, and it's just not true.\nIf you were to kind of Thanos Ethereum out of existence, including all the L2s, Solana would be over 90% of what's, well, Solana and Tron would be, you know, 99% of what's left.\nAnd and Solana's not going anywhere.\nThey started with a technology advantage and a vertical integration advantage, and now they're graduating that to an ecosystem advantage and still the same vertical integration advantage.\nSo that they're going to continue to to win unincentivized growth, especially among retail.\nThey're going to continue to win these pure launches in institutional products where the institutions launch on multiple chains.\nOf course, launching on multiple chains doesn't mean that the lion share of the institutional capital is going to end up on Solana.\nFor example, BlackRock's Biddle, I believe, is over 90% on Ethereum.\nAnd so when when we look at Solana's growth story, they've done an incredible job.\nThere can there can be no doubt about that.\nBut, you know, they sell the same, 300, 500, sometimes they claim up to 65,000 TPS to every single user.\nHow are they going to scale?\nThey're naturally going to need an L2 ecosystem.\nYou know, they they have, you know, challenges with their transaction failure rates.\nUh, they they're stuck in the middle.\nThey're they're in a middle ground, a middle strategic position that was so strong last era where if you wanted fast cheap chains, they were the only game in town.\nIf you wanted perceivably infinite block space, go to Solana.\nBut now, as the world comes on chain, like there's this kind of new barbell where if you need risk minimization and distribution, you can go to the L1\n\n\nAnd if you need retail distribution or your own customized products, you can launch your own L2. You can go on a range of existing L2s. You can also go to Solana. You can go to Tron. But the fact is that Ethereum as the global hub is going to become more and more unique and distinguished as time passing and capital piles onto the L1 and the web of interled connections that are increasingly rich. You know, things like cross L2 RPC calls across the web of L2s is going to get increasingly dense, and it's going to be the hub that is unique. Then Solana is going to be like a competitor to an increasingly diverse, high-scale, competitive landscape of L2s. So Solana has absolutely done an incredible job, but you know, the main reason they're threatening right now is the amount of capital they're willing to spend to grow and not anything inherent in their strategic position.\n\nSo I want to pull the conversation back towards Ethereum because I feel like we're starting to argue a little bit against Solana and more less so about Ethereum itself, which is like supposed to be the focus of the debate. So I, I mean, broadly, I, we'll just put it to like agree to disagree. I don't think that the natural, the default, you know, institution-friendly, risk-minimized place is going to be Ethereum. I think Solana is absolutely increasingly already in that conversation is going to be for the customizability and control people are default launching L2s today for that. I think that in general, like most of these issues are that I would say would say that they are generally different and like theoretically solvable in the long term. We'll see where if Solana can actually figure out, you know, better monetization from being in a shared chain, continue scaling, all these different things, whatever, we'll put, we'll put that aside, and we'll just like say Solana is going to lose, like we'll even agree on that. I don't agree on that, but like we'll just take that as a given to kind of like bring the conversation. Solana is not going to lose, absolute just relative. I mean, they're going to, they're going to keep winning. Exactly. But okay, but let's say as a relative, you know, Ethereum, we'll just assume that Solana is like share. It's, you know, Solana is not going to eat the world. It's going to go to a lot of other chains, including people who need a lot of customizability and scale.\n\nWhat is the argument then that you have high confidence? Because I don't think this was touched on in your answer of why will those naturally those other chains be, you know, quote unquote, L2s of Ethereum and accrue value back to ETH in some non-escript way? Because I think what we're actually seeing right now is the market doesn't really care when we see these like new customizable apps that are super successful. What is it? Hyperlquid is not an Ethereum L2. They, they're very explicitly like their own chain. They're building their own ecosystem. They didn't because they didn't need Ethereum to do that. So what is the argument that these like new chains of the future, the people who do really demand customizability, monetization, whatever, that they need their own chain, that they're going to be successful? Why are those going to have a tie back to Ethereum and accrue value back to ETH like very explicitly? Because I, I just don't think that we see that at all.\n\nYeah, Jon. Hyperlquid is an incredible example here because, first of all, it's a secular trader product, and the hot ball of money is, uh, they get their utility on Hyperlid, and then they take their capital and they buy the Hyperlquid token, and that's been a very successful arrangement for everybody, and it's an incredible product. Why was it in L2? The answer is timing. At the time Hyperlid was launched, the L2 SDKs and, and still today, do not support a Hyperlid style customization. But in the future, the Hyperlids of the future, and there will be competitors to Hyperlquid. You know, they seem so dominant today. They're, they're Hyperlquid will not, will not last a thousand years. Uh, and so, uh, the Hyperlquids of the future will be L2s because if something can be an L2, it should be an L2. You don't need to pay the cost of consensus. You, you benefit from, uh, uh, improved security guarantees. Uh, that's really the whole story. You get, you get better cross, uh, you know, cross L2 bridging in terms of the guarantees of staying in the same, the same zone of sovereignty on that global settlement layer. And so, uh, yeah, Hyperlid has been an incredibly successful product, and they make a lot of money, and that's been great for their token price, but the Hyperlquids of the future will be L2s. And the reason that people are going to continue to build on Ethereum is really for the same reason is that neutrality is worth money. And when you look at how that translates into sentiment in terms of L2 value accrual, look at Bitcoin. What percentage of Bitcoin activity occurs on the L1? It's like zero, many zeros because Bitcoin is a de facto centralized product these days. Sailor holds in custody. Everybody uses exchanges, and yet that usage of Bitcoin in centralized context contributes to aggregate confidence in Bitcoin and Bitcoin's monetary premium. And so if you look at the Ethereum price that's fallen versus Bitcoin, uh, and in absolute dollar terms in the past few years, uh, that's not because of some missing value accrual link. It's not, it's because confidence in Ethereum was in the doghouse. It was way, way down. Why was confidence down? 'Cause people thought Ethereum was was done. They thought, as you're arguing, that everything's going to go to Solana or it's going to go to Bitcoin L2s or it's going to go to, uh, you know, there won't be value accrual. But as confidence in Ethereum increases, it's not this whole value accrual argument is not going to end up being operative. It's going to drive confidence to Ethereum to Ether, the asset. L2s will distribute Ether as a store of value. They will use Ether, not all of them, and they all don't need to because the same phenomenon that's caused Bitcoin to be successful, where the use and attention on BTC, the asset, is going to occur for Ether, the asset, across the L2 ecosystem, and as that L1 becomes the more dominant, you know, increasingly dominant global hub.\n\nJon, I see you taking notes, so I want you to respond to Ryan however you see fit. But I also do want to introduce question number three, which is a little bit downstream of what Ryan was saying. Uh, Ryan's talking about gaining confidence in Ether, the asset. Now there are a lot of possible lenses for viewing and understanding and evaluating Ether, the asset. Uh, and Jon and DBA, you to my understanding, don't own any ETH, and so that is a choice, uh, because you guys have a particular lens on Ether, the asset. So I'm wondering if you could share your lens, your vantage point of Ether, the asset, and why you don't have confidence in Ether sufficiently in order to put ETH on DBA's balance sheet. Uh, so like, what's your perspective on ETH? How do you view it as an asset? Uh, and why are you less confident on it than Ryan?\n\nSo I agree that there will be, you know, call them L2 Hyperlquids. I've actually tweeted out a bunch of times, like, I think there's a big opportunity to build the quote unquote, like people have talked about, you know, the ZK Hyperlquid. I just don't think you can build it on Ethereum. I think it's like literally mathematically impossible. If you look at any of the numbers, Ethereum is many orders of magnitude away from being able to support it on DA. I think that people are going to build this, and it's going to be on top of Celestia. It's going to be on top of DA, or it's going to be on top of some, some other centralized DA thing. I think people will limit consensus and customize and do these things. You just can't build it on top of Ethereum. Ethereum DA is just like, for anyone who looks at the numbers, it is so far away right now. The just like to give a sense on some of the numbers. The, you know, the big like endgame dank charting number that people have like usually given for Ethereum is like 128 blobs, 1.33 megabytes per second. That's where Celestia is today. That is also about, I think it's like 40x or something like that, where, or no, maybe it's 20 something x where Ethereum is today. Let's assume they get there. Okay, great. That, that's where these other chains are today or already surpassing that. And then where are these other chains going to be? Obviously by that point, you know, like you look at the last test at first for Celeste, he was like 20 something megabytes per second. Like them DA, they're all going for like gigabytes per second. So these high scale things, they're just not going to be on Ethereum DA. Like we're already seeing that. We're seeing where do the new chains go? Where did the converges of the world that Athena securitized chain? They go to Sustia. Like where are these old new chains are going to go? They're going to go to different DA layers. So I, I generally just discount that as I, I do not think that mathematically Ethereum can win this market anymore. Um, at least at scale, it's not going to be the dominant player in there in the long term just because it literally can't on scale.\n\nSo then do we take this sort of like other definition of L2, which is all right, it's not the DA cash flow thing for me, it's the they're going to use it as ETH's money in some abstract sense. I also think we just don't see that in supporting data and like demand from users. You know, there, there isn't this inherent demand for people on Hyperlquid of like, oh, this would be a better product if we had a enshrined bridge to ETH that like sort of gave us vaguely better possible guarantees as ETH as an asset because like we demand ETH on Hyperlid so much because there's user demand for that. We, we just don't see that. And so I, I don't see either of these value accrual paths being compelling right now of that, oh, we're going to win the DA scale game and like we're going to have a gazillion roll-ups on us and we're going to get a bunch of cash flows for that. And I because I think that Celestia and these others are like very clearly ahead there. And I don't see that, oh, there's just this overwhelming demand for ETH, so people like have to put their enshrined bridge here and like people are just going to want to use a bunch of ETH. The only place we see that for is Bitcoin. People really want BTC as an asset. Doesn't apply to anyone else, um, other than US dollars. People also love US dollars. Um, generally, so generally as a framework for how to view and kind of um, value these assets, the very, I mean, the very simple thing, which is probably what I've like written a little bit more about, is what is effectively the floor for these assets, which is very simple, it's a DCF type calculation, you know, rev is effectively revenue for these types of chains, you know, what are the fees in MV that people are paying, that is just the absolute at least floor of what these things are worth. If no one buys your story, no one thinks this asset is money, nobody cares what you think, they all disagree with you, blah, blah, blah, you can just buy the asset, you can make your capital back based on cash flows, so that's at least the floor of what these assets are. Um, obviously that is, I would say, a generally unsatisfying answer for most of these chains, uh, if you're trying to justify a trillion something dollar valuation. And where I think practically what does come into it is you're assessing, okay, what, what is the actual store value market that the, that the thing that this asset is going after, and then what do I assess the probability of it actually winning that market? So the very simple calculation is you could say, hey, Bitcoin is worth uh, $2 trillion or whatever it is today, two and a half trillion, something like that. Um, I think that ETH, as you know, I think that is like a reasonable size on this non-sovereign store value asset market. I think ETH, ETH has an X% chance, whatever, of winning that market, and I think this is a durable market. Um, realistically, I think that's where probably like most of the value is coming from something like ETH if you're, if you're already valuing it in the hundreds of billions of dollars, which is a totally reasonable thing to do. I think we have like very clear market evidence that there is many trillions of dollars of demand for non- sovereign store value crypto assets. It's very clear Bitcoin has that. Um, the area where I would assume that we differ very strongly is I have a much lower assessed probability of ETH actually capturing that market, um, from Bitcoin. I, I think this is like a very high power law distribution into the top one, maybe a handful of crypto assets having a durable, very large monetary premium going forward. And then what ultimately is going to be the path, whether it's ETH or Soul or whatever these other assets to try to cut into that, uh, store of value market durably is, it's really going to be winning as a tech platform. The way that you're going to have a shot at winning and getting some durable store value is because everyone's building on top of you. You're the natural censorship resistant asset at the middle of this ecosystem, and then, you know, people recognize and just use you. And I think that's like actually a reasonable thesis if the end state of crypto is Ethereum is the base layer upon which everything is built on top of, either L1 applications or like everything is a roll up on top of Ethereum, and Ether is this trustless, censorship resistant asset across it. I think you like have a reasonable pitch that in that world ETH, you know, is a meaningful crypto asset store value that is on par with, maybe even bigger than Bitcoin. That's like totally possible. The market is just telling us right now that they assess the probability of that outcome on like a literal technical architecture level has just been going straight down for the past few years. And I think that's very clear. ETH is not going to be the like the winning store of value money. If what smart contract platforms end up looking like is a fractured field where ETH is like sort of Ethereum is like sort of important, that there's meaningful stuff there, but it's not a clear winner. All these other competitors are gaining share in that world. There's no ETH is the store of value that's going to compete with Bitcoin. Um, so generally that's how I view these like large assets is, I mean, the very simple floor is you're looking at what are cash flows, and then beyond that, what is a durable store of value, uh, kind of premium that I think that this asset can capture, which is usually, you know, there's some big outcome, what is the small probability that it captures that, um, and for\n\n\nETH, I think the market is just pricing in way too high a probability right now that it actually does capture durably that market in the long term. So, Ryan, let's get you to respond and, and, uh, also answer that same question: how should ETH be valued?\n\nETH should be valued as an institutional-grade store of value that comes with this incredible backing of being the world's economic hub. It is Bitcoin plus the next foundation of the world economy for decades, hopefully centuries. And right now, Bitcoin seems so uh important that it's able to sustain this monetary premium with, you know, no fee revenue, no direct value accrual, uh, because it has this incredible confidence premium. Uh, and uh, in crypto, we think, we tend to think on such short-term time horizons. Bitcoin is only 16 years old. Ethereum is only 10 years old next month, onchain. The story of Onchain is very, very new. You know, DeFi summer that, you know, really unlocked the first uh, starting to scale lending markets. It was one of the first main use cases. It's really only summer 2020, five years ago. And so as we look forward into the future, the growth of onchain by a 1,000x is going to increase attention like the world, you know, the institutional investment community, their attention on ether as a store of value. So assuming that Bitcoin's special status is somehow impossible to replicate or immutable across uh large, you know, large stretches of time, uh, is overconfident. It supposes that the future is like the past when there's good reasons to expect it not to be, especially that onchain will grow a 1,000x with the lion share of it on Ethereum. And so to address some of these other points, I started studying uh onchain fees in 2019. I got some of my first following being like a fee bull poster talking about how Ethereum's fees were, you know, growing so quickly. And in 2021, uh, I co-authored with, uh, Vivec from Etherealize, uh, a short paper called, uh, Ethereum, a store of value with cash flow. And we talked about the fees and the growing fees. And we hyped up the DCF case, using cash flow to value Ether. And it really wasn't until late 2021 that we realized that you can't use DCF to value these assets. Not because it's bearish for the valuation, because it's literally a broken model. It's nonsensical. And the reason, the primary reason for that is that the cash flows are valued, are denominated in the chain's native token. And so, uh, whereas if you look at a business like McDonald's or Walmart, cash is the independent variable. It earns some cash and then that backs into the share price and the whole thing flows downstream naturally. In crypto, the amount of cash generated is a function of the, the US dollar denominated cash is a function of the aggregate confidence in the chain because it's like, all right, my rev was like 10 units of native token. Okay, what is that worth? Is that worth one hot dog or a thousand hot dogs or a ton of gold? And so, uh, the DCF model is fundamentally mistaken when it comes to L1 valuation. So I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't agree that it's a floor of valuation on these on these instruments. I think it's, I think it's completely unrelated. Uh, and that's, you know, a journey that we came on having started as DCF bulls in the years past. Uh, and you know, uh, I stopped being a DCF bull while Ethereum was extremely uh dominant in fees. So this isn't like some reaction to rising rev on Solana. Started years ago when Solana's REV was, you know, it was over at like a 1,000x PE ratio at the height of 2021 when Solana had 54 billion and uncirculating locked insider token allocation. And so when it comes to things like building on top of, uh, you made a remark, Jon, about how the hyperlids of the future won't be built on Ethereum, they'll be built on Celestia DA. I think you gave another example as an Ethereum bull. I love that sentence because you're, you're, you're saying, uh, which, which is the fact, which is that there's a lot of DA options out there if you're not going to use blobs. And so when that hyperliquid of the future comes together, it's going to settle on Ethereum, but it's probably not going to use Ethereum DA. To your point, blobs are blobs are uh New York City. You know, the L1 is Manhattan, blobs are New York City, and alt DA is the whole rest of the universe. There's going to be significantly greater demand in terms of gigabytes, not economic value for alt DA, and it's going to be a significantly more fractured landscape. And so uh DA is not a commodity in general. Every DA is a unique snowflake. Uh, but there is going to be that substitution effect. And if we look at blobs today, like uh, it is the job of blobs to enable the L1 to win as a global hub. It's not the job of blobs to sell the most gigabytes or even to make the most money, although eventually blobs will make lots of money. And so uh, by that metric of helping the L1 to succeed as the global hub, blobs are, but blobs are crushing it. Like there's huge demand for blobs. We have excellent rollups building on top of them. We have a diversity of rollups. And uh, you know, so that's a trend that I expect to continue. And so when, when it comes to this fundamental comparison of like, why is ether going to outperform, it's, it's, it's because of the pair-wise competitive dynamic: Ether versus Bitcoin. Ether's going to win on a relative basis, uh, because onchain is going to be so important and much most of it's going to go to Ethereum, and this value accrual issue is going to end up going to the dustbin of history when aggregate confidence in Ethereum rises. You look at the other pair-wise comparison between Ether and Solana. You know, Ether really only has two competitors in this L1 token landscape, and you know, that that speaks to the success. Solana's done a very good job, but their strategy is not politically scalable. And so when you look at the Ethereum versus Solana pair-wise comparison, Solana is insanely unreliable and centralized in the comparison. They lack a real PDF protocol spec driven by a research community. They lack client diversity of three plus production clients, and they always will. They probably will never have uh a nice balanced stake among two production clients. They recently spoke about how Fire Dancer is running on 5% of the network. It's still Franken Dancer. It's not the original codebase. They had an uh irregular state transition where they, like, quite literally stealthily in the dead of night, uh, upgraded the chain to uh change the bike code of a deployed contract. Did it fix a critical bug? Absolutely. Was it maybe the best decision for their individual situation? That's up to them. You know, they decided it was, and it's certainly better than having a critical bug in, in, in what I believe is an immutable contract for them. But it puts the public in this situation where they think, \"Wow, this time they coordinated in the dead of night, you know, like on a Discord server to uh uh update the immutable, you know, so-called immutable history of the blockchain to fix a bug.\" That means they can do it. That means they're practicing the muscle memory of these emergency upgrades. Maybe next time it's it's a Fed or a spook or, you know, that mercenary firm Blackwater who shows up at Anatoli's pad, you know, at 3:00 a.m. on a Tuesday. And you know, like the fact is that these irregular state transitions build on themselves. This lack of client diversity is an enduring, significant issue. This focus on uh speed and, you know, you know, increased bandwidth, reduce latency above all else, it doesn't speak to the risk minimization that institutions need to bring the world's economy of tens of trillions in assets and, you know, 100red trillion in economic activity onchain. And so that's why Ethereum wins against Bitcoin on a relative basis because uh Bitcoin is not going to be successful in doing onchain uh, and onchain is going to get a thousandx larger with the lion share of it on Ethereum. And that's why Ethereum wins against Solana because Solana is catastrophically risky and centralized in the comparison to the L1. In addition, Solana will no longer be the fastest and cheapest chain as that high-scale block space is increasingly commoditized and new institutions launch their own L2s that provide, you know, a great, a great launch pad for things like that, those RWA launches that tend to happen on many chains rather than get us to a place because I know Jon could probably respond, but he doesn't necessarily want to be in the place where he's defending Solana as he said earlier because that's not the crux of this debate. It's not a defense of Solana. Really, it's about, you know, how Ethereum could be successful. I want to pin down your take on this, uh, Ryan, and you know, like, maybe there's some shared agreement with Jon. So the central question here is how should ETH be valued? And Jon's answer to that was the base, the floor is basically DCF, and that is true for all chains is DCF. Okay, the upper limit is essentially this, this magical property called monetary premium. And his rationalization for that is you just take percent market cap of whatever you think store value demand is, whether that's Bitcoin price, the gold price, something else, and then you uh, you uh, measure Ethereum's probability of getting there for Ether, the asset, and that's essentially your valuation uh mechanism. Are you on the same page with respect to that? I know Jon, you know, rates that as very low, but as far as the mechanics, DCF is a floor and then percent probability of uh non-store store of value that equals the price that you should pay for ether. Are you, do you agree with that aspect of what he's saying?\n\nYes, Ryan, I certainly agree with the non-sovereign store of value aspect. Uh, I don't want to pigeonhole into DCF. Uh, DCF is broken. Uh, I'd encourage anyone to reach out to me if they want more information on that. Don't use DCF. So, you don't even think that's a floor. It's not a floor. It's not a floor. Uh, when it comes to non-sovereign store value, I like valuation frameworks that are directionally accurate and uh, but not necessarily precise because uh, it's difficult to be precise about the future. So look at gold, about 16 trillion. Bitcoin, about 2 trillion. Uh, Bitcoin about uh, Z, close to 0% of it is used productively. For gold, we have about uh, 50% used in jewelry. Uh, 10% used in industrial applications, and 40% held for pure investment purposes. And so I just think you say, all right, gold, 16 trillion, Bitcoin, 2 trillion after, after 16 years, uh, you know, where could Ethereum as digital oil with a high percentage of productive capacity, uh, relative to Bitcoin and, you know, similar to gold, where could it fall in that pantheon? Well, I think onchain is going to get so important to the world and so much of it's going to be on Ethereum that we could just think of Ethereum as being like, you know, a pure of Bitcoin and they both gain on gold. So, you know, for example, uh, both, both assets at 4 trillion in, you know, four, four, 10 years, for example. Okay. And this gets us maybe to sort of the the final question. Yeah. This gets us to the final question, right? Which is sort of related to this, which is you, the crux of this debate and what the market is trying to figure out is Ether the asset over or undervalued right now. I think at the time we're recording, it's probably worth, you know, 300 billion or so. Certainly in the last two years has um depreciated relative to Bitcoin, also to some other alternative uh layer 1 ecosystems. Um, lately, as you mentioned, Ryan, it's been showing some strength. The market still doesn't know where this is going to head, of course, and you've got bullish takes on this and bearish takes, but it seems like given you both agree on kind of the upper value accrual mechanism for Ether the asset, and you're saying that's a store of value. It seems incumbent on your bull position, Ryan, to make the case that Ether the asset becomes a store of value. And so if you agree with that framing, what is the case that ether the asset becomes a store of value?\n\nYeah, absolutely. And I think that uh, it's really two things. It's, it's that onchain's going to get a thousandx larger. The world's going to realize that uh, onchain isn't just some parallel financial system. It's the new financial system. It's the new economic system. It's going to permeate all aspects of the global economy from institutional and sovereign capital flows and, and, and, and business deals all the way down to uh, you know, emerging, emerging uh, countries where you're going to have uh, you know, farmers who are able to sell product directly to buyers and then, you know, ship it on individually with these point-to-point economic connections across, across oceans. And so onchain gets so important that it's naturally going to rerate the L1 token space against Bitcoin. And that that that speaks to how the L1 token space wins, but not Ethereum specifically. And then uh, the way that Ethereum specifically wins as a fraction of that L1 token space is that uh, uh, the L1 as a global hub just doubles down on that capital gravity well, on that settlement gravity well. Uh, you know, similar to how Bitcoin uh, has continued to pull ahead from its pure digital asset competitors over the years. And so, you know, the L1 today, 220 billion in app capital, about 90% of that is on L1, uh, that's that's the uh, uh, the lion share of app capital uh, in in the whole uh, the whole crypto space. Uh, I think, I think it's about 3/4 or more of all app capital, it's over 90% if you exclude Tron. Uh, the Ethereum L1 one has uh, uh, Ethereum has 59% share of stable coins, 90% on L1, 80% of real world assets, that's 3/4 on L1. And so uh, this gravity well effect is is a real thing. And you know, my, my take for Ethereum being undervalued is that onchain gets more important and Ethereum's dominance position only increases.

No hacked databases, no unnecessary personal exposure for airdrops, and no AI bots ruining community governance. Meet SELF, the onchain identity verification protocol built for privacy and control. SELF protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to confirm your identity safely. Users prove key details like age or citizenship without revealing sensitive personal information. SELF never stores your data. It only generates cryptographic proofs. Here's how it works in three steps. First, register and verify. Use the SELF app to scan your biometric passport's RFID chip. SELF verifies authenticity with zero-knowledge proofs. Each passport creates one unique identity. Second, you can share proofs privately. Third-party apps request identity proofs like confirming you're over 18. You can also link proofs securely to public wallets for airdrops or governance participation. And then last, secure verification. Apps validate your proofs instantly onchain like on Cello or offchain. Audited by ZK security. The SELF app is live on iOS and Play Store. Visit self.xyz and follow SELF protocol on X.\n\nOkay, before we get Jon to answer then price calls. So if you're saying it's undervalued, the question is by how much. So let's just define that in a price the price call market cap of ETH in the year 2030. What do you think? Multi-trillion. Two, two plus trillion. So two plus trillion in 5 years time. Yep.\n\nOkay. Jon, same question. ETH over or undervalued? Uh, overvalued today. Uh, and I'll go through the various points that Ryan had there. Um, the I mean the one very quick one which I agree I don't want to harp on Solana because I feel like we keep deflecting towards that. The I a lot of the upgrade argument I would say is just incorrect. Um, I this was not an upgrade where statements change. This wasn't like user funds were removed or anything like that. Also Ethereum has literally done this before. Uh, also this is literally the same upgrade mechanism that every chain has and like most years ago was the Dow fork. It was catastrophic and uh never, never again. You can you can do this once and you can do it a long time ago. So, sorry to interrupt, but the Dow fork was 9 years ago and this was a contract bug change, not like moving user funds or locking funds or anything like that to be very clear. Also, this is this is okay. And again, this is the same thing that every chain can do. It's literally the same validators across these chains. It's it's Coinbase. It's like P2P. It's Figment. It's literally the same people who are coordinating on these things. This is how it happens across every chain. This has happened in Bitcoin. This has happened in Ethereum. This has happened in Solana. This has happened in Cosmos. Like you don't have to even look far to see all these. It's happened many times across every chain. There are bug fixes across chains. This happens. Don't want to harp on Solana too much there. I think Bitcoin was 14 years ago and never happened again. Uh, they had an inflation bug fix in 2018. Uh, where they had coordination. I don't think it was 2018. But um regardless the again this is like I want to put this aside. The point isn't like pulling down other chains. This is supposed to be about like why Ethereum is special. Um uh so the DCF point I I I will unpack this for people also. I'm I'm we're literally going to talk about this next week with Jon on um 2020 2010. Pardon me. Look, I had to look that up. Okay. Uh yeah, that's a different one. Okay. What regardless the besides the point the so the DCF thing I mean one we're going to talk about this next week. The the circular reference argument I would say is just wrong. You can do a DCF on these things. I've like tweeted about this. I will talk about it a little more. Uh this is just like fundamentally not a problem. I I'll explain the way that like multiple people get confused and where where I know that like our actual argument is over this. A lot of people get confused on the simple idea of like oh it's because the the the the fees are like charged in this currency. To be clear that is not fundamental. Like some chains have like some notion of enshrined fee mechanisms or like the base fees you need to pay in ETH. Even that is not fundamental. Most networks don't have that. You can avoid it. You can pay fees in whatever you want on any of these networks. You can pay in USDC. You can pay your priority fees in whatever you want. You can pay your MEV tips in whatever you want. Like you can pay whatever you want across these networks. And this isn't one, this isn't like a theoretical thing. We see this literally in practice where chains are starting to and increasingly are going to move towards users are going to pay in USDC because that is the reference asset. These people denominate their wealth and they do not denominate their wealth in ETH. That is what users want and that is why we are seeing it move towards that. The way that you get a circular reference in doing a DCF like this is if you fully assume that the wealth effects are just like entirely based on the base currency and that like oh if the ETH price triples well then my willingness to pay triples and like we're basically just assuming like oh like some percent of ETH each year will be paid for fees and it's just like a completely linear relationship. If you base if you have that assumption then yes you get a circular reference. That is not reality though. I do not base my willingness to pay a fee on Ethereum linearly with the Ethereum price. That is not what I denominate my wealth in and hold my wealth in. The reference asset for the world is the US dollars. That is what people are basing their like willingness to pay for a transaction on. It's not like denominating their wealth in ETH. That is not what the world bases their wealth on. So you can very easily go forward and look forward and say, \"Hey, if I think that Ethereum is going to generate a billion dollars this year and $2 billion next year and $3 billion next year and $4 billion next year, you can run a DCF of that that breaks. If you just denominate everything in ETH and you assume that ETH is money and like people aren't denominating their wealth and dollars, which is just like not reality. And like the examples of like I mean like the other simple example is like for the denomination point like you can imagine a company like Apple saying all right we're going to you need to pay for your phones in Apple shares tomorrow instead of dollars. It doesn't make a difference. You can still look at their look at their line items and say okay they received those shares what's the dollar value of those at the time and convert that to the reference asset which is US dollars and you can see okay here's the dollar value of their revenue for the year. All they did was like these are just like mechanical tweaks to change how a buyback mechanism works is effectively all they've done. You can run a DCF on these assets like DCF is not broken because fees are paid in Solana or Ether or Apple shared. DCF is broken because in practice during this era of crypto it is overwhelmingly the case that the US dollar amount of fees is reflexive in exuberance and short-term trends and it's not representative of independent customer demand. the way it is at Costco or McDonald's. Two points there. There like there are people who will dispute this. There there are there are research papers that like very empirically show that like that is actually just not true in practice. Even if you look at backwards looking that it is not this clear reflexive relationship and again more importantly we are going to look forward not where we are today. In the early stages of crypto I would imagine that there is a higher degree of reflexivity relative to where you will go in the future because yeah it's a nent industry. People are just like putting irrational amounts of the money of a lot of native users who are using the thing. Fine. It's not where the world is going. People do not denominate their wealth in the world in ETH. And therefore, as you expand to a normal audience, you will have a correlation to what people actually denominate their wealth and spend their money in. And that is US dollars. I agree with you. as maybe maybe in 5 10 or 20 years the cash generated could be much more orthogonal to the current spot confidence in an L1 but it's simply not today and is unlikely to be so in 6 months or in a year or in two years and I think that the Solana, for example, Solana rev chart over the last few quarters demonstrates that and and again you can say the correlation in the other direction as well of like people are paying more dollars so the asset should be worth more like regardless The idea is not fundamentally broken unless you believe the reference asset for the world is this base asset and the world is going to get more mature. We're going to move towards a DCF is like absolutely a reasonable thing to use. Like it it just simply is. The other point that I want to drill on to because I I don't know if this is contradictory or you you've changed for recent ones. So you're you're discounting the importance of DCF and a lot of like fee revenue stuff which is like fine. I I want to understand the point though like I I listened to your Gwartpod before this and you were talking about like the way that Ethereum is going to get out of this mess is entirely metrics driven and primarily the number one thing is fees and that we're going to generate a bunch of fees based on DA cash flows and I've seen a bunch of your tweets in that direction. So do you think that generating you know billions of dollars of fees is important and do you believe that because that that is the point to dispute on this because you do seem to believe that that is very very valuable and I also don't think this will happen but we could debate that next. Yep.\n\nSo, Ethereum has underperformed so significantly. Like, I I have, you know, normie crypto friends and they think Ethereum is a joke. They ask me if I'm still holding my Ether. Why would I do that? Ethereum got itself into quite the situation. It was really bad. In fact, it was even worse behind closed doors. And that's all changing now. It has really the fundamental change has already occurred and the trajectory is now bright. The problem is is that the world needs salient evidence to believe it. They're not going to take our word for it. They're not We can't talk our way out of this crisis. We can only grow our way out of this crisis. And so there's really only going to be, you know, a handful of metrics to your point that are going to convince people like my normie crypto buddies that Ethereum is finally back in a great place. And one of those is going to be an increasing amount of fees on L1 from blobs and execution. And I absolutely agree that how long is it going to take for those fees to recover? Could be a while. You know, could be a long while. Blob capacity continues to increase saving off the congestion pricing. That would give us a real sense of price discovery. And you know, L1 execution demand is even slower growing. So, uh, it's going to take, you know, time. Uh other metrics include things like landmark uh institutional partnerships, institutional TVL, uh and then I think the third metric that's really emerging uh that we're starting, I think, to crush on uh slowly but surely is uh uh ether treasury companies, you know, things like the strategic Ethereum reserve, great website, uh things like uh Joe Luben's new uh SB. So absolutely agree that that fee revenue is an important signal but not because of DCF because it drives confidence. So going through this one at a high level so all we're talking about here is effectively story. It it's not like evaluation demand driven whatever type of metric like any of these things it is just we think this is going to give us a better story and fundamentally all of this still gets back to the point of nothing is a 10x better story than Bitcoin like like nothing is even close to that right now. what all of you say about that.\n\nBitcoin's 15 years old. I'm gonna be uh I'm in my late 30s. Ethereum is going to be 10 years old in July. The first stable coin is only about seven years old. Die die die die on mainet. Single collateral die. These are very very very young networks. What if there's 10 trillion in stable coin in 5 years? then the dollar will be too early to say that Bitcoin is a special snowflake that will stand a decade over decade test of time. I'm not saying it is like a 100% chance that Bitcoin is like obviously the special snowflake. I'm saying like at minimum today based on all information we have and any reasonable projection we can make. It is by far ahead of everyone else. There is no reasonable story that anyone can craft here at any point in the near to medium to even to closer to longer term that anyone is actually going to credibly have a better story than Bitcoin in the absence of Bitcoin effectively imploding whether that's quantum or a security budget issue or whatever in like 10 years from now. And even in that world honestly that's probably bad for everyone in crypto because it's probably just going to drag everyone down. But we'll see. Regardless, this is all like story points and the practical reality is like no one is going to have a better story than Bitcoin. And it is very simple and you cannot be competing fundamentally with these other ones to like have a good story. The only way that you can have a credible story as like the story value thing is if you just like are this special thing that people accept. You can't pitch ETH as money to anyone like outside like even in crypto but outside of crypto and then like oh let's just ignore the fact that like by the way we have these 10 other competitors that like might flip us on utility and all the onchain activity in the next couple years because like oh whoops that's like already sort of happening. Those are just like very fundamentally compatible. The only world where you maybe get one of these other assets to get into that category is if it just effectively wins everything. And we just don't see any evidence of that happening. Um, and then on the cash flow point, I do agree at minimum, even if you're not doing a cash flow type analysis. Like a lot of this is really just a demand signal and shown like, hey people want to\n\n\nUse a chain.\nThis is important.\nLike it's, it's just a sign if the chain is doing well.\nThe practical reality is, I like, I, I'd also like looked at the numbers that you had like posted for Ethereum.\nI, one, I don't think they're meaningful enough.\nTwo, I, I don't think that they're going to happen and like these projections make sense of, I mean, one, it's assuming like Faka 48 blobs per block when we get that the users are just going to keep paying 1% per transaction, uh, and that the the margins for L2s is like they're just going to happily pay 30% of their fees to the L1, um, was, was like the numbers you had given, like that just like doesn't line up with reality.\nIf like Coinbase is making a billion dollars a year, they're not just going to pay $300 million a year plus to Ethereum for blobs for like a relatively fungible service that they could go put on Celestial or build their own DA layer or do something else.\nThe only way that you're going to ever fundamentally generate a durable high amount of value from something like Blobs is if you just scale the hell out of this to like a million times more.\nAnd that's effectively what like the Celestia pitches, the IGNA pitches, the whatever.\nThey're like, \"Ah, maybe we can get a billion dollars or a few billion dollars a year or whatever just by scaling the hell out of this thing.\"\nAnd, you know, we get like onchain AI agent micropayments that are doing like fractions of a certain transaction.\nAnd that's like possible.\nIt like might happen.\nUm, but even I will say as someone who's like been public that like, like we own TIA, like I, I think that's possible happen, but like I won't even say that that's the base case.\nAnd then what you fundamentally get to is like something like this is an incredibly speculative and like small investment thesis that like maybe justifies you taking a bet on something at like a couple billion dollars.\nThis is not an investment thesis for an existing $300 billion asset where this is like all speculative and like none of this is proven out.\nLike all of these just like forward-looking like predictions on ETH are just like they're just not proven out.\nAnd ETH is fundamentally priced at $300 billion.\nLike it's clearly winning and like going to win and going to crush the aggregate of the competition, and we just don't see that if we look at the numbers on the ground today and then project forward based on everything that is going on, like where is activity actually going to go from here, guys?\nUm, this has been great.\nI know we can go for another hour probably on this uh debate subject, and maybe we will another time.\nI want to end with uh this question.\nIt's maybe an introspective question for you both.\nUm, Jon first to you, if you're wrong about Ether, how will you be wrong?\nThe most likely way that it's wrong in my, if I were to guess, is that uh Ethereum gets itself into a good enough position for the next, call it, 5, 10 years, whatever, where it's still very relevant.\nIt's a, it's a very big platform, and then Bitcoin missteps.\nUm, whether that's like quantum becomes a real issue in like 5 to 10 years or the security budget and like you're in the second-best position, and the world has such a demand for a non-sovereign store value crypto asset that like somehow the the second one ends up taking the rates, and people don't lose confidence in crypto assets as a whole, which I, I, I, I don't think is likely, um, but that is the most likely way for the gigantic outcome is I think that I, I think a lot of it relies on Bitcoin misstepping, um, which and competitors too, like assuming that these other ones don't also catch up, which is the difficult part.\nI, it's not clear to me that Ethereum's fate is, is, is in its own hands at this point, uh, based on the rate that it can move.\nRyan, we know you're the ETH bull in this debate, but same question to you.\nIf you're wrong about Ether, how will you be wrong?\nIt's such a great question, and uh, it's similar to the question, like, what keeps me up at night?\nAnd two things for Ethereum really keep me up at night.\nThe first is if we take Ethereum's reliability for granted.\nIf Ethereum has a material outage, uh, or something of that category of disaster, it invites a direct comparison with other platforms.\nSimilar to when Bitcoin has to add tail inflation to solve security budget crisis, or it, it dispels the sacred cow, and Ethereum's reliability must be absolute.\nSo that keeps me up at night.\nThe other thing that keeps me up at night is the need to meet our customers, especially our new customers that aren't yet on the platform where they're at.\nBillions of people are going to come on chain.\nEthereum needs 10 different Etherealizes.\nEthereum needs many more Y combinator style batch, you know, serious startup incubators and accelerators.\nWe have to get out there and cultivate business development and net new innovation because we have the best platform, but that's not enough.\nWe have to grow demand for what we sell, which is onchain economy.\nI think we'll end it there.\nJon, Ryan, thank you so much for joining us for this debate.\nFun, fun.\nThank you.\nThanks for having us.\nBankless Nation got to let you know none of this has been financial advice.\nOf course, crypto is risky.\nETH could go up, it could go down.\nUh, both of our panelists have different perspectives on that, I suppose.\nBut we are headed west as always.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey.\nThanks a lot.\n",
