  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBankless Nation, it's the third week of June. It's time for the Bankless Weekly roll up. Man, exciting week this week. We got the GENIUS Act. It just passed in the Senate. And uh is the Secretary of Treasury bullposting on crypto, David? He called for uh 3.7 trillion in stablecoins by the year 2030. That's a That's a pretty decent bull post. Did he call for a Stablecoin Summer? No, we got to get him saying it. That's next.\n\nJP Morgan is also joining in on Stablecoin Summer with their own stablecoin on the base network. Uh but it's a little bit different from the rest. So we're going to talk about that. And then Coinbase releases not one, not two, not three, four banger products that we're going to talk about as well. We're going to rank order our favorites. And overall, there's just a lot of chaos in the world. Uh there's a conflict in the Middle East and BlackRock has a take saying smart money is buying chaos. We'll talk about exactly what that means. Dude, I'm glad I got you saying Stablecoin Summer now, too. It was not in our notes. That just popped in your head. The virus has spread. Some people on Bankless Discord actually sent me. It was a Coinbase email. And you know what the title, you know, the subject of the email was? It was like the big newsletter they sent out to all their customers. You know what it was? Stablecoin Summer. Stablecoin Summer. It's here. I cannot believe how sticky that has gotten. It was always going to be sticky. Uh, and I think we got prices to back it. You're going to show some circle charts later in the episode, right? Yeah, we're going to show some Stablecoin Summer charts. That's right.\n\nLet's do that. First, we got a message for everyone going to DEVCONNECT down in Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires is probably the greatest crypto city, I think, on the planet. I'm going to go ahead and say that we are doing the second ever BANKLESS SUMMIT at DEVCONNECT. If you don't know what BANKLESS SUMMIT is, it's like TED talks for Ethereum doing it at DEVCONNECT. We're doing it on Tuesday. Uma is our brand new sparkly speaker. She's joining the bench of all the speakers that we got at DEVCONNECT, including Justin Drake, Donrad, Onscar, Arjun, a returning speaker, and then Tamas from the Ethereum Foundation. So, that's not until November, but let me tell you, you heard it here first. So, if you're going to DEVCONNECT, make sure you get your tickets. It's going to be all day event. Again, no panels, no performative panels, just talks. Uh, and then we have a wine bar uh rented out. Did I tell you about that yet, Ryan? We're renting out a wine bar. We're actually renting out FedE's wine bar. I don't know if you know who FedE is, but uh of course Fed is. Yeah, absolutely. Got a wine bar and we're renting it. Uh the special wine, Argentinian wine, like you know, naturally. Yeah. MX is probably what the word that you're looking for. Oh man, this is this is worth going to just for that. Huh. And the bar is really high on these BANKLESS SUMMITs cuz the last one was like an absolute banger. I mean, I watched almost every presentation that came out of that remotely of course, but uh there was just fantastic content. So hopefully the speakers are prepped for that level of of content. Huh. I I have told them that it is their job to take command over their session and they all they all understand the assignment. Anyway, secure your tickets before price goes up in the future.\n\nSpeaking of prices going up, it didn't they did not they did not go up. They actually went down. Uh Bitcoin price went down 3.4%. $104,000 is where we are. ETH price went down even more. It is not what I'm going to call a Ryan Sean Adams week. I don't take no credit for this. Iran takes no credit is down 9%. ETH down 9% to $2,500. What the heck? You know, things were looking so rosy and then you you said it about the chaos in the world, Israel and Iran and that started happening, escalating even more and then we we did a tank it seemed like on the back of that. We did a little tanky things started happen Thursday, Friday. I don't know. Um, I mean, Bitcoin actually started to really appreciate after the conflict and, you know, it got it got its regular jitters. We're going to talk about this because BlackRock put out a piece about this. Got it got its regular jitters whenever uncertainty happens, but then it started to perform really strong. Uh, but now we're just like ranging again. We are ranging. You know what has gone up? Let me tell you, circle price. This chart is the chart of Stablecoin Summer. Uh, last week, Ryan, we were talking about the circle price. Uh, do you remember what it was? Uh roughly last week, roughly 7 days ago. Yeah. I I was thinking around 80. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Which was just fine. You know, it was down from the $110 peak that it had like two days prior, but $80 for Circle is incredible. Uh have you been watching the price action? No, I've been cur seeing tweets about it. I've not looked at charts, but I mean even the 80 that was way it was up double you like more than almost triple, right? From like what was the IPO price? 30 something like this. 31 32. Mhm. Okay. Hey, what are we doing now? We are clocking in at $199.84.\n\nAnd it all it hit like an intraday high of like $230, which put Circle at something like a $55 billion market cap. The $199 price, that's a $48 billion market cap. But Circle is like almost a Coinbase. Coinbase is currently at $75 billion after having a 15% day uh the day before recording. So Circle or Coinbase also had% up. 15% up. Yeah, 15% up. Yeah, but Circle is just it is starting to be completely dulu price action right now. This is crazy. It can't this can't continue, right? I'm not going to short it, but it can't continue. I I thought about like, man, I I know it's dumb to short and I'm not a short seller and I should not do that, but man, I want to short it. And that I was thinking those thoughts of like $110. And just admire, just admire. That's all you have to do. You brought some other charts though. What do we got here? Okay, this chart is the Salana Ethereum ratio. Salana is flat versus ether on the year on the year. I mean it's obviously done on the whole year. So I mean it's June 19th so 6 months 19 days Salana versus ETH is flat. So Salana Salana's shown some some weakness um just over the last like couple months or so and over Ether over the last like six six months has been flat. Obviously the six months before that were very bullish for Salana but Salana has not made any ground. This is this is soul weakness or ETH strength or does the answer that yes yeah I think that's up for interpretation of the listener. Um but there's definitely some sole weakness not which is not to say that ETH has been strong. ETH did have that like 50% candle day, but so far that's kind of proven to just be um just a one-off and really a hard time. Yeah, they did not turn that 50% candle day into momentum as of yet. If you look at the next chart, which is uh soul BTC, does this chart look familiar to you, Ryan, at all? When you look at the shape shape of this chart, the soul salana bitcoin chart, soul BTC ratio, it just looks like an asset that is just bleeding lately anyway, bleeding out since 2024 looks like bleeding out to Bitcoin, right? To king Bitcoin, just kneeling. It's just like kneeling. It's crouching down before the king and it's, you know, apologizing, kissing some feet maybe.\n\nSo, when you look at this chart, like oh, and let's go open up the next chart, which is the ETH BTC ratio. No, this is the And there's a flip back and forth between the Salana Bitcoin ratio and the the Ethereum Bitcoin ratio. Do you just notice anything? Yeah, it's bleed season. They're just bleeding to the same chart. Just Salana is just one one and a half years behind Ethereum. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's the same chart. There's a little bump. It's like there's a little green right here lately in the last uh you know, two months or so. So, maybe not. All hope is lost. There's got to be some reversion to the mean here, right? Overall, like the big common denominator I'm seeing is like Bitcoin strength is just so high. I mean, we the other chart that's missing here is Bitcoin dominance, which continues to be very, very high. I mean, altcoin season is nigh though, David. It's got to be because it's around that time and Bitcoin cannot get to means anymore.\n\nAh, you'll remember once we get the the first hints of green, the first green shoots in these charts, you'll remember. Sure. Sure. I I'm still a believer. All right, let's get into the rest of the markets news. Uh Trump's Truth Social has filed for a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. This is in addition to their Bitcoin ETF. So now they have another one. The allocation will be 75% Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum, which will rebalance quarterly to maintain that ratio. Ticker B.T.\n\nuh custodiancrypto.com. Uh they are again like they already like I said they already had their Bitcoin um S1 filed like one or two weeks ago. Uh so the SEC has a 45day window to review this can stretch it up to 240 days. If green lit it could launch in later in 2025. Dual ETFs are weird. Like I can just buy if I want to I can buy 75% Bitcoin ETF and 25% ETH if I want to. I don't need somebody to like duel it for me and just I don't know. Yeah, at that point just like I'd prefer to have some something like ARC, which is like an actively managed ETF by somebody who I trust. But and speaking of ETFs, David, there's a lot more on the horizon. This this might revive the altcoin season uh in except as a ETF season in maybe. Uh, so this is um I believe this is a chart of the Bloomberg probability of approval for down market assets, non- Bitcoin, non-ETH assets of when they're going to get their ETF. Okay. And the Bloomberg guys are pretty good at this. This is their job. So odds of approval in 2025. Again, not next month, but this year for Litecoin above 90% for Salana above 90%. for XRP 85% for Dogecoin 80%. Cardano even 75%. We're just getting ETFs for all the things. Wow. Wow. This is just extremely favorable. Everyone is most more likely to pass than not pass. Yeah. I mean, I guess this is not surprising given we have such a a crypto favorable administration and SEC and we have kind of the the whatever the opposite of Gendler is, that's who Paul Atkins is as the as the chair. So, we're getting approvals for all of these. And there's also talk that some of these ETFs will include staking. Maybe the Salana ETF will include staking for instance, which also begs the question, how about ETH staking ETF? That's coming as well. What's what's that waiting on? If one gets the staking ETF, then the other will too. Okay. I think they'll come at the same time. Did you notice though? Uh look at the firms that have filed for the S1's for all these uh other ETFs. Mhm. What's missing? Which firm is missing here? Uh okay. Yeah, I see. Grayscale, Bitwise, hashtags, Franklin Templeton, uh, Coin Shares, Van 21 shares. These are all I'm reading off all the potential issuers. Yeah. Um, who are you missing? Who is the big uh multi- trillion dollar asset manager in the room that doesn't have a down market ETF that they want approved? Yeah. No, there's no there's no Say it. BlackRock. There's no BlackRock. Yeah. Which like you would wonder, BlackRock, they're not dummies. So why not issue anything below Bitcoin and Ethereum. As we know, both Bitcoin and Ethereum had massively successful ETFs, like incredible demand compared to any other type of ETF that came before it. And uh I mean, we've talked to BlackRock people before. Uh they they would say that they would issue an ETF if they had consumer demand for it, if their clients actually demanded for it. And so my indication understanding th those statements that they've said that they don't think that there is demand down market beyond ether uh which is a hypothesis is an idea that we will be able to test if all of these things are more likely than not to get approved by the end of 2025. We will be able to see exactly how much demand there is for a Dogecoin ETF or a Salana ETF. Yeah, I wonder I you really have to wonder how much demand there is going to be for Dogecoin ETF, right? the thing that was like I just wanted dogecoin in my 401k and I wasn't going to buy Dogecoin before now but now that it's in my now it's in Robin Hood I can get it. Yeah. So maybe Oh, it's already in Robin Hood. Yeah, it is. Yeah. So like maybe BlackRock has kind of the right idea. Maybe the market's just too small or may like and that's the thing that would push this over to 100%. Cuz if BlackRock was on the one of these, you know, then probability is 100% because BlackRock always gets what they want, right?\n\nDo you want to talk about the uh the Fed this week, what they're doing with interest rates? David, I would like for you to inform me about what happened. Yes, please. It's pretty simple. The answer is nothing. They're not doing anything. So, they're keeping the rates the same. Target range 4.25% to 4.5%. This was completely expected. This was inscript. And much to uh Trump's dismay, did you see some of the clips coming out about Donald Trump? This just like entertaining. Okay, it's just entertainment. I'm going to play you one. Here it is. Doing well. Well, and as a country, if the Fed would ever lower rates, you know, would buy debt for a lot less. It's a shame this guy. I have a guy. Do you ever have a guy that's not a smart person and you're dealing with him and you have to deal?\n\n\nHe's not a smart guy. He's worried about inflation. I said, \"That's right. If there's inflation in 6 months or 9 months, you lower the rates. So, you raise the rates. You can do whatever you want, Brian.\" Right. So, let's say there's rampant inflation, which there's none. You know what? There is a success. I got a call from Congress last night. Sir, there's a problem. I said, \"What is it? Money is pouring in. We don't know how to account for it.\" I said, \"Check the tariffs.\" $88 billion came in from tariffs. No inflation and it's going to get even more so. I know what I'm doing. So, we have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed. He probably won't cut today. Europe had 10 cuts and we had none. And I guess he's a political guy. I don't know. He's a political guy who's not a smart person. But he's costing the country a fortune. So, what I'm going to do is you know, he gets out in about nine months. He has to he's gets fortunately terminated.\n\nThat was Donald Trump. Uh speaking of Fed chair Jerome Powell being a total bully.\n\nIf you That clip goes on for three five minutes. We only played a bit of it. But the whole time he's just calling Jerome Powell a stupid man. He's like, \"Oh man, I have to deal with a stupid man. He just makes stupid decisions.\" Like if it goes up, you just raise rates. If it goes down, you lower rates. Simple as that. It's all ad lib. It's like it This looks like a standup routine to He's got, you know, in the background these like kind of I don't know, the construction workers are just like laughing, chuckling along with everything he says. Anyway, the Fed is supposed to be independent, make its own decisions. Uh, we'll see how long that lasts. Right now, they're they're holding the line here. Uh, something else that's been happening in the chaos, of course, Israel, Iran, conflict. You'd expect investors to flee to the safe haven assets, right, David? Right. Yeah. conflict in the Middle East with one of the world's largest oil producers where there's a fight, a tugof-war over nuclear weapons. That's scary for markets. That's uncertainty for markets. And what is the safe haven asset of safe haven assets? What sets the risk-free rate for all capital? My favorite assets on the world in the world, bonds. Bonds. Bonds. That's right. Treasuries. Okay. But a curious thing happened when this conflict was breaking out. All right. which is uh treasuries didn't look like safe haven assets at all. So their yields barely budged after the Israeli attacks on Iran and that was pretty chaotic for markets. Instead what happened yields have gone up. Yields have gone up since then. Yeah. Exactly. Instead what happened was gold and silver took a run and they started appreciating. So are investors fleeing to gold rather than treasuries? I mean, seems like it looks like it from the charts and that was a pretty instant reaction here. Yeah. Downstream of that, gold has now eclipsed the euro in market cap. So, uh I mean I come kind of surprised that it hadn't already. Uh but turns out because of the appreciation of gold and also just net buying of gold by European countries as well as China and Turkey, non-European countries pushing up the price of gold, uh gold is now larger than the euro. Yeah. So gold on central bank balance sheets is about 20% of all central bank reserves, right? And so I guess the dollar is still at 46%. So treasuries has 46%. But um euros is only 16%. You know, Black Rock is trying to do this thing. We we had them on last summer and they keep saying that Bitcoin is not a um a riskon asset. It's a riskoff asset. Okay. And they're continually trying to reinforce this and they put together uh this chart. David, what what do you see in this chart? This is this is a chart of major uh catalyst. It's a table really of major catalyst cat you know kind of catast uh catastrophic events things that are destabilizing. You've got in 2020 U.S. Iran escalation. You've got COVID outbreak. You've got the election uh challenges of 2020. You've got the Russia uh invasion of Ukraine. And what they're charting here is 10-day return for uh S&P 500 for gold and for Bitcoin. And you look at the 10-day return and you look at the 60-day return. You see all the green here, David. So, Bitcoin is green. It's green on the 10-day for a number of these events. Three three out of um the the the I guess six here. And on the 60-day return, it's green in all of the events, basically. All of them. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. So what they're making the case is, hey, 60 day 60 days from a destabilizing event, something like Israel and Iran conflict, what tends to happen is first Bitcoin maybe it goes down, but days later it's back up. So they're saying it's a it's actually a riskoff asset. It's not a risk asset. Yeah. And they've been saying this for over a year now. And I think with the Israel Iran conflict, you actually really just it's one thing to make a prediction, you know, looking at data retroactively, but then something after that prediction happens that would test that hypothesis and Bitcoin performed right in line with that hypothesis. So it's growing in confidence that that's exactly what Bitcoin does. It gets the jitters just like all other assets, but then after that it just comes out stronger. So what that means is if this follows the trend 60 days from now, we're going to be well into the green. Granted, if you zoom the longer you zoom out, the more likely Bitcoin is going to be green. So at some point is also measuring that at the same time. All right. So in addition to uh Stablecoin Summer, it's also spa summer. Uh so Justin Sun's Tron Group is trying to go public in the United States with a special like acquisition vehicle for TRX. Uh the Wall Street Journal or maybe it was a Financial Times. They've reported it as Trust and Tren like Tron trying to go public. That's not what's happening. It's basically a micro strategy for TRX. Uh, and this happens just a number of months after U.S. regulators paused a fraud probe into Justin Sun and his companies under his control, which is after Justin Sun makes a major investment into World Liberty Financial and the Trump Memecoin and does a like a video blog of Justin Sun's attendance of the memecoin dinner. I don't know if you saw that that blog. Um uh and so there's a little bit of like what's going on over here because not only that but uh Justin Sun will is going to be an adviser to Tron Inc. the company of course that makes sense but so will Eric Trump. The Trump family will reportedly have a position on the board of this like special acquisition vehicle for Tron. The special uh acquisition vehicle is like a micro strategy for Tron, right? And so Justin Sun is depositing it's like 1% of all TRX supply into the the balance sheet to just start treasury company. And then there's some there was some question as to how involved Eric Trump was. I think it it first came out that he was like actually active in the project like one of the you know leadership team and then Eric Trump said uh that he's not he denied that he's having that uh role in the new he said I'm the biggest fan of Tron and love Justin Sun. He's a great friend and an icon in the space. That said the below isn't accurate. Uh I don't have public involvement in this company. There's been like three things that have come out of the Trump orbit where like the Trump sons are like, \"I do have involvement in this one. I don't have involvement with that one.\" And they just have to make clarifying statements all the time. Yeah, I know. It's every week. It's honestly, it's been every week since I've gotten back here. Um, this is a this is a tweet uh commenting on the this effect. Am I getting this right? Number one, Tron investigated by the SEC for market manipulation. Number two, Justin Sun becomes top holder of Trump and World Liberty Financial. Number three, investigation is dropped. Number four, Trump goes public via reverse merger with Eric Trump taking a role at the company. Crime season is here. Crime season. Crime. What do you think of this? Uh,\n\nI mean, this is this is what it cost to get Trump into into presidency. We have the GENIUS Act. We have Ross Olrich going free. There are some really nice things about the Trump presidency. And then we have this. This is uh Molly White who's obviously a permacritic of everything going on in crypto. She's taking log of all of these things. So tweet was so weak. I tell you I'm usually like able to give Molly the benefit of the doubt on most things. Like I I accept her points at times. Like I I she's a valuable critic. This one I thought was uncharacteristically weak of her. She uh tweeted out describe what it is. Quid pro quo between cryptocurrency firms, the Trump administration, and the Trump family's crypto ventures. And so she tweets out a picture of a chart and she lists the company, the benefits uh that they are getting because of Trump being in office and then the contribute contributions that they made. Uh so like Cumberland, DRW, Ripple, Coinbase, A16Z, Gemini, Kraken, Circle, Robin Hood, Consensus, BINANCE, Crypto.com are all listed and they all she like labeled out all the benefits that they get like Circle the SEC approved the Circle IPO. Uh Circle's also getting favorable stable coin regulation with the GENIUS Act. you know, Cumberland DRW SEC enforcement case was dismissed with prejudice. Ripple SEC enforcement case pending revolution, right? And so all the the benefits that crypto companies have gotten now that Trump is in office. And then there is also Justin Sun SEC enforcement case stayed criminal investigation possibly paused. Um like I just thought like she's just using the Biden the Biden uh chokeoint 2.0 oppression of the industry as this benchmark of what ought to have been. And then now that anything different has happened that's positive towards crypto, she is alluding to being a quid pro quo of the crypto industry to the Trump administration, which is just like totally unfair. It's like you're the benchmark that she's using is completely unconstitutional.\n\nYeah. I mean, I guess some of this is would you say some of this is fair, but most some part which is it's convenient that she listed him first and then all the other like Coinbase C like how is circle going public a quid pro quo to the Trump administration? Yeah. And also you look at kind of the SEC enforcement against Coinbase and and uh you know on down Kraken and Robin Hood. I mean that was unjustified in the first place, right? I mean it's like that should never h have happened. And the SEC and as well as the FDIC uh was completely weaponized against crypto. And so what choice did some of these crypto companies have? What I hate about this is you're forced to pick a camp, right? And like uh that's why I feel like everything forces us into you're either pro crypto or you're against like crypto. Either crypto is kind of bribing its way into uh relevance or it's you know surviving for its life against a a brutal government. Right? This is a problem with government. If you don't pay the government like tax then you get stamped out as an industry. Crypto is not the first or the second or the third industry to learn learn this. every industry just learns that you have to bribe government to make your industry illegal. And so it's not fair for her to single out the crypto industry. This is just the way that things are. You know, Elizabeth Warren came in with a hammer against the big banks and now the big banks are her biggest donors. I don't see the Molly White tweet about that relationship between big banks and Elizabeth Warren. Like go tweet about that. You're just you're just criticizing the notion of money and politics, which I'm also a critic of, but you don't get to say that this is a uniquely crypto thing that we are doing. and we are just playing the game shoulder-to-shoulder with all other industries. Yeah, I will say the Justin Sun thing that's pretty unique. Yeah, it's really it's really unfortunate that Justin Sun is really [ __ ] all this up for us. But what do you think of the overall soul of crypto right now as you kind of like look back? So this is Zach XPTt, right? And he is the sheriff of crypto, good guy, white hat, has helped so many in the space. Uh he said he put out a tweet this he basically said this the crime super cycle is indeed very real. He's talking about crypto. While true the industry has historically been ripe for abuse, has noticeably increased since politicians launched memecoins and numerous court cases were dropped, further enabling behavior. He goes on, he talks about the laundering, money laundering that's going on with OTC uh brokers. Uh he talks about Kos facing zero repercussions, basically scamming their communities. Uh courts siding with smart contract exploiters, so basically like criminals. uh h can we fix the system if the vast majority of people still do not care unless they lose money? There's kind of a a feeling of like some OGs in crypto that we're that we're losing the that we're losing something that this, you know, crime season is kind of rotting out the soul. Uh what's your feeling of it? Yeah, it it does kind of feel like the Overton window of onchain crypto markets has drifted farther to crime than like any of the OGs really hoped that it would. And then you have like serious companies, Robin Hood, Coinbase, Circle, uh, going public on the public stock market and like we're like, \"Oh, we're left with like leftovers and we don't really get any cool valuable tokens. We only the all the tokens that are like interesting investments are all problem childs.\" Um, we'll talk about that with the Black Works transparent transparency report initiative that comes later in the show because there's the whole idea that like as crime permeates and becomes normalized then the whole sector becomes uninvestable and so tokens are like becoming uninvestable which is problematic because we want tokens to become the new way to issue equity. But if if you're just issuing your equity shoulder-to-shoulder with crime then\n\n\nLike, maybe it's better off to be in the public markets.\nI think that's a pretty logical train of thought.\nI mean, have we swung too far in the other side of this, right?\nIt's like, now everything's permitted, and so, you know, criminals are coming in.\nUh, at, I mean, previously, a year or two ago, it was operation chokepoint.\nNothing was permitted.\nThey're trying to choke out the industry.\nBut now, this is Taylor Monahan.\nShe's saying crypto right now is in a rough spot.\nIt's attracting and retaining more antisocial, selfish, corrupt people while excluding, demoralizing, and wrecking those who are good faith, cooperative, selfless.\nIs there an element of that?\nUh, yeah, I think, I think people have a hard time like parsing the good guys from the bad guys in crypto.\nMy take is, you know, the bally corkscrew of progress, right?\nWhere sometimes you kind of go too far on one side, and then you go too far on the other, but, but you're always corkscrewing up into, into some progress here.\nI feel like that's what crypto kind of is.\nWe went operation chokepoint.\nNow we're probably going a little too far in the crime season.\nWe'll balance back out.\nYeah, hopefully sooner rather than later.\nAll right, coming up next, we're going to talk about the GENIUS Act, the stable coin bill that the Senate just voted yes on.\nIt is almost done, but we got some hurdles left over.\nWe're going to talk about that.\nUh, and then JP Morgan, whose CEO called Bitcoin a pet rock, uh, and said if he would the government, he would shut it down, is now launching a tokenized deposit token on base.\nInteresting.\nWe're going to talk about all of that and more.\nBut first, a

the Senate.\nThe vote was 68 to 30, like overwhelming bipartisan support.\nHappened roughly 6 weeks after Senator Bill Hagerty, who we just had on the podcast, go listen to that episode, introduced the legislation in the first place.\nUh, we also got some Trump commentary.\nThe Senate just passed an incredible bill that is going to make America the all caps undisputed leader in digital assets.\nNobody will do it better.\nIt is pure all caps genius.\nDigital assets are the future and our nation is going to own it.\nThe House will hopefully move lightning fast, pass a clean GENIUS Act, get it to my desk ASAP.\nNo delays, no add-ons.\nTrump wants that bill on his desk.\nHe doesn't want the House to add anything because if the House adds anything, then it has to go back to the Senate.\nSo Trump saying, \"House, don't do anything other than vote yes so I can sign this bill into law,\" which bullish, very bullish.\nSpeaking of bullish, this is Secretary Scott Bessant, the Treasury Secretary of the U.S.\nHe said recent reporting projects that stable coins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of this decade.\nYeah, he's increasing his price targets.\nThat's, that's kind of some bull market top signal of activity right there.\nThat's, it's fantastic coming from a treasury secretary.\nHe said a thriving stable coin ecosystem will drive a demand from the private sector for treasuries which back stable coins.\nThis demand could lower government borrowing costs and help re in the national debt.\nHe gets it.\nHe's looking at uh stable coin holders and he's saying, \"Oh, these are customers.\nThese are people who will buy my bonds when, when maybe countries won't.\"\nHe's getting the full picture.\nThis is everything we've been saying, and to have the Treasury Secretary behind it is uh something else.\nThere's also an interview.\nI, I think this is really going to change the conversation.\nIf there's anyone left in government who is saying crypto is bad for the U.S., maybe it's bad for the U.S. dollar.\nThis is um the Treasury Secretary in response to a reporter who used that line, cuz crypto, that, I mean, that seems to be a threat to the dollar, doesn't it?\nI think it's the opposite.\nOh, really?\nI, I think stable coins could reinforce dollar supremacy because with stable coins, stable coins could end up being one of the largest buyers of U.S. treasuries or T- bels.\nSo all of a sudden, if you are using a stable coin in Nigeria that's backed by the U.S. dollar, you don't actually have to have dollars.\nIt's on your phone.\nYou can transact.\nSo, I think there's a very good chance that crypto is actually one of the things that locks in dollar supremacy.\nIsn't that crazy?\nHe was so ready for that question.\nYeah, he was like smiling.\nI'm so glad you asked.\nHe's smiling the whole way through.\nHe's what's interesting about this.\nYou know, the big concern all the way back the genesis of of crypto is that it would be choked off by the world governments, in particular the U.S.\nOkay.\nSo if Bitcoin crypto is starting to threaten the U.S. dollar, what's the U.S., what's the U.S. going to do?\nIt's just going to choke it off.\nThis to me is signal that we have completely neutralize that threat.\nAnd this is surprising to a lot of probably people who, you know, back in 2015, if you told them, \"Look, the U.S. is actually going to use crypto rails to export dollar supremacy and they're going to love crypto,\" that would have been surprising to them.\nSo, I feel like we've completely, at least in this cycle, neutralized the the the attack from the U.S. government on crypto, and that's a big win as well.\nOkay, question, hypothetical question.\nDemocrats get elected next uh election cycle, uh blue House, blue uh Congress, blue Senate, blue president.\nHow far back does the pendulum swing?\nOr is crypto like well embedded and Democrats learned their lesson and they're like, \"You know what, we're just not touching it.\nIt's, we're just going to let it go.\"\nI think there's going to be a backlash.\nI think there is going to be a like a Thor hammer smacked on the head of, oh, a bad backlash.\nYes, in in certain sectors of crypto, but not all of it.\nIn the in the next two to four years, it's going to become so embedded that you won't be able to kind of completely strip it out, but there will be some sort of backlash, right?\nIt's like, you know, in the st, in the GENIUS bill, there was, they called it, Democrats called it the Trump loophole.\nAll of Congress was not able to issue a stable coin or or make profits based on the issuing of a stable coin.\nNo member of Congress could do that.\nBut you know who could?\nThe president of the United States.\nAll right.\nWell, if that's where the backlash goes, that's totally fine.\nThere's things that Circle going public, and I hope many more crypto companies going public.\nIs there something that does cement stable coin position, and so at least with stable coins, I don't think there's going to be much blowback.\nI agree.\nMaybe other parts of the market.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nMay, maybe other parts of the market.\nThere are still some threats here.\nWill this bill pass?\nThat's the question.\nPoly markets giving it an 82% chance right now, um, which is pretty good.\nI mean, there is some question though.\nWhat does this mean for some established stable coins?\nObviously, this is very bullish for Circle.\nHow about Tether, though?\nBecause Tether is kind of the the stepchild of stable coins, right?\nIt's like offshore.\nIt's got this reputation of maybe like being used uh from criminals uh and is, you know, a bit nef, maybe nefarious.\nIt's certainly not a domestic asset.\nSo, what happens to Tether in this bill?\nI would say uh just kind of reading but his body language and some of his answers when we asked him about the GENIUS Act, Paulo is indifferent.\nI think Tether is, that was your take?\nI think Tether is so large that Paulo is like, \"I don't care.\nI am, I'm the 18th largest Treasury owner.\nI am sitting shoulderto-shoulder with countries like, I, I'm the fifth largest Treasury purchaser in the last 20, in the last 12 months.\nI don't care.\nLike I'll, um, The GENIUS Act is interesting to me.\nI'm gonna issue my domestic United States flavor of Tether just to be in that market, but like I'm so large that I'm bigger than the GENIUS Act.\"\nThat was my take.\nHe's just completely unaffected.\nI, I can totally see that interpretation.\nI mean like mechanically in the GENIUS Act, what it means is that if, if USDC does nothing right now, okay, within 3 years it will be completely banned from the U.S.\nSo no CRYPTO EXCHANGE can list it.\nAll right.\nIt no bank can kind of service it.\nIt's, it's out of here.\nIt's, it's out of here.\nNow there is an opportunity for Tether to acquire an OC license.\nAnd Paulo told us, \"Yeah, we're planning to do that.\"\nAnd he also told us they're planning to do a domestic onshore U.S. based stable coin, too.\nSo they still want to have like do both and pursue both at the same time.\nAnd it seems to me he thinks that the big use for stable coins is actually not in the U.S. banking.\nNot, it's not domestic at all.\nIt's not in the U.S. banking system.\nForeign.\nYeah.\nIt's foreign.\nIt's for everybody that doesn't currently have access to a U.S. bank, right?\nAnd so he thinks that Tether is best positioned to capitalize on that market whether it gets through the OC license under the GENIUS Act or not.\nIt does kind of um buy for cake from tether in the sense that circle is for domestic payments and tether is for uh foreign like crypto dollars, like a euro dollar.\nIt is the new euro dollar market and that's not necessarily for payments.\nIt's for reserves.\nIt's for, it's like a savings vehicle.\nIt's for bank deposits in in foreign banks.\nIt's for individual deposits in the Tether bank account on whatever blockchain they use.\nUh, and so very different outcomes I think even though the end product is kind of the same.\nIt does strike me though that there are some losers on the back of this bill.\nUh, again, assuming it, it, it gets approved.\nAnd that's got to be the Visas and Mastercards.\nThat's got to be the incumbent payment system that charges 3% on every single consumer transaction in the U.S.\nThat's a tax.\nI don't know, like I live in Virginia.\nThe state tax is like 5%.\nOkay.\nThe Mastercard and Visa tax is 3%.\nIt's almost as high as my state, you know, consumption tax, right?\nWhich is absolutely crazy.\nAnd it feels like if stable coins really take off in the way that we think they can, that um rent seeeking is going to be eroded.\nYeah.\nWhich is a fundamental promise that the crypto industry started writing in like 2010, 2011.\nSo, it's good to finally see that actually kind of show up in reality, like Visa, Mastercard stock prices reacting to this is finally indicative of this is actually here.\nAnd there's also other news in this rollup that we'll talk about with um uh Shopify and USDC and base, which is again just again going right after these payment stepping uh the credit cards, right?\nBase is the new Visa.\nShopify is the new endpoint.\nYou promised to tell us uh about the JPM coin.\nSo, what's this?\nA stable coin from JP Morgan?\nYeah, not not a stable coin.\nA tokenized bank deposit.\nUh, what's the difference?\nI'm not too sure.\nBut this one is also permissioned.\nIt's like an intra network for JP Morgan and it's supposed to just be for JP Morgan and his permission clients.\nUh, how a um, how\n\n\nA JPMD token is different from a stable coin at the end of the day. I think we aren't totally sure, but first of its kind on a public blockchain. It'll be issued on base, uh, and for, you know, 24/7, 365 settlements between JP Morgan accounts. Uh, like, why permissioned? Unsure, I guess, is they're just using base as like backend bank account infrastructure for themselves, but using a public blockchain. Uh, I, I, I doesn't really impact me. I don't really know. Uh, what's your take?\n\nIt's interesting, right? So there's this, the word that JP Morgan has filed a trademark for something called JPM MD. Okay. Which appears to be a stable coin, right? So that happened. And then also there, um, base, Coinbase has announced that JP Morgan put the tokenized deposits, as you said, on chain on base as using that as a settlement layer, and that's called JPMD. It's the same, it's the same JPMD, right? But this is, as you like, it's not like a stable coin because you can't move it from one address to another. It's just for institutions, and it, so it's on chain, but it's unclear like why it's on chain or what you can do with it. It's on chain, and I'm really not sure why JP Morgan is pursuing this rather than the GENIUS Act stable coin strategy, which feels like, okay, you just got the green light to do an actual stable coin. Just make an actual stable coin. You are a bank. Go do a stable coin. Go do it. You now, you can now do it, basically. So, so maybe this is a stepping stone to that. It probably is. That's probably the future. And it's pretty significant because the guy who said, like, if I was the U.S. government, I'd kill Bitcoin. I'd ban Bitcoin. Now his bank is issuing a stable coin on a public, uh, blockchain. So more, more from them, I'm sure.\n\nI'll read a quote from Alex Thorn's newsletter, which goes out today. Um, it's very possible that this is innovation theater with an announcement timed to benefit from the glowing coverage of stable coins and not much more than that. Oh, ah, maybe so, deadly. All right.\n\nComing up next, we're going to talk about all the big Coinbase announcements that came out of their Coinbase State of Crypto, uh, event that they held last week. Uh, and then also Kraken launches a token for their layer 2. And we're going to talk about all this and more.

They tweeted out, \"Most tokens launch with a vibe and a prayer. Inc is launching with utility. A single token model designed for usage, not speculation, no fluff, no governance theater, just aligned incentives from day one.\" Uh, so what's the token going to do? Primarily for usage in DeFi, it sounds like it's going to be incentives for TVL in DeFi. Uh, they are getting a version of a is deploying onto the Inc. network. Uh, and so they are going to mint a fixed supply of 1 billion Inc. tokens. Uh, and there will be an airdrop to early users of the Inc. network. So, if you've already been on Inc., congratulations. You're probably getting an airdrop. Uh, what was your big takeaway? What was your response? What was your thoughts about? It seems like it's a liquidity mining token, which we've seen before. And so, I'm not, it's unclear what the utility actually is. I mean, zooming out though. So, uh, Coinbase has its layer 2 base, which is absolutely massive. 3, almost 4 billion in total value locked at this point. So Kraken has been out for seven months now. All right. And their TVL is only 7 million. So it's like a massive delta there. So it feels like, uh, Kraken is struggling maybe with adoption of Inc. and, um, I'm not sure that the ink token is going to spur that adoption very much. I mean, this is coming from a place of strength or a strength of weakness. It sounds like it's coming from a place of weakness. It's definitely coming from a place of weakness at this point. Uh, maybe it'll help. I mean, um, token incentives have kind of helped the, the uni chain bootstrap some liquidity. You definitely need that. But this has to be part of a broader strategy that that Kraken needs to deploy to, uh, to increase the, um, you know, the total value locked and and the usage of its chain. Yeah.\n\nAnother announcement this week comes out of EigenLayer. They launched EigenCloud. What is EigenCloud? It is basically EigenLayer as a product is the packaging up in this very accessible, uh, package to developers. And so it's kind of like AWS, but with all of EigenLayer's services built right into it. Uh, and so there's all these different AVS that build little modules on EigenLayer. There's a couple of these components. Everything in EigenCloud is just all of that wrapped up so that developers can go access what EigenLayer sells, which is basically cryptoeconomic security, uh, trust, you know, slashable trust. Uh, and so that that got launched this week. That also came with an announcement of a $70 million token investment, token purchase from A16Z. I listen to your podcast with, uh, with Shirrom, and the whole concept was like, it's a verifiable compute, right? That's it's like AWS for verifiable compute. I still found it hard to wrap my head around. It's hard to imagine verifiable. Yeah, it's hard to imagine. Yeah, I understand why verifiable compute is important for blockchains because it's all about property rights and assets, and you need to know that the supply is what it says it is, and I need to know your address has received my funds, and I need to know how much, like, it's that verifiable, uh, compute in the asset property registry space, like, I understand that now. I can't really imagine use cases beyond that, and maybe that's a limitation that that I have in my thinking. Yeah, I think if you are like a layer bear or bull, it really rests on like how easy it is to imagine that future. And from the bullish side, it's like, well, yeah, it's because this is a net new thing. There's no comparable to really illustrate what EigenLayer, EigenCloud is trying to do. Um, uh, but there are, there are some things that you can kind of like, um, understand, like, say, for example, we wanted to, um, govern over something like a company, a very large company, using an AI LLM, and we needed to have some assurance that the computation of that LLM is done by the right code, and there isn't like a man-in-the-middle attack or or any other sort of just like spoofing to verify that computation. And so, yeah, I think whether you're an EigenLayer player or a bull kind of rests on like how how easy is it to produce the future that EigenLayer wants to produce. And know the bullish side of of things will say, well, this is EigenLayer is a net new thing, there is no comparable, and that's why it's hard to imagine. And, you know, Sreeram gave a few examples, and I could probably list off a bunch of examples, and it would still kind of just like kind of feel the blind men feel the elephant.\n\nUm, but now the thing is, is like now this access to what EigenLayer is selling is as easy as a developer going to AWS and getting like an S1 bucket or something like that. And so, uh, the whereas EigenLayer and the smart contracts and like I compute and all that kind of thing are like kind of these components inside of a car. Well, now we have like the actual product, the actual car. Uh, and so you don't have to actually understand how a carburetor works to drive the car. And we just now have the fully seen, uh, stitched together package. And maybe the Eigen token will will join what Blockworks has just put out, which is the, uh, the Blockworks token transparency framework. So this is a 40-point grading rubric basically on token. It's like token supply, various, you know, stats, who holds what, and it's self-reported. This is almost, I, I shouldn't say what the SEC should be doing in crypto, but there's an element of it. It's kind of ground-up opt-in regulation. Layer 2B for token disclosures, token transparency. That's a great take. That's exactly what it is. And I'm very hopeful that, um, our tokens adopt this type of a standard, and it's great that Blockworks is is propagating this and putting it out there. Yeah. So, there's 18 different criteria with three points that you can score per criteria. So there's like supply schedules, market maker agreements, like if you've signed a deal with a market maker and that deal is made public, then you get a point. Uh, exchange listing agreements. These are all trying to make these things public so that the average investor can go look at what the actual details of the market maker are. And there's also things like, well, is there equity token misalignment, like Uniswap Labs, or is it more like Morpho where there is no equity, there's just a token, things like this. And this was all downstream of, um, some effort from, uh, from Felipe, who we've had on as a guest, and his notion of like lemon markets. This is what I brought up earlier, where like, well, if we have a bunch of markets, if if a bunch of tokens, for example, say, say 50% of the tokens that are potentially investable are kind of shitty because of bad disclosures, bad market maker agreements, well, it really taints the remaining 50 that are potentially good. And so we are trying to just illuminate, give people who are have have put their best foot forward with their token, the a way to, uh, advertise the fact that they have put their best foot forward. And so there's a transparency. Yeah, there's a page on Blockworks where you can go look at the tokens that have gone through this report. I think there's like six of them right now. Morpho is one of them. Stride is one of them. Uh, and so the call to action here is if you have issued a token and you would like to flex your transparency and your good intentions, uh, the Blocks Works transparency report is a place to do that. And then also in theory, like, you can imagine if there was like a hundred tokens that have gone through this process. You can imagine like a Blockworks version of CoinGecko that only lists tokens that have gone through the transparency report. And so it's kind of like a trusted place to get token information. Yeah. And I think that the the good tokens will go do this, right? What do they have to transparency? And so you get a market double form on that, too.\n\nDavid, there were some major Coinbase product announcements here recently. Can you rattle a few of them off? Yeah, the Coinbase One credit card, a metal American Express card launching in the fall of this year. 4% Bitcoin cash back, 4% if you have enough assets on your Coinbase account. Uh, and then some boosted USC yields as well. Also, uh, credit card perpetual futures CFTC compliant per United States traders, that's a first, right? Yes, per onshore, per is a first, is a very big deal. Uh, so they are going after, of course, what is Hyperlid's non-KYC volume, uh, in-app access to dexes, so base dexes are going to be baked into the main application, that's pretty cool business, a small medium enterprise suite for global pay, custodian and trading services, API automation, USC rewards, uh, and then Shopify tie-in. So, merchants can accept USC on base with 1% cash back straight into Shopify. Yeah, that was a big deal, that Shopify thing, right? Shopify is a $142 billion, uh, in volume company, and they've got 5.5 million merchants. And one of the things Coinbase rolled out too was this um, concept with Shopify of a a commerce payments protocol, right? So, so one of the problems with crypto, I guess, when you compare it to a network like Visa is that the payments are immutable. Okay? And this is this is great for a lot of things, but for every day, like you're buying a coffee, you just want a refund, I don't know, you like you um, there's some fraud, there's you want to cancel something, credit cards are way better than just an immutable blockchain. So, Coinbase has provided a service in Coinbase Commerce, um, that's deployed on base to just use a smart contract as escrow. So, think of it as like there's a step in between if I send a merchant some funds, I'm paying with uh, stable coins on base, then the money actually goes in a smart contract escrow. It's like money in the lock box, holds the cash. So, I'm not actually sending it. I'm just signing uh, approval of it, right? And then once the merchant ships\n\n\nTheir product maybe does some fraud detection or something to that effect, um then the funds are released by the escrow. And in the meanwhile, both sides can kind of cancel the transaction. And if the transaction is canceled, nothing leaves my wallet in the first place. So it's basically giving you some of the same capability that credit card networks have had, which is like their big feature is like we're not immutable. You can, you know, we got fraud detection. We can refund if there's uh like something that needs to be refunded, we can cancel. And now you can do that on crypto, too. So, you really see Coinbase leveling up payments and that meshing well with uh with stable coins and and doing that in a programmable way completely on chain.\n\nThere was one announcement that was not in the Coinbase State of CryptoSummit, but was more kind of behind the scenes. This was reported on Routers. Uh, Coinbase seeks SEC approval for onchain stocks. So, they want to create, if it's on chain, I'm assuming it's a token, they want to tokenize stocks or support tokenized stocks. Maybe they don't want to do the tokenization themselves, but they want those things and they're asking the SEC for either a no action letter or a regulatory exemption so that they can do tokenized stocks, you would presume on base. And so just reading between the lines, we have a Coinbase One credit card, perpetual futures, an inapp deck, Shopify tie-in, and then also approval for onchain stocks. Coinbase is going for a financial super app.\n\nAnd then you know who else is also going for all onchain? Yeah. You know what else is going for a financial super app? Robin Hood, which has many of these things. They have stocks. They have the credit card. They're they're going for banking services. The Robin Hood banking announcement. I think banking comes in like Q3 or Q4. And then Robin Hood, I don't know if they're doing this on purpose, but Coinbase had their state of crypto summit and then Robin Hood has their big crypto day at ETCC in a couple weeks, which they've been hyping up in a very big way. Uh, and so yeah, like I I'm seeing these two financial like Clash of the Titans. I mean, Titans in the grand scheme of things, like they're both is 70 billion right now. So like small in the grand scheme of things, but Oh, it's similar market cap. I similar market. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Coinbase had a 15% day last uh trading day. It's it's Junth, so the markets are closed today. So, like Coinbase took a little bit of a lead, but uh I think the Coin verse hood story is going to be a huge story because imagine if you are a Zoomer, even a millennial, you're coming of age, you're you're, you know, finally getting some wealth. What are you going to use? You're going to use Air Trade, you're going to use Fidelity, Charles Schwab. No, you're going to use Coinbase or Robin Hood. You're going to do one of those two things. Yeah. And Coinbase doesn't have stocks, but they want stocks. Robin Hood has just starting the crypto. They want to be more on chain. So, they're kind of converging, aren't they?\n\nI do wonder at ETHC, do you think uh Robin Hood is going to roll out like a a layer 2? I think that I think that would be the easy guess. Yeah, I think that'd be the easy guess. Maybe it's a stable coin, David. Get some circle stable coin premium. You talk about that, too. Yeah. You know, that if it wasn't all good news for Coinbase, let's say, or good press, there was also this thing little thing of the US Army parade. Did you see this? So, this went mainstream. So, of course, um there was on Flag Day, I believe this was Saturday. I was not watching the parade. It was a big parade. It was also Trump's birthday, was it not? In Washington, DC. Uh it was a military parade. I've never seen one of these uh in the U.S. and every military parade before. I know. Yeah. First time for everything, I guess. So, we saw a military parade. What was surprising to me in looking at this was it was sponsored by in part by Coinbase. Now, Coinbase was not the only sponsor, but you saw a lot of images like this, like two big tanks, a whole U.S. Army kind of platform and uh Coinbase branding. And so, the crypto world kind of reacted to this. I saw some good reactions to it, some positive reactions. We'll get to that. Uh some Coinbase employees with positive reactions. Coinbase employees thought this was sick. Yeah. Lots of a lot of negative reactions. What was kind of the negative reactions that you saw? Uh I mean generally that this is completely antithetical to what crypto was supposed to be. Yeah. Uh which I very much resonate with. Like the cool thing about Bitcoin proof of work and Ethereum proof of stake is that we can create a money without a military. And so the notion of a crypto company sponsoring a military is like wait what? Uh many people I think got disillusioned because and I would can resonate with this like I'm here for the counterculture. I'm here for like the the revolution that is antagonistic to nation state powers and nation state overreach and I think the military is the symbol of like nation state overreach and the reason why it can't overreach in the first place. Did you ever read one of my favorite OG articles in the space is um a most peaceful revolution from Nick Carter is a 2019 piece. Do you remember that one? I do. Yeah. Yeah. What was the what was the theme of that? Basically, the TLDDR is that like as nation state fiat just prints and you know people lose their savings in fiat, they're going to use Bitcoin as a savings vehicle and that's going to force governments to be more fiscally responsible because they're it's going to collapse down to the value of the services that governments can provide their citizens. It's going to be the value of their fiat and so that they're going to not be able to support their armies if their army is a sovereign individual type of right. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's just like completely antagonistic to just sponsor the army. I mean, here's the the other side of this though. It's Coinbase is I mean, members of the army on board to crypto. What what are they going to use? Maybe there's some, you know, affiliation here. Maybe there's some uh you know, eyeballs on this that wouldn't be otherwise. This is all part of crypto going mainstream in that and that story. And Victor Buunan says uh he was very excited about it. He said uh hell yeah, this is great. The men and women defending our nation and our way of life deserve our culture and respect and this is just Coinbase, you know, giving respect to uh the military. Well, Victor Buun is the target market for this. As a Coinbase employee who was a huge Trump fan, like of course Victor Buun is going to be like, I love this. This was great. Yeah. Well, there you go. I mean, maybe alienating some crypto OGs, but maybe picking up some eyeballs uh elsewhere.\n\nDavid, um Roman Storm is short on his legal defense. What's the update here? Uh yeah, so the Ethereum Foundation donated $1.25 million matching fund to Roman Storm. First, he needs more money because his court case is coming up very very fast. July 14th in New York. Uh and he is short $750,000. Uh and so the crypto we we've raised a decent amount of money for Roman Storm. Remember, if Roman Storm wins his case, the precedent that open-source software developers can't go to jail is set in. And we can just feel good about the fact that we protected one of our own. And so the big call to action is that the EF is matching your donations. So you donate $1, the EF donates another dollar. Uh and then we need to get Roman Storm $750,000 more dollars so we can win his case. Make sure he doesn't go to jail for writing open-source software. Yeah, big big encourage. It was great to see the EF step up and go do this. And this is the second time they donated. So absolutely huge.\n\nUh well, that's it. We got to wrap it up. David, I I got a question for you in the midst of stable coin summer. It's a question about, you know, crypto in general. I saw this tweet from Jason Choy. He said this, &quot;The irony is not lost on me that crypto went from let's replace the banks to let's provide an alternative to fiat to let's strengthen U.S. dollar dominance. Uh what's your take on this overall with our excitement over stable coins? um you know going mainstream all of these things is crypto starting to lose the plot as to why we're here. I mean aren't we here to go bankless? I don't know if it So Jason he brands this as crypto went from let's replace banks to let's provide an alternative fiat to let's strengthen the United States dollar dominance. I it's not either or to me it's yes and and crypto has always been about replacing banks. It's always been about providing alternative to fiat. And now with the innovation of stable coins, we're like actually we can we can do all of these things. We can it's a it's a yes and. So we're going to strengthen United States dollar dominance for those who want that. We're going to provide an alternative to fiat for those who want that. And for those who want it, they can replace banks. I think it's all of these things together. I agree. I think stable coins are a big step towards that actually. I mean the banks don't like it. We no longer need their their uh savings accounts, right? We can keep the stable coins in our non-custodial wallets. All we need is the yield. And hopefully that comes at some point. So, we are making progress on this. Got to end with this, guys. Of course, you know, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.\n[Music]\n",
