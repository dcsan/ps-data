  "cleanText": "Last year we made 13.7 billion in profits, and this year I think we're going to beat that. Wait, 13.7 billion in profits last year. And this year, I think we can do a little bit better.\n\nWelcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of stable coin finance. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. Guys, there's a Game of Thrones going on right now, a stable coin war of sorts. Tether is the undisputed number one lead of stable coins right now. So, I guess that makes our next guest, Paolo Ardoino, who's its CEO, the stable coin king. And I got to say, for a king, he's pretty unassuming. But he has ambitious plans for the continued distribution and dominance of Tether. And that's going to be important in this new era. An era where we've just seen the Genius Act, the U.S.'s landmark stable coin bill, just passed the Senate. Looks like that's going to go forward to Trump's desk and it will get signed. So my biggest question going to this episode was, assuming the Genius Act passes, what's Paolo planning to do with USDT and Tether? Is he going for compliance, or is he going to launch a new U.S. domestic stable coin and bifurcate things? The answer sounded like it was both, but it was also really nuanced, and you'll have to listen in to find out and get your take. He also said, and this made David and I almost fall out of our chairs, that Tether made almost 14 billion in profits last year. Okay, that's profits. I did some math after this episode was recorded. And if you take the price to earnings ratio of Circle right now, which is trading at pretty heavy valuations, and you multiply that by the earnings of Tether, around 14 billion, you turn Tether into a $13.7 trillion company. That'd be the largest company right now that exists ahead of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and all of the rest. I'm not sure if Tether is worth that much, but it's certainly gargantuan in scale. He also broke the news that Tether is launching a new product this year. So, let's get right into the episode with Paolo, but before we do, I want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.\n\nIn the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance, the protocol revolutionizing stable coins, DeFi, and Rolex.

He's at the helm of Tether, the $150 billion stable coin, the thing that really brought stable coins into existence in the first place. Last time we talked, uh, this was pre-stable coin uh, bills, pre- Genius Act, all of the stuff that's going on inside of Capitol Hill. So, there's a bunch to get updated on. Uh, now with the U.S. on the brink of passing, just a massive stable coin bill that just got voted on uh, and passed in the Senate, it goes back to the House, there are a lot of things to discuss. Paolo, welcome back to Banklist.\n\nThank you for having me, guys. I just want to get your first reaction to the passing of the uh the Genius Act. It still has some work left to do. It has to go back to the House. But people are more than cautiously optimistic. I would say Donald Trump sent out that tweet saying, &quot;Guys, I just want to approve this thing. House, just get it done. Let's get this done.&quot; What was your first reaction to the Genius Act passing in the Senate?\n\nFor us is um as you know, Tether is the creator of the stable coin industry in 2014. Um we are very honored that uh um the most powerful country in the world, the most uh powerful government in the world is is is taking good care of a technology or legislating on a technology that we created 11 years ago. So that is very exciting. I think that Genius Act is a step in the right direction. It creates a framework well, of course as you said, it still needs to be passed by the house, but seems that there seems there is a good momentum. So it creates a strong framework for uh domestic stable coins as well as foreign stable coins like USDT that um could find um in their ability to meet um the requirements through uh comparable regimes. Um so we think that Tether USDT is um um is in the right spot uh to to comply as a foreign issuer and also as I announced I think couple months ago now, we are looking at creating a grassroots domestic stable coin in the United States. So the Genius Act uh creates a very, very high bar for everyone. That's the thing that I think I like the most and is very fair in a sense that it creates a very high bar when it comes to AML and compliance. Um yesterday there was a huge news of Tether collaborating with um the Department of Justice. Um Tether was able with its own means almost one year and a half ago at this point to identify uh through its uh monitoring technology. We built I think the most amazing technology for monitoring uh our secondary markets in the blockchain ecosystem when it comes to stable coins and specific USDT. We were able to identify a big blockchain scheme and um when we did that, we we immediately notified the um the uh law enforcement i.e. the DOJ, and they agreed with our analysis. We we we proceed to the freezing and now basically the DOJ is in the process of receiving this money and um and working on restitution. So these are great examples of what Tether does. We collaborated with more than 250 law enforcement agencies across more than 55 different countries. There is no financial institution that has these numbers. So we are happy to prove more and more and raise the keep raising the bar, and when I see that um those type of requirements in the Genius Act, I'm I'm very content because I think that we are doing that better than anyone else. The requirements of strong financials are also very good. We no one wants to have another teruna. Tether has more than $125 billion as in treasuries. Um u it's growing um you know over the last all the data statistications we have been growing our monetary base in U.S. treasuries. So we are going in the right direction. Um so we we think that um um you know that's having a requirement for for for a strong balance sheet is very important. Tether has in this moment as a group equity has around $176 billion um in front of 155 billion in market cap of the stable coin and precisely we keep just on top of the single reserves of of the stable coin of the 100% of of reserves of the USDT stable coin, we keep around $6 billion in excess right compared to the standard banking system that usually goes in fractional reserve um up to 90%. So they keep only 10% of liquid assets. Tether has like 10 something% like 105% of of liquid assets as reserves of of the stable coin. On top of that, we have another $15 billion as a group equity to add. Um so it is very unprecedented and uh you know so we are basically in general, we are very excited, of course, you know, we we need to see the final form also to proceed with our domestic with our intention of the domestic stable coin, but um you know, I just I just want to upload the the efforts that have been done by by Senator Agati Lamis and all the others David S. Bohines um um yeah and the rest.\n\nAssuming the Genius Act gets passed as it stands today, what opened what doors open for for Tether downstream of that? Like what happens next? What's your guys' strategy post Genius Act getting approved? And also is there anything in the Genius Act or not in the Genius Act uh that you would have liked to have seen? Like what what's your biggest um what would be your biggest amendment to the Genius Act if if any?\n\nSo um I think that the Genius Act would provide the clarity that um everyone needed in order to operate uh more safely. So first of all, we come from um the last four years, not as Tether, but as an industry, we come from the last four years where was clear this thing called operation chop point 2.0 where the OC where the you know um the administration and they were against crypto. So banking was crypto banking was uh not very much possible, and when they tried like remember 2023 when you know our major competitor almost died because of Silicon Valley bank and silvergate signature all targeted by um you know the u the operation choke point 2.0, you know, but nevertheless almost killed our competitor. So that's not very good. Now, so I think that the new administration is creating a framework that ensures that there is support from the um from the institution, the administration, from the federal authorities for crypto banking, and so that will improve um the safety of the industry as a whole. So we are very excited about that. The Genius Act is also giving the the opportunity to other players to step in, right? I mean to me when I see all the consortium of banks, JP Morgan or or Amazon and um uh Walmart and others are declaring that they want to create the stable coins. Everyone their sisters now want to create a stable coin. That's great. I mean uh the more the merrier, like welcome player 2 as I said on X, because I think that the the beauty of it and um is that unfortunately so unfortunately all these competitors will focus on the U.S. markets that you know the way I describe it is like there is such an opportunity globally that the opportunity is insane. There are 3 billion people in the world that are unbanked and Tether covers 450 million users now, but there all the rest are like you know they there is so much to do, and so the opportunity is big, but what I feel is like most of the competitors will compete keep competing in the U.S. and Europe uh because they are the lowhanging fruits, and in a way in a certain way when it comes to profitability is great for terror, but also is not great for the industry itself or is not great for the end users because technical you would have more competitors so that you can bring the efficiency at higher level and also the cost at the lower level. I do think Tether has done a fantastic job outside of the U.S. in particular to get, you know, recruit new stable coin users and the usage metrics certainly show that.\n\nPaolo, I I want to make sure we get details on kind of your plan post uh Genius Act because there are multiple paths now it seems that that Tether could take and let's just assume the Genius Act passes. In fact, I was looking at Poly Market this morning. We got a 80% probability on uh Poly Market, okay, that the Genius Act passes. So that's the best it's ever been. I was thinking about last time we had this conversation with you. It was February 2024 and that was just a completely different world with respect to U.S. and its relationship to crypto, not to mention stable coins. We had Operation Chokepoint. Anyway, okay, let's talk about the path forward for Tether itself, USDT. We talked to uh Senator Bill Hagerty yesterday who's a co-author of the bill and we asked him specifically about Tether and this is what he said. If an offshore issuer like Tether wants U.S. market access, our bill lets Treasury run a comparability test and if their home rules match ours, they can keep operating. Otherwise, they'll need a U.S. subsidiary that meets the same reserve and disclosure standards as everybody else. He further said, Tether can start complying tomorrow. So, can you give us the details on kind of what's your plan? So, you have USDT, which is currently not compliant. It seems like there could be a path to get USDT compliant. In order to meet that path, you have to go through some additional auditing rigor. You have to uh refine your treasury. Uh maybe, you know, be more domestic, be more onshore. I'm not\n\n\nSure, everything that goes into that.\nBut there is a path there, and you could acquire an OC license for that.\nThere's also the path that I think you have announced, which is to create a domestic Tether stable coin.\nIt's a separate type of asset that is really focused on the U.S., and then I guess you would preserve USDT.\nThis seems to fracture liquidity though.\nAnyway, give us a sense of what your plan is in some more detail here.\nRight.\nSo our interest is, and I think that even with USDT, actually with USDT, we plan to follow that pathway to meet the requirements.\nOkay.\nI think that if you have a company that last year, we made 13.7 billion in profits, and this year I think we're going to beat that.\nWait, 13.7 billion in profits last year, and this year I think we can do a little bit better.\nLook, only with only having $155 billion.\nYou know, the Fed didn't cut the rates.\nWe have been saying that for a long time, and you know, kind of was true.\nSo the rates are still around 5%.\nSo you do the math, it's, you know, give or take 7.5 billion just because of that, and then all the rest, we are doing all the other investments, all like, um, you know, we have been investing gold and Bitcoin, all that, right?\nSo it's, well, this year I think we are going to do much better, you know, still the year is long, but you know, do you why people do think that we don't have the ability to meet with the requirements?\nBecause not saying that you said that, but the I saw that on X, right?\nSo people think that we are going to let it go.\nWe are going to not continue to support the best businesses in the world.\nYou know, why is that?\nI mean, again, we have the profitability to, and by the way, we are acquiring more treasuries than anyone else, apart maybe a couple of countries, but, um, you know, that the pathway is there.\nLike last year, we were the fifth largest purchaser of U.S. treasuries.\nOkay, just people don't appreciate the stat.\nFifth largest purchaser of U.S. treasuries, and that's taking into account all the countries that are purchasing U.S. treasuries as well.\nSo number five, ranked with like entire countries.\nYeah.\nAnd we are in total overall the 18th largest country.\nWe are not a country, but holding U.S. treasuries.\nSo that's the power of stable coins, and I think that Bessent understood that very well.\nUm, uh, the president understood very well.\nIt's is one of the best aids to the U.S. economy.\nAnd look, think about it.\nThe one thing that is very powerful about USDT compared to everyone else is that USDT focuses outside the United States, but also means that it's people outside the United States are purchasing USDT, and with that money we purchase U.S. treasuries.\nMhm.\nSo in a way is people is we are decentralizing the ownership of the U.S. debt.\nThat can press a button and sell them all together.\nIt's 400 million different brains that will not act all together, and that is great service first, but also I think that is much better for the U.S. to have the depth of the U.S. not owned by U.S. people, otherwise I think that that is kind of the recipe for disaster.\nSo you want people outside the U.S. owning the U.S. debt, and so that is also what data is making.\nSo we have, as I said, as I think Senator Hagerty is right, right there is a pathway, um, there is a process, right?\nSo there is a pathway, you have there is a comparable regime reciprocity, it will take a bit of time because, you know, countries have to create these regimes, and what I think will the GENIUS Act do is exactly this, will open the path for every single other country in the world to adopt the GENIUS Act almost exactly like that, so that there are the U.S. is the greatest country in the world, so everyone will copy that, because if you think about it, apart UAE, I mean, Europe has a very, very bad regime with like 60% of reserves that has to be kept in an insure cash deposits, that's what happened to our competitor with the Silicon Valley Bank, so you don't want Europe has a bad regime, but everyone else like UAE has a very similar regime to the GENIUS Act, and you know, Singapore is deep in their toes in the water.\nBut when the U.S. will pass this, I can guarantee you that every other country will follow, and that will open a path for for reciprocity.\nOkay.\nSo, but on USDT, then it sounds like you're saying your primary plan is to just get USDT compliant with the GENIUS Act, and so, you know, but but if that's the case, then why why launch a domestic on like on U.S. shore asset as well?\nWhy have two?\nIs that just for redundancy?\nIs that like a backup plan?\nNo, it's it's a great question, but um, you know, the I think that serve two completely different use cases.\nThe the way I see it, and maybe might be controversial, but I think the U.S. will be a market where stable the current stable coin business model will not work.\nSo of course there is a lot of frenzy now in the U.S. because the Circle IPO, but no one will make money in the U.S.\nIt will be a race to the bottom on making the money on on stable coins in the U.S.\nSure.\nLook at when exchanges, crypto exchanges starting in 201, well 201 around 2010, right?\nAnd Bitfinex was at in 2012 was making 20 basis points in in fees every trade, now you get one basis point is a taker fee compared to 20 like 10 years ago or 12 years ago.\nAnd um, you know, it's basically a race to the bottom when you have look at the U.S.\nU.S. is the market in the world where there is the highest efficiency as money rails.\nSo you could argue that U.S. has 90% efficiency to of financial rails.\nSo if you add a stable coin in the U.S., you will bring the efficiency from 90% to 95%.\nSo the premium that people will pay pay for that is very little.\nIf you are in another part of the world, you are like Nigeria, the efficiency of financial rates is like 20%, if you add a stable coin, you get to 50%.\nSo you have an increase of 30% of efficiency.\nSo that is why, you know, people in emerging markets are happy if they leave to us the the the interest simply because the intraday volatility of the national cars is higher than 4% that you can give them on a yearly basis.\nSo to me it's important to have a distinction between, you know, two products, two use cases basically, to me in the U.S. stable coins will become at some point tokenized money market funds, like I was seeing this JPMD.\nIt will be be kind of like that, and like every other stable coins will be coming like that, where basically the entire yield will be shared back, and so to us then in order the stable coin in the U.S. that we want to create has to compete on a different level, has to compete in programmatability, has compete in services, has compete not with, um, does not cannot compete with the same business model that we have for USDT, that is a stable coin that is made for the foreign world, I see.\nSo you're still thinking two products potentially because they will serve two different use cases, but you're also saying that you you do intend to get USDT compliant under the GENIUS Act as well.\nThat is our intention.\nYes.\nMhm.\nThere's a a growing conversation about domestic stable coin issuers.\nThere's been a bunch of rumors about things like Amazon, Walmart, even like Meta, Twitter launching stable coins.\nAnd we also know that like JP Morgan, City, Wells Fargo are also they're exploring this consortium stable coin.\nKind of feels like COPE to me, but that's just my opinion.\nUh there's going to be a lot of domestic competition coming out.\nSo if large U.S. banks can mint deposit, tokenized deposits that settle against Fed balances, what moat would you say Tether still has in 5 years after this becomes pretty common place domestically?\nSo there's still a lot of potential with our distribution partners and our own distribution networks, right?\nSo again, the the the thing is that banks usually would sell their stable coin to their own um customers.\nSo I don't see a bank breaking, you know, banking employees breaking their back in the streets, you know, doing educational stable coins and going to basically the normal people or the people in the lower west tier tier of richness.\nThat always was our approach, right?\nSo we never went to when we open a new country, we don't go to, you know, the local biggest bank like our competitors.\nWe go we do education in the streets.\nWe work in the streets.\nWe explain how to, we do education in schools.\nWe we we go doortodoor basically, we find the the partners locally that are aligned with exactly this vision of grassroots adoption from the bottom up, and so that is also possible.\nI mean, although the U.S. uh has great financial rails, still, you know, the I was reading that um, you know, the people struggle even to keep bank accounts open.\nSo more and more in the U.S. you will have a tier of population that will benefit from a product that has uh our more like more direct approach to people rather than, you know, sitting on an ivory tower and, you know, just thinking that the world um is the same of 20 years ago.\nNow I want to bring up the conversation of the Circle price post IPO, launched at $31, now trading at $200.\nI saw um some napkin math on Twitter that if Tether was given uh a commensorate valuation, Tether would be valued at something like $3 trillion or something like that.\nWhat what's your what's your reaction to the the price action of the of the Circle post IPO?\nIt's great.\nI mean, so we don't we don't want to go public first of all because I mean, companies that want to go public do it for two reasons, either they need to have access to capital, but our profitability is so high that we don't need that, and second, we would need, and by the way, we are invest with our profitability, we invested I think in the last two years more than $5 billion in the United States, that is something that is very little mentioned, but it's very important, it's like so we are giving back also to to the country that um that uh you know, has created this great currency like the U.S. dollar.\nSo, but you know, you you go public because you want to have access to cheap capital or because, you know, the shareholders wants to have an exit, and we don't need either, right?\nSo we have great profitability, and at the same time, we don't need an exit, we need I want to stay in this company forever, I, you know, we are we are having fun, we are we are enjoying, we we think that uh it's almost like we just started this company because there is so much to build, so so much to prove, so much many more ideas under you same same concept of USD, but different verticals, different sectors, like in terms of disruption, right?\nSo disruption for the benefit of of the people and not not the um a few corporates, and so the but when I see that multiplier, I was like really thinking, well, that's a nice uh that's a nice multiplier, because uh you know, some um at some point you have to, you know, price what you're doing, and if that is comparative, that is is that he's a great prize.\nI mean, um, we'll see what how you know, how long it will last, but uh for us couldn't be better.\nGoing back to this notion that Tether is sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with countries when it comes to owning U.S. treasuries, and then this implied, you know, not really fair, but implied valuation of multiple trillions of dollars.\nDoes it stress you out the magnitude of what you're building and what you're doing?\nLike I, if I was managing enough treasuries to, you know, be considered a country in terms of just like geopolitical weight, that feels like a lot of pressure.\nDo you ever like, do you stress out about this?\nDo you worry about this?\nLook, it also ties into, you know, sometime people, um, you know, there there is this old fod of oh, terror, you know, even in the respect of what I saw on Twitter in last recent days was like it's almost like people still think is um, you know, is uh 2014, people think, oh, um, maybe Tether, you know, Tedar wants to hide and all that.\nWe keep our money in counterfeit, that is a prime U.S. institution.\nWe keep 120 plus billion dollars in counterfeit Gerald in U.S. treasuries.\nSo we are not hiding ourselves.\nWe keep our money in the United States.\nThat's going back to the GENIUS Act, right?\nSo it's not like, oh, Tedar wants does not want to comply or all that.\nI mean, we keep already our money in the U.S., and so the U.S. has has basically control over our money because it sits in one of the most regulated entities in the world, that is primary dealer, that has a direct connection to the Fed and all that.\nSo the reason why we are we keep our money in counterfeit jail is because is is because I can sleep well at night because, you know, they they have um a direct connection to the Fed.\nWe have a great line with overnight reverse repos and repos.\nSo it's um it allows us to be uh comfortable if we get um uh you know, tens of billions in redemptions, we can meet them without problems, and that that's I think the beauty of the setup, and I think that this administration and the GENIUS Act will help in making this industry even more solid.\nPaolo, I think investors right now are really trying to figure out what's the value of this whole stable coin thing, right?\nSo like you could see Wall Street, you know, they're the gears are are grinding as they try to value um Circle, and I think everyone is just like stable coins have just come on the radar for a lot of investors, and this has been silent in the background just growing and growing and growing every year, and I think Tether is finally getting a spotlight.\nI mean, Scott Bessant, the secretary of the Treasury, just it seems to have come on his radar that this is a big net buyer of of bonds.\nAnyway, when it comes to valuation of stable coins in general, right, we're talking about a $45 billion market cap for Circle, David just read out the numbers, that's on like 150 million or so in annualized net income, in annualized profit.\nYou just said you were generating 13 billion.\nOkay.\nAnd that was last year, and you said you expect this year to be bigger than that.\nAnd so I'm just like calculating the numbers.\nDavid David said 3 trillion, which is uh interesting.\nThat would that would place Tether in the top five of all companies.\nI mean, just below what uh Nvidia Nvidia and and maybe Apple and Microsoft kind of in that camp.\nBut it's not inconceivable based on the cash that you're you're throwing out.\nAnd then there's also this vast very strong treasury as well.\nAnyway, I I know it's a it's an interesting question for you to ponder, but now you have public market comps of a pure play stable coin company and it's trading god knows how much.\nI don't know, 200x profits, something like this PE ratio.\nSo, what like what do you think Tether is actually worth today?\nTo me, a lot.\nSo, so that is I should say so.\nYes, to me a lot.\nBut because it's it's this is my baby, right?\nSo is uh to me is a is\n\n\nWorth a lot.\nBut uh, look, I, I don't know how sustainable.\nI mean, I don't know how many companies sustain 200x, and again, if they can continue to sustain 200x is great, is great for, for, for us.\nI mean, as, as comps, as you said, we are, we are not seeking for, for, you know, we are not actively seeking for investments.\nUm, so, um, we don't need to raise money, that's the problem.\nSo it's, we'll see.\nI mean, but uh, it, uh, it's, it's just nice, is it's nice to see, right?\nIt's nice to see because in the end, it's a an industry that we feel we created with in 2014.\nAnd so we are just proud, like we, it's every day I wake up and pinch myself, you know, looking at these numbers, like I come from a town with 600 people and living there and with cows and and and a chicken rowing, and so like these numbers are out of this world, and I think it's, you know, just the entire, this is actually the achievement of an entire industry, including the crypto industry, you know, we, we went so far, we improve, so we have, we had ups and downs, but there are so many people that were stubborn and kept going even in the difficulties and built all this.\nSo, you know, it's, it's a congratulations to everyone, I would say.\nSo, let's talk a bit more about winning kind of the, the next phase of stablecoins, right?\nBecause right now, I think it's safe to say Tether's won phase one, and that has been well, stablecoins have been primarily cryptonative.\nUh, GENIUS Act means we're entering a phase two.\nDavid mentioned a whole bunch of uh, U.S. companies that were talking about getting into the stablecoin game.\nAll of the banks, these are your new competitors, right?\nSo, so welcome to that.\nNow, the banks are going to have a play at this.\nSo, will the tech companies as well, something like Meta?\nI read an interesting post uh, from Arthur Hayes.\nIt was just on stablecoins.\nAnd he makes the point that stable, the stablecoin game is all about distribution, right?\nAnd Tether came out first, came out early, really pioneered the sector, had all of the cryptonnative distribution, fantastic.\nUm, I think saturation and offshore, you know, Tron is a fantastic distribution networks.\nIt, it seems like for Tether, 80 billion Tether on Tron alone and a lot of usage and payments there.\nAnyway, the next phase of this whole stablecoin game, you're going to be faced with big tech.\nYou're going to be faced with companies like Meta because Meta have over 3 billion users like worldwide.\nUh, and so it's a new chapter.\nHow do you win the next chapter with respect to distribution of the Tether stablecoin?\nWell, one, one thing is interesting.\nMaybe, you know, again, the GENIUS Act is not, maybe, you know, we, we need to wait, but um, seems like um, companies like Meta might have a hard time to launch a stablecoin, um, given, if I'm not wrong, given the GENIUS Act, right?\nSo there is kind of sort of a prohibition if you are not primarily involved in in in finance, there is kind of a sort of prohibition, if you know, that that is at least my take from, from the language that I saw.\nSo that is going to be interesting how it will play out.\nSo I think that big companies will need to to partner with existing stablecoins providers or with baby banks in order to support, you know, someone else's stablecoin and get a rev share for sure, but that will create a very interesting dynamic because I, again, it feels like Meta or or similar, you know, will not be able to launch stablecoin, again, I could be wrong given the language, but um, I, I think I, I got it right.\nAnd so, but when it comes to distribution, people, you know, you, you know, Tether has more than 100 companies in its port portfolio, investments done with Tether, investments, not as as the reserves, and so, um, that is where part of the profitability uh, goes and went.\nSo that gives us enormous distribution channel.\nThink about um, think about the U.S. domestic stablecoin, Rumble will launch a Rumble wallet and has 70 million users, it's not bad to start with, you know, it's good to bootstrap, you know, I think that is pretty much how, how many active user, much more active users than probably the the biggest exchange in the U.S.\nSo it's a, is a great bootstrap, and then there are other opportunities that that that we invested in, like where that could uh, that actually built and helped Tether to build in the last 11 years the biggest distribution network for the U.S. dollar in the history of humanity.\nSo we have millions of physical touch points around the world.\nSo the reason why Tether is the lead stablecoin and has s such high metrics, like 450 million users, we grow by 30 million new wallets per quarter, and uh, we, we publish that data, we have this website called usdt.net network, the where we publish the updated data, 37% of our users are savings accounts, uh, for example.\nSo we have, we collect all these statistics, the reason is because we are actually growing and we have been building this distribution network that that uh, is unprecedented, is granular, is with boots on the ground or reach really the the smallest village in Philippines or, you know, we, we, we invested from remittances companies to bodegas in central South America to building kiosks in Africa.\nSo, you know, just in Africa, you know, we build, we are building, we did this pilot with 500 kiosks with solar panels on top and rechargeable batteries inside.\nIn Africa, uh, 400 million people don't have, 600 million people actually don't have access to electricity, and so we build these kiosks with solar panels on top and batteries inside.\nWe sell subs, subscriptions for 3 USDT per month to to to the people in these villages, and we have around 500,000 users already, and uh, 10 million battery swaps, and by 20 and 2026, we're going to have 10,000 kiosks, and end of 2030, we're going to have 100,000 kiosks.\nSo we are going to touch around 30 million households by 2030.\nThat means that 120 million people on average in Africa.\nFirst of all, is a change that you can see from space because you light up a continent, and also, you know, you have 120 million people that are going to rely on a day-to-day basis on the U.S. dollar in the form of US.\nThat's how you bring the U.S. dollar, German money farther, and you bring it to the emerging markets.\nThat's what we, you know, what boiled in in in our pot for the last many years.\nAnd that is one of the least understood things about Tether.\nI, I was going to say, I just like as going over these stats that you were talking about, and this is all on usdt.network, right?\nUm, 440 million total estimated users of Tether.\nI, I feel like the entire U.S. has been sleeping on this use case.\nI mean, there's been so much talk of crypto not having a killer app.\nUh, it being just kind of, you know, speculative casino, just, you know, Bitcoin, that kind of thing.\nAnd we have 440 million users using the U.S. dollar.\nHow did this first phase of distribution happen?\nWas it all?\nCan you explain these numbers to people who are seeing them for the first time?\nActually, it's funny because if you can scroll down a little bit to the chart of the growth, um, um, of the market cap here, right?\nLook at 2020 and what happened?\nDo, do you know what happened 2020?\nDo you remember?\nOh, yeah.\nWe had a little uh, global pandemic.\nYou talking about that one?\nYeah.\nSo, and you know, we, for people who can't see, we are at 4.7 billion Tether in 2020.\nYes.\nSo, um, and this is in retrospect, right?\nBecause we didn't have a marketing team until 2022.\nSo, and look at the growth up to 2022.\nSo the reason why that happened is we, we understood recently, we went back and we, we, we did a lot, we, we ask a lot of questions to ourselves, and so think about the emerging markets in developing countries.\nThey have two common denominators, you know, well, three, they are in general poor, they have this high, you know, high inflation, higher than, of course, the wealthier countries, but they have two other things, they have um, um, good penetration of smartphones, and so they're still very digital, and they have more children, so they more youth, younger population, from 2017 to 2020, this youth is the one that learned about crypto before anyone.\nAnd in the meanwhile, when the h, when in 2020, when the pandemic happened, something changed.\nThe parents of these kids were going to in the streets with the pandemic.\nThe pandemic accelerated the uh, loss of jobs everywhere, but especially in emerging markets, like in the U.S. and Europe was bad, but in emerging markets, the pandemic accelerated the loss of jobs, increased inflation, and it did all that, right?\nBut, and so what people did more and more during the pandemic with the fear was going out in the streets and buy cash dollars, because if you live in Argentina with the at the beginning of the pandemic, the Argentina pesos started to tank.\nAnd then you get scared.\nYou want to, you lo, you are risking to lose your job because of the pandemic.\nYou cannot go to work.\nYou go out in the streets in the black market.\nYou buy cash dollars.\nBut the kids in 2020 look at their parents going out knowing that there was the pandemic.\nParents putting themselves even more at risk going the black market with the pandemic.\nAnd the kids were like, &quot;Dad, why are you going out to buy dollars?\nI have dollars in this app.\nThat's how it all happened.\nThat's crazy.\nIt's very humbling, but it's how it happened, and the charts prove it.\nWhat apps are they using for this?\nIs this you just kind of like crypto exchange type apps?\nAre these like, you know, everything?\nMetaMask wallets?\nAre these just wallets that are connected to Ethereum and Tron?\nMostly local exchanges, uh, you know, small, I mean, a variety, like an infinite number of wallets.\nLike we never said, oh, use this wallet, use that wallet.\nLike it's truly when people are in need, that's the the issue with Europe and the U.S. in a certain way, right?\nSo we still live in a situation that is better than anyone else for most of the people, because we, we have our problems, but you know, again, that is far better than everything is relative, and and we are still be far better, our economy does far better than anyone else, that's the reality, and so when you are in need, when your family is at risk, when you work from January to December mber for 12 months, and at the end of the year, you're poorer compared to the beginning of the year because your value, your currency devaluated so fast, you will find any possible way to save your family and to protect your family, and that is exactly what happened here, people find, found ways to go out and or sorry, to find ways to hold dollars and to have access dollars through local exchanges, through Binance, to you name it, but they fund every possible way through the kids, because again, the kids were playing with crypto because they're young kids.\nThey, they try everything.\nThey know everything.\nThey're small actors and growing, right?\nSo they, and then word of mouth, because one parent goes to the other parents and says, &quot;Well, you know, we, you know, I, I did this.\nI, I, I'm testing this.\nI'm buying dollars on this app, and and so that's how it went.&quot;\nSo how much do you think Tether market cap is tied to the total market cap of all of crypto?\nI mean, it there seems like to be some correlation there, right?\nSay, you know, got a massive acceleration up to 2022, and then we had kind of a a dip.\nUh, it didn't go all the way back down, but slightly, and then more, more acceleration.\nIs it tied to crypto market cap at all?\nI honestly, I, I mean, I think that right now only, less than, I mean, we are running some statistic around that, right?\nBut I think that from what we see around, less than 40% to be conservative, less than 40% of our market cap is due to crypto.\nSo there is actually grassroots usage of uh, of USD in emerging markets.\nI think that the next leg of growth of USD market cap is commodity trading, like every single, the biggest commodity traders are pinging us, calling us, because for them, USDT is the best thing after sliced bread, because when you have, you do, you need to do, you need to do international trades and you are relying on on the slowness of banks, the efficiency of capital is very bad with for, for commodity traders, and now they're looking at USDT as a solution to make their portfolio infinitely more efficient, because if you're a commodity trader, usually the commodities are bought from the emerging markets.\nSo if you are a commodity trader for use and USDT uh, or a pigeon or whatever is accepted by the the seller is great, but you just want to make sure that the seller will receive the money as soon as possible so that you can move on to the next deal.\nSo for them, for the commodity traders, USD is great, for the seller, the seller is in an emerging market.\nSo we'll get USDT and we'll find a user base for USDT directly in the market.\nSo they can pay salaries in USDT.\nThey can do everything USDT.\nAnd so look at Bolivia.\nI posted a tweet about Bolivia um, one week ago or so.\nYou have in Santa Cruz and and other villages in the cities in Bolivia.\nLike in the shops, there are like the the price tags are in USDT.\nWe did, we, we never went there.\nWe never been there.\nWe never had a person in Bolivia.\nAll happened organically.\nImagine if your checking account and

There's a lot of different investments going on out of the Tether portfolio. And then now there are investments that make sense that I definitely want to talk about things like Plasma and Stable, these like LAYER 1 chains that are specific for Tether. But then there's also just a bunch of more kind of like eclectic investments that you guys make. There's acquisition offers for basically like mobile networks, telecom networks, on-ramps, and just other infrastructure companies. There are energy startups in the Tether portfolio. There's like these media tech companies like for that that help creators make content out there and you guys I believe you guys also own an Italian football team as well. So there's a bunch of like interesting investments coming out of Tether Ventures. Maybe can I just talk about that strategy going on there?\n\nYes. I mean the portfolio is big, right? So you have to create different verticals. So as any good portfolio, you know that is again outside the reserves and for any good portfolio you have a part that is very conservative and very stable. So we buy some Bitcoin and gold with that, but also we started recently to buy land and agricultural companies. So this company called Adiagro that is listed on the U.S. market. They are the biggest or one of the biggest land owners in South America between Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay and they are producing also dairies and well biol, but also dairies, rice, and cattle stuff. Why that, right? So first of all, land is a very scarce and safe asset and historically slowly appreciates, right? The part of your portfolio you want in something like that, in something that humanity will always need like land and agriculture. But on top of that, you have to think about the fact that you know this agriculture is commodity commodity trading could be you know what I said about commodity trading and USDT can be applied also to agricultural commodities and so USDT and stable coins in general will expedite also agricultural companies to have better you know efficiency when it comes to access to capital, but also when it comes to just payments for the goods that they produce. So that is a very interesting combination between the two things. Then we have another silo that is new technologies. Artificial intelligence is one. We are building our own peer-to-peer AI platform called CUAC. It's going to be insane and very, very cool. Really unstoppable AI. I think that with the way I like to describe is like the comparison between when you had the when I was in the elementary school you had like the the the teachers were forcing you to do like calculations by mind, right? So the sum, the divisions, and all that, then kazu calculator started and I don't know now, but you know most of the people that I meet they might not be able to do simple math in mind and so and imagine like that is so we lost our ability, many people lost their ability to do in mind calculations. So imagine if and because you have a replacement for that, imagine if you have the same thing for for for intelligence, right? So you think less because you have an aid now, now it's fine because that is where the future will go, but what you could say about not your keys, not your coins, you could say also for not your AI, not your intelligence in a sense that you don't own if you give all your data to a big corporation that also own your intelligence, that is not becoming more intelligence, it's becoming dumb and making more money and become to the other company and so that also that company will become more intelligent. So our ability and given our balance sheet and the the fact that we are a very unique company that has the technology capabilities, but also the capital to build whatever they want. We are trying going to trying to build technology and AI platform that will bring AI closer to the people. So the SI platform will run on every single device, can adapt to the GPU of the device, working from from a $30 smartphone to like a flagship phone to any laptop to any server, right? We just automatically decide which model to use, which number weights to use and all that. So we've been invested in biotech. There's this company called Black Narotch, doesn't do anything, any does not have anything to do with Black. We're going to change the name and you know the you know the idea is like to me brain computer interfaces are very interesting because are the the ultimate hedge against the robots killing all of us. So I think that humans will need to become more intelligent and have but in order to become intelligent they they need to have a mathematical co-processor in their brain that will not share all their thoughts with open AI, right? So the idea of combining local intelligence plus brain computer interface is very exciting to me. I'm a big sci-fi nerd.\n\nUm, you mentioned football club, well yesterday Juventus won 520 in the in their first match of the U.S. for championship for for clubs. So great start. Um, that so you know that is a Italian football club. Myself and John Carlo have been football fans. I mean the investment compared to our portfolio is not that big. So but we are football fans of more for fun. Just a little bit of fun. Yes. But if you think about it, it could be an insane distribution channel. Juventus fans are everywhere and and scatter all over the world. So actually we could bring more football fans to Juventus through our network plus you know Juventus network could be beneficial to that longer term.\n\nWhen you're looking at a potential investment is distribution the first thing that you kind of evaluate is like every every investment that you make, you distribution is kind of the top of the list of things that you care about.\n\nYeah, exactly that. I mean even with AI, the AI platform, I think that I think that AI, we are going to have one trillion AI agency in the next 15 years and every AI agent should have an studio wallet. I doubt that you know any agent will have an account at the fed or or in JP Morgan, right? So so we are building this SDK called WDKs wallet development kit will be fully open source and will allow like everyone to build full non-custodial wallets, we don't have any keys, you can create any model you want, will support all different blockchains and the idea is that paired with our AI platform, I want basically I see a user experience where I have my smart fridge shows shows me a QR code, I the the QR code is linked to like an encusto wallet. Um, I give like $50 to my fridge and the fridge will just do groceries for me. Right? So but I I don't want basically my fridge money to be in PayPal, right? So that I don't think is is the right experience. is also because if you have billions of equipments and even I see a future in 20 years where light bulbs should have a very, very tiny AI that will understand what is the best level of of electricity to use and the best lighting for that specific moment in time in ambient and we're going to go there maybe in not in 20 years, maybe in 30 years and 40 years, so that's the reason why we are doing local AI. I don't think that every single light bulb can be connected to chacht, we'll crash the service of chacht, the latency will insane and all that. So, local AI is going to be very important. Plus, giving a wallet to Local AI is going to be very important. And if you have a stable coin to add to that wallet, it's going to be great.\n\nThere's a couple of investments that Tether has made that has hit the zeitgeist on the crypto side of things. Plasma, stable, there's a bunch of LAYER 1s that are trying to become just Tether based LAYER 1s. Notably, fees on Tron have like really kept up recently. I think the average fee on Tron is something like four four or five dollars, which as a payments blockchain is just not not gonna work. And so Plasma stable like I mentioned a few others are all trying to be a payments blockchain that's Tether specific and Tether has invested in all these. Are are any of these supposed to be the Tether chain or how do you think about this like investment into a handful of Tether specific high throughput blockchains?\n\nThere is not at our chain and I don't think there will be ever a chain, but there are good opportunities and good good teams that can build great ecosystems so I foresee you you mentioned like higher fees in in certain chains and you know that varies over time like sometimes the chain has high fees, sometimes low fees. I foresee a future and I never see this user experience and I I trying to I want to craft it in in some of the wallets that I might launch wallet by the end of the year. We'll see. But um well actually never said it before. So um that could be breaking might launch a wallet on a you know particular crypto NETWORK or will it support no? It will support every NETWORK. But one thing that excites me is that we we want to launch it with WDK, right? So everyone can actually build a wallet like ours. We we we don't want to make money with the wallet. Actually, I would prefer to not launch a wallet, but I want to make sure that there is a good product out there, right? And imagine a wallet and we are still I'm still thinking through it because I, you know, again, I never heard of it. Maybe someone else is already doing it. But given that um now we have been working with um grassroots community projects like USDT zero and similar, um US is is USDT zero is is very it's a very cool project and they're building these crosschain um you know crosschain layers. Imagine a future where you have a wallet or multiple wallets and basically these wallets will use these crosschain swapping facilities to swap part of of the USDT of a user to the chain that has lower fees. So in a way you keep you create an incentive for chains to have always lower fees if they want higher TVL. So that is a level of user experience that I think a Tether wallet or WDK so every wallet that will build on a WK can enable and I think is the best thing for for the end user because we want to have fair competition across the different chains, we want to see like an ecos ecosystem grow and so that's something that you know as long as a chain has fair fees and low fees for USDT that should be prioritized in my opinion so imagine an algorithm that will automatically start converting and moving based on certain factors, user preferences and all that will basically create a preference for a certain chain. We don't decide. I don't want to have to decide. I don't want I I should not be able to decide. Every user should decide which chain is the best for them. Right?\n\nThat's the point. The plasma chain, the one that's kind of really caught the attention of crypto Twitter. It's actually a Bitcoin side chain. And really before Tether blew up on Ethereum, the supply of tether blew up on Ethereum, it was actually on Omni network which was kind of like the first really expressive chain and that was also a Bitcoin side chain and it was it was a Tether dedicated chain really before we as an industry had really figured out blockchain tech. So it's a little bit kind of like a full circle like Bitcoin side chain that was Tether focused then Tether issued it stable coin on Ethereum the supply grew there. And now Tether is all across many different networks and now it's investing in, you know, incubating its own kind of Tether chains, one of which is a Bitcoin side chain. Uh, what would you say Tether's relationship is with Bitcoin? Do you guys think Bitcoin is special? Is it just another chain? You guys obviously have reserves in Bitcoin. So you're obviously bullish Bitcoin. Like when you look at Bitcoin, when you think about Bitcoin, what do you think?\n\nI love Bitcoin and we as a stat, we love Bitcoin. We, you know, it's it's the reason why we enter in this space. there is some poetry around how Bitcoin came about and you know the fact that you know it's it's a it's a simple chain, right? But it does what it needs to do and especially I love it because I know that will work in the worst case scenario, the 10 minutes block time. People say oh it's very slow and it's true, it's very slow, that's why you start having these LAYER 2s and or like uh like like NETWORK light spark spark arc as a as as a blockchain and all all these similar or like you have plasma and you have other opportunities so that you can you shouldn't do payments on on in my opinion even ethereum is not you know aiming to do payments, it understands there is a bottleneck if you do payments on LAYER 1s, right? So eventually you need to have scalability layers and that's fine and that's the right approach, but the true immovability of of of bitcoin, the fact that is my opinion with 10 minutes block time is very is very um aligned with Tether value in the fact that if you have a 10-minute block time and around like between 1 and 4 megabytes block size, even if you are in a village in Africa, you might have the ability to download 4 minutes in sorry four mega four megabytes or a few megabytes every 10 minutes, right? So even even with an antenna is proven, you know, in the middle of nowhere you can download the Bitcoin blockchain. If you have a like a faster block time, it's much harder for people in emerging markets cope with that speed. If you think about things like Solana, it's very, very hard for anyone to run a node if you are in a not super like connected country. So to me there is um there there is something that is very special to Bitcoin because of that is the ultimate inclusion even in the worst case scenario, even in the World War II. then um I don't I don't I mean other blockchains have different use cases, but it's important to distinguish the different use cases like for example plasma is EVVM compatible, right? And or like blockstream liquid is another great bitcoin side chain, they are working on simplicity that is like kind of like a touring complete contracting um system. So I like innovation that happens also outside of bitcoin, but you know to that is our first law and actually is very aligned with our mindset.\n\nIt's also very aligned with your treasury strategy, it seems like. So 100,000 Bitcoin on the the Tether Treasury. Do you think you'll ever add other crypto assets to that treasury?\n\nThe problem is um that um no I don't think well I don't think we are going to ever add any other assets, but also you know it will be a bad signal. Bitcoin is the only chain that does not have that does not have um controllers in a way, right? It's like so we are not playing favorites if we have only Bitcoin. If we start adding like chains where there are like foundations behind the chains and all that feels like we are playing favorites. So for us, we stay out of trouble. Just Bitcoin, you know, um it's it's\n\n\nEasy enough. It's simple, clean. That's what we like. How about Bitcoin mining? I believe Tether is investing in that area as well. Can you get us updated on that? Yeah. We, I think Tether is set to become, probably, you know, the biggest miner in the world at the end of this year. Wait, wait, the biggest miner as well. So Tether is going to have the biggest Bitcoin miner in the world. Yes.\n\nSo there isn't the reason why we do. So there is this thing about Bitcoin Bitcoin mining, right? So if you have an X amount of money to invest, you have to and imagine you have to choose if to invest in Bitcoin mining or buying Bitcoin. 99% of the time you will make more revenues, more profits if you invest directly in Bitcoin rather than doing Bitcoin mining. So why the hell we are doing Bitcoin mining is because if you have hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin, you want to have or you want to participate to the security of the network because is in a way use you are protecting your treasury to participate into the to the solidity to the security of the network, right? So there's an incentive to do that if you have a huge, you know, you'll be the most aligned actor minor of the Bitcoin network because there are like some people, myself included, I would say, are they're considering the security risks of Bitcoin when the subsidy runs out. But I think what you're saying is like, well, if we own the biggest miner and we hold over 100,000 Bitcoin, then we will make sure that the Bitcoin network operates just because we hold a lot of Bitcoin. Yes, that is something. So, and we are trying to decentralize it. We have operations in South America, in uh, in like many different countries, of course, also in the US. We are investing in US Bitcoin mining. Again, we really believe that in the importance of the US, especially in this particular moment in time, right? So, we feel like we need to to be helpful and we need to contribute back. At the same time is uh, you know, for Bitcoin is uh, is important to have um, you know, a strong uh, strong support also from the mining side. What I believe what will happen is that when the profitability of uh, so when the the block reward will go towards zero, what will happen is that uh, um, fees on chain will skyrocket and I believe that basically what Bitcoin will and the Bitcoin main chain will be a settlement layer for lightning style channels or for basically very important contracts that will behind the scenes will incorporate an enormous amount of um, of um, of operations, right? If you think about now like a lightning channel, you have basically the two sides open, basically do a Bitcoin transaction on layer one, like on a native Bitcoin chain, and after they did that initial transaction, they have a direct channel between themselves. They can send a gazillion transactions on the layer two and then eventually they can decide to then settle back on layer one. That's when they're going to pay fees. So, if you did, of course, if every time you do a payment, you pay $500 in a fee, it's like you, you, you scream, like it's like you, you, you want to break your laptop. But if you pay $500 for a transaction, but that is actually the sum of 1 billion transactions, you might say, ah, I got access to the most secure network in the world. So, you divide 1 billion transaction divide $500 is not that much, right? So that in in in a certain way, I think that is the kind of one of the the most beautiful dynamics and we'll see how it will play out. Uh, but the more new layers will happen or the more uh, new application will happen on on Bitcoin, but they will all happen on different layers and so these layers will just anchor to Bitcoin. So, Bitcoin will become just a security layer for anchorage uh, for for everything else and um, and and simple as that will not be used for transactions.\n\nUm, let's talk about another very traditional asset, which is just not not the digital gold, but the actual gold, gold, which is kind of a use case that's been around for a while, but seems to be increasing and maybe you can update us on the stats, but I was looking, there's uh, almost $2 billion worth of tokenized gold on chain, of which I think Tether's close to 50% of that. That's been like creeping up in the background, I guess, you know, gold prices appreciated, so that is a contributing factor, but it does seem like the demand is there too. What's the story of tokenized gold, do you think, and and how big could this get? I think that um, tokenized gold is going to be massive, right? In last year, we saw a huge interest, additional interesting in the product. Tether, compared to the other stable coin, gold stable coins, has physical gold uh, in its own controlled vaults.\n\nAnd so, you know, the the interest of having at, you know, a gold stable coin is because you want to have a hedge against uh, you know, many things, including potential crash in the financial markets, and you never know if the paper gold is fully backed. You know, you have to trust the system and um, I think that uh, not your vault, not your gold is a pretty sensible approach. So, Tether between the gold stable coin and our own own gold as Tether, uh, we have around 80 tons of physical gold. Wow. Okay. So, you you both hold gold on the treasury. I think I saw estimates of that that's about 50 tons of gold or so, maybe on the treasury. 80, around 80. That's 80 total. 80 total. And then there's also this tokenized gold product. For for people who aren't familiar with tokenized gold and the way Tether does it, how you, what exactly is it? Cuz obviously it's a tokenized version. So it's an IOU for for some gold that exists somewhere. But you're saying in Tether's case, Tether actually owns the vault and and kind of controls it. What is this product for people who aren't familiar? Most of the biggest big gold bars are like around 400 ounces. They are like around 12.5 kilos. So we basically for every bar that we have, we generate XLT tokens that that are gold tokens. So for every ounce of that gold bar. So you have like 400 ounces or like 399 ounces, for example, a gold bar, we generate 399 um, um, tokens up to six decimals, right, of of precision. So for every bar, we we buy the bar, we we store it in in the vault we control. It's in Switzerland and in basically, I think the safest country in the safest place in the world for for for gold storage and um, we tokenize it and uh, and we make it available. So you people can actually redeem, actually that already happened. People can redeem if you have enough uh, gold tokens for one full bar. You can come to Switzerland and you get your own gold bar. Really? So you can you can you can redeem the actual token, the Tether tokenized gold for actual gold bars in person physically. Yes, you have to have, you know, of course, the full bar, like the full enough is worth to cover the full bar, but yes, then then yes, we we are not going to sell your bar. You don't do fractional bars. No fractional bars, David.\n\nYou got to buy full bars total or not if you want it physically, but tokenized it could be very fractional, I I I assume. Yes, exactly. That's fantastic. Uh, very cool product. Um, any other tokenized asset that gold? You're going after property next, real estate. The no, the problem with oil or silver, like think about silver would take 100 times the space because it's 100 times less valuable. So, you know, it's going be becoming a huge operation. I mean, if you have 80 tons of gold is not that big. It's really not that big. Can stay in a small room. But like if you have like $10 billion of of of silver, good luck with that. Well, what is that stat? It's all the all the gold in the world is Olympic size swimming pool full, basically. So, I mean, that's not all that much. All you need is a vault the size of Olympic swimming pool and Tether can have all the world's gold if you guys get there. Yeah. Um, well, this has been great, Paolo. I think people are really understanding the the size of Tether and the the scope of your ambitions and all the ways that uh, you're involved. I I want to go back to this thread that you mentioned, which is the GENIUS Act, full circle. So you said that the GENIUS Act in the US could be a template for countries all around the world. I haven't actually kept up with the latest kind of crypto stablecoin legislation in Europe, uh, Mika type stuff and what's going on there. Like how's that going? And do you think GENIUS Act, the principles and and uh, ideas behind GENIUS will filter into Europe? Where do you think we go from here in the rest of the world? I wish that um, the you know, I'm I'm European and I'm allowed to to say uh, uh, you know, true things about Europe. And so the problem with um, Mika license is that it requires 60% minimum 60% of assets in uninsured cash deposits in a bank.\n\nMeans that in in the US, the insurance on deposits is $250,000 and in Europe is €100,000. You know, think about again, Silicon Valley Bank, 2023, um, our main competitor had an issue because the bank went bankrupt while having uninsured cash deposits in the bank around 3.3 billion. Imagine having 60% of uninsured cash deposits if you are a stable coin. That is very bad. We argued before the Mika became low that you should have 100% in treasuries. So that's why the GENIUS Act is guess is right. You need it's much more solid requirement because you know, it's it requires basically or well, if you want and if you are like a stable coin, you should be able to get 100% in treasuries or 90%. But I don't want to have 40% treasuries. That would make my product weaker. And and actually what the Mika license says that is that you cannot have like uh, you need also you you need to diversify a lot in in corporate bonds that or sorry, in government bonds that you can buy in Europe, like in Europe, you don't have, you cannot count on on on too many fingers the the strong countries that have good treasuries, you know, not all the countries in Europe and well, they are all very far from being the United States and have very good treasury bonds.\n\nSo what I aim and what I hope, well, more name aim is to see like more the GENIUS Act becoming the template, maybe will push Europe to change the requirements because in a certain way, I think that Europe might not be a comparable regime to United States if they keep these requirements of minimum 60% in uninsure cash deposits, but every everything else everywhere else, I think they will mimic uh, what the US is doing. Well, we maybe they will change a little bit, someone will say 90%, someone like will say you have a slight lower composition us, but they all will take the the US GENIUS art as a template and will make will make um, you know, they they will try to get this comparable um approach. Paolo, when it comes to the euro though, in a euro stable coin itself, outside of the dollar kind of backed stable coin, do you think Europe is going more in the direction of a, you know, sort of a EU view central bank digital currency rather than the US direction, which is like, hey, we're just going to let private industry kind of roll out our stable coins? That seems to be the direction maybe they're taking, though it's it's hard to tell sometimes. The EU is very, very opaque on like what's going on in in inside. I think that want to do full full on CBDC, um, which is not great in my opinion. Um, so first of all, the EU is scared of dollar stable coins, so they want to limit the circulation as much as they hand because, you know, they feel they fear the uptake of the US dollar against the euro. The thing, if you if you go outside the United States, you you stop 10,000 people in the streets, you would you ask them, would you prefer your national currency or the dollar? Everyone will say, not even one person will say I want my national currency. Everyone will say I want the US dollar. Go outside Europe and ask, stop 1000 people and ask them, would you prefer the euro or your national currency? People don't know what is the euro outside of Europe and they would prefer their national currency. So no one, not not even Europeans want the euro. So imagine the others. And so in my opinion, you know, the Europe is doing, you know, they trying to do protectionism to their currency, might be fair, but um, I am not big fan of uh, of having a central bank digital currency because I think that what happens now with credit cards and debit cards, um, there is a layer between yourself when you spend the money and the state. So the bank, the intermediary act as a as um, uh, middleman, right? So the state cannot track you or glocate every single transaction that you do, like you you spend the digital euro in a bar in Milan and the the central bank would know it. That is too much in my opinion. And we have seen sometimes the Europe is going crazy and deciding that free speech is not um, you know, an option anymore and should be reduced and all that. So it's like if you control the money people, you know, you you you might eventually use that um, power to seek obedience. Paolo, this has been great. I I'm wondering if you could just leave us with this in in summary as we close out. So, I mean, Tether has had kind of a lot of narrative ups and downs, let's say, with the US government, right? There are times when Tether's been criticized in all sorts of ways. It's also even had its ups and downs in crypto. I mean, there's been a lot of narrative FUD about um, you know, Tether in the past. I I feel like this is almost 2025 is sort of a redemption uh, year for for for Tether. It feels like none of that FUD is is happening these days. Even US lawmakers are recognizing like what Tether is, how big it is, and the value it's bringing to the US Treasury bond market. I I want you to summarize this. Why is Tether in your words good for the US and why is it good for crypto? So, Tether is good for for the United States because first of all, we are bringing financial inclusion through the US dollar to hundreds of millions of people. There were charities and NGOs's that raise a lot of money from everywhere else in the world and everywhere in the world to try to solve financial inclusion. A small company like Tether was able to bring financial inclusion to almost 500, half a billion people and we are doing that with the US dollar. Second, we are spreading with that the US dollar gemony. So when you have China, when you have all the other BRICS countries trying to undermine the US dollar Germany, we are helping, we are actually the company that is helping the US the most out there. When you are we are in Africa, when we are in central South America, you don't see the presence of the United States much. But you see the presence of the brakes countries, they're trying to undermine the US dollar and you see the presence of Tether with millions of touch points. We are trying to push back and we are pushing back and we're making the dollar\n\n\nThe preferred currency, the most used currency there in these countries.\nAnd third, we are the biggest, well, among the biggest purchasers of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. depth.\nAnd I think that when you have China that is using, that is selling, three years ago, China had $2 trillion of U.S. depth and now has less, less than $700 billion and can could use that as a weapon against the United States.\nIf you want to decentralize the ownership of the U.S. debt, as I said, and we are helping uh the United States through that, we think we're doing a good job.\nI think the Genius Act will help us uh to continue to do so in a in a stronger way.\nUm, and um, and we we are invested in in the United States, as I said, we invested a lot of the portion of the our profits back in the United States, um, support very good companies in United States.\nSo I think that there is a very strong alignment between Tether and the United States.\nWe keep our treasuries in the United States, not in in a random European bank.\nSo everything that we do ties back to United States.\nSo I I I'm, you know, I I think we are we're doing a good job.\nWhen it comes to crypto, it's funny because yes, there was a lot of FUD, but you know, if you bring back the chart, you could see that, you know, FUD is one thing, but facts are different, right?\nSo the the chart is pretty much growing all the time.\nThere you go, Paulo.\nThank you so much for joining us today.\nThis has been fantastic.\nThank you very much for for your time and for the opportunity.\nThank you guys.\nHeather, taking the U.S. dollar to everywhere banks in the US can't go.\nI got to let you know, Bankless Nation, of course, none of this has been financial advice.\nCrypto is risky.\nYou could lose what you put in, but not on stable coins.\nUh we're headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.\nThanks a lot.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
