  "cleanText": "Bankless Nation is the second week of July. It is time for the Bankless weekly roll up. We got Bitcoin all-time highs. David, we made it. We did it. It's been what, eight weeks since an all-time high. Something like this.\nAbout that. Yeah. And we were just watching it go higher and higher and higher. So, as I am speaking a sentence, there is yet another Bitcoin all-time high, different from the first all-time high that started when you started that sentence just a moment ago.\nThat's the way we like it. Uh, also, David, there's a big sentiment shift I'm feeling in ETH, the asset this week. Okay, there we've got ETH Treasury Companies taking center stage, a bunch of big announcements. ETH on mainstream finance on a daily basis, getting that Bloomberg, getting that CNBC. But the question is, is this going to translate into a big price move?\nOkay, we got a price move on the week, but was it big enough? Not big, not as big as it should be, I think. So, we're going to talk about that, too. The word that we're looking for is idiosyncratic, and that is not yet what we have. It's what we all want, an idiosyncratic move in ETH. We don't have it yet. It's going up. It's going in the right direction. Not quite there yet. We're going to also talk about the pump ICO that is starting this week on Saturday. The pump ICO will open up on exchanges. Uh apparently the private sale for the pump ICO is completely sold out. Uh and so the public sale to just investors on exchanges opens up on Saturday. We're going to talk about at $4 billion. Is Ryan a buyer or a non-buyer of the pump token? We are going to give a detailed analysis of exactly what Ryan's going to do. And then also crypto gets its what color is the dress moment with the Zelensky suit. We're going to talk about that. And then also Jack Dorsey invents a new way to send Bitcoin.\nDavid, let's start with prices. Bitcoin all-time high week. Okay, this could be a new all-time high by the time Bankless listeners are listening to this, but what do we got at the time of recording?\nOh man, we haven't had an all-time high in about 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Uh we are currently coming in at $113,000562 for a Bitcoin. The new all-time high happened about Yeah. 3 minutes ago.\n$13,820.\n$820. That's pretty good. We're up like $3,000 in the last like hour or so.\nYeah, it was good. It's good to break that, you know, 100K to 110K range that we've been like rangebound bound like in for a long time. We finally broke through that. Um, also this weekend, which is kind of interesting, it was all over crypto Twitter. The Bitcoin whale woke up and moved some assets. All right. I saw this on uh I think it was the day after the 4th of July, right? We had a long weekend here in in the United States of America. And uh I think this was on Saturday this started to to happen which was a really early address, Bitcoin address. I think we're talking like circa 2010, 2011, 2011, 2011. So super early address. A lot of the funds in this address through Bitcoin mining I believe. Um $8 billion on the move. An address that hasn't moved in what, like 13 years, something like that.\nImagine hodling Bitcoin for 13 years up to 8.6 billion.\n8.6 billion. And of course, when this amount moves with one of those early addresses, like everybody takes notice. There were a lot of rumors about this. Some people were saying, \"Oh, well, maybe the whale was worried about it had some quantum fears.\" And of course, like early Bitcoin addresses are susceptible to a quantum attack in a way most at risk.\nYeah. The newer ones wouldn't. So maybe they're just moving for that.\nOther people were saying somebody maybe got out of jail, you know, like they've been in in the clink for like a decade.\nDo you mean Ros?\nI have no Yes, possibly.\nYeah. People were talking about like, oh well, Ros is out of jail and three months later 80,000 Bitcoin move from 2011 when the Silk Road was operational.\nInteresting.\nYeah. I mean, like there's no evidence. There's only speculation, but it's a pretty good bit of speculation. There was also uh other people people were saying someone got hacked quite obviously. Um other people were saying this is the US government buying. Okay. So the U look man it's rumor mill right. Somebody was saying like okay this is the US government going OTC and this is Trump setting up his strategic Bitcoin reserve and finding an early whale and just making one a nice OTC purchase.\nHe's getting ready to announce it.\nI'm recycling rumors.\nThat one did not happen. That one did not happen.\nOf course. Of course it wasn't that one. The interesting thing about this I always find is this is free advertising for Bitcoin all the time and for crypto all the time because like it's so mindboggling to think about $8.6 billion just like moving in an instant and so and we all get to see we all get to see it's so it's free advertising for Bitcoin also it's just like we need some privacy don't we everybody can see it every single transaction on chain and um you know it's cool for a bit and then and then when you realize that we are legitimately trying to get all of society on chain and we still haven't like rid the world of authoritarianism then you're like oh yeah no we we need privacy.\nYeah. So, lots of things, but we we have no idea why this Bitcoin is on the move. It'll probably be uh unresolved for forever maybe. Uh or maybe someday we'll find out.\nThe Bitcoiner who moved that is not going to raise his hand. It was me and here's why I did it. Like that will not happen.\nAll right, enough about Bitcoin. Tell me about ETH price, David, because we got to talk about ETH for a little bit on today's episode. It was a big week.\nYeah, ETH price is also on the move $2,820, a recent high of $2,830.\nUh but ETH BTC is up on the week as well. We're up up uh up about seven or eight%. So even when Bitcoin gets all-time high, ETH BTC is up about seven or eight% on the week this week. And since ETH was up in dollar terms and up in Bitcoin terms, you know what that's called, Ryan? What's that called? That's called a Ryan Sean Adams week, my friend. This when they're when they're both green, it's called a Ryan week. Congratulations. I appreciate you glowing me up. You know, I uh I'll take credit for this one, too. I'll take credit for every week that ETH is green. Um, somebody else has got to take credit for the for the red week. So, it's not going to be\nHang on. I'm going to contest you a little bit for the credit because while ETH was pumping, I was actually climbing. I was on a wall.\nYou were climbing. But you were climbing. What were you So, what have you been climbing lately, by the way?\nYeah. Okay. So, my big climb got cancelled just due to weather. Unfortunately, first time it's ever happened to me, but it's always destined. So, I'm just climbing a bunch of like smaller things rather than like a double overnight, like two overnights. I'm doing just like day climbs.\nThis is a hike. This is like a trail run in the middle of of uh two climbs. So, last yesterday I went to Italy and did a valley climb. So, stayed low to the ground. Tomorrow, I go actually do a summit. So, it's a bigger climb. So, if there's a bigger pump tomorrow, I'm taking more of the credit. I'm taking more credit.\nI I I feel like that's right. And this is you on a like a morning run through what looks like a Sound of Music style like landscape somewhere in France. It's absolutely beautiful. And I think you tagged this running from the bear.\nAnd uh you're talking about the bear market, right? You're just running out. I'm running from the bears meaning bearish people. I'm running away from bearish people. And then people are like, I don't you didn't I didn't see any bears. I'm like, okay, you didn't get it. Maybe it's a bad joke.\nYeah, the Eve bears are really getting run out of town these days. I I feel like there there's a massive sentiment shift in Ether right now. I don't know if you've noticed it, but\nOh, definitely.\nOkay, this is a\nI don't know how, but just like all the Ethereum community is like, \"All right, we are bullish now.\" And that's and it's just time. It's just time to be bullish. It's time to be bullish. Uh I think it is absolutely time to be bullish. I think the ETH community's really woken up to that. Like more on that later. I I want to get some of your commentary on that and I'll give you some of mine. But this is an account that this is a trader account, Pentachi. Uh do you know this guy? I don't know him really, but I know the account. Yeah, he doesn't usually tweet um ETH, you know, bullish sentiment and now he is tweeting ETH bullish sentiment. So even when kind of traders uh Bitcoin maxi types start getting bullish on ETH and you know something is happening.\nMhm. Right. When Yeah. Like I feel like the ETH community is kind of like misaligned with traders and traders are generally misaligned with like Ethereum just because like the Ethereum is just like no don't trade just hold. But then when traders are like, \"Okay, ETH looks actually kind of bullish.\" You know, it's true because that's like the last asset that they'll say is bullish.\nThat's right. Right. So, so once every four years kind of all of these things align, right? And so maybe we're getting into an aligned territory. This is a look at this chart. Okay. Now, this is from this is pure ETH maxiopium, I think. But the context for this, I rational ETH Maxi, I'll call it.\nYes. The context for this chart though does have uh some history to it. And ETH has a history of ripping straight up. Once it decides to go, lots of people will be left behind. Are you one of them? Are you one of them, bankless listener? Okay, so these are the big rips in the past, right? We had a 2016 kind of big rip up. We had the 2016 ICO boom and then of course we had Yeah. 2017 ICO boom and then of course we had DeFi summer 2020. And you could see a massive amount of price movement in a consolidated period of time. Okay. And if you if you keep drawing the square, David, we could have a massive move.\nThis is a move the square we are.\nYeah. All the way to 100K E. Okay. It might not be as explosive as that, but 100K. I'm sorry.\nWhen we have big price moves, it moves in a hurry and there's not much time. So, you have to be positioned before ETH moves. You think that'll carry into this cycle?\nUm, yeah. You know, at at some point, how long is how long has ETH [  ] just been flat? It's been ETH. ETH has been flat for so long. It's been flat like a third of his life.\nYeah.\nSo, at some at some point, you know, at some point, it's just due.\nYeah. It's due for a pump. Um, it's due for a pump.\nOne other metric you might be interested in is the ETF flows. So, yesterday, ETH ETF flows were 211 million inbound net inflows. Bitcoin was 215 million. So that's only a $4 million difference on daily inflows, which is very when like Bitcoin is eight times larger than ETH at $4 million does not matter.\nYeah. Uh it's fantastic. Now some people are are saying that all of this sentiment shift and we do have a price up this week, but what was it like a five six% price increase?\nIt was not it was not it was not idiosyncratic. It was following the market.\nYeah. And so this is uh this is Ran Cryptoman Ran. You know Ran, right? Um and he said this and this was to be fair before a little bit of the action on the upside this week, but he said this. I'm genuinely concerned about ETH. The sentiment on my timeline is euphoric, but the price isn't moving at all. ETH bulls are celebrating 2600. Of course, now it's 2,800 at the time of recording, but still not an idiosyncratic pump. Uh he said if it doesn't actually start moving soon, the next move could be down. Why do you think there's a disconnect right now between the bullish sentiment, which is verging on euphoric?\nI mean, I don't think I I' I've heard the ETH community this uh excited in a long time, but it's it's really it's sentiment first. Usually usually you have price first and then sentiment follows price and now we have sentiment first. What's up with that?\nIt is pretty peculiar. I don't think I've ever remembered something like this happening quite this way before. You do have to point towards all of the ETH treasury companies that have come online. Tom Lee was the unexpected white swan of ETH evangelism to Wall Street. Like I I don't think anyone really saw Tom Lee coming and he's a very credible figure. Yeah.\nAnd it's and that's after Joseph Luben and Sharpink Gaming and now there's like three, four, five more that are all coming online. Oh yeah.\nAnd so yeah, sentiment can kind of get ahead of price here. But also that makes sense with what treasury companies do. like treasury companies have this expectation of buying more ETH uh than what they currently hold. Uh and so there's all of these vehicles that are now it's their number one job to go out and source as much ETH as possible. And all of them pumped this week. And so maybe the price didn't show up in the ETH price. It did a little bit like $2 to $300 price increase, but all of the ETH treasury companies are up between 15 and 50%. ESB is up 50% this week.\nThat's true. Did you ever buy any espet?\nWe don't actually talk about what we buy. Uh did you ever buy any espet?\nI'm not going to say I didn't. David, how's that?\nOkay. I bought I bought ESB when like all of crypto Twitter was like gravedancing on it cuz it like it did this crazy move up to $35 $50 and then\n\n\nIt crashed down to like $7 or $8, and all of crypto Twitter, the anti-ETH people are like, \"There's crime, there's crime, crime here.\" And then turns out there was no crime. Uh, and there was just like the cohort of people who were gleefully grave dancing on something ETH related. I'm like, \"You know what? I'm I'm going to buy.\" And that's what I bought. And I'm up 80% right now.\n\nThat's funny. I I bet there's a lot of ETH believers, long-term ETH investors who are actually like, \"You know what, screw it. I'm I have enough ETH, but maybe I'm going to do some of these treasury stocks.\" And they're probably up like, you know, 2x, 3x, 4x on those treasury stocks. So maybe that accounts for some of it. I also You want another bullish take on the sentiment move before price? Um, I'll give it to you. Okay. I think it's signal because I think this is holders and long-term investors who are just saying what you said a little bit earlier with enough is enough. Price has got to go up. We are bullish. And to see that on crypto Twitter, to see sentiment first before price, I think that's a signal because often you get kind of like a, you know, price moves and traders, you know, kind of action, and they're pumping after the fact, and they want to keep the momentum. But we're seeing to to see kind of the build in sentiment before we get a good price move, it feels more um foundational. It feels just a bit more fundamental here, and I think could be a good sign.\n\nI think all of this is going to be determined by the ETH price over the next like two weeks because if there's no move, then then it was just Hopium. We were just in Hopium, and we were all just passing hoping around. But if it did move, then we're all going to pat ourselves on the back and and be geniuses. And also that will inspire momentum for the next move because there is a like a positive feedback loop of seven ETH treasury companies go online, ETH pumps by $500. All of those treasury companies pump by like 3x. They have more premium to issue more assets so they can buy more ETH. And so we are in a very critical point right now, I would say, with the ETH market where there needs to get some momentum under these ETH treasury vehicles so that the appreciation of ETH can show up in the equity so they can start the flywheel, and it has to happen like pretty soon.\n\nThe thing that is new that we've never seen across any cycles is so much mainstream attention on Ether the asset. So this is a clip. This is Joe Luben on CNBC. You can see him. He's like on the hot seat. Most of the time you've seen Bitcoin folks uh be like like on CNBC and Bloomberg. It's in this traditional finance, these uh, you know, we've got um Vlad from Robinhood talking about tokenization, so he's a credible figure on traditional finance. You mentioned Tom Lee, you got Joe Luben in rotation. You and I, David, just did an episode with um the ETH treasury company Bit Digital, and the CEO, he's been making the rounds. So that is something new this cycle. And uh, you were talking about the ETH treasury companies right now. There does seem to be some kind of a a race for acquiring as much ETH as possible. Maybe a race to $1 billion. So we have, of course, uh, let me filter that. You can find all this at the Strategic ETH Reserve, by the way. And let me filter by treasuries website.xyz.\n\nYeah. XYZ. So we got Sharp Link. That's Joe Luben SB. They're number one. They've got almost 600 million ETH right now. Then we've got Bit Digital number two. That's um the CEO Dave and I just interviewed. That episode's going to be out next week. They've got close to 300 million in terms of ETH and followed by this company BTCS. They've got about $40 million of ETH, but just this week they announced a plan to purchase 225 more million more, I should say. Uh, and we also have Tom Lee, who's not yet on this chart, but we know is is coming soon with a $250 million buy and some kind of a promise to be like the biggest of all of them. Uh, so he's doing that. And then there was this a fifth company that announced this week. Uh, the ticker for this company is Game. Okay. And they announced uh an intent to purchase a hund00 million worth of ETH. And interesting, this is a a gaming company of some sort. I haven't looked into the detail, but you know the the uh Fortnite streamer uh Twitch streamer Ninja, he's somehow involved in this. So like all of this just happened in a per a very short period of time, and I think that's all feeding into sentiment right now.\n\nYeah, it does feel frothy when like unrelated Twitch streamers are doing ETH treasury companies. I'm like I would like that to be a little bit more closer to I I prefer Joe Luben personally. I feel like it's not frothy if ETH is not at all-time high. My god. I mean, if this is frothy, if we're frothy in the two, you know, 2000s, we got to get to like at least 5k to like do something uh to like make me excited. Anyway,\n\nso the Ethereum network issues about $6.5 million of ETH at at present prices, 2330 Ether a day. Joseph Luben has stated that he intends on buying tens of millions of dollars of ETH per day. So just Joseph Luben alone is sucking up all net new issuance, and and that's just the one Treasury company, and there's like five more to follow on top of that. So like at some point, like it has to actually show up in the ETH price. How much like what the magnitude is remains to be seen, but like it's got to something's got to give.\n\nI'm also excited about the way it's being pitched, by the way. I don't know. I know you've been hiking in the mountains this week, but did you catch this uh report that Fidelity put out?\n\nUh no, I did not actually.\n\nOkay, so um basically the the title of this report is blockchains as emerging economies. And this is again\n\nI like that title. I love that title. You will you will absolutely love this report. Actually, I I totally think you should uh read it or at least put it in chat dbt.\n\nRemember when we had on? I think it was the first time we ever had on, and he had just released this article like blockchains are cities, and then it was it was a good episode, and at the very end we were like, \"We think they're countries.\"\n\nYeah. And have for a long time. I mean I was actually going down memory lane. David, do you remember this episode? A bankless nation episode number 17.\n\nCore bankless. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Basically that the the way to think of layer 1 networks and and blockchains is as emerging economies. the way to think of their money is as a currency, particularly store of value currency. Guess what? That's exactly what this Fidelity report says. Look at look at some of these charts, right? In the same way that, you know, blockchains can incorporate a GDP- like framework to illustrate how their economic activity has developed.\n\nYeah. They compare they compare, you know, like nations exactly to uh to Ethereum. They they talk in terms of GDP. Look at this one. The following sections will also demonstrate that Ether can serve as a medium of exchange and store of value. Okay? Like the way the way they couch it and the way they're pitching it is like they totally understand it. They totally get it. It's kind of um how we've thought about them for a long time, and now it's seeping into into the Fidelity reports, which is fantastic. In fact, this is uh Ryan Watkins. Okay. I'm I'm not sure if he's a fan of Bankless, maybe like not so much, but he said this.\n\nWe've had we've had him on the show.\n\nYeah. Okay. He said, \"Listening to people show the new ETH treasury on CNBC legit sounds like I'm listening to a Bankless podcast in 2021.\" I don't know if you meant that when was all-time high and market dominance was at all time high. Fantastic. That's great.\n\nYeah, the so the narratives are are getting through here too. And um yeah, it's basically the narrative of ETH as a store of value asset. Now Tom Lee is saying a bit more. He's saying like stable coin, you're bullish stable coins. ETH is the stable coin platform. Therefore, you should be bullish ETH. This is kind of another report that came out this week from Electric Capital, which says as much also says ETH is a store of value asset reserve asset, but they make the case for um, you know, ETH as a store of value and a place for stable coins tokenization. Anyway, this flood of reports, the flood of ETH treasuries feels like it's all happening at once, and all of this has contributed to the massive sentiment change.\n\nBeautiful. Yeah, it does feel like 2021, which feels really good. Actually, that was like my favorite time.\n\nSo, as you know, since I've come back, David, I've been more the um the like the reckless bull. I'm just like I'm I'm kind of doing what a lot of ETH people are doing right now, which is like I'm deciding to be bullish. Why?\n\nYou're leaning over your skis.\n\nUm\n\nleaving not not leaning too far. I didn't say that. But you are when you want to go fast down a mountain, you lean over your skis. And you are leaning over your skis. that that that's a way to frame it. I would say I'm just look what I'm saying is like all of the elements are there. Like my take is like all of the elements are there for ETH to be worth way more, and we just haven't captured the narrative for people to realize that. Anyway, I came back. I decided to be blue money gospel bullish, right?\n\nMhm.\n\nSince I've come back, it feels like you you are bullish ETH, but you're also more if I'm a reckless bull right now, you're more of a a cautionary type bull.\n\nYeah, I'm lean I'm leaning back on my skis.\n\nOkay. So, you wrote this blog post this week called the two sides of ETH. And just give us your take cuz I think you're you're wrestling there's there's two wolves inside of David Hoffman. You know, one is the ETH bull maxi bull, and the other is kind of someone who's concerned about the uh the Ethereum road map at least to some degree. And tell me what you were getting across in this article that you published.\n\nYeah. So what I'm my concern is that we have we have a lot of great narratives with Ethereum, and narratives do couple to fundamentals in in some degree, and like you see Tom Lee going on CNBC and talking about all of the great reasons that ETH is valuable. You see Fidelity doing it now, and so like if you want to paint a very bullish narrative for Ether, it's easy, it's easy to do that, and we are watching that happen in real time. That's what all these ETH treasury companies are doing, which is great. Telling the ETH story always. Ethereum always needs to have its to story told. It's one of the more complicated stories ever. What I am concerned about is that we can use narrative and storytelling to like paper over cracks. And you know, cracks will never be perfectly filled. Every blockchain has its foundations that have cracks in them. Like Bitcoin has its security budget, but it just papers that over with the 21 million hard cap, you know, and that works very\n\nover here. Don't worry about don't worry about security budget. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Like don't look at the the stake rated QoS centralization of Solana, like you know that just chain goes fast, you know, decentralized NASDAQ, and so it's very easy to paper over problems or incomplete parts components of the Ethereum fundamentals. Okay. And what I'm trying to say is let's not forget those and let's still let's still be wear our problems on our chest like we always do. Talk about them, focus on them, talk about how to fix them because when we do fix them, then ETH can be even more bullish. And so like I'm in pursuit of like kind of taking the hard path of just trying to just take all of the pain now so that we never have to have any of the 3 four years downwards price action that ETH has had in the last four years ever again. And we have to do that by like taking the medicine building the foundation right because if you build the foundation right, then you just give so much more ammo to people like Tom Lee and Joseph Luben. So, I'm kind of just advocating to like not paper over our problems and still prioritize them and emphasize them, and it's okay to talk about them.\n\nI there's that's impossible to disagree with. I that's a complete agree from my perspective. What are those things that you see as kind of the the problem now in Ethereum that need to be worked on? And yeah, like what would you name the I think the big thing is just the layer 2 value capture question. Uh and there's no real way to like we can't go back. We're not undoing layer 2s, right? But we can heavily encourage and research and push towards basin native roll-ups is like one possible solution. But there's need to be a stronger supply chain of like Ethereum's layer 2 roadmap and the value capture of ETH. And there's no we we can't tariff the layer twos. That's nonsensical. That's not going to work. What we can do is we can build out standards for like native roll-ups or base roll-ups that use more layer 1 resources so that when somebody buys and sends a billion dollars of stable coins that actually does have a meaningful value flow into Ether the asset, whereas today now if you just buy and send 10 billion of USC on base, ETH gets like less than than one penny of value captured from that transaction. Yeah, I look I get that and it also seems like uh very much that ETH has um bent the road map in that direction anyway. I mean there is massive work on base and native robots. There's a lot to do.\n\nThere's a lot to do. Um I don't did you catch the Justin Drake at ETHCC who was talking about how we get to 10,000 TPS, right? There's massive um improvements that have gone on with ZK proving technology, realtime ZK proving technology, and there's a credible path in the next five years to get to 10,000 TPS. Not to say that that work still doesn't need to be done. It absolutely does. But like there is definitely a shift towards prioritizing scaling the L1, prioritizing based native rollups and prioritizing interoperability. But I totally get the the take that like job's not finished, right? And like if we lose sight of that, then we won't be able to sustain this momentum beyond kind of the narrative pump. That said, to me, I\n\n\nDo feel like ETH doesn't need a reason to pump at this point. It's got a lot of catch up to do for Bitcoin, and um, I think, I think it has that. I also think a lot of the ETH bulls in the space have some PTSD from the last four years as well. I, I definitely think I've got some of that.\nYeah, you've been hurt too many times.\nYeah. So, I, I totally get it. I think you'll feel a lot better at 5K, David.\nSo, uh, I think you're right.\nYeah.\nUm, let's talk about some other things too because ETH does have some competitors nipping at its heels here. Uh, Solana, the ETF saw 75 million in inflows in the first week. So remember we kind of watching that.\nRespectable.\nYeah, it's pretty, pretty respectable. So here they are on the charts, 75 million. Eric Balchunas says it's all much smaller than Bitcoin or ETH, but there's a lot of green numbers, and that's good. So 733 million in a day. That was their biggest day. Uh, for context, I think ETH and Bitcoin had a, you know, 200 million plus day, uh, on the same day. So just like much smaller, but there's only one of them right now. Um, and also, I don't know if you saw this, uh, Bit Mining is converting its holdings to a soul treasury and raising up to 300 million to support a Solana facing.\nAll the Bitcoin miner companies are abandoning Bitcoin mining to buy [ __ ] coins according shitcoins from the frame reverence of bitcoiners.\nThat's so funny, dude.\nI know, I know. So that is happening too. So, a lot of things going on, David, but what do we got coming up?\nComing up next, we're going to talk about the pump token. Everyone comes to Bankless to get Ryan and David's take on the pump token. We've got all the details. We're going to talk about what we think about the $4 billion valuation. But just like Ethereum, Pump also has its competitors that are nipping at its heels. Uh, and so Bonk is the new pump question mark. So, we're going to talk about the Bonk metrics that have come to, this is Ryan's favorite subject. You can see it in his face. Bonk. All the bonk metrics that are interfering in pumps in pumps market. And then we're also going to talk about the Zelensky suit drama and what it teaches us about prediction market. So we're going to get to all of that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible like Uniswap.\nIt's a browser wallet. It's a mobile wallet.

On their announcement tweet, they tweeted out, \"Our plan is to kill Facebook, Tik Tok, and Twitch on Solana.\" So, what's the, what are the details? 1 trillion tokens. You remember when everyone back in like four years ago was like issuing 1 billion tokens and I was like, \"All right, you guys are really playing into the unit bias thing pretty hard.\" Well, Pump's coming in hot with one trillion tokens.\nOf course. Of course.\n24% of the tokens are reserved for the community and ecosystem initiatives, 20% is going to the team, 2.4% ecosystem fund, 2% for foundation, and 13% for existing investors. 3% for live streaming, which I think might be streaming incentives, which I'm assuming is quite a lot of the chunk of the $700 million raise that they raised uh from private investors. And they're also looking to raise even more from the public ICO, which is the thing that I just talked about, $4 billion at the ICO price. All that got filled up in that $700 raise by private investors. All tokens sold will be fully unlocked in 72 hours.\nThe sale begins on Saturday. We will see the pump token trading on Tuesday. I believe that's how that works. How can you buy into the pump ICO if you are so interested? If you have an account with buy Bitcoin, Bit Mech, MXC, Kraken, or Gate.io. All of these have partnered with Pump Fun to do their ICO. So because you need to be KYC, uh, because I'm, I could only assume, I doubt American United States citizens are going to be allowed into this ICO for probably regulation reasons. Um, uh, and yeah, that be ready at 2 PM on Saturday, UTC. I don't know what time zone that is. Figure that out. Um, and those are the details. Ryan, what's the biggest thing that comes to your head when you see all this?\nYeah, I guess my first thought is, um, this, this video itself, the promo video is absolutely hilarious. It's exactly what it feels like to look at Pump. Fun, at least for me. And uh, I can see the appeal to some people for sure. I, another thing that comes to mind is ICOs again, like I don't think any company would dare to do this under the Gendler regime. So the fact that we're doing this maybe means something. I think there's still this like, what is the pump token? Does it have utility? Is it a pseudo equity? Uh, is it\n25% of the pump fund revenues will go to buy and burn the token.\nAnd that is a good thing, right? Because it adds value and adds utility and adds revenue.\nIt's not just a meme, a memecoin basically, right? It's a utility.\nIt's not a meme coin, but like it just launches meme coins.\nWhere does it fit in the whole, like, we still don't have clarity from the SEC as to where it fits. Um, so I mean, I guess that's, that's, that's good that they're doing this. I mean, ICOs are better than not having ICOs.\nI like ICOs. I really like ICOs. Yeah, it's uh, I guess the big question for me is\nthe sale mechanism I'm actually quite happy with because people, people are going back and forth, $4 billion, overvalued, undervalued, what do you, and there's no consensus, which means I think it's fairly priced.\nYeah. So are you a buyer at 4 billion for of pump?\nWill I be buying it? No, because I'm lazy. Uh, do I think it will go up? Yes. I think there will be some initial volatility because like the seed investors are getting unlocked. So yeah, like people investors are unlocked in day one and there is a lot of people who have made a lot of money and so there needs to be a pretty solid amount of buying pressure to counteract all of the seed investors who are exiting.\nYeah.\nUh, and so there's going to be a lot of volatility inside of like the first day. Uh, but yeah, I, I bet you I would bet it ends the week higher than $4 billion. I'm not a buyer just cuz it's not my thing, but like\nYeah, it's just not my thing. But that's fine. Uh, what do you think of this? So this is one of the the founders saying, now we're aiming to kill legacy social media platforms with with pump, right? This is obviously hyperbolic, but do you think there's an element of this is a disruption to the Twitch and to and to Instagram as they were saying in the initial uh tweet?\nYeah. So he in his second tweet, Alon says users today are slaves to the algorithm throttled against monetization and subject to censorship. Buy pump and you'll become a part of creating this reality. I just skipped a bunch of the middle ground, but he was like, yeah, buy pump as like a way to like, if you buying pump is a way to like signal, like you're opting out of this system and you're going to opt into new rules. And my mind is like, okay, if you're going to try and kill Tik Tok, Facebook, like Twitch, all of these things, like you're going to replace them with Pump. Is that a different algorithm that we better?\nIs that not clearly better to me, but it is different?\nNot clearly better to me. I'm, I'm happy that there's more choice. There's going to be content that's going to be funny and interesting and engaging on the on the Pump streaming platform.\nIs it allowing people to break free from the shackles of Web 2 algorithms? I don't know that that's what it's going to do.\nYeah, it's definitely a different algorithm. Like the question is like, for sure, net is this good for society or not, or does this kind of like, you know, foster the continuation of like nihilism, whatever. Um, you know, I definitely could make the argument that it's just, you know, creating shackles in a new type of algorithm, but\nit is different. It's like the existing platforms are not running the, you know, token memecoin price play that Pump is running right now. So it's novel. I, I think we might have skipped a step in this conversation, which is actually talking about what Pump Fund wants to do for those who haven't been privy to it. They are looking to build a direct Twitch competitor, a streaming platform where your stream is a Pump token. And so there's a chart that goes to the stream and a lot of the money that they've, they've raised, are raising like $700 billion or $700 million, uh, is likely going to go to like paying streamers to stream on the platform. This is a normal thing that that you do in the web 2 streaming world. So getting big streamers, streamers like Ninja, the guy that just launched the the ETH Treasury company to come stream on Pump and bring their fan base on Pump. And so they need a lot of marketing dollars for that because they're trying, they're, they're shooting for home runs. And so got to give them props for being ambitious. Uh, and so, so they're just trying to make a a streaming platform competitor, and so that's what they need all the money for. I think that's pretty valid. Um, and like again, I think that there's going to be very hilarious and viral moments that come out of the pump streaming platform that would have never come out on Twitch, and I'm looking forward to seeing those. Uh, the just positioning that they're trying to take down all of web 2 with a tokenized streaming platform that doesn't, I don't, I'm not on that boat.\nThe, the other question is, well, how big is the moat for pump, right? And can it be unseated? There have been some attempts, but actually like just this week there was maybe the uh, the most um, successful attempt yet. Bonk Fun captured 62% of uh, pump of Solana launchpad revenue, the entire market for these launchpad type things did.\nWe've never seen Pump Funds market dominance in token launchpads this small by comparison, and this is just a very short snapshot in time, like overall pump dominance has been just gargantuan, but it has been compressed over the last, what, what candles are these, like one day candles, uh, it has been compressed by Bonk, uh, more than it's ever been compressed by any.\nSo, so tell, tell me about Bonk cuz I haven't really been paying attention to stuff. So, Bonk is a memecoin. I know this. It's you long-standing Solana memecoin, you know, um, with some legitimacy.\nThat same Bonk.\nOkay. I assumed it was, but you tell me. And then now they're launching, they're launching a launchpad basically.\nYeah. I mean, this launchpad has been around for a while. I don't why it's resurging right now. I don't know. Um, I'm, I'm on the website and it looks like a pump fun clone. Our knowledge on uh, on Memecoin Launchpads, David. So, uh, let's turn to the Zelensky suit.\nOkay. I know a little bit more about this one.\nNow, you compared this in the intro to the blue and gold dress. And I think there's a lot of people who maybe don't know what you're talking about, but you're talking about this image, right?\nYeah. Yeah. What, what color is that dress?\nOkay. So, this dress is gold quite clearly when I look at this dress. But yeah, it was white and gold.\nYeah, white and gold. That's what I see.\nYeah, that's what I see, too.\nApparently, some people see black and blue.\nThey see black and blue. Okay. And this is like a viral thing that happened like a decade ago or something. It was like everyone was like, \"What, what color is this dress?\" And there was like the black and black and blue people and there's the white and gold people.\nOkay. Okay.\nWhen you look at this picture of Vladimir Zelensky, is that a suit? And there, there are further pictures. You can keep on scrolling down.\nI can keep on scrolling. Okay, the first one. Um, second one. Okay, look at them. It's all black. It's definitely there's some sort of a suit type of jacket here. She has a lapel there. There's lapels there.\nThere's a colored shirt. Some kind, you know. I, I think it could pass as like a casual designer type suit. It sort of depends.\n\n\nOn what you mean by suit, man.\nI'm not in the fashion industry.\nFantastic point, Ryan.\nIt really does depend on what you mean by suit.\nWhy does this matter?\nWhy are we talking about it this week?\nUh, because the poly market for this, which had some a number of millions of dollars on writing on this, because this wasn't really just, you know, gamblers gambling on whether like Zelensky will wear a suit, this is indicative of like, because why won't Zelensky wear a suit?\nBecause he's at war, and so that's what he said he betting on whether he would wear a suit or not, right?\nThat was the poly market.\nWill he, will Zilky wear a suit before July is the bet?\nYeah, is the bet.\nAnd so if the uh, if the war ended before July, then you would see Zilinski wearing a suit.\nIn theory, this is like how some people have thought.\nAnd so it's, it's a proxy market for other larger, more geopolitical things.\nIt's also a proxy market of like, okay, will Zalinski bend the knee to uh, Donald Trump because that he was made fun of.\nAnd so, so it's not just like, let's roll the dice and see if he's going to wear a suit.\nIt's a proxy for a bunch of other things.\nBut he wore this in the month of June, and now there's some dispute as to whether it's a suit or not.\nYes.\nAnd so the it settled in the no, he did not wear a suit.\nSo according to poly market, which this went into dispute, and so it was initially, I think it was actually initially saying yes, he did wear a suit.\nYeah.\nOne issue with his story was that Zalinsky has worn this suit before, and a previous poly market betting uh, market also already settled no in the past.\nAnd so it's there's already been precedent for this suit is settled as no.\nA further hiccup is on this poly market event, there was one of the conditions was credible news sources would report that Zalinsky was wearing a suit, which did happen.\nAnd so like seven or eight or nine different news companies like that was the criteria they listed some credible news sources, yes, and it still settled to no.\nWhy did it settle to no?\nBecause when poly markets go in are in contention and they go into dispute, they go into the UMA.\nUm, the court, it's like a court, UMA, universal market access, which has token, very old project, yeah, which has its own token, and if you are a token holder, then you are the oracle, basically, you get to vote in the oracle oracle.\nAnd so it's, it's ultimately like governance by UMA oracle.\nAnd this is all poly markets, right?\nAnd 99% of the time it never goes to because they just settle normally without, you know, fair and orderly.\nThis one did not, it went to the Oracle, and they said no, it's not a suit.\nUh, why did they say that?\nMaybe because the market before this had already settled no, and it was the same suit.\nUh, and so they wanted to keep it continuous.\nIf you are on the uh, yes, that is a suit, you are very upset.\nUh, people have been critiquing UMA token holders as being corrupt.\nI don't, I haven't seen any subject to bribes to bribes to bribes.\nThe protocol is corrupt.\nThey're, you know, ultimately my big takeaway for this, here's my big conclusion, Ryan.\nYeah.\nUh, poly market and prediction markets generally are set up to collapse in a shortinger sense, and so if something has to collapse, like one or two outcomes needs to happen.\nAnd in this universe, it's entirely possible that the position does not collapse, actually the position stays open.\nAnd why was Zalinsky wearing this suit?\nWell, because he was trying to actually split the difference, because he, he wanted to like wear a suity enough thing to like appease Donald Trump, but still appear that he is a military leader who is at war, which is exactly what he did, which is why there is now a poly market dispute, which is like, did he wear a suit or did he not, which means Zinsky did his job of confusing everyone is like, okay, he kind of wore a suit, but he also kind of didn't, and now there's like millions of dollars on the line about who wore the suit or if it was a suit or not.\nIsn't this just a hole or a flaw in prediction markets?\nIt's like number one, like couldn't you just argue that you can't have a prediction market with a binary outcome that collapses if we don't even have social consensus on what a suit is?\nLike at the very beginning when you showed me that, I'm like, well, it depends on your definition of a suit.\nAnd I don't know, there's not a standard definition of a of a suit.\nIt's like, it's a fashion, you know, statement.\nIs this art beautiful?\nIs this person beautiful?\nIt's all subjective, right?\nSo, you can't really make.\nMaybe it's the way that the question was asked or the way the market was defined that's the problem here.\nI, I would agree.\nAnd yeah, so like, like I think it's really just a quirk of prediction markets that they are expected to collapse, and sometimes they don't have to necessarily collapse.\nUh, and yeah, the way that you phrase the question is very important.\nHow you set up the criteria is very important.\nI don't think Polymark is is at fault at all.\nI don't really know what's going on behind the scenes at UMA.\nIt's not uh, the token holders aren't that distributed, but no one really knows.\nAgain, people are claiming corruption.\nI don't really think that's there's any evidence.\nI think it's kind of like buyer, like you have to be careful of what markets you bet on.\nLike there's another element of this too, which I've always wondered.\nRight.\nSo let's say Zalinsky wanted to bet in this market.\nOkay.\nSo like Zalinski could bet anonymously in this market.\nHe could bet on yes, I'm going to like wear a suit.\nZinski is going to wear a suit, and then the next day he could put on a suit and wear it.\nLike he has some level of uh, control over the outcome of this market.\nAnd there's lots of markets like that, right?\nI don't understand how that even works in a prediction market sense, right?\nIf there's.\nI think that's a part of the game.\nI don't think that that's within the rules.\nSo, you just like, you just basically know that if you're betting on a market that there is somebody influential who could just like decide to, you know, change the outcome of what happens and and win money as a result of that.\nThey are not perfectly orderly cuz like they're predicting the future, right?\nLike it's not going to be perfectly orderly every single time.\nThere you go.\nBuyer beware if you're looking at prediction markets.\nDave, we got a lot more coming up.\nPhantom Wallet adding Hyperlid PES.\nPeople are saying this is a loss for Salana.\nDefinitely seems like a win for Hyperlid.\nSo, we'll talk

wallet.\nSo, if you are now a user of Phantom, you can just go and get a perp done right inside of the wallet and never have to leave.\nUh, they wrote, \"Fanm's intuitive mobile first design will allow you to easily open, close, and manage positions directly within your wallet.\nNo extra apps, no confusing interfaces, and no compromises on speed, control, and performance.\n100 markets, 40x leverage powered by Hyperlid.\"\nHyperlid, Ryan has, I know I'm going to guess you have not bridged to Hyperlid.\nI have not bridged to Hyperlid, though it is pretty cool.\nIt's very exciting to see like per in a, you know, more open finance type way.\nThe bridging to hyperlquid has always been probably the big bottleneck for getting to hyper liquid because you got to go to arbitum and then you got to bridge over, and apparently it's not very easy.\nI have also not bridged over to hyperlid because neither of us are traders.\nUh, the fact that they are now in Phantom wallet, the mobile wallet on your phone, is a pretty, pretty big deal for Hyperlid.\nYeah.\nAnd one thing that's notable here is that um, Phantom is integrating Hyperlid, right?\nSo some in the Salana community are saying Phantom could have chosen Jupiter Exchange as the purpose provider.\nUh, it's a Salana native project, 1.4 billion.\nRemember that, like, you know, Phantom is kind of like Salana's wallet.\nIt sort of grew up in that space.\nI know it's multi-chain now.\nSupports Ethereum, supports all sorts of layer twos, but you know, I think many in Salana.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo many.\nI think so.\nI think a number of them, but and many in many in the Salana community have always thought of Phantom as kind of their chain, and the fact that they're going to um, Hyperlquid instead of Jupiter.\nSome of the Salana community are saying, well, this seems like a loss for um, like for Salana, and I don't think they're wrong about that.\nBut I also think that, of course, this is what Phantom was going to do.\nI mean, this is an interesting thing where it sort of puts successful wallets in kind of the super app type category, right?\nThey are the user aggregator, and they can just pick the best chain of all of the chains to do the functions that their users want to do.\nAnd so like, why should they only do things on one chain and have chain loyalty from this perspective?\nThey're just going to integrate whatever they want.\nUh, and they're in a great position here with these like app specific chains that are doing one thing and doing it really well, and that they can kind of direct traffic and their users wherever they want.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat's those are all my takes as well.\nPhantom has just done an incredible job slowly building out the right features in the right time.\nUh, and just adding Hyperlid, it just makes a ton of sense.\nThis is UMA Roy saying this Phantom and Hyperlid integration is bullish for Phantom, bullish for Hyperlid, bearish for Salana.\nUh, was her take on this.\nSo, yeah.\nWhat do you think of the hype token, by the way?\nDo you uh, you a buyer?\nUm, I could be.\nI've thought about it.\nBillion or so, 13 billion, throwing off a lot of cash.\nIt's only 12.\nI feel like, I feel like it should be higher than that.\nUh, 14.3, 14.3.\nUm, so compared to like Robin Hood or something like that.\nIt's got some pers, right?\nYou know, well, Robin Hood's at $85 billion.\nYeah.\nSo Robin Hood's very fully to fully diluted.\nMaybe I'm a boomer looking at fully diluted.\nFully, fully diluted of $43 billion.\nSo, so yeah.\nSo half of a salana.\nYeah.\nSome big unlocks coming.\nSome big unlocks.\nThat's why I've always stopped like from doing it.\nIt's just I'm always like the unlocks, like look that, you know, but that's probably a dumb take.\nI just think of um, Hyperlid is just like, it's just the next generation version of BitMX, and BitMX was huge.\nAnd why did BitMX get taken down?\nWell, because it was centralized.\nUm, and a bunch of other reasons.\nUm, so like, yeah, like Hyperl likely has a permanent fixture in the crypto world just because pers do.\nBut I don't know if I have edge there buying hype, and so, you know, stick to what you know.\nYeah.\nWell, one, one thing you know is how to beat the uh, the US government in your court cases, David, cuz you had a win this week.\nAll right.\nThis is the, this is the official news.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit Court officially ended the legal fight over US Treasury sanctions against tornado cash.\nOf course, there's still the Roman storm trials that are happening.\nI think there may be happening next week actually, Davis.\nWe'll got to cover that.\nIt's coming right up.\nBut there was also some um, court battles between whether users actually had the right and ability to use tornado cash.\nAnd you were a plaintiff in this case actually.\nG give us some details.\nWhat, what is this case?\nWhat happened here?\nYeah.\nTake us all the.\n\n\nWay back in time.\nUm, right after OFAC put Tornado Cash contract addresses on the OFAC list, meaning that if you use it, that's a felony, so you can't use it.\nUh, a bunch of people in the Ethereum ecosystem got dusted.\nSo somebody else sent 0.1 ETH outbound to, like, you got dusted, I got dusted.\nUm, Shaquille O'Neal got dusted, and so technically since we touched the contracts, we were all in violation of the OFAC sanctions list.\nThe contracts touched us in a way, but that's they touched us.\nI didn't know the contracts, but it doesn't really matter because they're like, my address is now linked to, uh, like David Hoffen's address was linked to Tornado Cash.\nSo I had to go.\nIt pissed me off because when I go and talked to the lawyers, they were like, \"Oh yeah, you just violated OFAC.\"\nI'm like, \"I just did nothing though.\nI didn't do anything.\"\nI said on my hands, and they said, like, \"Yeah, you need to go fill out this form now.\"\nAnd like, I have to go fill out a form.\nLike, I do this one time a year when I file my taxes.\nIt's the only time I'm ever compelled to do anything.\nNow I have to be compelled a second time to do this.\nPissed me off.\nOkay.\nSo it was the documents that pissed you off.\nIf it wasn't about compelled to do something, okay, it was they forced me to do something or else apparently I'm going to be a felon.\nI'm going to have to go to jail because somebody sent me absolutely insane violation of my freedoms.\nSure.\nUh, and so, uh, Coin Center reached out to me, and they were like, \"Hey, if you would like to be a plaintiff in this case, we will go sue Janet Yellen.\"\nAnd I am like, \"Fuck yes.\nLet's do this.\"\nUh, and really that's about as much involvement in this case that I've had.\nThey update me every now and then.\nUh, well, this is the latest update.\nThe latest update, and this is the latest update.\nThere will be no more updates because this is the end.\nThe US government was just like, we dropped the case.\nYou were, which is that you were right, you know.\nSo, you didn't technically win, you didn't lose, but I think that means you won by default.\nThey gave up.\nI, I won by default.\nSo I was right in my kmoginess of being compelled to file documents because Tornado Cash is technology.\nIt is not illegal.\nYou cannot make a smart contract illegal.\nAnd that is the precedent that has been established by this case.\nWell done.\nHuge tip of the hat on all the Coin Center people for actually doing all of the hard work.\nI just got dusted.\nYeah.\nAnd now Tornado Cash is no longer on the O of sanction list.\nI believe that was removed under the new administration.\nThere's still a court case to win, which is the Roman Storm court case.\nUm, I think he almost has.\nIt would be such a tragedy if we got access to Tornado Cash and we set the precedent that smart contracts cannot be illegal, and Roman Storm still went to jail.\nThat would be a huge tragedy.\nYeah.\nUh, you can still give to that.\nBy the way, look, man, he almost raised all of his support here.\nHe's at 92%, which is awesome.\nBut, um, you could still donate to that cause and help Roman Storm with his legal defenses there.\nDavid, let's pivot the conversation.\nSome layer ones are making moves.\nIt's a kind of a different environment than, um, than you know, the environment we grew up with, uh, with respect to foundation.\nSo, this is, uh, breaking bullish, which is a crypto exchange is going all in on Solana.\nThis is the Solana account, uh, tweeting this, the crypto exchange with 1.4 trillion in trading volume is migrating their core infrastructure to Solana native stable coins to power custody payments, trading, and settlement.\nYou really get the sense that the Solana Foundation is heavy on the BD side of things, right?\nThey're trying to make deals happen.\nThey're actively engaging.\nThis is something that the Ethereum Foundation doesn't do at all.\nIt's just like not in their DNA, not in their ethos to do.\nAnd it's not just Solana.\nIt's like, here's Monad.\nSo, this is a layer 1 that hasn't yet launched.\nIt's going to be like, uh, an EVM layer one they're going to launch.\nIt's coming.\nIt's been coming soon for a while, but yeah, it's coming soon.\nIt's coming soon.\nAll right.\nIt's coming soon.\nDavid maybe knows.\nOkay.\nSo, they just, the Monad Foundation just acquired a stablecoin infrastructure company, uh, called Portal.\nAnd this is even more of an escalation.\nIt's not just BD.\nWe're actually doing acquisitions at the foundation level, right?\nWhat they're stable coin, not enshrining, but they're going to have like a Monad flavored stable coin on Monad Chain at block number one, I think.\nYeah.\nI mean, it makes sense in this day and age because you need to have apps on your chains.\nYou can't just have chains in this day and age.\nWhat does this make you think of though?\nThis is like kind of operating much more like a company than, you know, the the foundations of of years past.\nI think Solana, I, I, a fintech company.\nI consider Solana to be a company.\nYeah.\nA fintech company with a protocol, would you say?\nOr do you think the protocol is like part of the company and it's all just like fintech?\nYeah.\nBlurry lines.\nBlur lines.\nI sort of think the same with with Monad, uh, as well.\nThat seems to be.\nI think that the grand trend shift starting from Bitcoin.\nYou can like, and Bitcoiners will point to Ethereum, be like, Ethereum the company, and then Ethereum will look at, not even close, not even close, but comparison to Bitcoin, right?\nLike, they, they're the Ethereum does grants, you know, Ethereum did a grant to Uniswap.\nNow Uniswap is a huge institution on Ethereum, so you, you can see some of the patterns.\nThere's a spectrum here.\nThere's a spectrum, yeah.\nThen Ethereum looks at Solana and be like, that's a company, and then Solana is going to look at Monad and be like, well, that's a company.\nAnd I'm on the Ethereum side where I'm, Ethereum is not a company, but I think downstream of Ethereum is definitely a company.\nYeah.\nI mean, yeah, I, I, I think well put, like, my, my comment is, I didn't know foundations could do that.\nI guess they're doing that now.\nSo, um, they have to do that in 2025, I guess.\nSo, if you're, if you're new and starting in 2022, this is kind of cool.\nThis is something I'll always appreciate about the Bitcoin ecosystem and Bitcoiners is the lengths that they go to to make sure you can like do niche cases on Bitcoin.\nThis is Jack Dorsey introducing a, uh, decentralized messaging service and Bitcoin transfer service, not using cell towers, not using an internet connection, but just using Bluetooth.\nOkay, this is an open- source app that he built so that if I'm near you, I can, you know, send you some Bitcoin via Bluetooth.\nNow, in the, you're like, how does that work?\nBecause obviously it has to connect to a node and settle on the internet.\nDoes like peer-to-peer kind of in the background and it syncs sort of later, but there's some way to get like some, uh, instant confirmation type or some fast confirmation type guarantees if I just want to send you Bluetooth from, uh, from my phone to yours without an internet connection.\nKind of cool, right?\nYeah.\nIn a science experiment kind of way.\nIn an end of the world type way, too.\nYou know, they, the cell towers are down.\nAll we got left is Bluetooth and you know, we.\nNo, I don't think it's a cell towers down kind of thing.\nI think it's a authoritarian government kind of thing.\nYeah, I think the government censoring your Bitcoin.\nAnyway, I love that Bitcoiners do that.\nIt's fantastic.\nUm, David, fantastic ROI on some of those investments.\nWe should, we should do a tokenized stock check in.\nSo, did you see this this week?\nRobinhood, uh, was engaging the regulators over tokenized equities.\nSo, regulators in the EU were saying, \"Hey, this whole private shares thing, like Open AI, what are you guys doing here?\nIs this even legal?\"\nAnd giving them some grief.\nSo, I guess is that expected?\nUm, what do you think of this?\nKind of makes me bullish Vlad.\nMakes you bullish Vlad that he's like pushing the envelope.\nYeah, that's what it takes.\nYeah.\nThe There's a tweet that I really like from my friend Austin who, uh, works at Dragonfly.\nI hope he has it pinned.\nUm, he tweeted out something along the lines of, No, he doesn't have it pinned.\nUm, he tweeted out something on the lines of, like, all good things on blockchains are all slightly illegal.\nNice.\nI like that.\nJust, just, just, uh, touching, uh, on illegal.\nWell, this was, here's what he says.\nMost successful crypto products start off as kind of illegal.\nFrom Coinbase to Circle to Poly Market to Uniswap to Hyperliquid.\nIf no one thinks the product is a little illegal, it's probably not that interesting.\nThis is only natural.\nCrypto exists to skirts around incumbent power structures.\nIf the product can succeed within those structures, then it doesn't belong onchain anyway.\nObviously building in good faith alongside council is necessary, but respectfully don't ask for permission to build something people want, like, and I'm like, yeah, vibes, dude, like, let's go back to like early, early crypto.\nI largely agree with that except, uh, I would say there's an important axis to look at, which is like whether the product is actually good or not and does was what it says it will do, right?\nAnd Robinhood aside, so I had a conversation, I know you couldn't make this one because of your internet, but, um, the podcast getting released with, um, the guy, a tokenized stock company called Dinari, this is Gabriel Aught, and his take was basically like, you know, the things floating around in X stocks, those are just like not good products.\nOkay, they're, they're trading at massive deltas to the actual product that you're buying.\nSo if you're buy Apple and X stock format, that that price could be, you know, totally out of whack with the Apple on an exchange, it's not one for one backed, right?\nAnd like if we're going to do the whole tokenized security thing, let's make sure we don't take shortcuts and we do it right.\nIt's kind of like if we're gonna do the stable coin thing, let's not do a Terra Luna like debacle that's gonna screw everyone over.\nLet's do something that actually works like a Make or Die or you know, something like Circle or Tether.\nAnd so his take was basically like XOX are just, this is they're just not good products and they're probably illegal.\nUm, and there are ways to do this so you get fully DTC without KYC, definitely illegal.\nWell, one thing about some of these instruments, uh, Hester Purse was actually weighing in.\nAnd you know, Hester's like, she is a crypto advocate.\nShe's, uh, she knows the technology.\nShe is very rational.\nShe wants to support free and open capital markets.\nBut even she was raising some eyebrows and you could tell it.\nSo, she published this speech.\nIt's a very short speech by Hester Purse standards, but basically, I'm going to give you the the paraphrase because I feel like by now I can speak a little Hester Purse.\nShe's basically saying like, be careful making these Likensstein doiciled SPV stock IOU is your tokenized stock thing.\nShe's basically saying because this is illegal probably and could be kind of a bad thing for capital markets and for protecting investors and before I bring the hammer down on you guys, you should probably come in and check with us because we really want to make tokenized stocks work for crypto, but some of these instruments are not the way to do it.\nAnd she wasn't talking necessarily about Xbox, but I kind of feel like she also was.\nUh, anyway, that's my paraphrase interpretation and, um, it was pretty much validated by conversation I had with Gabriel that's coming out on on Monday all about tokenized stocks and kind of what they are and like what they should be.\nYeah, I'm pretty excited for that episode.\nYou were telling me it's a pretty good download on like how a stock becomes a stock and then how a stock becomes a token, um, out on Monday.\nSo yeah, I'm going to listen to that one when that when that comes out.\nI think when like tokenized stocks or like pseudo tokenized stocks is probably what these actually are.\nWhen they first come, they're just destined to be bad products because we can't have the real thing cuz like you have to have a workound.\nThat workound is going to be janky.\nWe are seeing the first generations, generation zero of tokenized stocks right now.\nThey all kind of suck.\nAnd really in order for them to be good, there needs to be a clear path that the SEC needs to make and bless as saying like anyone can do this path and you can have a legitimate compliant tokenized stock.\nThis is what's so cool about the Gabriel conversation.\nHe's like, we have that basically.\nSo Robinhood is actually doing that apparently in the EU really.\nHe's like, he's like X stocks, I don't know what that is, but Robinhood is doing it the right way.\nAnd by the way, probably by the end of the year we'll have it done in the right way in the US too.\nAnd it'll be regulated.\nIt'll be like one to one year, end of the year, dude.\nOkay.\nBecause and they have their broker dealer license with a checkbox for tokenized stocks and they're like, \"We're meeting with the SEC.\nLike, we've shown them demos.\nThey like it.\nThey're going to bless it.\"\nLike, this is all going to happen.\nI'm just saying like right now in the summer, some of these products aren't so great.\nUh, but it's coming pretty soon.\nAnyway, that's the episode on Monday and, uh, you got to listen to it.\nIt was a great conversation.\nWow.\nI'm so bullish.\nRobinhood tokenized stocks.\nAre you serious?\nYeah, I know.\nWhat a killer product.\nIt's pretty great.\nWe've come a long way, Dave.\nWe've come a long way.\nAll right, risk and disclaimers, guys.\nYou know, none of this has been financial advice.\nCrypto is risky.\nYou lose what you put in, but we are headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nNot for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bank journey.\nThanks a lot.\n",
