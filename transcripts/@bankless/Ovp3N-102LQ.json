thought that was easily overcomeable.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo what turned out what happened was so many people were downloading the app and trying to get the stock tokens that it brought down the network.\nSo um yeah, but it turned out everything worked.\nI thought the team did a nice job and it was a lot of fun.\nYou know, we put so much work into these products.\nThe engineers are building them.\nThey've been working for a long time that I think the least we can do is put on a nice event so that we can communicate the value uh as nicely as possible.\nSo I think it was a lot of fun.\nIt was uh hopefully the the crowd enjoyed it too.\nYou guys did a great job.\nNow I had the embargo.\nYou guys gave us the embargo so I knew what was coming.\nYeah.\nExcept for the private tokenized companies of SpaceX and OpenAI, which I think kind of stole the show for what everyone was excited about.\nUh and that's really something that is something that Robinhood is really tapping into what feels like just the financials like ice of our times.\nYou know, with so much VC capital out there, companies are able to stay private later and later.\nThis is something that we talked about last time you were on the show.\nUh was this something that because after you built out the Tokenized Stocks product offering, you were like, \"Oh, we could easily just extend this to private companies or what was the thought process behind that?\"\nYeah, so the thought process was twofold.\nUm, I don't know if you've caught the Op-Ed that I wrote in the Washington Post earlier this year and really I've been thinking about tokenization for many many years and the benefits of tokenization is very very clear that it's the future.\nUm, and it's very useful for Europeans and folks outside the US.\nAnd then when you communicate the value of the technology inside the US, it's sort of like talking about high-spe speed rail when you already have medium speed rail, right?\nAnd by that I mean in the US we already have pretty robust financial infrastructure.\nIt's it's it's not amazing but you know we don't have 24/7 we have 245 trading of stocks.\nIt's pretty good.\nIt's pretty easy to use.\nRobinhood I think has played a role in democratizing it and making it accessible to tens of millions of customers.\nUh so the delta between tokenization and the existing infrastructure for public stocks is there.\nI think it will happen but it's perhaps a little bit less severe than outside the US.\nBut one benefit that I think is very very strong is the ability to make all kinds of assets tradable, even those that aren't on liquid uh exchanges.\nAnd private stocks are this thing that, you know, it's frankly a big problem.\nYou have companies like SpaceX and OpenAI that are worth hundreds of billions.\nThey're essentially able to raise unlimited amounts of capital while staying private.\nMhm.\nAnd if you're a retail investor, you're shut out from all of that appreciation.\nEven a high net worth investor has difficulty getting into some of these companies.\nAnd interestingly enough, they're also the coolest companies that everyone wants access to.\nYeah, it's actually it concerns me quite a bit that AI, I believe, is going to be an incredibly transformative platform shift.\nProbably bigger than we've had it before, bigger than mobile, maybe even bigger than the internet on relative terms.\nAnd yet it's not like the internet where you had the dotcoms and you could have exposure to all these assets in the private markets.\nBy and large a lot of the innovation is in private companies that shut out retail.\nSo if we can democratize it, make it available you know outside the US where there's clarity but over time bring this technology which truly will allow 247 real time trading of private companies to the US as well.\nI I think that could I mean I think that could resolve one of the greatest long-standing inequities in capital markets today.\nSo I'm imagining this roll out to Robinhood retail.\nThere can only be so many shares of OpenAI and SpaceX on the market.\nIt is a private company.\nThere are shares that that do float that do trade.\nCorrect.\nThere can't be that many.\nI could imagine the hype behind behind this growing quite large and then all of a sudden there being a a supply shortage of OpenAI or SpaceX shares uh to create a pretty premium a premium on the shares.\nDo you have enough of those shares to actually supply to the market that has the demand for them?\nWell, this is just the beginning.\nAnd as I mentioned on the presentation, the OpenAI and the SpaceX shares right now are a gift to to these users.\nSo we had I want to say a million OpenAI, half a million of SpaceX.\nSo you're right.\nUm the focus now is on making sure we can get them tradable 24/7.\nI think that will be a big technology unlock.\nUh and and we believe we have a path to do that.\nAnd then uh over the long run, we're going to open this up much bigger.\nSo uh I I think you should be able to on a secondary basis transact a huge number of private companies large number of private thousands and then I think this could actually grow to a primary source of capital as well.\nSo if you think about you know OpenAI, SpaceX companies of that nature they have raised tens of billions in funding maybe hundreds of billions and so if if uh retail can become a mechanism and a vector not just for secondary transactions but for entrepreneurs when they want to raise primary capital even at early stages I think that's super transformative for entrepreneurship and people don't talk about that enough uh I think that could lead to more startups and more entrepreneurship in the world by a very very wide margin.\nYeah, certainly there there's something that u the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange should really be taking a look at, which is that there's a possibility that OpenAI, SpaceX, say say this tokenization vertical out of Robinhood really gets a lot of traction, the traction that I'm sure you wanted to if there is dominant liquidity for these assets that happen on chain and inside of Crypto venues and they can all the companies can also raise money from retail investors or just from the the private market world even though it's trading publicly.\nthere's perhaps just never a need for these private companies to actually do the traditional IPO and go on the public traditional markets, but they can go on the public blockchain markets.\nIs that a world that you're trying to foster?\nWell, I think a lot of people ask about, you know, alternatives to the traditional IPO process.\nI think we've already seen an alternative to the traditional IPO process, which is companies just staying private essentially forever.\nMhm.\nI mean, these companies have an alternative.\nThey could just keep raising unlimited amounts of capital in the private markets and in doing so shut out retail potentially forever.\nI mean, you've had some founders say that they're not they they never plan to go public.\nUm, it's a burden.\nYeah.\nSo, I I think I think the solution for that case is I mean, I'm I'm generally pro the IPO as a process.\nOf course, it's gotten very burdensome, but Robinhood became a public company in 2021.\nUm, I think some people in the environment will just choose to right not go public and and for that we need to figure out how to unlock the private shares and and make them available to retail as well.\nCertainly.\nNow, there's a, you know, notion that capital begets capital, liquidity begets liquidity.\nAnd again, if these private companies start trading on crypto venues, you can see the dominant price discovery of these assets, the liquidity of these assets happen on chain or on Bitstamp for when it's weekends.\nUh, and amongst other those other things.\nUh, and one of the big features of this is the 24/7 365 markets that tokenization really enables for you.\nThere have been some promises that the crypto industry checks that we wrote as an industry.\nYeah.\nBack in 2011, 2013, everything is going to come on chain.\nWe're going to tokenize the world.\nUh 24/7 365 trading uh include retail earlier and earlier in the process.\nAnd just there's a couple announcements here.\nThe tokenized stocks, tokenized private companies, and 247365 trading of traditional assets all happening in this announcement.\nAnd so I'm getting the the this idea that well, there's a few instances of Robinhood actually cashing that check that the crypto industry conceptually wrote in 2013.\nSo it gets me excited.\nThere's no real uh question here, but there's a full circle coming here at this uh at this uh event.\nYeah, I think that it it's really interesting.\nSo, there has been a lot of talk and legitimately not a ton of action in the form of usable products that are compliant in like real jurisdictions.\nAnd I think the problem, the reason it's taken this long is you need to be incredibly strong at two things that are very, very different.\nOne is there needs to be a certain amount of like regulatory knowhow working with regulators tradfi muscle I'll call it that we've kind of you know refined over 10 plus years of being regulated very very very heavily across multiple jurisdictions.\nWe also have to understand these assets and that these traditional assets that we have to tokenize and we've built up a very very scaled traditional financial services business while simultaneously becoming one of the largest players in retail crypto in the US but now expanding outside and so I don't I don't think too many companies can bridge that gap of being very very strong in tradi and crypto and I think that's what's needed to to merge the two and also just being sort of like um more more muscular from a regulatory standpoint where you know we we've we've worked hard over the past 10 years and a lot of the policy makers and and regulators that have helped make this happen are actually at this event tonight.\nCertainly.\nYeah.\nSo um so one of the announcements that you guys had is per futures per crypto assets.\nUh but once you have a tokenized stock that also becomes a crypto asset.\nSo down the line is there on the road map per futures as you announced for crypto but for tokenized stocks.\nThat's a good question.\nUm I think the intent is the the technology that we've built here is incredibly general and it can be used to power and tokenize pretty much anything.\nAnd actually you know private stocks and public stocks are quite different mechanically as assets.\nSo, you know, we'll we'll take customer demand.\nWe'll we'll probably have futures versions of crypto assets.\nI mean, we've listed a bunch of those in the US uh already with, you know, the the micro uh XRP and and ETH and Solana futures, which are sort of like Tradfi instruments of crypto products.\nAnd then with tokenization, it's crypto instruments that reflect Tradfi products.\nand we'll we'll just offer everything the customers want in a you know safe and compliant manner.\nThat that's that's the goal.\nMhm.\nThe crypto uh idea is that per are better than options.\nAnd so the crypto believer will say like oh well if it's a head-to-head competition between per options, people are going to use per every single time.\nIt's more intuitive.\nIt's more easy to think about.\nAnd so I would hope that as per becomes more understood by uh the audience, the consumer base, that per as a financial instrument would proliferate, you know, alongside the rise of tokenized equities, tokenized stocks.\nThat's my that's my attitude.\nI don't know if you have a comment on that or just or anything at all.\nYou know, I don't want to upset my uh my options or I I think they have their their unique use cases.\nI mean, there there's certain certain scenarios where an options trade might make sense and, you know, you could put together a multi-le strategy and benefit from sideways markets perhaps a little bit more easily than you could with a straight up perpetual future.\nYou could have, you know, iron condors or butterflies.\nUm, you know, these are things that our active traders are really uh experts in in in many cases.\nSo, you know, if if if there's a demand for those products, we have the capability of adding them as well.\nAnd with the access for the United States markets, which I'm sure, you know, plenty of United States viewers watching this and also watching the announcement, I'm sure just chomping at the bit to get their hands on pers on side of Robinhood or tokenized stocks on side of Robinhood.\nI know you guys are barred by the CFTC.\nYou guys need the CFTC to give yourselves a thumbs up.\nUh, Coinbase, I'm sure, is also waiting for that same regulatory green light to launch these tokenized stocks for their retail base.\nUh, are you in conversations with the CFTC?\nAre we at the beginning of this conversation?\nKind of where are we for US citizens getting their hands on these things?\nYeah, I mean, it's it's our belief that tokenized stocks in the US will end up being governed by the the SEC, regulated by the SEC.\nMaybe that was the perpetuals conversation.\nPardon me.\nYeah, the perpetuals uh the perpetuals would would be governed by the CFTC.\nAnd when it comes to stocks, um I I think there's openness from the SEC, the crypto task force who we've been we have been having meetings with.\nUh you know, Johan, our crypto GM was in Washington a couple of weeks ago on the tokenization roundt which was hosted by the crypto task force.\nAnd yeah, I it's our belief actually that this can be done by the SEC alone without the need for uh additional rulem by Congress and they seem open to it.\nUm I I think in the in the US in particular, we want to make sure any product we roll out is like fully compliant and the regulators are on board uh every step along the way.\nuh in particular because our offerings in the US are so good already.\nI mean, we've got 245 trading of a huge universe of stocks.\nIt's very easy to use with Robinhood.\nSo, I mean, you you would get weekends and holidays, which are nice.\nUm, but we we want to make sure that it's uh very very good and and a and an amazingly compliant product.\nAnd we we think we can get there.\nWe have the technology.\nWe think we can get there uh relatively soon.\nCertainly.\nSo, Robinhood has become a leading crypto platform for its retail user base largely because you guys have so much\n\n\nDistribution. Your pre-crypto products previously have lagged other competitors, whereas like Coinbase has more assets on their platform. They had their wallet before Robinhood had the wallet. And so, when Robinhood would release a product, it would generally be somewhere between 6 to 12 months behind a Coinbase product because Coinbase is cryptospecific, is cryptonative. Robinhood, you have plenty of trady activity that you also need to maintain. But on this, uh, what the announcements here today, some of them are products that Coinbase just announced just a few weeks ago. And with many of the onchain stocks, that's actually leapfrogging Coinbase. They kind of beat them to a punch on a number of the things. So, is this Robinhood becoming a leading cryptonative company? I know 30% of your revenue already comes from crypto. Uh, and so, where do you think your relationship with crypto grows? Are you investing even further into this industry? Are you guys trying to go and and take down Coinbase? What do you think?\n Yeah, it's an interesting question. Um, I'd say traditionally, you're right. Our approach to building products and rolling out features has sometimes been described as Apple-like in the sense that Apple really use it. It's usually not the first to market, not like the bleeding edge innovator, but they sort of like focus on the user experience and the design and the product quality and make it very, very accessible. And I, I think that's been a good analogy. Um, I mean, we, I, I think when you bring up the wallet as an example, like our, our wallet wasn't the first to market, but I think it was the first to market in an intuitive way that rolled out features like gasless swapping, which I think if you're a retail user and you expect this technology to go mass market, like thinking through the gas and the fees in a different currency is just very, very confusing. So, we felt like gasless swapping was important and I think we're actually one of the first to enable that.\n But you're also right that, you know, now we're kind of pushing the frontier and I think we are, uh, the first big platform or at least among the first to roll out these tokenized offerings and with the private company stock tokens definitely on the bleeding edge. So, it's a new place for us to be in. We're, we're usually used to, you know, coming in later into a market, um, taking share through just like price competition, efficiency, sort of a war of attrition. Uh, and and now being first, but bringing that capability of lower pricing, great technology, uh, it's, it's fun. So, we'll, we'll see how it goes.\n Last question, Vlad, and I know you have to hop to another interview. Uh, the the Layer 2, the Robinhood chain. Yeah. Uh, talk to me about what the the long-term relationship is between the Robinhood app and the Robinhood chain. Uh, and I think you know listeners and myself, our frames of knowledge are going to come from the relationship between Coinbase and Base, where Base is actually a pretty big universe in of itself. And then Coinbase also uses Base to get Bitcoin back to loans and they offer that straight through the front end. Uh, is this kind of something that you're trying to do similarly with Robinhood, where you have it's a developer ecosystem. Developers can build permissionlessly on the Robinhood chain, or are you more using it just to settle backend logic for your own needs and your own, um, your own simplicity? How do you think about the long-term relationship between Robinhood and its own Layer 2?\n Yeah, and and by the way, I think the team over at Base, uh, it's a good team. I think they've done a very, very nice job. Um, and they're, they're pushing the sort of like Base is for everyone campaign, which, which I think has been relatively effective. I think our niche in this space, um, is it, it's maybe not going to be useful for everyone and every use case, but what we intend to do is make it the best chain for real-world assets. I think real-world assets have very specific needs and and qualities and making this the best chain for real-world assets starting with stocks going into private company shares. Um, you know, we mentioned real estate and art and those things are very, very interesting to me as well. And combining that with, uh, the lowest possible fees and really, uh, I like to call it, you know, we're trying to build like military robustness. Um, I think that's going to be exciting and, um, I do think that that's going to be an interesting proposition that should attract some developers. We talked to a lot of folks building chains and the value prop that I hear a lot of is, you know, this is the number one chain for Dgens. I probably, I probably met like seven or eight Degen chain builders. Um, and we're, we're trying to go in the opposite direction. We wanted to be, uh, the number one chain for real-world assets and for it to sort of confer fundamental utility to all participants.\n Cool. Well, Vlad, I can say I'm, I'm excited for what you guys have announced. I'm pretty optimistic for what you guys can do and it, uh, help, it's nice to see another big company helping the world move on chain. So, we appreciate it.\n Thank you. Yeah. Uh, thank you for, uh, joining us here and and helping, uh, be part of the journey. I do have to ask, last time we had you on the show, we talked about tokenization of equities and you talked about the private markets and and and all that and I, I wrote this article on Bankless the next day saying Vlad wants to tokenize SpaceX and OpenAI on. So these plans have been in the works for a while or when did that idea come about?\n Uh, let's see. Well, I, I talked about SpaceX and OpenAI in the Op-Ed. Uh, and what I found is if, uh, you write about stuff often enough, uh, sometimes it ends up happening. So, you manifested it.\n Yeah. I'd like to think so. Um, and of course it, it's really nice to see that a lot of competitors have been like jumping on and trying to do this stuff, too, which, which I think would be good. I think, uh, I'm, I'm here for the future when everything is onchain and we move beyond Bitcoin and memecoins into a place where Crypto is actually very, very useful and it confers fundamental utility to participants and I, I think that's going to be exciting and the time has come. I think, I think it's this year. Vlad, congrats and thanks for coming on the show.\n Thank you so much.\n Cheers.

Uh, I think people are a little bit less familiar with Johan. Uh, tell us a little bit about yourself. What's your role in the whole, uh, Robinhood universe?\n Yeah, so I lead the crypto business at Robinhood. Um, so everything that is related to crypto usually goes around my team and you know, we are really excited to have launched all these products today. Um, I initially joined Robinhood a bit more than four years ago as a CTO for the crypto group and I've been running the business for a few years now.\n Mhm. And so all of the big decisions that happen in the crypto universe of Robinhood, the Bitstamp acquisition, the Robinhood wallet, all of this is over under your oversight.\n Yes, that would be right. So my team and I, you know, we work very hard on all this, uh, announcement on this project and this acquisition and so we are, we're really excited to see, you know, the enthusiasm from, uh, from people here.\n So the acquisition of Bitstamp was a pretty big deal. Before that there was the Robinhood wallet. Before that there was just, you know, you could buy select crypto assets on Robinhood. There's been certainly a crescendoing of activity on the crypto side of things from Robinhood. Uh, just talk a little bit about Robinhood's long arc with crypto. It seems to be growing. It seems to be like crescendoing in excitement. Uh, talk about that arc and where we are today.\n Yeah, so you know, we launched crypto in 2018 to your point with just a few assets and then we started to add more assets. We started to add functionality like transferring the Robin wallet, which was our self-custody wallet.\n Um, and slowly we, you know, really build on this vision that crypto and blockchain technology can be the backbone of the financial system of tomorrow. And really what this event is about is how will we rebuild Robinhood using blockchain technology. And you know, in the EU, we're actually almost all in blockchain technology. So now, uh, EU customers can actually trade crypto, st crypto, but they can also do perpetual, um, on two assets and they can also do stock tokens to get exposure to US stocks and ETF. And so I think that's what's really exciting for me. You know, I joined Robinhood because I wanted to bring this mass adoption and stop talking just about the technical and the protocols and actually giving tools that people can use every day and use blockchain.\n So, PERPS is one of the big announcements that you guys had, uh, this, uh, today. And PERPS is a financial instrument that was created in the crypto universe, but isn't inherently crypto by any means. It's just a neutral financial instrument. Uh, in theory that could have gone into the regular Robinhood app for regular tokeniz or non-tokenized assets, normal equities. Uh, but instead it is first being primarily introduced in the crypto context of which it's native. Um, so that's under your domain. Talk about that choice to keep it inside of the crypto context when it could have also been applied to like more normal financial instruments, uh, in the rest of Robinhood. Yeah, I mean, I think you know, there is, uh, a few issues on, you know, the CFTC side and for example, pers are not necessarily, uh, something that exists in the US today. Um, you can do like long-dated contracts, but it's, it's not something that really is a perpetual that roll over, uh, indefinitely. And so in the in the EU, we received our license, our MIDI license and our MI license. So we are able to actually bring perpetuals. Um, and it's something that is really exciting because, uh, you know, a lot of what we were saying on stage was about how complicated it is to to use SPS on different platform. Um, and you can very hardly do it on a phone. You know, you, you always have to update your, your take profit, your stop loss. You want to make sure that you know, you're not going to, uh, lose too much money or take too much risk. And so you're always having to kind of stay at a desktop to to use it. And so what we wanted to build on on Robin was really an interface that you can use on a on a on-go basis basically and just with a swipe of a finger being able to update your position and your strategy and make sure that you don't take too many risk.\n Do you see the per instrument, uh, spreading further and more in integrated into the rest of Robinhood or is it kind of you'll follow the demand, we'll see how it is adopted. Uh, how, how do you see it expanding? Yeah, I think you know, there's two aspects for the purps. There is the retail, um, there's also the institutional aspect. Uh, so the the back end that we're using for per is Bitstamp and that, um, exchange is actually open to institution. So we expect to see institution also coming to that.\n Um, but we also announced stock tokens today that are like token, uh, that gives you exposure to US stocks, US ETF. In a world where you have crypto tokens and per combined together, you could see a world where you can, uh, you know, have per tok to tokenized asset basically.\n Let's talk about, uh, the the chain because I think that's a very one of the most exciting announcements that we've seen out of today. Uh, but there was also a choice that was made. Uh, I believe, I, I'm fuzzy on the details, but I understand that there was also a potential deal, some sort of deal with Solana about some interest in working with Solana. Maybe that deal is still open. I don't know. But in the what we heard from today out of Robinhood was the launch of a Layer 2 on the Arbitrum Orbit tech stack. So talk to us about that choice, that strategy. Why was that the right strategy for Robinhood?\n Well, you know, there was a few things. Uh, we, we talked to a lot of chains. So you know, when the rumor started, it was just about the fact that we were talking to to chains and for us, we wanted to understand like, do we want\n\n\nTo use an existing permissionless chain, or do we want to build something that is custom for us? And really, when we started to look at the complexity of what we're trying to build and all the ambition that we have around stock tokens and bringing the financial system on-chain, we felt like having a chain was giving us a lot more optionality. We are able to build the right regulatory requirements on the chain and also making sure that, you know, it can scale with us. And why Arbitrum? You know, for us, there were a few things. We really like the fact that the way that you can use Stylus, which is a system that basically allows you to use any kind of code, so you don't have to be stuck with one type of code, but you can actually bring like Rust, C++, whatever you want. And so that's very helpful if you're thinking about the long term and the type of products that we want to build. The second thing that we liked was the priority queue system that is nonpredatory, and also, you know, we've been a good partner with Arbitrum for a long time. We've partnered a few times on the wallet, and we overall expect to be a good partner with every chain. So, you mentioned Solana. We, um, you know, we offer, like, for example, no fees on the wallet on Solana if you're a gold customer. We also offer staking on Solana on multiple platforms. So we want to be good partners with everybody.\n\nOkay. So just to trace over what I heard you say, the main reason why the Arbitrum Layer 2 was selected was one, the customizability, and also, to the reading between the lines, the me control, as in, if you guys run the sequencer, you know, me is a very legally dubious topic, and if you outsource that to external parties, and all of a sudden there's a little bit, um, you know, outside of your control. So if you have a single sequencer, which I would imagine Robinhood is going to run, you guys just can make sure that there is no things like front running, back running, things that would otherwise be illegal in a traditional context because you guys are operating the chain. So customizability and control, is that kind of the two key features here?\n\nYeah, some of the future, you know, there was also the interoperability between multiple ecosystems, Ethereum being a big one, you know, there's many on EVM. So we were really excited about that, but yeah, I think I think you're right. I think the idea of having just one sequencer is not necessarily true. Like, you know, I think at some point we will want to bring a decentralization, and I think using the Arbitrum stack is helpful for that. But, you know, I I think you're right. We want to make sure that we can control the products that we are going to launch at the beginning, but also build tools that are kind of the platform for everyone else to build on top of it and use the technology that we are creating today.\n\nLet's lean into that interoperability word. If you say that you are interested in interoperability right after you talk about an announcement of tokenized stocks, I get images of these tokenized stocks moving beyond Robinhood chain. Is that an explicit part of the plan? What talk about that future?\n\nYeah, absolutely. You know, I think for us, the idea of tokenized assets has been that we are removing them from the walled garden, and so you can transfer them between brokers, you can do a lot more things with it. Maybe, you know, you can use all the things that you're thinking about DeFi and and assets. And so for us, we know that, you know, people want to move to a different chain or they want to move to a different platform, and I think it's part of the DNA, but if we want that product to be really successful, we don't want to recreate another traditional finance system, so definitely.\n\nSo are the stock tokens, are they whitelisted, or what are the transferability like conditions that are built into the token contract of the Robinhood stock tokens?\n\nYeah, so right, what we announced today for the launch, we're going to just allow it within the Robinhood app, and we're going to open self-custody pretty soon. You saw it during the demo. We we try to transfer from our self-custody wallet to the Robinhood app. And so we are kind of ready to go. We just want to make sure that, you know, the product is working well before we we open the gate.\n\nOkay. So, are there, is there a whitelist contract, as in, if I say, say, uh, I'm a I have a Robinhood account, or or excuse me, an Arbitrum wallet, and I send my equity tokens to my wallet, can I send it to a friend who has another Arbitrum wallet, or would they have to also be a part of the Robinhood KYC universe?\n\nYeah, in the future, we would want everyone to be able to transfer between each other. I think where, you know, the mint and burning will be where you will need to be either a Robinhood customer, or you will be have to be a customer of somebody that is compatible with Ostack.\n\nOkay, cool. It makes sense that you guys have chosen Arbitrum. I was talking to AJ about this, uh, because Arbitrum is so inherently DeFi focused. So, you know, it's one thing to be able to buy and hold tokenized equities, you know, private companies especially, but it's another thing to be able to compose those into a broader DeFi ecosystem, which, you know, Arbitrum definitely has. Uh, and so are you envisioning a world where, you know, there's an implementation on the on the Arbitrum layer Layer 2, or you know, there's a Uniswap, so you could, you see these tokens being interoperable with the existing DeFi Arbitrum ecosystem?\n\nI mean, that's a goal, you know, like I think we we want in the future to be able to do all of this. I think it's going to be hard for me to tell you, like, is it going to be Havage, is it going to be a Moru, or something else, but we want to make it compatible, and that's why we we picked kind of an EVM-based solution for for layer. Otherwise, you know, we could have done our own Layer 1, or we could have kept it on a non-permissionless chain, it would have been a lot faster and easier.\n\nSo, but there's also nothing inherently stopping you guys from issuing these tokens on Solana in the future, right? If there's demand there, could you also see yourselves tokenize these these across many chains?\n\nI I think bridging is going to be part of the strategy overall, you know, like I think again, we want everyone to be able to use it, and so for that, I think you you need to be able to give access to everybody, and you won't be able to do that if you limit yourself to just one chain.\n\nMhm. So when I I was listening to Vlad talk about with the whiteboard session, he talked about all the different components of the Robinhood world, especially as it was kind came to, you know, issuing these tokens and then also having them trade on Bitstamp when, you know, the tw the very constrained traditional markets are are only alive, you know, so many hours of the week, but now Bitstamp can trade them 24/7. And then you also have the Robinhood wallet as well. There's a very tightly integrated ecosystem of components that are being woven together there. Was that your was that your mastermind? Is that your your strategy?\n\nWell, I I don't know about that. I think, you know, we have a very big team with a lot of talented people. So, um, but I think for us, that was kind of the idea. The exchange, when we acquired Bitstamp, was this idea of not being only reliant on Market Maker, but being able to support some of the new products we were thinking of, like tokenized assets. Um, and the Robinhood wallet is also something that, you know, four four years ago when we were starting to build it, the idea was really to think about the DeFi world and think about the fact that at some point people may not want to use a centralized platform. And so it's great to see everything going together. Um, and you know, we we we hope to keep going like this, and there is a lot more plans that we we are we have shared also on the pirate stock, for example, uh, that is going to really get together nicely in this ecosystem.\n\nMhm. The spawning a brand new chain is, you know, a pretty big undertaking. You know, it's one thing to use your own chain to deploy your own assets and to do the backend things that Robinhood needs to do, which I mean, I think we're all very happy about, that's what blockchains are for. That's one of the big bull cases. But there's also the conversation of, well, the Robinhood chain is also going to be permissionless as well for developers and users. So that means that any old developer can come and do things on Robinhood chain. Is that a specific vertical that you are trying to foster?\n\nYeah, we are really excited about that. I think, you know, we we call all the developers that want to be working on the hood chain, that want to talk to Robinhood about this, like it's something that we we want to do, and we think that will happen. Um, for us, it's the, you know, the big long-term vision is that everybody can use these stock tokens, everybody can build on it, and you can see more type of real-world assets, and so for that, we will need a lot of developers because as uh, you know, important revenue is, and with a great team that we have, we can build the entire DeFi world. There's so many things being innovating every day, and so we think that it's all coming together.\n\nSo Robinhood, about 30% of Robinhood revenue comes from Crypto products, which I think if you told that to the average Robinhood shareholder or just the average person in in traditional finance, they might be shocked about how high that number is. Uh, do you where do you see the trend of that number going, because Robinhood also has a bunch of uh, Trady products. They just launched Robinhood banking. They just launched Robinhood strategies. So it's not like neglecting by any means its trad. But also some of these announcements are pretty amazing. So where do you see this 30% uh crypto revenue going in Robinhood? Do you see that increasing, staying the same?\n\nYou know, I think it's hard to say, like, if you think about last year, we had so many great products on Robinhood, not just on the crypto side, but uh, you know, event contract, futures, like so many new things, and so I think it's just the business as a whole has been growing, and so that's been what's really exciting. But I think for us, what we've been mostly focused on is less about the, you know, the share internally of what is a Robinhood crypto doing versus the other businesses, but more like what market share we're able to get outside of Robinhood. Um, and you know, we've been able to grow our market share nicely in the past few quarters. And I think that's really a good signal that we are building what our customers are really excited about.\n\nMhm. Let's fast forward 5 years, 10 years, and everything that you want about your on on the crypto side of Robinhood comes true. Paint us a picture of what that looks like. You have the Robinhood app, you have the Robinhood chain, you have the Bitstamp exchange, you have these tokenized equities, tokenized private companies. There's a big there's a good number of puz puzzle pieces here. When all of these puzzle pieces that we know of come together and maybe some additional ones that we don't know of, what does that picture look like?\n\nWell, I I think, you know, for us, uh, we've been not really keeping a lot of secrets, like we want to make Robinhood available everywhere in the world. So that's one big thing. We have a wallet that is available in a lot of countries, but we also want to bring the entire Robinhood stack, like stocks and futures, options, all these things. Um, and the next thing also will be like, we want a lot more of the traditional system to be on chain. So ideally for me, in a in a few years, is you use the same revenues that you are using today as a US customer, and most of it is is using on-chain. It's a lot faster. It's instant. It's 24/7, and you don't even know it because you don't need to know all the details about the protocol.\n\nDo you think you guys can dethrone the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange as the centerpiece of liquidity in the future?\n\nWell, I I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see how the the market responds to to this type of uh asset that are being tokenized. Uh, but is it is going to create a lot of opportunity, like, you know, during market, during weekends, uh, off-market hours, all these things, like you will start to see a lot more people trading these assets.\n\nMhm. Will there be a token for the Robinhood chain?\n\nUh, currently nothing to announce there. I think, you know, right now for us, the focus is to launch some of his new products and see how people are using it, and then we'll share more detail on that later.\n\nJohn, you've gotten a lot of uh people excited today, including myself. So thank you for all the hard work that you've been putting in, and I think we'll be watching Robinhood with pretty good interest.\n\nThank you for having me.

I'm really excited to be partnering with Robinhood on this. I'm really excited about their vision, particularly about sort of reconstructing their platform for their users with Crypto rails. And yeah, it's an incredible day. I'm sure we'll get into it, but yeah, it feels kind of surreal in the moment.\n\nThe Arbitrum Robinhood partnership goes back pretty far, like two plus years. I don't know what the partnership looked like way back when. Maybe it was just an initial deal, but it's certainly crescendoed over the years to where we are today where we are seeing Robinhood do something very innovative, which is launch stocks that are not trading on Robert with a little Arbitrum logo right there. Talk about the crescendoing of the Robinhood Arbitrum relationship.\n\nYeah. No, it's been really cool. So I remember, I think it was ETH Denver 2024. We announced sort of like the beginning of our partnership together, and it started with like a really simple, like Robinhood's going to support Arbitrum in their Crypto wallet, easy access for users to trade on Dexes, and sort of do other activities through that wallet experience. But we sort of started like laying the building blocks for a deeper, closer relationship. Our teams got close. Joe and I in particular, you know, sort of fostered a great working relationship, and our thesis with them has always been like, be good partners. You know, for us, we don't have this vision that Crypto needs to be at the forefront or that Arbitrum needs to be at the forefront. We're a powerful technology that can power user experiences, and for us, Robinhood sort of and its place in fintech was always the best partner. So we, you know, we developed this relationship and obviously crescendoed into where we're at today. But the same like elements and thematic components of these guys are the best at building user experiences, and we want our technology to be able to be flexible enough to be supportive of their vision to make their users happy.\n\nSo I would imagine that there is not one longstanding Arbitrum Robinhood deal. There's one deal at a time, and every single new thing that you guys do together has to be done on, is this right for both of us? Do we like working together? So every single deal has to be one, right?\n\nYeah. I think in many ways, like, you know, I think one of the core things that's really important for businesses that are moving as quickly as sort of both our business and their business is like flexibility to make sure that the products are right. Like, for example, today they announced like Solana staking as well, and that's a great thing for their business. They're bringing that utility to their users. I would say Tokenized Stocks was always like the main prize that we were after, right? Obviously, you know, I joined Crypto in 2014, and for me it was about ownership, sovereignty, and democratizing access, and there's nothing that does that more than just the tokenized access to everything. And as Vlad mentioned in phase three, the goal is for that to be, you know, self-custody, do with it what you want. And like that vision is incredible. Well, so that was always I would say like the the north star of what we were hoping to collaborate on. And obviously that's where we're at today. And we're starting with them on Arbitrum 1.\n\nSo like today, for example, the demos that they did, those assets are all minting and burning on Arbitrum 1 and trading. Eventually they're going to be transitioning to the Robinhood chain, which the Arbitrum Orbit Stack is going to power. And I think that's one of the really cool things and one of the things that excited them about Arbitrum is the flexibility of what we can offer as a platform, right? We have Arbitrum 1 as a core economic hub of, you know, Crypto and financial activity and also the ability for them to take a stack and own it, own the customizations of it, whatever they want to do with it, and our team is going to be, you know, a strong partner in product design for what is the best product for their users, and there's a lot of people reasons why people talk about wanting their own chain, but the ability for them to continue to compound their users on the Robinhood chain is going to be a very powerful thing as they build their entire company again on Crypto rails. So again, like that flexibility of what Arbitrum can offer, I think is something that was a key component of this because the Arbitrum platform offers the flexibility that they might need in order to continue to build their business on chain.\n\nNow I think people are pretty familiar with the deal structure of Base and the Optimism collective. It's something like 15% of Base sequencer fees or 2.5% of total profit, whichever one's greater, goes to the Optimism collective, and that's kind of the deal of the Optimism collective. Then that's kind of like kind of set the standard for the OP stack ecosystem. If you are willing to share, what are the economics of the Robinhood chain?\n\nArbitrum has a similar model with the Dow. It's a little bit different, but it's similar in the sense that if you want to launch an L2, which is what Robinhood is choosing to do, then you do a 10% profit share as well with the over DAO. So, it's a very similar model. I would say the differences in model are maybe some of the philosophical differences between Super Chain and Orbit. So, Super Chain you kind of opt into like a shared governance model with interoperability. With Orbit, it's, you know, just sort of contribute back into the Arbitrum Dow on the profit share through what we call the AE, and then do whatever you want with it. Right. We expect there to be interoperability, but it's almost like an orthogonal product question to use of the stack. And because we're not sort of locked in on orbit into specific interoperability and governance mechanisms, we can have a lot more flexibility in design of the stack. So that's why you sometimes see Arbitrum, like you see L3s, you see L2s, you see custom gas tokens, you see all these different changes because the orbit stack provides a lot more flexibility, and that was something that was like really important to Robinhood on this journey was to make sure that they had that flexibility with the stack to own it. So like they don't have to opt into shared governance or interoperability. They can if they want to. My suspicion is they won't prefer to, but yeah, that's that's how the orbit stack structure works.\n\nYeah. So, it was pretty cool to see the Arbitrum logo right next to the OpenAI, you know, transfer 1 million shares of OpenAI in the Robinhood app that everyone's familiar with. And you see the little Arbitrum logo. Yeah.\n\nAs you alluded to and as they said, you know, it starts on Arbitrum 1 that it'll migrate over to the Robinhood chain when that thing is, you know, up and running. But also at the same time, Arbitrum 1 already has, you know, fantastic DeFi infrastructure, which the Robinhood chain will have to start from scratch on. I don't know if they're going to leave the option to do tokenized stocks on Robinhood Arbitrum 1 persistently. Will that always be an option?\n\nSo, it's a great question. It's really going to be up to them. I mean, the reason to do it is it's another environment where they can sort of integrate that already have been integrated, so they don't have to like uproot some of the existing established relationships that they might have on Arbitrum. The reason not to do it is fragmentation potentially of liquidity. So that's probably going to be a key product question that we're going to work on with their team over time. But you know, I guess you said Arbitrum 1 has a really robust DeFi ecosystem. I'm sure a lot of our builders are going to want to work with them on the Robinhood chain as well, which is great and something that again we encourage and support. I think that's probably like we don't know yet. We'll figure that out. Sort of remember, like on phase one, these assets aren't integrated yet into DeFi, right? So it's still more of a self-contained box. So today if they migrated, they wouldn't have some of these sort of liquidity fragmentation concerns. It would probably just be some sort of mint and burn mechanism. But it probably depends on how mature and engrossed or if there's demand for it.\n\nSure. Sure. You could just imagine that like there's a ton of potential TVL up for grabs. Yes. And you know, if there's some inherent interoperability inside of the Arbitrum stack, maybe I don't know, I can take my Robinhood tokenized stock and take it into GMX or Aside of Arbitrum 1. But that would necessitate transferability of these tokens. Now you are not on the Robinhood team, so I don't know if you're privy to these details of the transferability of the Robinhood stock tokens. Do you know anything there?\n\nUm, so yeah, I don't want to speak for them. I think what Vlad was referring to is in the later phases that that isn't very much their intention. Like they want self-sovereignty, like so for example, when you saw Vlad do that live demo transfer.\n\nMhm.\n\nThat was self-custody, right? That was not in the contained environment, like he linked out to Arbiscan, he sent it to somebody else's wallet. So the infrastructure is already there as they clearly showed, and I think what they're going to be planning on is I think figuring out the roll out, like this is an extremely ambitious thing that they did today, like I think they made more announcements today than you typically see from companies in like a two or three year timeline, like really incredible across so many different components. But I think like again, and this is sort of goes back to what I was saying about like what I really find so exciting about this. They're really focused on Crypto rails for their existing user base and they're going to focus on the product that will make sense for that user experience. Like when they were talking about the pers, they said you can do this like two or three taps of the finger. And like that's why I love working with this team where instead of saying how do we get Crypto users to do more stuff on chain, it's how do we get more people who are regular financial traders to be actually just using Crypto rails. And again, I think Robinhood is best positioned to be able to do that, and we're extremely excited to work so closely with them.\n\nI think when people are digesting this news, they're just going to see the take that Robinhood has a chain now, and they're going to look at the correlates between Robinhood and Coinbase and be like, \"Oh, Robinhood has their equivalent of Base.\" And people are also going to look towards Arbitrum as well and and compare that to Optimism and the OP Sack. It's like, oh, Arbitrum has its equivalent of Base now with with Robinhood. But maybe you could also kind of continue that conversation and get into the nuances of the difference. How is it the same and how is it different?\n\nYeah, so I think it's so I I think it's the same obviously in that like we have a huge user base that's using the stack sort of exogenous to the sort of DAO governed chain. And the reality is is that as we see like Worldcoin, you know, Athena, and Securitize are building converge also using the Arbitrum orbit stack, there's plenty of demand for people to have their own chains, and that's really one of Ethereum's killer features is the flexibility and customization for that to happen. I think that there's two distinctions I would say sort of between the Arbitrum Robinhood relationship is two is like Robinhood, they have Crypto users, but their core user base is not Crypto. So the overlap between maybe, you know, Arbitrum 1 users and the people who are going to be the first users of the Robinhood chain are definitionally probably going to be different. There's of course going to be onchain activity happening from Crypto natives on the Robinhood chain as well, I'm sure, but it's an additive user base.\n\nM.\n\nThe second difference is, you know, I think especially with the expansion of time, like I think Coinbase and Optimus was probably a couple years ago, Arbitrum 1 is very entrenched as, you know, I would argue the most credibly neutral liquid L2, right? Obviously Coinbase and Base is huge as Arbitrum 1 and Coinbase are probably neck and neck in terms of different metrics, but Arbitrum 1 has a very strong home if you're looking for a credibly neutral environment, and again, the way we've designed the Arbitrum path is if you want to launch an Arbitrum and migrate to your own chain, it's seamless, right? That's what we're doing with Robinhood. That's what we're sort of pioneering. And I expect that journey to continue to happen for more people. Launch an opportunity one, have a great experience, expand your user base, build yourself a mandate to be able to have your own chain, your own user base, and we're going to help work with you through that migration. So, that's probably a little bit of the difference, but you know, it's maybe a little more nuanced than some people might appreciate. I think this is going to keep people's attention focused on what exactly Robinhood is going to do onchain. How fast will the tokenized stocks come onchain? How fast will they spin up their own chain? What does Arbitrum growth look like, you know, downstream of all of this? How does Arbitrum keep this momentum going? What do you guys have next in the chamber to fire?\n\nYeah, it's a great question. It's hard to beat this one, but I think that for us, you know, we've have a very, very specific focus and thesis, which is we want to make sure our product can best serve our user base. And that user base is very broad, right? Like if you look at Arbitrum is probably most known for DeFi, both on Arbitrum 1 and also a lot of the chains that are launching using the stack, but also basically every\n\n\nGaming chain, for example, that launches uses Arbitrum One.\nAnd the reason for that is because, like, we've had really fast block times.\nSome might want to use Stylus because they might want to bring in, uh, traditional gaming libraries.\nSo our goal is still, like, find use cases that we have conviction in.\nAnd, you know, I would say the highest conviction today is probably this merge of TradFi and DeFi into what Stephen, our CEO, likes to just say, finance.\nLike, in 10 years, we're all just going to call it finance.\nUm, that's probably our strongest focus right now, both on Arbitrum One and also, um, across supporting ecosystems that want to launch their own chain and just finding more use cases, right?\nWe're very focused on, you know, traditional RWAs, lending, um, capital markets.\nYou know, I say Arbitrum doesn't do as well in the memecoin, um, craze as as as other ecosystems, and, you know, every ecosystem sort of has their different communities and cultures, but this has kind of been always our focus, and during DeFi bearer days, we probably went down with it, but, you know, as this is all coming back, I think Arbitrum's the excitement, the euphoria for the ecosystem is is coming back with it.\nYeah, there, there, I do like that sentiment of, like, you know, the OP mainnet are the governance philosophers, and the base chain are like consumer crypto in and crypto culture, and, like, Arbitrum has always been DeFi and execution optimized, and so it makes sense that that's what Robinhood chooses because that's what their core product offering is.\nThere's always, there's been a, there's a strong alignment between those two brands.\nYeah, 100%.\nI think that people like to say, like, crypto and, like, TradFi or Fintech are that different.\nI don't think they are.\nI think there's a lot of cultural similarities, a lot of cultural elements.\nAnd it really all comes down to relationships, teams, and obviously product.\nAnd yeah, we've been, I think, very focused.\nI think we've had a very product focused.\nI remember, you know, everyone talks about fast block times now.\nIt's like the new hot thing, right?\nArbitron had sub 250 millisecond blocks time since 2021, right?\nAnd, like, for us, that was something we identified really early as going to be a critical thing to expand use cases.\nAnd that's why Arbitrum did so well with pers as they sort of expanded off of Ethereum mainnet with, you know, GMX, Vertex, and others.\nAnd I think Stylus, which is not as popular today, is going to be that sort of next unlock, just so in case your your your listeners aren't aware, Arbitrum is an EVM compatible chain, but Stylus enables you to launch contracts in Rust, C++, fully interoperable, so we're seeing a lot of teams now that, like, you know, fintech is meeting crypto, privacy, and privacy layers are really important on top of, and Stylus enables you to have, like, privacy optimized because you can just pull in cryptographic libraries, like, super cheap, right?\nSo, we try and stay ahead of the ball in terms of what we think are the features that our users and developers are going to want and, um, and execute on that thesis.\nI do see privacy becoming a increasingly important and discussed.\nIt's starting to crescendo as a topic, uh, especially as Trifi comes on and realizes, like, oh no, all of my assets are totally transparent to to everyone.\nUh, and so it's it's good to see that there is a potential path for lots of the Arbitrum stack to also access some of the privacy that we really need.\n100%.\nWe have, like, for example, there's a team, like, when they launched on day one with Stylus called Renegade Finance, and it's essentially onchain darkpools, and it's the coolest thing, and I think they have, like, more than 30 ZK proofs generated on each transaction, and again, they're doing it on Arbitrum.\nIt's a super cheap transaction because again, they're utilizing Silus.\nWe extended the EVM.\nWe we recognized early the EVM is the huge mode of the Ethereum ecosystem, but we can do more, and that's like what the flexibility of L2s offers without compromising on the EVM.\nAnd we thought that, you know, Stylus is a great a great combination there.\nCool.\nAJ, congratulations.\nIt's been a very big day.\nCongratulations.\nAwesome.\nThank you.\nCheers.\n[Music]\n",
