  "cleanText": "Bankless Nation, welcome to our monthly crypto fundamentals podcast.\nWe got a few topics to discuss today.\nAre we forever stuck at like 107k Bitcoin, 2500 ETH, and 150 Solana?\nFeels like we've been in this zone forever.\nWe're going to talk about that.\nAlso, are alts the most hated asset right now?\nAnd if that's the case, are we actually going to get an alt rally?\nMaybe a hate rally?\nAnd uh where approximately are we in the cycle?\nFeels like some summertime blues maybe.\nAnd when the bull market comes, will it actually come to our cryptonative assets or is it all going to stocks that none of us own?\nWe've got Michael Nadeau here.\nMike, how you doing?\nAre you feeling bullish?\nAre you feeling bearish?\nHey Ryan, great to be here.\nUh I am feeling bullish.\nUm I think we are in an interesting spot in the markets right now.\nYou know, Bitcoin, it sort of feels to me like Bitcoin is like a beach ball uh that's trying to be held under the water uh right now and I think you know we've been trading in this range now for uh going on 7 months you know 7, 8 months so that is like a very interesting setup in terms of just like we've chopped up the markets a little bit feels like Bitcoin is somewhat of a coiled spring uh but it's still not breaking out at the same time we are in this sort of summer months where there's there tends to be a little bit less uh volume a little bit less interest people are taking vacations.\nWe have holidays next or this week.\nUm so like really near-term is I think like kind of up in the air, but the the setup to me looks very good and looking forward to getting into that uh in this episode.\nSo guys, these episodes Mike and I get into the onchain data.\nSo the analytics, this is a crypto fundamentals uh podcast and we're doing this monthly usually the first Tuesday of every month.\nThis is coming out on Wednesday because we had some special Robin Hood things to cover that's in your podcast feed.\nThe idea is we're trying to figure all of these things out in about 45 minutes.\nWe're going to get you a few major investment ideas backed by this onchain data.\nAnd at the end of the episode, Mike is going to make some calls on some assets.\nOkay?\nSo, we're going to peek into Mike's portfolio.\nI'm going to ask him what he's buying, what he's selling, how his positions have moved between this episode and last episode.\nSo, all of that we're going to cover today.\nMike, I just want to tee up with this.\nThis was an article I actually like read uh prior to this episode.\nI read earlier this morning.\nAnd here's kind of the title.\nThe Hodler's fallacy.\nRethinking conviction in a naturally extractive market.\nOkay, that's the title of the article.\nAnd basically the thesis is none of this crypto asset stuff is investable.\nYou can't really hold it long term.\nThe exception may be of Bitcoin, but the author says the the hodler's fallacy is the belief that in time uh the market leads to long-term upside, but this article impacts why crypto rewards execution, not conviction.\nCrypto is pure arbitrage, masquerading as an investment market.\nI feel like this sets the tone for how a lot of people are feeling right now, which is basically there's nothing investable in onchain assets aside from maybe Bitcoin.\nIt makes no sense to hold things for long-term uh horizon.\nYou're a fundamentals guy and I know part of your thesis is based on no there are investable assets in crypto that you can hold for years and hold for decades.\nWhat's your reaction to this kind of sentiment?\nMy reaction to this kind of sentiment is that uh we still are in a period in crypto where these markets are still, you know, largely unregulated.\nAnd I think, you know, as we sort of move through regulation, what what I expect to happen is sort of this bottoms up sort of movement amongst people like like The DeFi Report, others that are in the market that are trying to deeply understand how value acres to tokens, how it acrus through the through the tech stack.\nAnd through that process, like we are going to, I believe, force these projects to return value to tokens.\nAnd then that's where this narrative starts to to shift a little bit.\nBut I would say it's sort of fair to look at it right now and say like how could you uh hold an altcoin?\nLike how could you have a long-term thesis on a lot of these things when we still aren't at a place where you can hold the uni token which and we know UNISWAP has a fantastic protocol and it it does a lot of e economic activity but can you hold that token?\nDo you have confidence that the value is going to go to you as a token holder and not to the equity holders?\nAnd I think this is something that uh you know regulation will sus out and and these tokens will certainly uh I think be valuable in the future and we will be able to have these these more long-term thesis for for how how value is going to acrue to the token holder itself.\nSo you feel like some of this commentary is is uh captures where we are in the market but this is the process.\nThis is how we figure it out.\nWe're in this purgatory period now and we've got to figure out what the actual claim of these assets are on productive cash flows and other other fundamentals, right?\nThat's the work we're doing here essentially on this episode.\nThat's why we're here.\nImagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language.\nThat's MANTLE Banking, an all-in-one fiat and crypto account.\nIt lets you save, spend, and invest all from one dashboard.\nSwipe for coffee, stake me through yield, or even use virtual cards for payments through Apple Pay.\nSo, it feels web 2 simple yet stays web 3

for for how long, but it feels like we've been here for a while between 100k Bitcoin and 110K range.\nWhat are you seeing when you look at some of these charts?\nI know the first one you asked me to pull up was was this, which is a Bitcoin holder accumulation ratio?\nWhat are we looking at here?\nYeah, some some glass node data here.\nAnd you know, I'm looking at the a lot of onchain data and trying to pair up like why is Bitcoin just kind of not moving?\nIt's there's all these treasury companies out there um starting to buy up Bitcoin.\nS Michael Sailor and Strategy have purchased I think 4,000 BTC over the last few months.\nUm the the macro setup looks pretty good.\nLike there's enough of like a hint of like that that liquidity is going to be coming back.\nTrump won't stop talking about reducing the, you know, cutting the Fed funds rate so that we can, you know, refinance our debts.\nSo, you can kind of see that there's a, you know, a pretty interesting setup out there.\nAnd I'm trying to pair that up with what I'm seeing on chain.\nAnd what we're seeing right here is just the BTC holder accumulation ratio.\nAnd it's telling us that people that already hold Bitcoin, there's more people selling their Bitcoin of the current holder base than are accumulating right now.\nThat's that you look at the right side of the chart, the blue line there, that's the like 43% or so that are accumulating Bitcoin right now.\nUm, so we need to see like holders actually start to to accumulate.\nI think a lot of people are sort of holding uh expecting like another thrust here maybe into Q4.\nThis is showing you like the existing holders, right?\nSo if if existing holders are not going to step into the market, we need new money to come in.\nUm, and that's that's sort of like what that's telling me right now.\nUm, it's important to remember that this onchain data from Glass Node does not pick up the ETFs, which ETFs are holding roughly, you know, 6% or so of the supply, and it's also not picking up what's on exchanges.\nAnd I think when you add those two up, it's about 18%.\nyou know, so we factor that into this when we look at this data, but it's just telling us that like existing holders um were were actually like most bullish like in the beginning of last year uh actually.\nAnd so I think this explains a little bit of why price is just kind of ranging uh a little bit right now.\nOkay.\nSo this is telling the story because this is this has been down since what you said was the beginning of last year.\nAnd what do you want to see from this this blue line here that is the creeping down towards 40%?\nDo you want to start seeing it kind of like eb up?\nWhat would make you bullish in this indicator?\nYeah, I would expect that, you know, let's say, you know, Powell comes out and he we start to see like a little bit of a shift from like a more hawkish stance towards like it's becoming more clear uh that we're going to see rate cuts maybe um July.\nIt could it could take until September, but I think if the market starts to sniff that out, I think existing holders will will get back into the market and also, you know, new money will come back in and you'll see that line um shoot up a little bit.\nBut like I said at the beginning, we're we're in like the kind of summer months where there's not uh people are enjoying their lives a little bit more and less like glued to their glued to their screens, you know, buying crypto right now.\nSo you want to see this holders start to accumulate more.\nHere's another indicator which I think shows uh holder metrics.\nSo this is the number of addresses with a balance above 10,000 Bitcoin.\nThat's quite a hefty balance.\nSo is this kind of some some sort of a a whale indicator here?\nAnd we're we're seeing this this purple line here which uh seems to oscillate around the number 100.\nWhat are we looking at here?\nYeah.\nAnd yeah, exactly.\nMass these are the the hu the largest whales um in terms of the cohorts of like holders of Bitcoin.\nAnd this just also sort of explains why price is just having a tough time breaking out I think because this cohort is uh has been selling really over the last you know few years or so.\nSo you know they're scaling out.\nThis is not like a massive there's only when we started this uh cycle there were 120 you know holders of greater than 10,000 bitcoins.\nSo this is not\nOh it sounds like 120 addresses that have over 10,000 bitcoin.\nYou're tracking all these big whale addresses then.\nExactly.\nAnd that's down, you know, it's under 100 now.\nSo, so we've lost uh some of the, you know, largest holders are now under that threshold.\nSo, it just tells you like, okay, like, you know, we know the conditions look pretty bullish out there, but there are people that have been, if you own 10,000 BTC, you're probably in very early.\nAnd so, you still have some of that sort of sell pressure.\nPeople that are up, you know, tens of thousands of percentage on their Bitcoin are happy to sell, you know, 100 100k Bitcoin.\nSo, this is another indicator of uh that you're looking at kind of long-term holders.\nSo, this is uh Bitcoin long-term holder supply and you've got Bitcoin price in orange and then you have the long-term holder supply in purple here.\nSo, what are we looking at?\nWhat does this tell you?\nYeah, this is on sort of on the other side of this.\nSo, the first two charts are kind of telling me, okay, this makes a little sense of, you know, why we're seeing price just kind of rangebound.\nThis is a positive indicator to me.\nSo that that long-term holder um supply is now back to all-time highs.\nWe saw a dip in that.\nSo long-term holders were taking some profits um earlier earlier this year and we've seen basically that them step back into the market as buyers.\nIn some cases, that line will come up just if people came into the market, even even if they came into the market at the all-time highs um and they just didn't sell, they become long-term holders over a period.\nSo, it's it's it's it's sort of a reaction of that time and it's also um you know long-term holders adding to their their wallets.\nSo, that to me is this is very positive.\nThis is like 74% of the supply is now held by long-term holders.\nAnd that's usually a pretty good base um for like if we see speculation come back into the market, then you get the new money coming in, the short-term holders.\nSo, that's what I'm looking for.\nUm, you know, as we move through the summer months here.\nOkay.\nAnd then how about this one to round out the Bitcoin story here?\nLiquid supply.\nWhat's\n\n\nThis?\nSame idea. Uh, long-term hoes. This is bullish to me. So, uh, illquid supply is at an all-time high as well. And what this is doing, Glass Node is just basically um looking at all the wallets that have held Bitcoin and determining based on how much uh they're they're buying and selling, like, are these illiquid wallets? Um, and so it's kind of like looking at all the onchain data to tell us that, hey, like most of the supply looks like it's in strong, you know, diamond hands uh right now. And so again, that's another um that's another bullish indicator. And like when we see like big moves in Bitcoin, you do see that that line kind of oscillate down a little bit because people are moving their coins to exchanges to cash out. So um it feels like we were setting a very like strong base is kind of I think the key takeaway for some of this data.\nOkay. So, when you add all this together, you're seeing a strong base, maybe a pause in terms of long-term holder accumulation, but it's still pretty high and the long-term holders are still holding. And after all, that's what seems to drive Bitcoin price, right? It's just like more people holding it as a store of value asset over time uh and not selling. And then when you have that effect, you see Bitcoin price rise so long as you have net new sources of demand. Exactly. That that's it. And I think the market is uh waiting to see what what what Mr. Powell is going to do. Uh and who's going to win this this fight between, you know, Trump and Pal. And I think that's that's the final domino, I think, to go. Everything else looks pretty well set up to me.\nI know we'll get your insights in macro towards the end of this, but it does seem like pressure is mounting on on Powell or whoever his successor is. Yes. Right. Which could be like a real fact in the situation here. But let's turn to some of our other bags. So, if Bitcoin's in kind of a hold place, but you're expecting, you know, like uh further increase, further accumulation, price appreciation, what about altcoins?\nSo, I think last time we had this discussion of like when is alt season, what are you seeing in uh the metrics here? I know Bitcoin dominance is like creeping to all-time highs. Maybe like 20, was it 2020 where where it was really an all-time high into like the 70% uh type range, something like that. Um now we're we're in the 60s, mid-60% I feel like with Bitcoin dominance, something in that range, but you are showing a chart here which is the altcoin season index. Uh, and this oscillates between a band that says, you know, like more Bitcoin season versus, oh, in orange, it's Bitcoin season, I suppose, and then in kind of this blue hue, we're moving to altcoin season. We are squarely in orange in uh June uh like and July of 2025. Earlier in this year, it actually dipped into altcoin uh territory, at least according to this index. So, what do you see when you look at this chart? And like what even is this chart?\nYeah, the reason I like this one is it's it's giving you um a relative performance in terms of like the prices of altcoins versus Bitcoin. It's factoring in the market caps. It's factoring in trading volume uh of the large cap versus the altcoins. Uh and it also looks at social indicators as well. And so it's kind of giving you a broad view of sentiment on altcoins. And yeah, we're in Bitcoin zone right now. And what what I like to just I try to observe the market, like, so look at the data and then observe what you see on crypto Twitter and like most of the when you get into this this type of market structure, like the people start to think that like the alts are never coming back and and this is just a Bitcoin cycle and the the you know Bitcoiners were right and um so to me like that always there's always going to be like another rotation after that. And so my view is that altcoins are pretty hated right now. Sentiment very low on altcoins. Um I think there's a few things we could sort of look at to say like why that's the case. And uh some interesting an interesting data point came out with the Robin Hood partnership on with Arbitrum. Um just seeing Robin Hood, you know, move like 15% a day on that news, uh but not seeing the same reaction on on ETH or or you know some of the other like animal spirits that you might look for on chain. We haven't seen that, but we're seeing it uh almost you know from from trad\nseason is looking like it may be inspired by Wall Street this cycle. Uh we got a glimpse of that with Circle. Um, we got a glimpse of it again yesterday with Robin Hood. Coinbase has been doing very well as well of late. Um, and so, you know, this is something this is something to factor in. We have like I think nine uh altcoin ETFs coming uh this this summer. And so, you know, that could be the thing that sort of helps to kick off the actual sort of longer tale of crypto assets um outside of the equities itself. But but yeah, for me like you know I always want to be zigging uh when everyone else is zagging and I think that's this is one of those opportunities for for for select altcoins right now.\nSo you think there will be an altcoin season.\nI do. I, you know, not not the same way what we saw like in in '21, but I definitely think that um quality assets will outperform Bitcoin and I and I expect ETH to outperform Bitcoin, you know, for a period as well. So,\nyeah, it's interesting because like in '21, right, some of that uh altcoin energy, let's say, went into the NFT market and some of those NFTs, guys, like they're just not coming back. All right. So, but this brings like the whole question of when you say alts, what alts are you talking about? And I think I mentioned you last uh episode, I'm I'm I'm still haunted by Arthur Hayes, like, like did an episode with him and and talking about, yeah, there'll be an alt season, but it may not be your alts. So, it's kind of like choose your alts uh carefully. When you talk about alts, are you basically talking about everything south of Bitcoin? Is that an alt? Because I know you've got some um bellweather assets, let's call them, that we're about to take a look at, Ether and Solana. I I would imagine like to you these are in the kind of alt non-Bitcoin territory, but there's a whole lot of other assets even in the crypto top 20, even in the crypto top 10. And so this still happens to me, Mike. I still get texts from um retail investors who are not plugged into crypto. Um I'll call them normies, but I don't want to be derogatory to like, you know, like normal people, all right? And they're like, \"Hey, what do you think about XRP? I know you're into crypto. Like, what do you think about, you know, like Ripple and XRP?\" And I just don't have much commentary on that, right? Like it's not it doesn't hit my rubric for like fundamentals. It's not on my radar very much. Is XRP an alt? Is Cardano an alt? Is BNB an alt? Is Litecoin an alt? Like, what's an alt to you?\nGreat. Yeah, it's a great question. It's a good I think a good lead in here. Like, um, the way I think of it is, yeah, basically anything outside of Bitcoin, I would consider like an alt. Um, and for me, like what I what I've historically done well with in my portfolio is having an allocation. most of my allocation to the top three like you know cryp crypto networks BTC, ETH, and Solana, and then looking for high beta on the other side of that to sort of like I like to think of it as like you're capturing uh it's almost like a little hot sauce on the portfolio where if you do it in a percentage like a smaller percentage it tends to not like add too much to the volatility of the portfolio and so like sharp ratios and things are are pretty interesting when you look at um the relationship and the beta of like a memecoin um to like ETH you or like uh to to Solana. Uh so that's how I think of altcoins, like, you know, XRP is not something I've ever held. Uh, I think you have to respect the the Ripple army and just like what what's happening there and and the reason I've never held it is I've never been able to get like everything that I do is informed by data and so I've never been able to get any data on the um Ripple chain onchain data specifically for you onchain data. Yeah. And and they don't I you know I I don't maybe there is some data out there that I'm not aware of um but as far as I know none of the data providers have data on them. I think it's essentially a memecoin to me. Um, but like I said, you got to respect uh what what they're doing and there's there's a lot of people that believe in that. So, you know, um but yeah, I think for for us it's mostly like things that are longer farther down the risk curve that we can develop a thesis for is is essentially and that we can look at data that tells us something interesting like there's high beta to the L1 and that's that's how we we do the analysis. So I guess this gets us into into your head a little bit and your kind of investment style which is basically like for like for you in The DeFi Report in order to capture the alt season upside you don't have to own every alt but like what so what you do is you own alts that you see fundamentals in, strong fundamentals, onchain data in, but then you're you kind of lever up a little bit and you capture the beta on those alts through other tokens. That's essentially the the Michael Nadeau strategy here. That's that's the Magneto strategy right there. Yep.\nAll right. Well, uh let's talk about some of those maybe bellweather alts with good onchain data. Um and you've got a few charts here. We're talking about like what is fair value for something like Ether right now and Solana. And again recognizing this is a chaotic market. We're all trying to figure out what layer 1's are actually worth and that's an ongoing discussion. But tell me about this metric. So, this is market value to realized value. And you've got both ETH uh MVRV and Solana MVRV. One of them in purple, one of them in this pink color. Um ETH in purple, Solana in in this pink. What are we looking at here? What does this chart tell you?\nYeah. So, this is looking at um so market value to realized value. Realized value is a proxy for the cost basis of of the network. And you know, when I'm in the when I'm in the market looking to buy tokens, I'm trying to figure out if these is it is it at fair value? And like one way to think of this, it's almost like if you're going to analyze a a stock or an equity um and you saw that it was trading near its book value, right? Sort of like this the actual stock price is is where is trading at the sum of the of all the assets. Um you know, you're kind of getting fair value at that point. And so trying to find ways to think about fair value. We don't have book value for for these, these are software um but we have ways to think about it. And so one way to think about fair value is to look at the cost basis of all the tokens in circulation. And then where are you trading, you know, relative to that. So both of these are, you know, just over one, right? Which is telling you that on average the average ETH holder or Solana holder on average again is sort of like just above water on their hold even on their cost basis. So they bought ETH, they bought Solana at whatever price they bought it and they're basically flat. They're not down, they're not up on average. They're just kind of flat.\nThat's right. And when you see that line, so when you see the the pink line sort of in the middle of the chart there, that was the last bare market. When you see that go under one, those are typically like back the truck up moment, you know, and we're we're we're close to one right now. We're not under one, but we're close to one for both ETH and Solana.\nYeah. And ETH was under one, you know, uh during the sort of tariff uh tariff wars in around April. And so when it dipped to like 1500, right?\nYeah. Yeah. So, that was a really good opportunity to buy ETH. We might not see that again, you know, possibly ever, you know, we we'll see. Um, but I think, you know, this is one way that we sort of get develop conviction around, okay, we we have conviction about like the macro setup and then we start to look at these types of metrics to say, okay, this is a this is a good time to buy.\nI like that. I'm a fan of this metric. And other times when um ETH and Solana have been below one as like Solana fell way below one back in the post FTX like 2022, 2023 bare, of course you could see uh and even less so, but also a little bit, and then you can also see the these times when uh market value realized value was just like well above 2, 3, 4 for both these assets and that's when you start to see like frothy assets, basically the holders are way up, you know, they're they're 2x up, they're 3x up, they're 5x up on average, and that's where you start to see the froth. But right now, it is not looking frothy for ETH and uh and Solana. It's looking like kind of like accumulation uh territory historically. I'm wondering like this metric kind of reminds me of um you you remember that episode we did with Jonah on BANKLESS, which was like um uh uh MSOV or sorry, RSO, realized store of value, right? This kind of reminds me of realized store of value. Is it is it is it the same kind of metric or in the family of realized store of value metrics?\nIt is. Yeah. The way he's using this um with like with ETH and and sold to get to the RSOV is he's looking at the realized value of the ETH that is actually staked. And so what that's doing is it's like it's taking the value of ETH when the asset is actually moved into a staking contract and it's taking the sum of all that to say like this staked in also in DeFi, right? So he's taking in DeFi\n\n\nExactly. Yep. Those two, um, which, you know, and I think for since Bitcoin doesn't have the DeFi elements, he's just using Bitcoin's realized value, um, to kind of get there. So, the other thing I'll add to this is, um, we also look at the Z-score of these metrics. So, the Z-score is telling you, uh, how many standard deviations you are from the average, the historical average price. Both, it's fascinating that both ETH and Solana are actually like, you know, sort of mirroring each other here, but they're both around like 0.3 above their standard deviation, um, which again is like pretty, pretty fair, pretty fair zone. I actually really like this metric. I'm a big fan of this metric for like buying opportunities.\n\nLet's look at another one, which is, uh, FD market cap. Um, so I guess that's fully diluted market cap versus TVL, and this is for, uh, for Ether, the asset. And let's see, what we're looking at is the Ethereum ecosystem total value locked in purple here. So, I imagine this is the value of all assets including ETH, um, onchain in just Ethereum mainnet, or does this include layer 2's, Mike?\n\nIt's including, uh, just ETH mainnet.\n\nJust ETH mainnet. Okay. And then that's, so that's in purple, and then, uh, pink is just the fully diluted market cap. Um, and so what we're seeing, like, tell us what we're seeing here.\n\nYeah, this is again, just searching for signals of when we think like there's, it's fair value. And what's interesting about this chart is, like, you can see that the market value of ETH, like, has bottomed when it's sort of touched the TVL, the ecosystem TVL. Um, so, and we just had one, you know, we had that in April as well. So, you can see those two arrows there pointing to like these bottoms. I think this is just a fascinating thing. Maybe TV, maybe ecosystem TVL is book value, right? Like, it's, that's kind of how I'm thinking about it. I've seen reports like this, and I've seen, uh, investors and analysts and like, even kind of like quant-style, uh, like, look at, look investors, like, look at this metric, right? And there's definitely some correlation here. And so, what this means is, I suppose, if TVL grows, and let's say Ethereum TVL is kind of a bottom floor for the value of the network, as this maybe chart seems to indicate, there's some correlation here, uh, like, you know, at least then you start to get some proxies of, well, if stablecoin and growth, you know, exceeds 300 billion, 500 billion, goes like up towards a trillion, right? And a lot of that's on Ethereum, then that starts to set the floor for what the value of the network should be. Is that how you think about it?\n\nThat's exactly right. And I think it's important to hone in on the stablecoin piece there, because, um, you know, the assets that are in DeFi, like TVL, that's in DeFi, like the TV, it's reflexive to the price, right? There's a lot of ETH involved in there. So, so all the assets, if ETH goes down in price, you know, TVL is going to drop as well. So, they sort of move together, but stablecoins are sort of holding more of a base there. And so, maybe stablecoins actually become the sort of book value at some point, and because we know that that's not moving as much. Um, but yeah, just another metric where if we know we're getting close to that line, then it's, it kind of tells you it's a decent buying opportunity, I think.\n\nYeah. And with Ethereum, you have six years of data on this, right? So, that's kind of nice. Now, let's talk about this one. Uh, the 200E moving average. So, this is kind of a long-term DA type of, uh, chart. What's this showing you?\n\nYeah, long-term. So, this is like almost a four-year moving average. And similar, this works for Bitcoin as well. Um, when, when you drop below that four-year, uh, moving average, tends to be a really good buying opportunity. We dropped significantly below it in April. Um, so that looks, that just again looks like a really good buying opportunity back then. Still, uh, we're, we're just below it right now. So, you know, still looks like we were in, um, a pretty good buying zone, to be honest. That's, that's what that's telling me right there. Um, and it, it just historically worked pretty well. So, what's interesting about this is the numbers, the onchain numbers that you're highlighting are indicating that, um, it's a good buying zone, right? It's certainly not a bad buying zone. It doesn't feel like it's a good buying zone like from a sentiment perspective. And maybe that's the exact reason you need to be looking at buying, right? Because you blood in the streets, most hated assets. This is, of course, if it was doing very, if these assets were doing very well, we would be on the other side of these charts, and it wouldn't be a buying opportunity. So, the fact that it, it feels like it's a bad, like, a bad, uh, time to buy is maybe the reason you should consider it once you look at this onchain data, which brings us maybe to the, uh, the sauce, uh, right? If you want to kind of lever up on some of these alt plays, the, the beta type assets. Uh, so we, we talked about ETH and Solana as alt Bitcoin assets, but on top of that, you can capture some additional beta. I guess, give me the take for like, why you even want beta style assets, and like, why can't we just, like, why not just, why don't you not just capture the full value of kind of like your, your, your takes here and your investment in these alternative assets directly? Why even go down the stack to these beta assets?\n\nSo, I guess this is a personal question, and if people are not as involved and like, they don't, they're not spending as much time studying the markets and and being really involved, I probably recommend just buying the majors. But this is really more for if you want to, um, take a little bit more risk, right? So, these are high beta assets, meaning they will go up significantly more than their sort of L1 pair, uh, but they will also go down significantly more if the L1 pair does not, does not, you know, does not do well. Um, and so for me, the way that I've constructed our portfolio in the past is, and and what I'm doing right now is, if I have conviction, uh, that that ETH is going to do well, that that Solana is going to do well, I then try to find a high beta pairing with with that so that I can sort of, I, I describe it as like a little hot sauce, you know, on the portfolio. And you know, we, we, we're in crypto. Like, we should be, we're, if you're in crypto, you are probably more of a risk taker than the average sort of market participant. And so, uh, we like risk, right? We like to take some risk. We like to have some fun. And so, that's kind of the, um, the thinking behind these high beta assets. And and you know, we've put out reports on this as well, where we go through like how we actually do these, do this analysis. And as long as I can look at data that can give me some sort of conviction, then it's something I can participate in. And so, that's, that's sort of the sort of the view on these, these memes. Pepe, um, like I've said in the past, if you think the ETH is going to do well, Pepe is probably going to do well, do well as well, and probably, probably potentially go up multiples on, on ETH. So,\n\nSo, that's some of the hot sauce. We'll talk about some of that. So, but, but one of them is just like, and this might surprise people, is Pepe. You think that's hot sauce to, uh, ETH basically, and the, the reason you derive that view is from these two charts here. So, mark Pepe market value to realize value ratio. Nice thing, of course, it's a meme, but it's all on chain. So, Mike can peek into the data, like, what, what, like, what about these charts is indicating that this is, um, beta for ETH?\n\nYeah. So, we were just looking at this for for Solana and ETH, and we were saying that when, you know, you get under one, that's typically, you know, a really good buying opportunity. With Pepe, you get a little bit further below one because of the volatility of this. And you can see we went down to, we've been down to 0.5 a few times in the full history of Pepe as a tradable asset. We are close to that same level right now. Um, so again, if this is telling you that the average Pepe holder is underwater right now. So, if you're wondering why the sentiment is so bad on crypto Twitter, it's because people are are losing money. Um, and that's as a contra signal. That's to me, that's a signal to buy Pepe, uh, potentially. You know, you don't, I'm not going all in, but, um, I think it's okay to be nibbling on these things sort of at these levels. So,\n\nlet me ask you about something like this versus a strategy to just do some kind of, look, I do not advocate for leverage, right? Just like in general, margin in crypto is just, I'm, that's like, you know, strapping, strapping a bomb to your chest and then going skydiving. It's like generally a really bad idea, but that can add some hot sauce to a portfolio. So, why do something like Pepe rather than kind of like a, a 2x, 3x levered bet, some sort of perp trade on ether or Solana?\n\nbecause I don't want to get liquidated. Uh, and that's really it. That's really it. You can, you just want to survive.\n\nYeah. And I don't do leverage. So, and that's a personal choice as well. But I think if you are somebody who's comfortable doing that, you sort of get the same, you get the same output. Uh, for me, I'm more comfortable just buying the memecoin than putting leverage on to ether, Solana. Um, and so that's how I play it. I just think it's a little safer than than risking a liquidation. And I always want to be long the crypto asset class. Uh, I don't want to risk. I just don't want to risk that. So, that's again, another personal decision.\n\nBinance is the world's number one crypto exchange. Over 275 million users already trust their world-class security.

Use Uniswap's web app and wallet for a more efficient way to use DeFi.\n\nOkay, let's talk about some other, uh, flavors of hot sauce here, because we got, maybe this is our Tabasco. We got some Sriracha sauce over here, which is, um, some of these other crypto assets that aren't memetokens. They do have some different style onchain fundamentals, maybe access to some future cash flow. One of which is Ethena and ENA, which is the asset of Ethena. You wrote this memo. I thought it was fantastic. It was back in June. It's all on The DeFi Report, guys, so you can, you know, check here. But this is an asset I believe that you are bullish on, Mike. Can you tell us why?\n\nYeah. So, um, you know, this is, there's a little bit of a stablecoin-like meta, I think, that you can capture.\n\nI've noticed, I've noticed with the Circle price.\n\nYes. Uh, Circle's doing really well. Um, we, we just really like the team behind this project. Um, what's fascinating about this is it's essentially a hedge fund, and and this is going to be interesting to see how regulation we can get into regulation with this, but it's essentially a hedge fund. And the way that I think of this is, they're democratizing access to that hedge fund, and anybody can, can participate in this, and it has this reflexive, uh, nature to it where the yield that is being paid to holders of the stablecoin. You can, you can capture yield, this is a yield-bearing stablecoin. I think there may be an issue with them calling it a stablecoin, potentially with regulation. Um, but for now, it's a yield-bearing stablecoin, and the way that it pays that yield is when you are in a risk-on environment, uh, funding rates. So, if if Ethereum sees a move towards $3, $4,000, what we will see is open interest rise, right? Traders will get into the market, they will want to put on leverage. And so, what Ethena is doing is essentially shorting ETH when that happens, and the longs are paying Ethena to have that position open, and then they're sharing that the yield of that with the stablecoin holders. Uh, so it's a very reflexive play on on ETH itself. Um, which also means there's risks there if ETH goes in the wrong direction, and you know, open interest, you know, comes down, um, there could be an issue there, which we, we highlighted as as one of the major risks. Uh, we cover a lot of the risks with this project in particular, but to me, this is a bull market play. It's probably not a long-term hold, um, through the bare market, but it's a reflexive play on, uh, on ETH, and it's, it's not a memecoin. It actually has fundament\n\n\nals.\nIt has yield that goes to those stablecoin holders.\nSo, let's talk about this a little bit more.\nI think the mechanism itself is a little difficult to understand, and maybe we could talk about that.\nLet's park the mechanism aside.\nMy understanding, Mike, is this is Ethena now, the stablecoin itself, so not the kind of the, you know, the token that's the recipient of future cash flows, the ENA token, but the Ethena stablecoin token itself, is it, what is it, the third largest stablecoin?\nIt is, yeah, it is the largest, uh, the largest yield-bearing stablecoin.\nIt has about 50% of the yield-bearing stablecoin market.\nWow, okay, so, uh, stablecoins, number one is, of course, like Tether, and we'll call this a stablecoin for now.\nSo, number one is Tether.\nNumber two is, uh, Circle USDC, and we've seen what Circle is doing, and we know the profit margins on Tether.\nWe just talked to Paulo, Mike.\nI don't know if you caught up with that episode.\nUh, but do you know they're throwing off, um, uh, I don't know, was 13 billion or so in profit every year in profit, and he expects to do more this year.\nAnyway, massively profitable.\nAlso have some narrative, uh, you like, uh, tailwinds, say, with the Genius Act, and this is the number three stablecoin.\nOkay, it's still not huge in comparison, but this is respectable.\nWhat are we at?\n6 billion or so in terms of the, the like, the total amount of these stable, these stablecoins that have been issued.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nMassive.\nAnd they were the, I think, the second fastest protocol to over 100 million in protocol revenue as well.\nOkay.\nSo we have that, we have kind of the narrative.\nNow, what's interesting, too, is I don't know if this is good or bad, but the Genius Act doesn't contemplate something like Ethena, right?\nSo it doesn't, it doesn't, from my understanding, it doesn't rule one way or another on Ethena, right?\nBut in the Genius Act, there's like no contemplation of a yield-bearing stablecoin.\nUSDC does not have a path to do that, neither does Tether.\nSo the fact that this is a stablecoin with yield that goes back to kind of the holder of, uh, USDE, that's kind of a something different than the other top two stablecoins.\nNow, something else that's different, I suppose, is it doesn't have the blessing from this regulation.\nSo, it kind of exists in this regulatory gray area.\nAm I right about this?\nYes, that is correct.\nUm, and that is, you know, that's how they've been performing over the last few years.\nAnd the Genius Act sort of says, hey, like, we realize there's these other stablecoins out there.\nUh, we want to study them for, uh, a year or so, and then we will come up with a framework for those, but for now, um, they are outside of the Genius Act.\nI think what people can get maybe a little comfort around is the fact that this is not a SEC regime that is necessarily probably going to go after them for being outside of that framework.\nIt's more just that, like, you're, you just have to operate offshore.\nYou don't get to be blessed by the US capital markets.\nYou're just going to have to operate offshore, and they have to like sort of geo-fence the actual app to US users.\nYou know, people use VPNs and things like that, but that's sort of where they sit, and, you know, they've been able to achieve the amount of success they've had, you know, in this current state of being in this gray area.\nAnd I think it'll just sort of continue for a little while.\nHow scalable is the stablecoin itself?\nAnd by scalable, I mean, how big could it grow?\nSo we're at 6 billion now, but to get to Tether's like level, you're 150 billion.\nAnd it's, it's somewhat easy for Tether to scale.\nIf there's a dollar of demand for Tether, they just buy more treasuries and they just scale it that way.\nSame thing with USDC.\nSo it's infinitely scalable with demand.\nSome, some of these other stablecoin projects that are based on collateral, this type of thing, like something like, um, Make or Die, for instance, it's just harder to scale because you have to have collateral that kind of backs it.\nThey have to have demand for, for leverage, essentially, that backs those types of, uh, stablecoins.\nThis uses a different mechanism, I believe that, but it does have some scale limitations, right?\nIs it the, the amount of pers in circulation, or what are the scale limitations of Ethena?\nIt does, yeah, it's a great question.\nUm, so the limitations and scaling this is really the amount of open interest, uh, on on Ethereum and these other crypto assets, okay, that they essentially short to pay, pay the yield, and they can't, based on sort of the risk parameters of the protocol, they can't have more than like 20% of the open interest.\nIt just gets too, it just gets too risky.\nI see.\nAnd so they are, they are, um, constrained by this.\nI would say that, um, in a bull market, uh, what I think that constraint, just sort of the ceiling of that constraint, sort of rises as open interest comes in.\nUm, but, but there is a constraint there.\nI would say that they are diversifying their reserves as well.\nSo they, they do have, um, the BlackRock Bidd, uh, money market fund that is also backing.\nSo they have some interesting TradFi integrations, and they work with, um, they're building an L3 with Securitize and BlackRock, and that's a, uh, real-world asset, real-world asset platform for issuing assets.\nSo they're building that with Securitize.\nThey're using the BlackRock Bidd, um, which is treasury bonds, to sort of diversify some of the risk and some of the reserves there as well.\nSo, um, that constraint, you know, the way that I think of it is like, based on where I think open interest can, can go in this cycle, I think it can get to 20 trillion, or sorry, 20 million.\nWow, that's bullish.\n20, 20 billion in open interest, and so Ethena could get capture all of that potentially.\nYeah.\nSo I think they could get to 20 billion of stablecoin supply.\nThey're about six right now.\nAnd if that were to happen, um, I would expect the token to rally as well.\nAnd we can get into fair value on the token.\nIt's, it's, it looks similar to me like as these, these memes that we were just talking about.\nUm, it's, I think it's down almost 80% from its all-time high right now.\nWow.\nWow.\nAnd the fundamentals look great.\nSo, well, okay.\nOne question before we get to maybe the fair, fair value is, you mentioned risk a couple of times.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nAnd I, I'm just like, you don't have to explain all of kind of the risk here, but I want to get your sense of the spectrum, right?\nSo if on the one hand, on the, the like, not risky side, we have something like Circle and Tether, which is backed by a treasury, not risky.\nOn the other of the spectrum, people remember 2022, and they remember Terra Luna Algo stalecoin, stablecoin backed by indogenous collateral of the asset itself, kind of this recursive, like, pyramid schemy thing that like can unwind in a hurry.\nWhere are we?\nAre we somewhere in between those two like ends of the spectrum?\nYeah, I think that's fair.\nThis is not a pyramid scheme type thing.\nBut what, but it, but it also has not been tested, uh, in a bare market.\nAnd what that would look like is funding rates actually going negative for a period of time, and they, they make their money by shorting ETH when, when funding rates are positive.\nAnd so, um, I do think there's, there's risks here that we just haven't seen how it's going to perform.\nUm, they also have custody risk, right?\nThey, they work with exchanges, and they've done a lot of stuff to try to get some of the, um, reserves and stuff off, off exchange so that they are not, so they don't have this counterparty risk.\nUm, they did have $30 million with Bybit when Bybit was, was hacked earlier this year.\nThey did fine through that.\nUm, but there's, there's sort of like the counterparty custody risk.\nThere's the protocol risk itself in terms of just smart contracts functioning properly, and then you have this PEG risk in terms of the market conditions and funding rates.\nI think are like the three, three primary risks.\nThese things won't show up most likely in a bull market, but they will show up in a, in a bare market.\nSo, this feels to me like it's slightly, definitely not Lunatra territory, but slightly maybe more risky than something like DeFi, which has sustained through, uh, multiple bare markets in the past.\nYeah, agreed.\nOkay.\nFair market value of this thing, what do you think?\nRight now, it's what, 25 cents for ENA.\nSo, it's down.\nIt's similar to, um, what we were looking at before.\nWhen you look at the MBRV of this, it's, it's, it's down, uh, I can't remember where it was when I shared that report, but it's close to one, below one, and I might have had it in the closing.\nYeah, there it is, MBRV.\nYeah.\nSo, we're under, we're, we're negative on the MBRV Zcore.\nThat's the, that's telling you that the, um, where it's trading in relation to its, um, historical norms.\nSo it's trading, I think, almost 0.5 standard deviations below its average, uh, you know, price.\nSo that's telling you it's, it's, it's oversold, uh, basically right now.\nUm, it does have, you know, token, it has unlocks, right?\nSo this is like part of the analysis we share in this report, and that's another one of the risks is, uh, team unlocks, and, and so that, I think, that's putting pressure on it during like this sort of risk-off phase of the market that that we're kind of in right now.\nUm, and is there a fee switch on or not yet?\nSo the cash flow situation.\nYeah, they, they have, uh, hinted at this.\nThere's a few, and we cover this in the report.\nThere's a few thresholds that they want to reach, uh, in terms of, uh, risk parameters, in terms of total protocol fees and things like this, um, before they actually turn on this the fee switch to the ENA token.\nUm, but it's on, it's on the roadmap.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nSo that's Ethena, guys.\nI know you also, Mike, have a position in Worldcoin.\nUh, we, we talked a little bit about that last time.\nThere's a full report on The DeFi Report that, uh, people can go get Mike's take on Worldcoin.\nI, I want to zoom out and ask more of a meta question on sort of alt season.\nYou were, you were talking about it a little bit earlier of like, what if alt season happens, but it's with crypto equities and stocks rather than onchain assets.\nSo what we've seen this week is a Robinhood rollout of, uh, tokenized securities on top of Arbitrum.\nArbitrum got like the ARB token got a little bit of a bump on that.\nRobinhood also got an 11% bump on that.\nWhat happened to ETH?\nNothing.\nPurgatory 20.\nIt's like it's operating like a stablecoin this summer.\n2500.\nThat's all.\nI wake up, I see 2500.\nI go to bed, I see 2500.\nRinse, watch, repeat the, the full cycle.\nSo, that is not filtering into some of the our cryptonative assets.\nWe've seen Circle people sideways on on Circle, the crypto natives at least, because they own onchain assets.\nAnd where do you buy Circle onchain?\nIt's not in Uniswap.\nI, well, at least not now.\nMaybe it will be someday soon, but, um, and that's seen it like at 8x from IPO at at some point in the time.\nSo now, if you're considering fundamental crypto assets, do investors need to look outside of onchain assets and look at actual traditional crypto equities that benefit from the crypto, like things like Hood, things like Coin, things like Circle?\nI mean, let's ignore the treasury companies right now because those are levered bets on cryptonative assets.\nBut like, the crypto equities, do we need to start looking in the public markets for these things?\nI think so.\nI think you got, you have to pay attention to what we're seeing here.\nLike the Circle IPO was, was, um, was pretty eye-opening for me to observe just the amount of demand for that.\nUm, and we're seeing Coin sort of catch up a little bit.\nNow Robinhood has done extremely well.\nLike you really have to pay attention when, when, uh, when Robinhood goes up 11% on announcing news that they're building on Ethereum, but Ethereum doesn't move.\nArbitrum moved a little bit.\nUm, you got to pay attention, I think, to that.\nIt doesn't tell me anything like long-term or what, you know, where this is all going, but, um, I recommend we've been holding Coin and Hood since like the last bare market.\nUh, and we will continue to do that.\nThat's basically, there's like eight assets in our portfolio.\nThat's two of them.\nSo a quarter of the portfolio is in these like equities.\nWhat I'm looking at is, um, these, these ETFs.\nWe do have like nine altcoin ETFs coming.\nYeah.\nSo to me, that's, that's bullish for altcoins, right?\nUm, and the fact that this is happening, and then this becomes the narrative, like I sort of want to fade that a little bit.\nIt's like sort of telling me like maybe this is getting a little too, people are getting a little too caught up in this, and like there's still, you always have to come back to like, you know, people love to gamble.\nWe are, we are, there's a lot of dens in crypto, and like I just think people will chase, um, but we need to, but you need to see sort of a, a change in, I think, the liquidity conditions, and we can maybe get into a little bit of that at the end here.\nUm, but altcoins, you know, ETH BTC chart, all of these things really depend on Fed liquidity.\nAnd so like that's, that's like the key thing.\nYeah, I, one thing I, uh, I, I, I appreciate about that perspective.\nI, I do think people need to be looking at, uh, crypto equity assets is it resolves some of the challenges that we've had with our tokens in the past, which is like some of our tokens have been, people have called them lemon market tokens, but like almost like pseudo equity, where like, do you have a right to cash flow?\nDo you have a right to governance?\nIs the team incentivized behind this like singular asset, or they have multiple assets?\nCould they just like abandon the project?\nAll of those protections have already been worked out over the last what, like 80 years in Gary Gensler style.\nI'm gonna invoke his name, but like the, the SEC and crypto and, and, uh, sorry, US equities markets have worked out all of these kinks.\nAnd when you own, when you own stock in Robinhood and Coinbase, the teams around those have a fiduciary responsibility to return value to shareholders and to maximize that value.\nAnd that's like in the legal code of the US.\nSo, it's kind of nice to be dabbling.\n\n\nIn those crypto assets, too, because they don't have the problem that many of our tokens have.\nBut, let's, uh, let's end this episode with, uh, liquidity and the macro setup.\nSo, you've got a chart here with, uh, global weekly global liquidity, and, um, tell us about this and what do you see in liquidity?\nWhy is that a driver for you of, like, the macro conditions?\nYeah, this is from Crossber Capital, where we sourced this from.\nUm, what we're seeing here is, like, it's just turned over a little bit, uh, in June, and this is to me, this is just the Fed sitting on its hands.\nUm, and so we know that there's quite a bit of, you know, fiscal spend going on.\nWe'll see what happens with the big beautiful bill.\nLike, it looks like it might have hit a little snag, uh, recently here.\nSo that's a big deal, um, in terms of what's going to happen there.\nAnd then what is Pal going to do?\nI mean, Pal, he was at, he spoke, I think, in Europe yesterday, and I thought maybe we would see him hint at, like, a sort of shift, but still hawkish, um, still saying that they're going to be data dependent, concerned about inflation.\nUm, the, you look at the CME futures in terms of where the market is pricing rate cuts, it's at, uh, like a, I think it was, tw, less than 20% for, for July.\nI think it was 18% the last time I looked.\nUm, looks better for September.\nSo, looks like it might be a 75% chance of cuts in September.\nReally?\nAnd, um, actually, what was interesting was, like, it looked like a 20% chance of a 50 basis point cut in September.\nSo, you can see, like, it's, this is telling you that the Fed is, what I think is going to happen is, they're just going to be behind, they're going to be behind this.\nIf you're data dependent, you're basically saying we're going to be late.\nUm, so this is a risk in the market right now.\nLike, it's, it's easy to look at a lot of things and be bullish, but the longer they go, the, the, the higher the chances are that you have something, some snag in the repo markets or some scare in the markets.\nUm, you know, last August, we had the Japanese carry trade unwind in early August.\nSo, like, kind of just be on the, be aware that liquidity conditions are not, like, really good, uh, right now.\nAt the same time, we have Trump, you know, out there talking about, uh, we need to get interest rates down at 2% to be able to, you know, refinance the debt.\nAnd so, you know, you just have this push-pull between what Trump wants.\nI think Trump's going to get what he wants.\nIt's just a matter of, uh, when, when, when that happens.\nIt is the big bright, uh, crypto macro indicator, this, the weekly global liquidity supply.\nSo, basically, if this number goes up, crypto goes up, and the higher this number goes, the higher, presumably, altcoins go as well.\nAnd so, if this right now, global liquidity has, like, you know, recently locally dipped down, but the things to look for are what, like, uh, rate cuts from the Fed, um, big beautiful bill, which adds to deficits.\nAll of these things mean money printing, means global liquidity number go up, means the crypto bull market continues, and those are the things to watch right now.\nThat's it, I think.\nSo, you know, um, this chart here is factoring in not just Fed liquidity, but, uh, all the major central banks.\nSo, you know, the PBOC in China is, is actually a little bit more, um, has a little bit of a more loose policy right now, but we are also seeing, like, tightening in Europe and in the UK.\nSo, it's not just the US, um, they're, they're involved as well.\nI, I think that's it.\nLike, once this turns, I think you will see, um, a move for, for, um, for crypto and the longer tail.\nI think I may have put another chart in there.\nIs the last chart showing Fed, the Fed funds rate and ETH?\nYeah.\nSo, you know, along those lines, we've got ETH versus the Fed funds rate right here.\nAnd we can see that when that purple line, the Fed funds rate starts to come down, ETH goes up.\nThat's when the pink line goes up, right?\nAnd so, even you can even see last year when the Fed, uh, the Fed cut, uh, I think it was 100 basis points, they did a full percentage point from September through December, you can see that and ETH went up, right?\nAnd then when they stopped cutting, ETH has gone down.\nAnd so, if you see that purple line come down, most likely the pink line's going to go up, and we're sort of in a holding pattern.\nAnd we'll see how long we can hold on without a major sell-off, right?\nIf liquidity conditions sort of really dry up.\nLook, man, I, I feel like with, uh, Trump's rhetoric, with kind of the election cycle, actually, it's like, I mean, we're creeping on a year away, uh, politicians need to get reelected.\nUm, I feel like it's a pretty fair bet that the purple line's coming down sometime soon.\nI mean, uh, inflation's not running too hot from a CPI perspective.\nYou know, all of these things, uh, you blending together feels like a pretty good macro setup.\nSo, let me, let me ask you the question I end these episodes with, uh, which is, okay, what's in the portfolio now?\nWhat have you changed around?\nI think last time you were talking about long-term positions of Bitcoin and Ether.\nUm, you also had some recent additions.\nUh, you mentioned, you know, some of the blue chip memes like Pepe, World Coin.\nYou have a position there.\nI assume you've got a position on, uh, Ethena right now.\nWhat's in the, what's in the portfolio?\nYeah, so not a ton of changes.\nSo, 60% Bitcoin, um, tend to be, that's like on the lower side, uh, for me.\nSo, I've been sort of allocating more into ETH, uh, more into ETH related assets.\nSo, that's Worldcoin.\nUh, that's Ethena.\nWe've been nibbling on these, these meme coins.\nSo, Pepe and Bonk are also in, in the portfolio.\nUm, and I think we talked about last time, we have a position in Celestia that we started buying under $3 that has been selling.\nSo, we're like underweight on that position right now.\nUm, but I think that that is still, like, that.\nSo, we actually bought more of it at, like, a buck 30 recently.\nM, um, so, so, so, sort of, like, I, I would say more of a, um, more of a risk-on posture, but still not, like, fully all in the markets, like, definitely keeping some cash on the sideline to, because I think there's a chance that, you know, liquidity conditions continue to sort of dry up, and you get, like, another, another opportunity to buy, uh, even lower than we are now.\nSo, we'll see.\nI want to be in the market in case, uh, in case that doesn't happen, but also have some cash on the sideline in case there are more buying opportunities.\nSo, this is great.\nAnd guys, we didn't get a chance to look at it.\nIt's an exhaustive, you know, memo report in and of itself, but, uh, Mike also authored this, this great report, \"How do you value an L1\" on The DeFi Report, which you guys should absolutely, uh, read.\nIf there's demand for an episode, we could do an episode on this just this topic alone because I think it's a fascinating from a fundamentals perspective, and also, Mike, we've got something coming up, which is, we're going to start doing quarterly reports together, and The DeFi Report, you're planning to publish quarterly reports for, I believe, Ether and Solana, starting in June, or starting in July, right?\nSo, give us, give us a feel for what's going to happen.\nYeah, so we're going to roll these out.\nThese will be the Q2, uh, reports for this quarter, um, July 15th.\nWe plan to publish these, uh, starting with ETH and Solana.\nAnd the, the plan here is, we want to produce a report that is sort of free of our opinion.\nIt's just really the pure data and from the token holder perspective.\nUm, and so that is what we're going to roll out, uh, later this, this c, uh, or mid-July.\nAnd then we're also going to pair this with our Dune dashboards.\nSo, we have all of the data that supports that, that report.\nAnd then we're going to do an earnings call where we sort of invite up leadership right from some of these communities.\nAnd, like, we haven't seen this in crypto, and I think this will be interesting.\nI'm sure there'll be a mixed reaction to this on CT, but the idea is that, like, the token holders need a voice, and they need to be able to sort of ask questions or understand things, um, about how value occurs to these tokens.\nWhat's the right way to be thinking about them in terms of, um, in terms of valuation?\nAnd so, we want analysts to have a place that they can come to sort of ask these types of questions.\nAnd we want the report to be free from our bias, our potential biases, and just data driven, and to let the market then interpret that on their own.\nWe will do a separate podcast where I share my opinions about what the data is saying.\nUm, but we want the market to be able to just take that and then, you know, build their own, their own thesis, their own analysis on top of it.\nSo, super excited to work with you guys on that.\nI love it.\nLove the work you're doing.\nSo, you heard it here first.\nEarnings calls coming to crypto starting in July.\nI got to end with this.\nOf course, you know, none of this has been financial advice.\nCrypto is risky.\nYou could lose what you put in, but we are headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the crypto fundamentals journey.\n",
