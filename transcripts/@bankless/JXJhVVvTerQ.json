  "cleanText": "Welcome, big nation, to the Friday weekly rollup. My co-host, Ryan Sean Adams, is out for the week, hanging out with his family, and we are tapping in Tom Schmidt from Dragonfly to replace him. Tom, how you doing, my man?\n\nGood. Thanks for having me. I was just saying this is like a nice crossover app. Like, you came on the Chopping Block a couple weeks ago, and now I'm on Bankless. Now you're here. Yeah. You know, the podcasts are just cycling through other podcasters. Eventually, we'll have everything. Honestly, everyone should just get into one big podcast, and we'll have one room. We'll see how it goes.\n\nOverall, uh, before we get into the news of the week, which was a pretty light week, I'll call it. We have the Kalshi raise. We have some markets to talk about. Nothing too big this week. Uh, so, in order to kind of kick things off, I kind of want to get your vibe check about the state of crypto because we are going from one half of the year to the other. It is June 26th at the time of recording, as we're finishing the first half, entering the second half of the year. I remember general sentiment. I don't know what your market take was going into this year, but general consensus was rough first half of the year, frothy second half of the year, and I think that that has played out more or less to a tee. Wondering what your take is.\n\nYeah, I, um, I feel like whenever there's some macro chaos, some geopolitical chaos, um, that is always taking the driver's seat, and crypto is always sort of secondary. And it feels like, you know, this week we were kind of covering from a lot of the geopolitical craziness for the past couple weeks. Um, but yeah, it's been quiet. I think, um, Permissionless was taking place in New York. A lot of people were in town talking about that. Um, but also there's a lot of focus on equities. Um, and I feel like, you know, we'll talk a little bit about that, which has been kind of bizarre. It feels like a very much of a reversal of like 2020 when crypto is going crazy. Um, and it feels like the equities market, everyone's like looking, and there's nothing, nothing really going on.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Zooming in on the Bitcoin price, we are up 3% on the week to $107,500, and ETH prices down 3% on the week. Uh, so a little bit, little bit of divergence between the two majors, but overall Bitcoin, I guess if we zoom out to the 3-month mark, we're up a pretty substantial amount, coming up from $80,000 to almost $110,000. We did hit that $111,000 in May. So we are kind of ranging between this $110,000, $100,000. Are you bullish? Are you like eagerly waiting the breakthrough of new all-time highs, or are you more patient?\n\nHow, I mean, how can you not be bullish? Like every week, uh, I feel like you read a headline that would have been totally unbelievable, uh, 5 years ago, let alone 10 years ago. Uh, just in terms of interest, traction, adoption in the space, even now, I mean, we, you know, bemoan, oh, Bitcoin's down to $100,000. Kind of insane. Uh, it was actually like a CZ tweet from 2020 or maybe 2019 even, joking about this fact that like, hey, in 5 years, we'll be complaining about Bitcoin dropping to $100,000, and sure enough, that here we are. Yeah.\n\nNow, I don't want to pin you down to anything specific because I know that's just not how markets work, but I'm generally feeling that you are in the camp of Bitcoin is currently edging, and we are looking through an all-time, looking for an all-time high.\n\nYeah. I, I think really the only thing that's going to stop this is, um, some sort of bigger shift in, uh, yeah, monetary policy, some big, again, uh, macro calamity. Maybe we get, uh, you know, dollar strengthening later half the year, that could be really bad for the market, but right now, it feels like, um, there's really only tailwinds, um, and, and so I don't really know what's going to kind of make us deviate from this path.\n\nYeah. Yeah. The total crypto market cap coming in at $3.4 trillion. So that's actually pretty still far away from its peak at $3.9 trillion. Still like $300 billion off. But nonetheless, uh, the Bitcoin dominance story, I feel like, is the news of the week, at least in terms of the crypto markets side of things, because we are just hitting new all-time high, new all-time high week after week. There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, seven, maybe eight, depending on how good my counting is, weeks straight of green candles on Bitcoin dominance to a high that we have not yet seen since all the way back in December of 2020. So Bitcoin dominance is at 66%. When you see this, what do you think?\n\nThat's weird. I would have, uh, pegged it more for like a 2019 all-time high. I guess 2020, there was also like, um, I mean, I guess it goes back to these, the stuff being very cyclical. Whenever it's over, you, you need to prepare yourself to be back, and, uh, and vice versa. And I think right now it's, anytime there's grave dancing, which is kind of what we see, uh, I think from, from maxis on the rest of the space, um, in my mind, that just means there's more opportunity, and it looks different every time. I mean, even the market now looks different than 2021, um, looks different than 2017, but there is going to be a shift, um, and, and I think things generally just don't move kind of monotonically like that. Um, so I, you know, if I had to bet a year from now, I think Bitcoin dominance will be lower, but I don't know what the rest of the market's going to look like.\n\nYeah, a year from now, I, I totally agree. And from, for an entire year, I think you could still slowly see this thing grind up. It's at 66%. It could go to 75%. There's nothing stopping it. And that grave dancing can just get louder from the Bitcoiners, can just get louder and louder and louder, and it will be more annoying, and people will capitulate even more. But when Bitcoin dominance does turn over, it has never gone down slowly. It only goes down very, very fast.\n\nYes. Uh, I, I think that that's right. I mean, there's always, I feel like, the start of some new meta, which is ultimately going to drive down Bitcoin dominance. And when there's a meta, that's the frothiness that we were kind of talking about. And so, um, yeah, I'm curious to see what that looks like. Again, different every time, but, um, it feels like there's, there's little green shoots popping up here and there.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah, that new meta that you talk about, I'm going to call it a token issuance meta. The ICO mania in 2017 was what brought Bitcoin dominance down from, uh, the high, high number of 96% down to the lowest it's ever been at 34%. That was the ICO meta. Uh, the NFT mania in 2021 also brought it down, uh, where it crept back up in that bare market up to 72% and brought it down to 40%. And then actually, interestingly, the memecoin mania only really, like, I'll, I'll call the peak of the memecoin mania starting in November of 2024, right before Donald Trump issued the Trump token. And with the issuance of the Trump token, the Bitcoin dominance went from 61% down to 55%. So the memecoin mania did not really make a dent in overall Bitcoin dominance. So that was not really the cycle that we were looking for.\n\nYeah. Um, I, I mean, I think that is true, which is, uh, people always, uh, uh, I remember when, when memecoins were going big, people talk about, oh, this is just, uh, everyone being tired of, of VC coins, people being tired of, of Bitcoin, and expect, I'm like, yeah, but in, in absolute terms, these are, you know, pretty small numbers, right? This is kind of a weird little pocket of, of the industry. Um, I think the NFT thing was, was interesting, where, like, again, that would not have been something I think you would have predicted in 2019 that, like, you know, NFTs will make a big dent, and yet they did. And who knows, maybe something, you know, uh, will make that happen this time around. Maybe it'll be, you know, tokenized, uh, equities, or maybe per take a big dig in it.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. In 2019, I remember, uh, me, Ryan, a lot of the Ethereum crowd of people were just so bullish on DeFi and things like MakerDAO and Uniswap, and we're going to democratize finance. And, you know, we got, we got that bull market, that was DeFi summer, that did not make a dent in Bitcoin dominance. It was the NFT mania that made a dent in Bitcoin dominance, and that brought in the net new people, and then we were like, you look at our cool new financial toys, and they're like, I want to collect the monkey JPEG. Uh, and we just, we had just no ability at all to predict that that coming our way at all. And so I'm guessing whatever, whatever brings Bitcoin dominance from 70% back down to like 45% or wherever it goes is going to be something that, like, no one actually sees coming.\n\nYeah. Uh, I mean, it could be, you know, ICOs coming back, and we're kind of seeing again, like, some of that. Yeah. Um, you know, I, I don't think it's the worst idea in the shape of capital formation.\n\nWell, so you're an ICO meta fan. And maybe you could talk about why, why you like ICOs.\n\nI don't know if I would say I'm, I'm a fan, but I, I don't hate it. I think, um, hopefully we've, we've kind of learned some of the lessons from the 2017 ICO phase. And I think there has been maybe just an exhaustion, I think, of market participants. And that's where I think a lot of the infighting and Twitter finger-pointing is happening, where, uh, you know, traders and retail investors blame VCs, and and VCs blame projects, and projects VCs again, too. I don't know. I don't know. Everyone's blaming some VCs. I feel like that's really healthy.\n\nYeah. Um, but you know, it's, it's okay. This is a byproduct of, of the current state of, of fundraising and capital formation. Um, then there's, there's appetite, I think, for more early-stage interest. Also, frankly, um, the way projects are raising capital is just so much different than it was, you know, 5 years ago, where, um, early-stage teams need less capital. They're doing fewer private rounds. You can see that all kind of collapsing at some point, where, hey, maybe we don't do a private round, or maybe we do one small private round and then a public sale, and, and that's kind of it. And I think that has been kind of the only maybe major trend line I've seen in, in private fundraising has been, hey, maybe we don't need, you know, $200 million to make a new blockchain, maybe we need a lot less and a lot less time, and we can kind of, uh, you know, compress, uh, our, our capital needs, um, and therefore open up to the public.\n\nYeah, there was an era, maybe two years ago, three years ago, where the $1 billion raise or the, the monster raise was truly signal for retail investors. And now I think in more recent times, that has flipped on its head, where the very large, gargantuan raise has turned into anti-signal, whereas, like, oh, this, this is like, I'm not going to name any VCs, but there are, there's a select cohort of VCs out there that I think are being branded by these as these like token shops, and they do these very large, high-valuation raises, and like, it's just early in the lifespan of said company, and so this said company is brand new, getting a billion-dollar valuation from like the same kind of cohort of of VCs, and people are just like flagging that, and that is not, is the opposite of what the signal it used to be like 2 or 3 years ago, which, like, I think, I think is, is good, at least it is a pendulum shift, and I think, you know, the, it can shift too far, I think, as well, it can get too toxic, it can be too, um, too much of like, too much of a good thing, uh, but that is kind of like what the current meta is, is like the large VC race is kind of being, um, uh, thrown up by, by the market, at least the Twitter discourse, I'll say.\n\nYeah, I, I, I think that's a good way of phrasing it. Um, I think obviously VCs, in my mind, provide value beyond just the capital in, in, I, that's what I, you know, like to, like to tell myself, and I think, you know, project products, uh, do say that about, about good VCs. I think there's also a lot of angst around the exchange listing meta, um, a large chunk of the, uh, projects going to, um, exchanges, and hey, maybe these aren't as positive signal as they used to be. Not everything is going to pump on a Binance listing anymore. And so I think that all kind of creates, uh, this discontent that creates revolution. And I think that's kind of what you're seeing right now.\n\nYeah. Yeah. The other thing that's happening alongside of that is, like, I can't remember what, um, echo round it was, or maybe it was the token sale on, on Sonar, on the new platform, and then, like, a bunch of, you know, retail investors got access to be able to invest in this thing for the first time, and it was like, very clearly a lot of people's first exposure to VC investing, and, uh, I can't remember what the tweet, but there was, like, the realization that, oh, this is actually very likely not going to work, and that is the game that VCs have always been doing, and retail thinks that, like, VCs just have this, like, staircase to heaven where every single project, you know, is a 10x, 100x every single time, but in reality, like, the odds are much slimmer, and just retail haven't, they're just not exposed to the failures, and now, like, Kobe's ICO platform is exposing, like, the actual failure rate of venture startups to retail investors, and that's a, that's a new experience for many in the, in the retail side of things.\n\nYeah, I think, uh, you know, there's a phenomenon in venture where you want sort of professional LPs who are institutional, who do a lot of venture, who write chunky checks, and sort of can, can weather the storm, and it has kind of seen it all, and aren't going to be extremely annoying when things go you well, or things go poorly, and I think projects have that same phenomenon where, um, if things go poorly, like, you actually kind of want a VC, uh, backing you who's seen it all and can kind of help you and isn't going to be complaining, whereas, yes, I think retail can kind of, uh, feel like everything's going to go, I mean, certainly the median venture fund does not do particularly well, but, um, you know, the outliers obviously make up for the rest of it.\n\nYeah. Let's turn our attention to the memecoin markets, excuse me, the tradfi markets, where we're looking at the Circle price. It's actually come down from the all-time highs that it set just\n\n\nLast week of $297 ridiculous dollars.\nIt is at the still ridiculous price of $210.\nSo, we had a decline in the Circle price.\nAny commentary on this Circle price action post IPO?\nUh, I think this is like the most mispriced IPO I've seen in maybe my entire career.\nUm, I mean, I can't imagine another, I can't remember the last time an IPO had been pumped 10x off the listing.\nAnd the bizarre thing was like they were trying to IPO for the longest time.\nThey were shopping this thing around.\nNo one wanted to buy it.\nUh, and maybe they're just showing to the wrong people.\nI don't actually know who's buying Circle stock.\nUh, I think Robert Lushner suspects a lot of Tik Tok retail traders, which might be true, but it's, he claims he's seen Tik Toks of the people telling others to buy Circle.\nI cannot imagine Robert Leer just scrolling Tik Tok.\nI can't either.\nAnd he claims, oh, the best Tik Toks make it onto Twitter.\nAnd I'm like, you could just say you have a Tik Tok account, Robert.\nLike, it's okay.\nYeah, it's a big app.\nUm, but it does seem like there's this weird disconnect between this thing was such a dog in the private markets to now being such a public market darling and now everyone is taking note and everyone's like, \"Oh, maybe I should go public or maybe I should uh, you know, um, you know, do something in stable coin land,\" and so it's sort of like the signals are percolating through the rest of the market.\nOkay, so this might be cope, but when people say this is a mispriced ICO and everyone's like, \"Oh, I totally mid-curved that.\nI should have bought it on open.\"\nIt's obviously everyone is saying that in hindsight, hindsight 2020, but we understand the Circle fundamentals and like with that the $31 IPO price aligns with that.\nIt was it's like $150 million of yearly income.\nIt's not great.\nUh $31 billion.\nThere is already like a stable coin premium baked into a company that has $150 million of yearly revenue being priced at $7 billion.\nThere's already a premium there.\nSo like in the sense when you say that it is mispriced that is just objectively true in the sense that we can now look at the price of $300 that it hit and just say that that is what is true, but I'm also again I preface this saying this might be cope, but like I don't know, I feel like it's justified at $31 and it's just not justified at 210.\nI don't disagree.\nI would not have bought it at open.\nI didn't buy it openly.\nFive was crazy.\nUm, but you know, I think the market, you have to take signal from the market and the market is telling you something else and maybe these people are totally irrational or maybe they have a different view than I do, but um, I think as always, you know, markets are forward-looking and I think when people look at Circle, they see, hey, we have GSAC passing the Senate, all these big uh fintex, all these big fortune getting into stable coins is clearly in the lead um when it comes to sort of regulated uh you know uh stable coin issuer in the US.\nUm, and it's there's really not many other ways to express that view um, in the equities markets.\nUm, I mean, there was a little bit of a catch-up trading in Coin because people realize that Circle revenue, but other than that, like what else are you going to buy?\nUm, and I think that that's a large part of the rally, too.\nYeah, this it was the Circle price pump was just a very isolated rally when it went from like it opened up at 30, immediately jumped to 70, and then just climbed to 130.\nAnd no other crypto equity, mainly Coinbase, was really moving at all.\nCoinbase actually kind of traded down even.\nUh that has changed in the last just 4 days.\nCoin stock has gone from $254 to $375 in about 9 days.\nSo that's a 50% increase in the last 9 days.\nSo Coin is doing a catch-up trade.\nI would say like there is a correlation to Circle here.\nI feel pretty confident in making that market call that it was because of the Circle price where people were like, \"All right, Circle's so goddamn frothy.\nLike, where else can we get exposure?\nOh, let's buy the company that has 50% of Circle's revenues.\"\nAnd so, like, my commentary before this was, okay, there's a lot of private companies that are looking to go public downstream of the Circle uh very positive IPO and then trading price action afterwards.\nLike, as soon as something 10xes right after IPO, that's very signal, big signal that the public markets are ready.\nSo like now people are like looking at Kraken and looking at chain analysis of all things, Fireblocks, all these private companies that could in theory IPO and they're like, \"Okay, like that's the next one.\nThere's going to be a next one.\"\nBut when people were making these comments, I was like, \"Look at the Coin stock.\nLook at the Coin price.\nIt's not going anywhere.\nIt's actually just a stable coin narrative.\nIt's just about stable coins.\"\nBut that is now wrong over the last nine days because the Coin price has hit new all-time highs.\nUh, and so if we zoom out all the way to the pico top of the 2021 bull market when Coin launched at like $375.\nI guess it did trade briefly higher up to $420, but it launched at 320 $75.\nWe are at $375 right now.\nSo we are matching one for one.\nThe price that Coin listed at at the top of the 2021 market, the thing that ended the bull market and now we are back here.\nUh give me some commentary on just like the long-term price action that you see in Coin.\nYeah, I mean um I think you're right that again the private markets take signal from the public markets.\nUm they see Circle doing well, they see Coin doing well and now you see all these sort of uh longer tail companies now looking to IPO kind of based on comps, right?\nThey're saying, \"Well, hey, if they can get this kind of price with this kind of multiple, maybe we can also get something pretty favorable.\"\nUm we'll see.\nI think Coinbase has been kind of a strange uh company on Wall Street where some people look at it and it's just a total dog and they're like this thing, I remember even the narrative in 2019 was they need to shift away from exchange revenues and there's going to be fee compression and they need to be more of like a bank and then that was like just totally obliterated right in like 2020 2021 whereas like oh yeah maybe if there is no fee compression maybe they have some sort of uh regg mode maybe they'll change this time around.\nI do think you know certainly um some of the other trading platforms and certain that ETF launch um you could argue has been cannibalistic to um some of the revenues, but it's also has so many strong tailwinds behind it.\nUm I don't know if I'm going to uh jump the boat here uh jump the gun here a little bit on on Robinhood, but that's been the other kind of crazy all-time high move um you know, from the past few weeks has been and and you know, what is it like 30 40% of their revenue is also coming from from crypto.\nSo like\nOh, really?\nI didn't know it was that much.\nYeah, if you look at their last earnings report, um it's very very heavily crypto and it's a very weird segment of crypto.\nLike I think um their number one or number two asset was like Doge.\nUm and and so it's just um just a totally different type of user than probably user trading on on on Coinbase or you know trading on Uniswap.\nAnd so um you know but again if you think about them as like a crypto beta play um I think that that's probably another you know sort of attractive position.\nYeah.\nAre you saying okay so the recent price action in Hood is just phenomenal.\nThey also like you said got obliterated throughout like post um uh when the uh interest rates started going higher and higher and higher in 22.\nThey also uh Hood Robinhood launched also in 2021 August of 2021.\nSo pretty similar to Coinbase timing actually.\nUh and then you know launched at $60 and just got obliterated.\nWent down below $10 for a very long time.\nSomething like 2 years it stayed below $10.\nAnd then just in um let's see when was it about the start of 2024 it was $10 and it started creeping upwards to where it is now at $83.\nUh how much do you credit crypto as a part of this price increase?\nDo you think what the the all-time high that Hood is seeing and continually breaking on a week- overweek basis is that downstream of crypto or is that more of is just like regular business do you think?\nUm hard to say.\nI mean again as a percentage it's it's quite high.\nSo if you think of hey like that being a driving force then um you know I I I think it's it's like a uh certainly a big part of it.\nI I don't think weirdly that's been a big part of Robinhood's public story.\nLike if you think of all their new product announcements is actually been about trying to take their existing user base and upsell them and convert them and turn them into this more sort of long-term financial plan which planner which has been or you know asset managers been kind of their whole story the whole time where it's like hey you you come for the meme stock trading and you stay for the 401k and the uh you know I I think maybe honestly yeah for it's definitely been I think a good move on their part.\nUm, interestingly, I saw some research recently that a lot of the zoomers and the alphas are not actually getting onto Robinhood.\nUm, it's like they kind of captured this like millennial cohort that I feel like I'm a part of and they're aging with the platform.\nThey're staying in Robinhood, but the youngs are not actually onboarding and so maybe that's okay.\nMaybe you're getting people as a kind of age into their peak earning years, but um kind kind of uh maybe a little bit counter to kind of the the public narrative for them.\nYeah, that is counter to my understanding.\nUh I mean, I guess I could account for that in a couple reasons.\nMaybe zoomers just don't have that money that much money yet.\nUh maybe they're just not in not investing because I can't imagine where they would go.\nLike I don't see them opening up a TD TDM trade or any other sort of trad brokerage.\nSo if they're not going to Robinhood, I kind of think they're my gut take is that they're not doing anything.\nYeah, that's certainly possible.\nUm maybe they're going on chain, maybe they're uh you know uh I don't know, trading Tik Tok.\nYeah, whatever.\nUm I just pulled up their Q1 earnings.\nSo in Q1 2025 or 2025 uh Robinhood made 252 mil gross on cryptocurrencies out of 927 mil gross for the quarter.\nSo pretty substantial.\nI mean they made they made more in crypto than they did on options.\nUh they made five times more than they made on equities.\nAnd so um yeah it's it's a big part of the business.\nThey have a pretty big announcement at ETHCC in can is that is going on Monday.\nI'm going to that event.\nSo, uh, actually they already gave me the embargo.\nIt's a very large announcement.\nIt's pretty cool.\nI'm pretty stoked for it.\nUh, so Banklessation, you guys will see that in your podcast feed on Tuesday of next week.\nSo, uh, stay, uh, hold your breath for that.\nOne last thing before we move on.\nI don't know if you pay attention to this as much as I do or other people in the industry, but a growing number of people keep on showing me this hood coin ratio.\nSo, yeah, we got the Bitcoin ether ratio, uh, but now we also have the hoodcoin ratio.\nSo like there is also similarly um similarly valued uh I don't know if this is the price yeah this is the price over price not valuation over valuation but the valuation is both around roughly $75 billion.\nSo people are in this like horse race between Coinbase and Hood.\nI don't know if you have an affiliation here Tom that you would like to share.\nUh I do not have an affiliation.\nUm I guess I uh I don't know either individually other than maybe through an X fund or something.\nI um I don't know.\nI um I continue to be impressed frankly with Robinhood's product execution.\nUm I think when you get to a company of a certain age, there's a natural tendency to kind of fall off.\nAnd um I feel like they keep shipping fresh new products.\nI mean even I think their prediction market stuff um for the election and some of the newer stuff they've been doing.\nUm I mean just just cutting edge for um you know kind of a brokerage of their age.\nAll right, we're going to get into the rest of the news of the week starting with KI's raise.\nThey raised a bunch of money and Tom I think had the tweet of the week that we are going to talk about.\nI won't spoil that but I thought it was pretty good.\nUh and then we're going to get into how you can get a mortgage with your crypto.\nUh so we're going to get to all of that and more.\nBut first a message from some of these fantastic sponsors

This raise, this round, even though to my understanding, I don't think Khi has anything to do with crypto. This was nonetheless invested in by a bunch of crypto VCs, including Paradigm, Multicoin, and then also some people outside of crypto like Sequoia and some other VC firms that I am not familiar with. So, this has just kind of rocketed around the tradpto prediction market, I think, fitting in with the non-crypto media organizations. And so, I think you're kind of seeing like a bifurcation of the internet, and people are picking allegiances here. Everything is getting tribal these days.\n\nUm, like I alluded to, Tom, you have a spicy tweet. I don't want to get to that yet. I first want to kind of just get your take on a $2 billion valuation of a prediction market. I think everyone in crypto is generally bullish on prediction markets because that's kind of like our technology, and so that feels like our turf, and we have this non-crypto startup raising at a $2 billion valuation. What do you overall, what do you think about a $2 billion prediction market?\n\nUm, I don't think there's anything crazy about $2 billion for a prediction market. I think $2 billion for Koshi is a little nuts in my mind. I mean, you can see some of the metrics, I'm not particularly impressed in my mind. Um, I think they also obviously face this competition issue sort of I mentioned with Robinhood. I mean, certainly have this partnership with Robinhood to do distribution. Um, and that's, you know, pretty, pretty attractive in terms of fees, but you have this platform risk. There's also Forecastex, which is another, uh, you know, sei, uh, events, uh, platform that Robinhood used for the, um, election. Actually, they didn't use Koshi. Um, and, you know, again, they're the one who ultimately has the end relationship with the user. I think Polymarket has done a really good job of going direct to user, um, having their own brand. Um, I mean, Shane posted their, uh, you know, visitor numbers, um, and, you know, that they're putting up the same, um, order of magnitude of visitor numbers as, you know, some of the biggest, uh, sites in the space, but, um, I, I just don't really see that sort of affinity with Kio paid tweets from, uh, influencers versus actual, um, organic interest. But full disclosure, Dragonfly is also an investor in Polymarket.\n\nAh, okay. Okay. All right. Uh, one last question before we get into the tribal side of things. What, like, there are, what do you think about the crypto companies investing in a non-crypto? There's no actual firm, like, rules, like crypto VCs can't invest in non-crypto projects. There's no, there's no rules about that. But nonetheless, it's interesting to me that we have some crypto VCs investing in Polymarket's competitor. What's your gut take about that? Yeah, I, um, I mean, I do maybe Kelshi has some, uh, deeper features on the in the product roadmap that I'm, I'm not privy to. They do, I, they, or they did recently start to accept stablecoins, I believe. So maybe they see some of the opportunity in kind of the, uh, you know, DGEN trading going on in cryptoland and want some of it, but, um, they still miss out on the core component, and I think that's something that does not get brought up enough, which is Polymarket is actually happening on chain. Uh, I mean, you know, granted, they're using this order book, but like the trades settle on chain, you can see the balances, you can see the trades. Um, it's verifiable, you know, they're using for the oracle. Like, it's, it's very cool and transparent and embodies so much of, um, you know, the DeFi story, whereas Kelsey has, you know, none of that. It's, it's lally just an exchange that can take your stablecoins, uh, if you, if you want to send it to them.\n\nYeah. I mean, the main difference between Khi and Polymarket, of course, is that Koshi is legal for United States citizens and entities, and Polymarket is not. Uh, and so they're just like an offshore predictions market, right? Uh, and so, you know, in theory, it's possible to open up a VPN. I'm not recommending that, but that's technically possible if you're onshore. Uh, but it to me, it's maybe there's like a parallel here between like Circle and Tether, where Circle is offshore and has more freedoms, and, uh, excuse me, Tether is offshore and has more freedom. Circle is onshore and has more restrictions, but you get to have onshore customers. Uh, I feel like that's a fair comparison. What's your, what's your reaction?\n\nYeah, I actually like that. Um, I mean, I was going to say, I think, um, you know, maybe the comp was originally going to be, uh, Hood versus, uh, Coinbase, but, uh, I, I like the Tether-Circle comparison a little bit more. Um, I, I do think, you know, people underindex on the amount of, uh, uh, prediction market interest coming from outside the US. I mean, um, there's an, you know, for the longest time, what, um, uh, Lad Brooks was like the largest, uh, prediction market for the US election, which is a UK-based, um, sports betting, uh, site. And so you, there, there is, you know, it is the biggest election in the, in the, in the, in the world, and I think, um, there also just more and more events that people want to trade on. I mean, the New York mayoral election, Israel, Iran, it, it just kind of the way people consume news now.\n\nOkay. Uh, Tom, I would like to get into the spicy side of things. So you have freedom to take the muzzle off. This is a tweet that you tweeted out, uh, with some screenshots saying, \"Never forget that Khi is a team of little rats.\" And there are some stories here that this one came out of a pirate wires with a title of, uh, \"Kali paid influencers to target Polymarket CEO after a FBI raid.\" And then there are some other screenshots that have, I believe, somebody from Polymarket, uh, in DMs with an influencer who has a bunch of followers, uh, to retweet the tweet of, uh, CEO Shane Cop of Polymarket getting raided by the FBI right before the, uh, the Trump-Biden election. So maybe, uh, listeners might remember that the CEO of Polymarket, Shane, got raided. Um, I think to this day, no one really knows why. Uh, and we have verified screenshots of somebody from the Koshi team convincing a general influencer on Twitter to retweet the tweet saying, \"Yo, this guy looks guilty.\" Which, uh, is, uh, unfortunate behavior. I would, I would call that. And so that leads Tom here to call the coffee team a bunch of a bunch of rats. Uh, what's, tell me how you really feel, Tom?\n\nYeah, look, I'm, um, I'm all in favor of healthy product competition. Um, I would say, you know, this is just kind of the public story that's available on Koshi. There's a bunch of stuff below, uh, you know, the tip of the iceberg that maybe not, don't want to discuss on this podcast. But, um, yeah, I, I think, um, I, I mean, frankly, I just don't think they've been really been behaving as good actors in the space. Um, this is again one story. The rest might come out, um, in in public, but I, I don't think it's okay to, like, you know, basically libel your competitors, um, or to, uh, you try to beat them on things that aren't just product. And so, um, I think on the flip side, Shane has been like an unbelievable builder. He's been building Polymarket for, you know, over 5 years, 6 years, even during the bare market when there's no volume. Um, and he built it in a way that I think again embodies, uh, the spirit of crypto and the spirit of DeFi and what we're trying to do. I think there's many ways to take a shortcut. Um, and instead, he, he, you know, I mean, if you look at the contract, literally, it's like derived from the Nosis prediction market, you know, way back in like 2017, and so, um, there's kind of this nice through line here, and, um, I, I think it's also just an incredible utility for the world. Um, it's, it's crazy to me now that like so many world events, um, you know, we previously relied on, on, on pundits to give us our news, and, um, you often they were wrong, and I think we kind of saw this with most, most recently, the New York mayoral election, um, that, you know, uh, this is just a way better, better incentive-aligned version of, of how people get news now, and so, um, I'm very pro Polymarket, um, and again, I just don't, I, yeah, I, I don't want to get too, too much into it, but, um, I think we need to kind of, you know, do some self-pleasing as an industry and, uh, you know, weed out the bad actors.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, for those that, that don't remember, I remember Khi was operating in this very limited capacity because they were under a lawsuit from the CFTC, uh, that was really restricting their ability to just like operate as a startup at all. And then they, they won that lawsuit or something like this, and that, that went, that restriction went away, and they were finally open, able to open their doors like not too long before the US election. Uh, and so they really advertised themselves as like the only legal place for United States citizens to bet on the outcome of the United States election, but they were just so late to the game because Polymarket had already more or less like started to really crescendo in volumes, uh, ahead of the US election. So, they were just very clearly coming from behind. And like, my first impressions of them was like, \"Man, I kind of feel bad for them because the CFTC was really like not letting them off the leash.\" Uh, and they were really hamstrung by the fact that Polymarket was able to operate because they were targeting an international international client base. And then so they had to do some like kind of like kind of mean tweets, uh, pointing at Polymarket, and I was like, \"Okay, but I, I get it. They're an underdog. They need to like clamor for relevancy.\" Uh, and so I, I remember some of these mean tweets from the Kouchy team going out, like trying to to fight for relevancy. And I was like, \"Okay, you know what? Like, I, I get it. Like, they, they kind of need it.\" But then the, the, the distastefulness also crescendoed as well. And they've kind of never really lost that. Uh, it's like more than scrainess. It's like kind of just like actual, uh, yeah, distastefulness growing out of the ki side of things. That's my, that's my account of history. And again, I won't ask you to comment anymore unless, unless you're, unless you have something to say.\n\nYeah. I, I, I think a good limit test is, uh, if there's anything that you're doing that you wouldn't want to come out in discovery or, you know, for everyone in public to see, probably shouldn't be doing it. And I think there's a lot of things going on at Koshi that probably are in this bucket. Um, so again, fine to send a mean tweet, fine to, uh, you know, compete on product, but, um, yeah, it didn't exactly stop at the mean tweets. It just only got worse from there. Yeah. And then, yeah, and I've also just heard rumors of Khi just operating very nefariously under the table, but nothing I can actually like substantiate. So, um, all right, let's get into, I think, what the crypto Twitter's favorite news of the week. This came out of the US Director of Federal Housing. So, he's an appointee by Donald Trump, I believe, uh, who tweeted out, \"After significant studying and keeping with Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage.\" And so this is, uh, this individual who is ahead of the matters that are relevant for this to get the, uh, the Franny Mae and Freddie Mac, which are in the kind of this like pseudo-private, public-operated, uh, companies that, uh, just do mortgage, I can't really remember, I'm losing my 08 history, but they just manage the mortgage standards in the United States, uh, and they started to get heavily regulated post-08 crisis, uh, and so they are being ordered to look into the possibility of allowing crypto assets to be, like, leveraged as like valid liquid assets for people's mortgages. So, the memes on crypto Twitter, of course, just went straight into, uh, the, the big short movie where people are looking at the, I can't remember the, the individual who\n\n\ncalled the big short.\n\nUm, but we have mortgages. What's his name? Michael Burry.\n\nMichael Burry, thank you. Michael Burry realizing that there's a ton of mortgages in America that are totally collateralized with Fartcoin and SXP69,000, which of course is not in the actual order, but like there was no general specific cryptocurrency that was labeled, just like crypto can now be assets for mortgages. Uh, Tom, when you saw this news, what was your reaction?\n\nYeah, I mean, uh, maybe two initial reactions. One, and maybe verify this because this is what I remembered. Um, when the Bitcoin and ETH ETFs launched, the DTCC, uh, the Depository Trust and Clearing Commission, marked both of those ETFs with 100% haircut for collateral in US brokerages, meaning you can't actually borrow against these ETFs the same way you can for an S&P ETF or any, frankly, any sort of equity or bond or anything else you would hold in your brokerage. These basically count as zero for collateral. Um, and that hasn't changed. Um, and so it would be extremely bizarre to me if you can count your crypto assets as collateral for your mortgage, but you can't count your crypto ETFs as collateral for your margin alone, which is...\n\nI feel, if anything, if we were taking the more like marginal steps forward, the ETFs would be the only thing that would be valid, and even crypto on-chain crypto would be considered not valid.\n\nYou would think so. And they could do it with, you know, the stroke of a pen, right? You just change the haircut, and, uh, instead, they haven't. And so I would love to see that change. Um, I mean, this goes with all these sort of weird accounting rules. You remember when, um, there was the SEC staff bulletin around, you know, not being able to count crypto assets as assets on your balance sheet, but only could only be liabilities, which stopped all these banks. And so I think there's a lot of weird plumbing in the general finance ecosystem that still is kind of keeping crypto back in some ways, and this being one of those. Um, and two, I mean, there are a number of startups that have kind of positioned themselves as, you know, we are the mortgage lending platform that accepts crypto as collateral. Um, and I wonder what's going to happen to them now. I mean, maybe the answer is they move into, you know, more, you know, riskier versions of this, or maybe they go, um, you know, target different geos or something. But, um, it feels like in some ways this is kind of cannibalistic for those businesses.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so really what I'm understanding here is like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, they are the gatekeepers of what assets are legitimate or not legitimate for mortgages. And then after that, like once we open up the gates for things like Bitcoin, Ether, like perhaps even more longtail crypto assets to be valid for mortgages, then it kind of goes up to the free market of the banks, like, all right, banks, what are you guys comfortable with? Uh, and so I guess this is where that kind of private public partnership around Freddie May and Freddie Mac comes in. Like the government says, like, no, crypto assets are illegitimate. Uh, and so even with this, uh, may, maybe like, I don't know what Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac needs to even do in order to like make this a new rule. Maybe that's just like, like you said, like a stroke of the pen, and we could just have this good news event show up on Twitter like next week. Maybe it's that that simple. But even after that, then banks start to actually need to be okay with it, which I think is a pretty large hurdle in of itself.\n\nYeah, that's a good point. And I think we've seen that, um, even for just, you know, allowing clients to buy Bitcoin or not even the ETFs, and some banks immediately jumped on the opportunity, and some have still been slow to sort of adopt. And so, um, who knows what this is going to look like for mortgage lenders. Um, maybe again, there will just be a distribution, um, along the risk curve. Um, but, uh, I mean, hey, it's still a good step forward, uh, even if this is just the literally the very first baby step, um, in this process.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnyways, um, maybe one day we do have a financial crisis because we have mortgages collateralized by coins, too much fart coin in the system.\n\nIn the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance, the protocol revolutionizing stable coins, DeFi, and Rolex.

So, I'm going to bring up just a talking point. Uh, Vitalik tweeted out this tweet, which is a retweet of Joseph Lubin. Uh, and Joseph Lubin is tweeting out Ethereum layer 1 will be the master ledger for the world. Vitalic retweets this tweet saying Ethereum layer 1 L1 is the world ledger, to which I retweet. So we're going nesting dolls of retweeting, and I say subtle change from Ethereum to Ethereum layer 1. And I have mixed reviews on this tweet. I have some people being like, bro, these are, this is so pedantic, like this is nothing new. Uh, other people are saying, like, oh no, Vitalic Buterin specifying that it's the Ethereum layer 1 that is the world ledger and not broad Ethereum is actually significant. Where do you lie between these two debates?\n\nI, I mean, I think it's, uh, I don't know if it's significant, but certainly different than the language that he's used in the past. I still, I don't know if this quite communicates the shift, the vibe shift that we've seen in Ethereum land of more of a focus on the L1. It's almost like by distinguishing the fact that it's the L1 and not an L2, like you kind of draw attention to this weird, uh, sort of split, which has been, I think, a big point of the drama in Ethereum land. And so...\n\nWhy not just call it Ethereum? Why not just call it, you know, why not just call it Ethereum and mean the layer one, you mean like at the same time?\n\nYes.\n\nYes. It's almost like when you're overly specific, you sort of invite more questions, um, versus, you know, that the product is what the product is, and there's not really any more additional explanation or verbage required. And so, um, a little bit weird, but I mean, hey, at least there's some sort of narrative congealing around Ethereum, Ethereum L1.\n\nYeah, there's narrative congealing around Ethereum layer 1, which I'm a big fan of. And I, I accept the point that it is really also driving a wedge between the fact that there's this layer 1, layer 2 dynamic, and there are some people in on like one side of the Ethereum aisle that layer twos are Ethereum. They are the same thing as Ethereum. They're part of the system. And then there are other people who are like, no, they are technically not Ethereum, and they're technically their own layer 2s, and, uh, naming them under the broad Ethereum umbrella is not helpful and not productive and also takes away focus from the Ethereum layer 1 that I'm kind of leaning, I've been leaning towards the side more and more and more lately, and I, I actually think it actually is almost critically important for us to figure this out because Ethereum the layer one, I think there needs to be a line there as to what is and what is not Ethereum, and in being inclusive of things that I think are truly actually pretty desperate from Ethereum, like the mostly the rollup landscape that we know today, Base, Worldcoin, World Chain, like Arbitrum, which are separate chains that use Ethereum for security, there should be a separation there, in my opinion, there should be a line there, and when we say Ethereum needs to be at the world ledger, people ought to, like I like you said, ought to think Ethereum the layer 1 without having to consider the layer 2s, and layer twos are just customers of these things or just external protocols, and we need to expand the capacities and the TAM of the Ethereum layer 1 to the best of its ability and not have layer 2 be inclusive of that. I'm on my soapbox right now, but, uh, I wonder, wondering what your take is.\n\nYeah, I, I think probably right. I mean, I think a good litmus test is like what percentage of different L2 users know that they're using Ethereum, um, or think they're using Ethereum. They're now they're settling back to Ethereum, right? Um, I think there's, there's probably a spread there, but like I think a lot of people on Base probably don't think about that. Um, you know, they, they're probably...\n\nAnd is interested in growing those numbers, by the way.\n\nYeah. Well, I, I'm not saying this, uh, in an accusatory way. I think it was mal if you're, you know, using a wallet as a service, if you're funding through your Coinbase smart wallet. Frankly, if you're funding through Coinbase and using cash, like why would you ever think that, you know, you're using Ethereum or thinking about where does this transaction actually go? You're just thinking, oh no, I want to go, you know, buy this coin or I want to go coin this song or, you know, whatever, whatever it is that you're actually doing. Um, which is great. I think that's the way crypto goes mainstream. I think that was a large part of Polymarket's success, frankly, in the election was you can just sign up and use this thing the same way you would use a web 2 app. Um, but the downside is, you know, Ethereum is pitching itself as infrastructure and and plumbing, and uh, that kind of gets lost when, um, you know, users are, are, uh, different than what crypto users look like today, right?\n\nYeah, there, there are different cohorts of users, people that kind of understand, pop open the hood and look at the chains that they are touching, and then there are users who are just using apps and they don't care, and they just want to press the buttons and they don't really give a about what blockchain they are on, they just want it to go fast and and work. Uh, and yeah, the the growth of those users, uh, is not going to be found on the Ethereum layer 1 if the Ethereum layer 1 doesn't focus on itself in that in that same kind of capacity.\n\nYeah. And and to be clear, I think that's totally fine. I think users should care about a chain being fast and cheap. And I think that is, you know, part of Ethereum's goal is to, um, make this, make it the obvious choice, um, for developers, for users, that it just kind of blends into the background, which I think something that Solana got right. And that's why so many people were, were, were choosing it when they were looking to just have some very simple plumbing for their app.\n\nYep. Certainly. Certainly. Uh, yeah, it was a late week, Tom. I really appreciate you coming, going through the news with me. Since we have a little bit of extra time, what's exciting to Tom? What are you interested about? You guys have done a couple of, uh, uh, club, uh, order book based exchange episodes on the Chopping Block. What else is going through your mind? What are you, what are you looking at that no one else is looking at?\n\nYeah, we had, uh, Vlad from Lighter. It's a ZK-based, uh, per DEX on the on the Chopping Block this week. Um, very cool tech. They do pre-verifiable matching, um, of orders. So you don't have to trust, uh, you know, a single party even for a DEX to match orders together. And so you get this really nice UX. Um, I always have my, my pet favorite port. Um, one that I really am a fan of right now is this company called Mega Pot. Um, they were trying to build the world's largest lottery.\n\nCo-investors in Mega Pot.\n\nOh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Uh, very cool. I mean, yeah, already up to a million dollars today, uh, for the jackpot. Um, and I think the coolest part is a, it's global. B, it's verifiable. It's on-chain. Uh, but C, users get to be the house. Um, right. You can, there's a Uniswap style LP mechanism where you can provide liquidity, or you can buy a token. Um, and the market sort of sets the rate for, uh, you know, what percent goes back to the house. So, it's not just, uh, 50%, which is kind of the standard for for a lottery.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. And to be clear, this is a normal lottery that you see when you are driving down your highway and you see the Mega Millions, like X billion dollar jackpot. Same exact structure. No different except for the fact, as Tom said, that the user also gets...\n\n\nTo be the house. The payoffs are much more fair, cuz I think like the rational dollar going into like a Megaillions or something is worth 22 cents in terms of like actual EV. Uh, Mega Pod is something much more close to an actual dollar. Uh, $1 in almost $1 out. Uh, and then uh, users also get to be the yield on the other side. So like I think users so that the LPs have been earning somewhere between like 22 and 25% APY. Uh, there's a bunch of mechanics uh which with how that works, but like any any time that no one wins the lottery, the LPS just continue to rack up yields and they ticket sales. So it's it's fun that we get to have both sides of the market benefit. You can be a customer of both. I think it's pretty cool. Yeah, it's I mean I think ultimately you let the market speak and that's how you kind of get innovation. I think it's also frankly just cool as basically building an API for for lottery tickets. I mean sort of like strike with a single line you get to do credit card checkout single line of code you can buy a ticket. You can be an LP. You can sell a ticket. Um, you can combine it with other people. All sorts of cool stuff people are building on top of it. So um that's a pet favorite port right now.\n Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. Were you um down at Permissionless at all this week?\n I was.\nUm, Yeah. seen some folks doing a couple interviews. Overall, pretty good vibe other than the fact that it was like 100 degrees in New York.\n Yeah, it was bad.\nYeah.\n Yeah. But definitely the the permissionless attendance was actually pretty good as far I was concerned that uh attendance for permissionless was going to be down because it was in New York because New York is such a um there's a magnet for side events there. Uh, but man, people love going to the actual conference. Uh, and and I mean this is what happens when podcasters I think organize uh panels. It's like it's actually like good and worth interesting and worth going. And also Block Works just did a killer job just organizing in industry city. There was like a Zerox research dunk tank. So all the Zerox research boys were getting dunked, which was pretty fun. And overall, yeah, the vibes were like pretty good and upbeat and everyone was there. Yeah.\n Yeah. Got to give a Yeah. Shout out to the Block Works crew for organizing another great permission list.\n Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Tom Schmidt, you are a podcaster. If people liked your takes and like the sound of your voice, where can they go hear you?\nUh, they can find me on Twitter. I'm Tom Hmidt Smi Dt. Or you can check out the Chopping Block. We're Chopping Block on Twitter. Um, and yeah, you can check out Dragonfly or uh see me online and you know me already, but thanks for having me on on your pod. It was great.\n Yeah, I really appreciate it, my man. It was a ton of fun. Bankless Nation, you guys know the deal. Crypto is risky. You can lose what you put in, especially if you put it into a lottery. That's half of the point. Nonetheless, this is a frontier. We are glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.\n",
