  "cleanText": "It's not going to be long until people say ETH belongs in a portfolio with Bitcoin. But coming back to the tech stock part, it just you're missing the forest for the trees. You're saying that cash flows are just one tiny tiny portion. We should be looking at what digital oil means for the digital economy, what a store of value asset, what a reserve asset, what a fuel actually means. And that belongs in the same conversation, in the same valuation zone as Bitcoin, if not higher.\n\nBankless Nation, we have VC and Danny from Etherealize. They just released a report. I really like the name here. It's called The Bull Case for Ethereum. Digital oil store of value and global reserve asset for the digital economy.\n\nVivek and Danny, welcome back to Bankless.\n\nThanks for having us. All right, let's get into it. There's a lot of bullishness in this report today. What is the bull case for Ether the asset? I'll throw this one to, uh, well, who wants it? Danny, VC, who's more bullish between question, please.\n\nI will kick it off. I think that we are in this renaissance period where everyone knows the value of Ethereum, the platform, Ethereum, the blockchain. We're seeing institutional adoption, we're seeing tokenization, we're seeing stable coin adoption. We're seeing even on the regulatory front, um, the Clarity Act and the Genius Act, which are, which is, you would have said this years ago, um, it'd be the most shocking thing ever, and here we are with everything the stars aligning for the Ethereum ecosystem. We want to highlight that in addition to Ethereum, there is this wonderful asset called ETH, which isn't called out enough, that has, um, incredible store value properties and has been misunderstood and is one of the best opportunities in the ecosystem to play upside and growth. So, we're here to highlight that, and we wanted to focus on that today.\n\nI, uh, I like that this report is focused on Ether the asset, and, um, you know, it's something that I felt like for a long time we haven't done enough in the Ethereum community is, is we, we talk about the virtues of Ethereum the network all of the time. This report in contrast is all about Ether the asset.\n\nDanny, I'm wondering if you could add to Vivek's bullishness there by way of, uh, intro.\n\nYeah. So, I mean, as you know, I've spent nearly the past decade working on the Ethereum platform, but in a cryptoeconomic platform, in a, in a blockchain, you know, the platform, the network, and the, the fundamental asset in relation to it are inextricably tied. And when we're working on a secure protocol, when we're working on a sustainable mechanism, when we're working on scaling things out, um, you know, we're also working on and always thinking about, um, that asset that sits in the middle that, that runs it, that secures it, that is, you know, the, the most pristine version of collateral within it. Um, and by kind of laying the foundation of a truly decentralized, very resilient, and ultimately like, very economically sound platform, you, we've also been working on the asset itself. And so I, I think it's just worth highlighting that these things are, you know, nearly one and the same.\n\nYeah, you guys have a, your work cut out with you for you guys at, um, Etherealize. This is the moment where I think a lot of the people in the industry from like, you know, 2013, 2015 on, realize that like, oh, eventually the world's largest institutions are going to wake up to blockchain technology and figure, figure out how to leverage it. And this is what we're watching in real time, right? Like, Circle just went public. Uh, a lot of traditional financial institutions are looking to tokenize real world assets. Uh, you guys are the conduits between Wall Street and actually building and delivering products on Ethereum. And I feel like there's just a mountain of work that you guys have to do because there's so many Wall Street institutions out there that have products that they can sell that utilize Ethereum, utilize Ethereum block. Uh, and then also now we have this focus on Ether the asset. So, in your list of priorities, uh, why, when there, when there's so many Wall Street institutions out there, talk to me about why selling Ether the asset or explaining the, the investment thesis behind Ether the asset is sufficiently high in that list of priorities when you could also just, you know, uh, consult, advise on more stable coins or, you know, fixed income trading on chain or any of these other things that utilize Ethereum the network. Why is Ether the asset so high on your priorities? So, Becca, I'll start with you.\n\nI think that it's the most positive something in the entire crypto ecosystem for ETH the asset to perform well, and it makes it creates a tailwind for the whole ecosystem. Of course, there's going to be tokenization on ETH. Of course, there's going to be stable coins on ETH. Of course, there's going to be layer 2s that are institutional on ETH, and we've been focused very, very heavily on that for the last eight months. But we have come across questions like, what about ETH the asset? We don't understand the asset, and these are part of institutional conversations. So all this does is improves our arsenal for a full blitz of adoption. Um, of course, we'll continue selling Ethereum, but it's two sides of the same coin. Um, no pun intended, but we have to talk about ETH as well. And I think that in the past people have been so focused on Ethereum and not on ETH and realize that that by selling both together, it creates a flywheel. So we're happy to talk about ETH. It's a different way into different types of institutions. Not all institutions want to build L2s, so you can teach them about ETH. Not all institutions want to tokenize assets, but they have RAAS and they have people that have ETH ETFs. So having one universal narrative gives us an arsenal to go into everybody and fully blitz Ethereum and ETH. And this is, this is the, the most natural place to begin the, uh, financial and technical literacy that, you know, we're hoping to promote and beginning to promote, uh, in, in Wall Street and institutions beyond. Um, you know, this, this helps them understand the network. This help them, helps them understand the relationship between ETH and all the things that are happening on it. I mean, and honestly, like, if you read this report, it highlights all of the fantastic parts of Ethereum, of the community, of the network, um, as it relates to this asset. So, it's really kind of an entry point to that institutional education in Blitz, but there's, there's so many other things, um, you know, and this is, this is the tip of the iceberg. So, you know, expect plenty of, uh, institutional grade, uh, content coming our way, coming from our way.\n\nWhat's the conversation like when you open up this conversation with somebody from, from Wall Street or some institution? Are, are they approaching you guys about questions about Ether the asset? Are you guys going to them? What's their base level of knowledge about Ether the asset? Like, what, what do they already understand to be true? What are the things that they're shocked about? Like, what's just the average, like, base case for what the average institution or, or Wall Street individual understands about ETH? And like, also, what's their level of curiosity about it?\n\nThe base case is what's giving us the biggest opportunity, which is people want to tokenize assets. People want to employ stable. People want to use Ethereum, but they just don't know about ETH the asset. It's not the first thing that comes to mind, and, and that's partially on us. We have, we have such a network of such amazing utility that, um, the asset almost comes second. And we're here to say that ETH is one of the greatest opportunities, I think, the highest upside opportunities in the digital asset space. We'll never get a moment like now where there's so much curiosity and so much capital being invested across the crypto ecosystem. Every single bank is going to need a blockchain strategy. Every asset manager is going to need a blockchain strategy. Everyone wants to learn about this ecosystem. If we don't, if we just end up with a single spore of value across the whole crypto ecosystem in this renaissance, that'll be kind of a sad outcome. And there will be multiple stores of value. And we think ETH is right up there with Bitcoin. And institutions are yearning to learn more. They're just itching for a narrative. They're itching for some, for some guidance. And this report, the other 40 pages saying, \"Here's all the content in the world. Here all the things that, um, make ETH an amazing store of value, an amazing treasury asset, an amazing strategic reserve asset. Um, and let's put a meme on it, too. I mean, Bitcoin's digital gold. ETH is digital oil.\" We're going back to the old school meme and saying that they're complimentary assets and both should be part of a portfolio and both have enormous upside, and institutions are, are large and complex and don't necessarily, you know, one side and one person doesn't necessarily talk to the other. Um, so it really depends on who you're speaking with, right? There's, there's people who understand ETH, but they don't know how to sell it, and they want to know how, how do, how do they communicate this better to people. There's people that understand Ethereum deeply, but haven't thought much about ETH and want to understand like, how it relates to, to that and staking and this and that and the other, and then there's people that like, you know, know that they need to know about blockchain, but don't know where to start, you know, and so this becomes a good place to start, and it just, it's kind of spans the gamut, but this I think is a great entry point for all of those.\n\nIn the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance, the protocol revolutionizing stable coins, DeFi, and Rolex.

I mean, so in the, in the intro to this, you have some, uh, some words that I think grab institutional investors' attention. You say, \"ETH is the next generational asymmetric investment opportunity positioned to emerge as a core holding for institutional digital asset portfolios. Yet ETH today remains among the most significantly mispriced opportunities in global markets today.\" I assume you mean misplay, mispriced on the, um, you know, the low side rather than the, the high side, because you've got some numbers in here that are going to melt, uh, melt brains. We'll get into that in a bit.\n\nVC, I want to get to this, uh, meme that you're going with and you're putting forward. One, one of the things I liked about this report is it's really, it's not just an Etherealized report. It's kind of a, an ETH bull community type report, like a lot of these metaphors, memes, even some of the, um, vetting that you did, I know, were for members of the ETH community. And so you're, you're using some of these longstanding metaphors and, uh, analogies to really tell this story, but let, let's focus in on the one you went with, the, the primary metaphor of ETH is digital oil. Why the digital oil metaphor? What's, um, well, maybe first let me ask this. What's the market value of oil? I mean, I think people are pretty familiar with, um, gold, something like 20 trillion, something like this. Uh, how about, uh, oil? What's the, what's the market cap of oil?\n\n$85 trillion. So, there's some upside. So, we like it because it's a bigger number. Is that why we like it?\n\nWe like it for a lot of reasons. One is it's a bigger number. Um, oil is a strategic asset. It is a strategic reserve asset. It powers economies. It's, uh, um, it's stockpiled on a, on a national level. It's used globally. Um, ETH is that store of value, but for, oil was the basis of the industrial revolution. We're now seeing a digital revolution. ETH is the digital oil for that digital revolution. And we think it has, it's going to have the same amount of importance.\n\nLet's explain this. Uh, you know, pretend we are institutional investors. You've got this section in here comparing it to oil, and you're saying, uh, ETH is like fuel for compute. Mechanically, Danny, how is ETH fuel for compute?\n\nSo, when you send a transaction on the Ethereum network, there is a going market rate to utilize, you know, the limited amount of, of block space there is, and that is priced in in ETH, right? So, this is just one component of ETH's relationship to this, uh, complex network and and economy. Uh, but it certainly fuels transactions. Uh, and we don't need to get hung up on, uh, the burn because that's I think one of many different mechanisms and relationships that ETH has to, uh, to its value. Uh, but a portion of it is burned. So you do get a literal, uh, you know, you get, you get that kind of\n\n\nLiteral transition there.\nBut at the same time, a lot of the, although the critical importance of ETH to this economy, you might compare to oil.\nUh, you can't just pump more ETH, right?\nThere's known supply dynamics.\nYou know, the protocol itself, even if all ETH were staked, you know, you're capped at like 1.5% issuance per year.\nAnd even then, that's kind of an extreme scenario that we don't expect, given the incentive structures here.\nSo, that's a good point, one that you guys make in the paper.\nSo, you say, unlike traditional commodities like, say, something like oil, increased demand for ether cannot trigger increased production, inevitably leading to an acute supply squeeze as adoption accelerates.\nSo, VC, can you explain that a bit more?\nSo, you know, of course, if you have a commodity like oil or silver or even something like gold, the higher the price, the more people mine it, the more people extract it because there's value in doing that, and the cost to kind of extract it, um, like makes it worthwhile because of the price of the commodity itself.\nThat is not the case for ether, the asset.\nAnd why is that a distinction worth noting?\nI think it's one of the most important distinctions.\nI think ETH is such a simple asset that we've overcomplicated because there's a whole network.\nThere's a whole economy, but it's basically Bitcoin with an economy under it, um, which I think gives it tremendous offset and tremendous value.\nBut coming back to Bitcoin has a me'd supply cap very well, for better or worse.\nUm, we can discuss the supply cap as a different discussion point, but let's assume that 21 million is the supply cap.\nETH has an issuance cap.\nETH is predictable, too.\nETH has a very, very easy, predictable, modelable formula for supply, and the max amount of potential issuance ever annually, if fees are zero and if all ETH is staked, is 1.51%.\nThat's really, really important.\nWe're in this world where the world is yearning for new types of assets to invest in.\nThere's a lot of inflation going on globally.\nThere's a lot of macroeconomic stuff.\nWe need multiple stores of value.\nIf we look at traditional stores of value, you have, it's not just gold.\nYou have real estate.\nYou have treasury bonds.\nYou have the stock market as a store of value.\nThere's a lot of global store of values.\nThere will be a lot of very, very high-value store value assets.\nETH, by having an issuance cap, is arguably one of the best, if not, I think, the best, um, uh, store of value asset in the digital economy.\nI want to know how well this metaphor lands with TradFi.\nThis ETH is digital oil, uh, because it's one of the metaphors I think really fascinated me and Danny Ryan back in the early days, back when no one really understood anything about blockchain technology in like 2019.\nUh, one of the big things is something that you said, uh, Danny, I think, where there's this whole entire economy surrounding this currency, and I think, you know, nation-state currencies and bonds, there the bond market is really valued by the strength of the economy that they hold, like why is the economy of the United, why is the US dollar what it is?\nWell, the United States economy is really, really strong, uh, and the strength of fiat currencies is highly correlated to the strength of the economy that they correlate to, uh, and then there's also this notion of like this petro dollar, uh, where, you know, one, the currency of the United States dollar is tradable for this oil, and it directly correlates to, like, oh, if you want to like consume some, if you want to do some application on Ethereum, if you want to do anything on Ethereum, send stablecoins, tokenize real-world assets, trade real-world assets, you actually have to like consume some ether to power those applications.\nThat's what that's what the burn is.\nSo there's a really strong correlation in this metaphor with ether and oil to digital oil.\nNow, I'm wondering, VC, is that kind of like, okay, me and Ryan and you guys are just like huge nerds about Ethereum.\nWe understand this.\nDoes this land well with Brady institutions?\nDoes that make sense to them?\nIt absolutely does.\nAnd it's funny because you said digital oil was the original OG meme when we, and then we overcomplicated it.\nWe were like, wait, there's all these other cool things.\nWell, TradFi and the world is at the point where we're at the birth of institutional Ethereum, whether you're the birth of institutional adoption.\nGoing back to that digital oil meme, that's what catches on the most.\nWe go ask, is oil somewhat polarizing?\nYes.\nDoes is that fine?\nYes.\nDoes it elicit a reaction?\nYes.\nBut is it make it easier?\nDoes it show value?\nDoes it show that it's powerful?\nDoes it show that it's essential fuel for this new global economy?\nAbsolutely yes.\nSo, it's landing more than anything else, um, out there.\nAnd, and you guys were, you guys were the author of the meme that originally got me into ETH, the triple point asset.\nAnd I love the triple point asset.\nBut in wanting to simplify this a little more, I point to one of the points and, uh, it's resonated really well.\nIt's already, that's one that gets picked up.\nThe digital oil component, you know, one because some of the mechanisms that exist, some of the literal things that happen with ETH are like oil, but I think even more so, it captures the importance of it in relation to the digital economy building being built on top of Ethereum, you know, and that's, you know, the entire structure of Ethereum and the entire network of applications and users is all kind of centered around and structured around this asset.\nAnd it's, it's really that global importance, and then when you accent it with, again, the kind of known supply dynamics, you get a very, very interesting asset.\nI do think there's an analog to kind of add, you know, we've been talking about, um, ether as well, and you do also in this paper as a kind of a store of value as a having a monetary premium as well, but this idea of ETH being digital oil meshes with that, too, because, as David was mentioning, if you know folks who know their monetary history, know that effectively since Nixon took the US off the gold standard in the 1970s, we have been on the petro dollar, like, uh, petro dollar-backed US treasuries are the global reserve asset of the world.\nThat's what central banks buy, right?\nThat is the risk-free rate for the entire global economy.\nAnd it's all, it's not backed by gold right now.\nIt's backed by the US dollar.\nAnd as David mentioned, that is further backed by the strength of the US economy and also the strength of the US military, aka security, right?\nThose are things that the Ethereum network does provide.\nIt's got an economy.\nIt's got an entire onchain economy.\nYou mentioned some stats, uh, in your paper.\nIt secures almost 800 billion in total value right now.\nThat's kind of the amount that it's securing.\nAnd so you got an economy right now.\nAnd of course, you also have a military.\nThese are the validators.\nThis is the stake.\nUh, you know, $80 billion worth of military spend every single year.\nKind of dwarfs Bitcoin's, right?\nBitcoin is something like 10 billion.\nAgain, all these numbers are from your paper, which I, which I thank you for.\nAnyway, that analogy I feel like can work even for the, uh, the monetary history, you know, sort of, uh, you like, um, I guess Bitcoin types out there, uh, that want to think about it in monetary history terms.\nAgree completely.\nLet's talk a little bit more about the, uh, monetary design because I have to confess, um, I did not actually know VVC, the number 1.51% as the max issuance of Ether, the asset, and I guess like, maybe shame on me, right?\n'Cause like, I've been here for a little bit, and like, we've been talking about ETH monetary, you know, economics and issuance for a long time on Bankless, but I didn't actually have this number memorized.\nAnd that's interesting to me because I can quote, and everybody in crypto can probably quote how many Bitcoin are there ever going to be?\n21 million, right?\nEveryone knows that number.\nBut as Ethereum community members, we don't know our own issuance policy to the degree that we probably should.\nSo, let's spend some time to actually go through it.\nI don't think this will be, uh, maybe it'll be reviewed for some folks, but I think this could be, you know, good information for all of us.\nSo you said the max theoretical inflation issuance for Ether was 1.51% per year.\nOkay.\nCan you explain how we get the max and like what do we actually have?\nBecause that's the max, and we're lower than the max right now, and sometimes issuance of ETH is actually deflationary.\nSo can you give us some numbers here and explain this in some more detail?\nRight.\nSo there's a number of mechanisms at play.\nThe most critical to this conversation is the ether issued to proof-of-stake validators.\nSo Ethereum, the network, the protocol, is secured by this thing called proof of stake, uh, akin to proof of work.\nUm, and what happens there is, uh, users can take their ETH, they can lock it up.\nUh, it is now at, uh, it provides them essentially like the right and the responsibility to kind of secure the network, uh, and also that ETH is at risk, uh, which we don't need to get into at this point, but part of the reason you may do that is because of the ETH issued to validators.\nThere's no cap on the amount of ETH that can be staked other than the literal amount of ETH that exists, which is something like 120 million today.\nAnd there's this nice curve, um, where for each additional ETH staked, there's a slightly more ETH issued to cover that, but it's not a linear relationship.\nIt's actually like the inverse of the square root of the total ETH state.\nUm, this helps find a decaying curve for people who need to imagine curve, it doesn't matter that much, but it finds a better equilibrium than, you know, this fixed issuance, also linear relationship, you know, also has some degenerate outcome.\nSo this like degrading curve, um, allows for finding a nice equilibrium, um, without setting it in stone to start.\nSo anyway, you take essentially the total ETH that exists today and you plug it into that formula.\nIt has that square root function and a constant in relation to it, and you plug in 12 million and you get 1.151 uh% per year.\nUm, there are some nuances to this.\nSo if, uh, the ETH supply grows and literally all ETH is staked, which is this like degenerate outcome that we don't expect to happen because unreasonable outcome, but it's just something that we, you know, it's good to know the extreme limits of the system, but, uh, you know, if you had 125 million ETH in existence because of some issuance over time, um, that number actually goes down, the percentage that it can grow because, again, that square root relationship, inverse square root relationship.\nUm, so point being is, um, a little bit more ETH is issued depending on the amount of ETH that is staked.\nUh, but in the crazy scenario where all ETH is staked, there is a known maximum issuance that's 1.15 uh%, and in actuality, it's much lower because we have something like 30% ETH staked.\nUm, and the mechanism naturally targets values much lower than the total amount.\nThere are other things that accent this.\nSo the first input here that that is most critical is, okay, how much ETH stake, but, uh, they're given the burn mechanism.\nUm, there's a, you know, there's a fixed supply of block space.\nUm, increased demand on that block space burns a larger portion of the fees that come in, uh, from that.\nAnd so, you know, the supply and demand of the fee market does burn some amount of ETH.\nAnd so they're, they're given any amount of usage of Ethereum, uh, which we see very steady usage of, uh, you get some amount of burn.\nSo you augment that in the downward, um, and can in certain supply and demand, uh, scenarios have an actual negative issuance.\nUm, again, so we have, we start with this fixed cap, and any amount of like increased demand and usage augments it towards the lower.\nSo you have a very known quantity here.\nThis is a conversation that we've hashed on on Bankless a number of times, and I think it's worth kind of just placing this conversation into context about like, why do we talk about issuance?\nWhy do we talk about supply cap?\nAnd, you know, in 2025, I think it's easy to forget, but a lot of the crypto industry was born out of, uh, the DNA of the '08 crisis of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\nAnd this is where the 21 million supplied cap, like, chant came out of Bitcoin.\nUh, and I think like, we will say a very similar thing about the 1.51% maximum inflation rate of the ether, the native econ, the native money of the Ethereum economy.\nNow, it's a little bit different because, you know, Bitcoin has a 21 million cap, and Ethereum's cap is much more of an issuance cap, but it still comes from that same energy of having protocolized, codified, responsible monetary policy that's baked into the protocol that can't be changed by humans.\nNow, in Bitcoin's answer for this is just 21 million units.\nSo easy to reason about.\nThere will be no more is very much like gold.\nYou can think about it like digital gold.\nUh, and Ethereum is a little bit different, but it still has that same ethos of we want to put fundamental constraints on who can tinker with the monetary policy of the Ethereum, uh, economy.\nAnd so the Ethereum strategy has landed at this issuance cap, um, with some, with some nuances that Danny highlighted to do the same thing of putting guardrails on financial fiscal irresponsibility and make sure that the Ethereum, uh, ecosystem, the Ethereum platform will exist for our children and our children's children, our children's children's children's because no one got irresponsible with the money spigot.\nBut, uh, Danny, I want you to also tap into like, why is there a difference with Bitcoin?\nThe hard cap of the number of units versus Ethereum and the hard cap of the inflation rate because that's a choice that was made by the Ethereum design, and I'm wondering if you could just like under, like, help the listener unpack like why was that choice made and why is that important?\nSo if we could think about the mechanism here, we want a secure network.\nWe want a thing that works.\nWe want a thing that has what we call crypto economic security.\nTo have that, you have to have like a sound mechanism at the core, but you also like can't just debase the currency.\nYou have to have some bound to this, you know, fundamental asset of the network, otherwise, you know, number goes down or value in relation to the units of these things, uh, can go down, um, and you end up with an insecure network.\nThis is born from looking at monetary policy debasement, but it's in, it's even accentuated in these mechanisms because like the value of the asset and people wanting that asset is critical to the security of the system.\nSo, it's kind of the next layer of there.\nUm, in terms of long-term security,\n\n\nWe need to have long-term incentives to stake or mine in relation to a blockchain. And it turns out that Satoshi was just wrong. Satoshi was brilliant. Satoshi said, like, had that zero to one insight that we can create what have been called subsequently cryptoeconomic decentralized networks. Um, but at the end of the day, this curve that approaches a number and has no flexibility in relation to that, uh, will have fundamental security problems because the miners, or in a proof-of-stake network that adopted the same principles, or validators in the extreme, are just not going to have the incentives to show up and do the work. And it will become, in cryptoeconomic terms, cheaper and cheaper to attack these networks in the extreme. You know, I don't, I, uh, I know Justin Drake and maybe some others have predictions on dates of when that happens with Bitcoin. Um, I haven't gotten deep into those numbers, but I do know that there's a flaw in that mechanism in the long tail, whether that's in four years or 10 years or 15 years, whatever. But we're designing for, as you said, generations. Um, and this mechanism that does have, um, issuance but in a bound way, finds a better balance between long-term, uh, security and long-term value of the asset, underlying asset, because I mean, at the end of the day, uh, there is no value of Bitcoin if there's no security. So again, that's why I say, kind of the outset, it's not, it's not a sustainable, uh, model. And we, we've just, we've learned, you know, we've learned how to design these systems and make them better. The three words you guys have used in this report to describe, uh, Ethereum's monetary design is simple, transparent, and sustainable. I think Danny, you were just talking about the sustainability of it, maybe versus some sort of fixed supply mechanism that sort of runs out of security budget, let's say, at some point in the future. Um, I want to make sure we get kind of the simple part down. So, max theoretical inflation, if 100% of all ETH was staked, which is pretty much an impossible outcome, but if that happened, that's 1.51%.\nNow, practically, the uh, current annualized issuance of ETH is nowhere near 1.51% because we have other mechanics at play, much fewer ETH stake than the maximum, I don't know, 30%, something in that in that range, and also we have the burn. So the actual current annualized issuance is around 0.68%.\nAnd just to benchmark that, maybe you should look at Bitcoin's right now. This is after the most recent having. Um, Bitcoin's annualized issuance is 0.85%. And again, that is scheduled in about four years time to be cut in half, maybe just like less than four years time to be cut in half yet again. Whereas Ethereum's will stay, you know, the issuance, uh, you know, curve will stay, uh, the same. Now, the amount of issuance Ether has realized since the merge has been even lower than 0.68%. It's actually 0.09%, I believe, which seems outrageously low, but I suppose that's because during the earlier, um, you know, months post-merge, ETH was very squarely in deflationary territory. So when you're explaining this to investors, I mean, I guess you could show them the square root formula for max issuance if you really want to, but is it just simple enough to say, look, the max issuance this could ever theoretically achieve is like 1.51%. Likely it's going to be far below that, probably hovering around 1%. And there are times where of high demand and contention where it could spike down to 0% or in the negative territory. And like this is algorithmically defined, so it's transparent. Central banks can't fiddle with it. Nobody can really mess with it. It's part of the protocol, just as inherent in Ethereum as the 21 million is in Bitcoin. And it's sustainable. Is that just the core message here? Like, you know, if so, why has this been so hard to explain? I just think we need to come to first principles on it. I think people, the deeper they get into Ethereum and the more they become more and more enamored by the technology, by the blockchain, by the potential. Um, we came back to first principles. I want to explain this as a Wall Street asset, and you've highlighted exactly what the pitch is. Let's separate out the economy completely. Let's just take ETH, the asset, because that's basically Bitcoin, right? Bitcoin does not have an economy, so it just has an asset with a monetary policy. If we just take ETH as an asset, the max issuance ever, the issuance cap is 1.51%. Great. That's better than fiat. I think it's super interesting. It's programmatic. You can look at all the ETH software. It's open source, transparent. That's the max it'll ever be. Then you say, let's layer an economy on there. And actually, the more activity that happens, if you think Blockspace is going to fill up, if you think there's going to be more stable coins issued, if you think there's going to be more tokenization, if you think there more L2s, then Blockspace will get used and that means ETH becomes deflationary. So, I don't know, an asset with a max issuance of 1.51%, but that can actually go towards zero and even become deflationary. If we think blockchain adoption is going to pick up, which I don't think there's anyone out there that thinks blockchain adoption is not going to pick up, then it's a pretty compelling asset. I don't know. I think it should be a core holding. And I think when people think about which digital assets to hold as treasury assets or as part of a portfolio or when pitching to investors that want digital assets exposure, Bitcoin has crossed the Rubicon. For better or worse, Bitcoin is digital gold. So that's great. ETH is digital oil and ETH belongs as part of a portfolio, too. And that waiting, I think, has been almost 100% Bitcoin, 0% ETH for now. I think it's going to start shifting. We're already starting to see ETH ETFs pick up. I think it's been like 15 straight days of inflows. Um, we're already starting to see as a return to fundamentals happen for blockchain adoption as regulation becomes friendly, um, for stable coin and for decentralized systems that's going to flow through ETH. So, I think it's going to be the conversation is going to go from let's just have Bitcoin as a store of value to let's have Bitcoin and ETH as a part of a portfolio. And that's going to cause a ridiculous repricing, I think. And if that's kind of the core story of ETH's monetary design, then how do you, what do you say about kind of the yield, you know, of staked ETH? Is that sort of a cherry on top? Cherry on top. All of it. It's a cherry on top. I mean, it's, it's, it's ETH is digital oil is a great analogy. I think it's, um, it's memeable. I think it's, it captures, like you said earlier, a lot of the geopolitical and strategic importance of it. But it's much more than just oil. It's a store of value with yield. So if you stake ETH, you get a yield. So not only do you have this amazing monetary asset with a capped issuance, but you also get a staking yield. And that staking yield has a call option embedded for the finance people or just upside. If there's more activity, your staking yields higher. So you get indirect exposure to the growth of digital economy. I don't know, that seems pretty cool. Like so if you want digital gold, you buy Bitcoin. If you want upside in blockchain adoption, you buy ETH. And that's what the narrative needs to go to. If people want exposure to stable coins, you can buy circle. You can also buy ETH. If you want exposure to tokenization, you can buy ETH. So the narrative is very, it's going to realign. And I think the opportunity is right now. Um, but store value is worth a lot more than where ETH is right now as is well.\nI'm, I'm curious if institutions, Wall Street analysts, or just, you know, generally that archetype, if they come to you and they ask you the question, but why do I need to hold it? I think in this day and in this day and age with like MicroStrategy and like even the Michael Sailor archetype, there's some sort of like answer as to like why you need to hold Bitcoin on your balance sheet. Uh, I mean, I won't give you, I won't give that answer. I think that's Michael Sailor's job. But there is a compelling answer out there as like why Bitcoin needs to be on somebody's balance sheet. So I, I don't know if you get these same questions, like why do I need to hold as an institution who's like maybe I want to use Ethereum as a product. Um, but like do I need to hold it on my balance sheet? Like what would you say to that question? You don't need to, but you should. I mean, for all the reasons that Michael saying Bitcoin should be a treasury asset. I would argue, and you have the table up, that ETH should also be a treasury asset for all of those reasons, plus more, plus staking yield, plus the ability to generate revenue from your treasury asset. I would almost argue ETH's a better treasury asset. And now we have Joe Lubin leading the charge, um, with Sharplink with SBET, and he's going to show the use cases for ETH as a treasury asset, and let's line them up side by side and see. Um, there's a lot of arguments for why ETH should be as important or even better of a treasury asset. So yeah, you don't need to hold ETH. That's the beautiful part of it. Um, you can use ETH, you can use Ethereum, you can use stable coins, you can, we have everything is abstracted away. You have account abstractions. So no one needs to touch it, but they should. And that's part of that's part of the value of ETH that we want to highlight. Yeah. Another, another thing playing in here is like there is no, um, you know, set, set Bitcoin aside in terms of a programmable blockchain, in terms of a blockchain that, uh, glo, the global economy can be architected on top of, there's really no second place, um, in my opinion, and honestly, in a lot of institutions opinion, and honestly, in, uh, you know, if you look at some of the law happening in in the US, like in the perspective of that, there's not like a second best in terms of a an actually decentralized system, an actual system that reduces or nearly eliminates counterparty risk. Um, as we kind of rearchitect the global economy and the digital landscape. Um, and you see that in institutions when you speak to them, when they're talking about, uh, where would they think about tokenization, where would they they actually build products? Um, and the answer is, you know, by and large, almost entirely just Ethereum, because it does not have, you know, it doesn't have the counterparty, doesn't have somebody that owns the system, doesn't have central control points. When you go and look at, uh, draft legislation like the clarity act, you look at their decentralization or as they call it, their maturity test. You know, there's only, there's only one blockchain that isn't having to show up or one programmable blockchain that isn't having to show up and try to get carveouts or try to get specific language to make sure that they pass the test, right? Ethereum passes the test all the time because it was born, uh, it was born in a particular time. It had a particular token distribution. It has spent a decade working on decentralization and resilience at its core in terms of client diversity, in terms of, uh, the applications and diversity kind of across the globe happening on this thing. And so really from a, from the asset, you know, from a programmable blockchain standpoint, which it's the only interesting answer, you know, in terms of us thinking about like the digital future and in relation to the asset, uh, the fundamental asset in relation to it, ETH is the only answer. And then if you start looking at Bitcoin, you start thinking about the security model and all sorts of other stuff, it's like, you know, do, do the digital gold thing, but I think if you actually understand what's going on there, it's the value proposition begins to kind of degrade and and and you know, the actual like network effects and and and the things that will happen and kind of reinforce its place, it just doesn't exist.

So let's talk about the elephant in the room because I think as you're having these conversations with institutions, uh, this will be in the back of their mind if they don't say so explicitly and maybe is in the back of some listeners minds. So from September 2022 to today, the ETH Bitcoin ratio has declined about 70%.\n\n\nQuite the drop. Okay. And so, measured in Bitcoin, ETH is now trading near its 2018 lows. And, uh, you guys were here back in 2018, at least I know Danny was. I know David, you were. Uh, that was a dark time for Ethereum, right? That was kind of a, you know, investors had written off Ethereum entirely. There are papers being written that, you know, Bitcoin is the only store of value. ETH is just gas money, you know, that kind of thing. Um, so explain this to institutional investors. Why has there been such a disconnect? If Ether is digital oil, if it's such a good store of value, how come it appears over the last two and a half years or so that Bitcoin has really pulled ahead?\n\nI'll start. Uh, it's because ETH and Ethereum were not allowed to achieve their potential until literally right now. If we look at the Gendler administration, the only asset that really was cleared to thrive and shine as part of a digital assets portfolio was Bitcoin. There was a cloud of uncertainty around ETH. There's a cloud of uncertainty around all the other assets, but Bitcoin was the only asset where it was simple. It was a commodity. That's that. Most of the activities on Ethereum were not allowed. DeFi was unclear, so it moved offshore. Um, stable coins unclear, mostly offshore. The use cases weren't allowed in the US, and there was no regulatory framework. And then let's even, even until, uh, the last hour, uh, where ETFs even, you know, anyone thought that they might go through, you know, and that's that was the beginning of the transition. That was that was the previous administration getting worried that Silicon Valley and some of their special interest groups weren't going to vote with them, and they had to change the behind-the-scenes political tune overnight, you know, and that's only the beginning of us going, \"Oh,\" or institutions going, \"Oh, wait. This is a commodity. Oh, wait. This is something we can build on top of.\" Um, and and and that's continued to change radically since that point last May.\n\nOne important continuation from that is, obviously, there are other assets, um, for other blockchains that, um, that outperformed, and that's because a lot of, we're going to see a re a renaissance of blockchains in the US, but a lot of blockchains are actually centralized companies, and they took bets that, okay, maybe we will have a wave of, um, regulatory favor of regulatory favorable conditions, and they didn't care about the world. They didn't care about decentralization. Ethereum has that deeply built into its core. And in the end, decentralization is going to win. In the end, a decentralized system that no one owns, that everyone can access is the system where the financial system is going to live. And that's why temporarily you saw almost all assets outperform ETH in the short term. But right now, with the the genius bill hopefully about to be passed, with things like the Clarity Act that gives blue skies ahead for all the activity on Ethereum. So, yeah, the institutional adoption is going to happen now, and the repricing is going to happen now, and and until we had that clarity, it was leaking against other asset classes like Bitcoin.\n\nSo you basically think that Bitcoin has had the regulatory clarity for, let's call it, the last, you know, five years, and it juxtaposed with, um, Ethereum and Ether, the asset has basically had, uh, regulatory headwinds against it, um, and that has caused the institutions to just kind of like put it to the side and focus all of their efforts on Bitcoin. You're saying now that that is changing. You, you give an answer in the report that is maybe an extrapolation of what you just said, which is, you say the answer is simple: Bitcoin's narrative is institutionally accepted, and Ethereum's is not yet. Uh, okay. So, why, like, why is Bitcoin's narrative doing so well in institutions, and like Ethereum's narrative still really hasn't, right? It's like, maybe, maybe this gets into the valuation of Ether, the asset. When I talk to institutions, it seems many of them are determined to treat Ether, the asset. They say, you know, Bitcoin is digital gold, and, uh, Ethereum is a great piece of technology. Think of it as like a, you know, tech stock, you know, something like Google in the early days, right? Think of it, and and so look at the cash it's, um, it's putting off, you know, the the discounted cash flow. Maybe that's a way to, you could treat that as like web two revenue. Um, that's kind of the narrative that they're gravitating to. And I think there's a combination of maybe they don't want to give their investors a, you know, kind of second store of value asset. They already have Bitcoins, so they don't want to muddy the waters and confuse things.\n\nTalk, talk about valuing ETH as an asset and that conversation with institutions. How should they see it?\n\nEthereum and ETH is not a tech company. ETH is a store of value, and we, it took 15 years for institutions to understand Bitcoin, right? It took 15 years to get regulatory clarity. So, this did not happen overnight. We needed a first easy to understand digitally native store value. Bitcoin paved the way. Bitcoin's going to be a treasury asset. That's phenomenal. It is a little bit harder to understand ETH. Not a lot harder. As we're clearing up in this report, it's actually pretty simple, but the understanding gap is quickly closing. Everyone's using Ethereum, and it's, it's not going to be long until people say ETH belongs in a portfolio with Bitcoin. But coming back to the tech stock part, it just, you're missing the forest for the trees. You're saying that cash flows are just one tiny, tiny portion. We should be looking at what digital oil means for the digital economy, what a store of value asset, what a reserve asset, what a fuel actually means. And that belongs in the same conversation, in the same valuation zone as Bitcoin, if not higher.\n\nWhat I like about this report is it's, um, it's more bullish, I think, straightforward than other kind of Ethereum reports that I've seen that are extra revenue that when you guys are comparing to digital oil, you're looking at comps for other global reserve assets, you're saying Ether is going to become, is on its way to becoming a global reserve asset, and let's look at the valuation of other glob global reserve assets today. So we had already mentioned oil, which is 85 trillion. Of course, people know gold, around $22 trillion. You also have the global bond market is a $40 trillion. You also have global, the whole global economy, 106 trillion. You also have global M2, which is, you know, like monetary measure 2, 93 trillion. And if you take an average of that, it's 89 trillion. And then you guys extrapolate that, and you say if Ethereum gets to 90 trillion, Ether, the asset, gets to 90 trillion and is basically an average of all of those other global reserve assets, then the long-term potential for Ether, the asset, is $740,000 per ETH. I mean, that, that is a Michael Sailor-like bullish level prediction, and it's just straightforward. It's just based on comps of other global reserve assets, and you guys are making the case that Ether belongs alongside these others and certainly alongside Bitcoin. Can, can you talk about that?\n\nI want to say two things about that. One is, we can't underestimate this, the potential of blockchain technology. Ethereum is already a global network. Whether or not the US had accepted it, the rest of the world's already accepted it. It's already using it. This is as big as the internet with value flowing through it. I think the biggest risk is us selling ourselves short and saying that the potential is capped by some outdated valuation metric. This is a new asset class, is a new technology. If Ethereum is a global network, ETH will be a global reserve asset. And here's the thought experiment, which actually can get us to that $740,000 price target. I think everyone agrees that the world is going to be tokenized. Um, I think everyone agrees that these tokenized assets are going to trade on large decentralized public blockchains. Ethereum is the marquee there. And the amount of tokenized assets is not just going to 10x, it's going to 100x, it's going to thousandx. If every asset, if most assets on Ethereum are have some tie to offchain, to have some tie to a legal system, are, are tokenized assets that are that are held by different jurisdictions. There is one neutral asset across this entire Ethereum economy, and that's ETH, the asset. So if we're talking about geopolitical, there is one asset that has minimal counterparty risk that can be trusted across jurisdictions, that's ETH. The price of trust, that's very, very, very high. The price of trust, a trustless asset that's collateral across the ecosystem that nation states will trade in and out of to go between tokenized assets. That's ETH. I think that could be hundred trillion dollars.\n\nSo I, I should also mention, if 740,000 per ETH is kind of the the long-term trajectory, you guys are more modest in the short to medium, uh, term. So, uh, you're calling in the short-term potential 8K per ETH and medium-term 80,000 per ETH, which ordinarily I wouldn't call that that number modest, but it is in the context of a, you know, $90 trillion market cap, Ether, the asset. Um, I, I feel like we've already talked about maybe the catalysts for an ETH repricing. May, maybe we should turn it for a second toward, uh, Ethereum, the network. So we've mostly been talking about Ether, the asset, and that's, uh, incredibly refreshing. Like, just like I love that bullish talk. Um, Danny, I want to ask you a question about the trajectory of the Ethereum network right now in 2025. So it feels like the, uh, Ethereum scaling plan, I wouldn't say has pivoted, but has some new life in it, let's say, and now there's a a path to layer 1 vertical scaling as well as we have the existing path of layer 2 horizontal rollups, and you know, like you run those numbers, and people have talked about 100,000 transactions per second without sacrificing any of the things that, as you've been saying, have have made Ethereum what it is, which is like the level of decentralization and security. Could you give us a refresh on on your take on Ethereum's 2025 scaling path?\n\nAs I said earlier, we've spent the past decade with Ethereum focused on resilience, focused on decentralization, focused on, um, a protocol that has impeccable uptime and that there's no, you know, there's no central thing to attack, whether that's on on the social or the technological layer. And in doing so, um, especially on the L1 gas limit, the L1 scaling, um, we've been been very modest, and that's been to, for, for a number of reasons. One, uh, to ensure that we could have this multi-client paradigm, to to have the the most resilient blockchain network in the world, um, to have this, uh, to to really seek like stability and maturity in the the way these clients and the software was designed in terms of databasing and optimizations and and being really good at handling the load. Um, at the same time, uh, we realized that you could scale these networks by scaling the amount of data made available. That's the whole L2, uh, roll up horizontal scaling, which we've seen quite a bit of. It turns out you can scale data, uh, far easier than you can scale L1 computation. So this becomes complimentary to the L1 to have these zones, um, that can inherit the scale, the the security of Ethereum. But we've also come to this juncture where, uh, these clients are rock solid. We do have a decentralized and multiclient and very resilient ecosystem. Um, and and really two things now. Uh, these these teams are very eager to push their clients to optimize the hell out of everything that they have to get more out of the L1, uh, gas limit, to get more L1 scale. I think they're targeting, uh, 100 million gas at the end of the year, and we're something in the order of, you know, in the 30s right now. So, so 3x. Um, at the same time, during this window of focusing on decentralization, we've had a crypto cryptographic renaissance. So things that we used to call moonmath, things that we used were like these fantastical, uh, academic constructions, you know, seven, eight years ago, um, in the in the zero knowledge space, especially, we now have like robust production grade technology. Um, there's been so much capital and innovation poured into the, uh, ZKVM and specifically ZK EVVM, the Ethereum virtual machine, so zero knowledge Ethereum virtual over the past many years that things that we thought were fantastical even 3 years ago are now in production in that roll up space. Um, and so we're at the, we're at this juncture where the, because these things have become increasingly mature, because these things that we thought were like crazy moon math things we could might see in a decade, now that they're here, uh, we can start talking about integrating them into L1 to get more scalability out of L1. So past that, you know, 100 million, uh, path, past that, let's optimize the hell out of the clients that we have path, we can then start thinking about more advanced techniques like ZK, integrating ZKBMs, uh, into into the protocol itself. And so taking this, taking our time, ensuring that we're focusing on decentralization, focusing on scale that really inherits and and keeps the security of the system, we've laid a really incredible foundation where we're we're tackling now not only kind of that horizontal scale through the rollups, uh, but bringing it also back home and tackling scale at at layer 1. So, it's just a really exciting time, right? Like I think if you would have tried to do this three, four years ago, you would have ended up with maybe a more scalable Ethereum, but a way more centralized and way less secure Ethereum. But we're at this juncture where, uh, we can kind of have our have our cake and eat it too.\n\nSo, now that you're on the outside of of the EF, kind of looking into these types of, you know, you got the new initiatives, right? Or the the the three-part initiatives of scale the L1, you know, scale L2 blobs, and then improve Ethereum UX. And I think that means integration, interoperability, make it not seem so fragmented. Uh, how optimistic are you on the progress that the Ethereum community can make in in in short order, like, you know, 6 months to a year to 18 months on those three fronts?\n\nI'm I'm very optimistic. So in terms of the L2 scale, we've ha, we have and have had very clear path on how to do that through data availability sampling. I think they usually call it peer dos is the construction that they're going all in on. And that's that's just let's just keep moving forward because they've been banging on that and and getting in a really good spot, and I think we're going to be able to see iterative very good scale from that without much issue. Um, in terms of the L1 scale, that's certainly a, um, kind of revitalized and and newly pushed initiative, but it's\n\n\nLeveraging the expertise that is across all these clients and in a new way.\nIt's mainly just them saying, \"We're going to focus. We've been focused on shipping proof of stake, we focused on shipping blobs.\"\nAnd then there was kind of this whole gamut of things that we wanted to get in: some security improvements, some UX improvements.\nThere's a bunch of stuff that needed to happen.\nBut at the other side of this juncture, there seems to be a real shift in culture to say, \"Okay, let's now, now that we've done all that, let's be very focused and do what we do well and optimize the hell out of these clients.\"\nAnd so I think it's a bit of a shift in tone, but I don't think it's like a radical shift in the expertise required or change in, you know, some of the fundamental structures there.\nAnd like I said earlier, like we spent a long time getting to the level where we have a dozen mature clients.\nAnd now this shift in phases, we have a dozen mature clients.\nWe have the people that are best in the world at doing this stuff.\nLet's turn the gears up.\nAs for the UX, you know, I've said for a while there's two things when we have this horizontal scaling with roll-ups that feel fragmented.\nOne is the user experience of like, where are my assets?\nWhat am I doing?\nWho, what am I interacting with right now?\nWhat am I bridging to?\nThat kind of stuff.\nAnd then there's this other thing, which is related, but it's more of the composability, especially synchronous composability, like, can I in this environment interact specifically, you know, with this environment very cleanly, easily, and very fast?\nMy thesis, and I think a thesis of a number of people, is that 80 to 90% of the problem is really the former.\nIt's the user experience of what is my wallet showing me?\nWhat do I have to think about as a user?\nAm I on, you know, ZK sync or optimism or whatever?\nYou know, can I just be on Ethereum?\nCan I just have some default settings that say I want 90% of my assets in high security zone and 10%, you know, can be in this other place?\nCan I not think about, you know, the UNISWAP pool I'm using and like a router algorithm underneath the wallet, underneath the hood, can like just find the best trade in terms of where the assets are, where they need to be, where the liquidity is, etc.?\nLike I don't want to have to think about that, right?\nAnd most of that is really a user experience.\nIt's really a wallet, wallet, wallet standards and kind of the UX as we think about this complex system.\nAnd then I do think that there is a place for certain types of applications and certain types of users for the synchronous composability.\nAnd I do think that in terms of both some of the based rollup constructions and some of the more and more sophisticated ZK type constructions that we're going to, we're going to land in a good spot on that as well.\nI think that's probably a little bit farther out than just getting better, you know, wallets, better wallet standards, and better kind of UX across the board.\nVC, yeah, you said earlier that you felt like Ethereum was kind of entering its renaissance.\nAre you seeing that in the community?\nCan you kind of explain what you mean by that?\nThat seems to be part of the investment case here.\nThe community as in Wall Street or the community as in Ethereum community or both?\nYeah, just the Ethereum community.\nMaybe Wall Street as well.\nI mean, like what about, um, what about right now in 2025?\nA lot of people think, well, because of the price action over the past two, two and a half years, people are saying things like, \"You know, Ethereum has lost it, it's lost its market share, it's lost its lead.\"\nYou're making the opposite case here.\nYou're saying, \"No, no, no, Ethereum is entering its renaissance.\"\nAnd maybe that's the energy you're seeing in the Ethereum community, maybe that's some of the roadmap that Danny was talking about.\nWhat is it really for you that leads you to say those words?\nIt's all of them.\nI mean, it, I wouldn't be so convicted if it weren't an all in all signals flashing green at the exact same time.\nLet's take Wall Street.\nThe first stop for tokenization is Ethereum.\nIf anyone wants to build their own customized blockchain network, that's an Ethereum L2.\nWe already seen Deutsche Bank just launched their Ethereum L2.\nMore will follow.\nSo tokenization, stable coin adoption, all that stuff is all systems go.\nWall Street, like all human systems, are animal spirits.\nSo it's a herd mentality.\nIt has been very popular for the last couple years to say, \"Okay, ETH is out of favor.\nEat's out of favor.\nLet's not look at the asset.\"\nContrarian investors step in at some point.\nAnd those people have been stepping in full force.\nETH got the $1,400.\nPeople started saying, \"Has it gone too far?\nLet's look at the discrepancy between activity on the network and the asset.\nAnd maybe one of these is wildly mispriced and it's not the activity in the network, cuz that's going to go up.\nSo maybe it's the asset.\"\nIt only takes a little bit for an asset to violently reprice.\nIt already bounced very, very sharply off its lows of $1,400.\nAnd I think we've had two years of sell pressure, two years of people that are capitulating.\nThat doesn't go on forever.\nSo I come with a very, very, uh, I know, refreshed perspective.\nPart of it was I'm newer to the ecosystem than you guys.\nYou guys have been it for seven years, 10 years.\nI'm new.\nSo I see this vibrant ecosystem where everything is thriving.\nAnd I'm just like, this asset is amazing and it has this is exactly where Bitcoin was when Sailor started buying Bitcoin before he started Micro Strategy.\nAnd then Bitcoin went from 10K to 100K.\nAll right, it's time for ETH to go from 2K to 20K to a lot higher than that.\nI don't know.\nI see the most amount of energy and adoption ever.\nThen let's get to the second thing.\nWe're finally, we finally have regulatory a regulatory green light for innovation in the blockchain ecosystem and all roads, all laws, whatever passes flows through Ethereum.\nAs Danny said, it is the decentralized system.\nSo that's great.\nSo that's going to unlock a lot of real use cases.\nAnd thirdly, the ETH community.\nAgain, I'm newer.\nUm, I like being newer.\nSo, a lot of energy, but everyone seems pretty pumped up.\nSo, the last over the last couple years, yeah, it got a little disparaging.\nIt looked like we were getting hit from all sides because we stuck to values of decentralization and stuck to the L2 road map and said that, okay, well, um, these are the designs to not compromise on.\nAnd that's part of yet everyone that comes in the ecosystem, all these smart people, they never leave.\nSo, so I don't know, something keeps them there.\nEveryone seems really, really excited, really, really encouraged.\nAnd there's been, I mean, hopefully we're playing a part.\nWe're seeing ETH change for the better and becoming more and more aggressive and we're seeing players like Joe Luben and Espet come up to create more buy pressure and to talk about ETH the asset.\nYou had an amazing episode with him recently.\nI don't know.\nI don't see any reason to be bearish from here on out.\nVC, I want to know about the Ethereum brand when it comes to Wall Street and maybe even Capitol Hill because I know you've been across both.\nUm, the one of the big overhanging conversations is like there are many TradFi institutions who are now interested in stable coins or real world assets and they're shopping around.\nThey're shopping around for different blockchains about where should they deploy their, where should they tokenize their real world assets?\nWhat, what should they, where should they enter the crypto market?\nAnd you know, Ethereum seems to be the obvious place because it's just the largest place that has the most stable coins, most real world assets, but in 2025, it's not the only place.\nSo there are other blockchain brands, names with logos that are being considered by TradFi and any other like financial institution.\nWhat does the Ethereum brand mean to them?\nDo they differentiate it or does the Ethereum logo kind of just like intermingle with all the other logos and it doesn't really stick out?\nWhat does it, I don't know if you can like interpret or speak for them, but like what does the brand mean to them when they see Ethereum and see that diamond?\nDanny, what's up?\nLet me take this.\nSo, I've been focused on building like secure decentralized, you know, secure decentralized system for a very long time.\nAnd sometimes when you look out, especially at the consumer landscape and especially at low value kind of quick little things, your users don't necessarily care.\nThey're like, \"I'll, you know, I want my memecoin.\nI want my whatever.\nI'm getting in and out of this and that and the other.\nYou know, I'm going to hold this for 3 days.\"\nThey don't like, they don't parse like the meaning of decentralization and the meaning of security.\nUh, it's incredible to go and talk to institutions and banks and for them to say, \"Yeah, we, we get, we get Ethereum, we get, we get decentralization,\" without me saying, they saying it, they say, \"We get credible neutrality.\"\nAnd then they say, \"Because, because our lens for the world is counterparty risk and we don't want it.\nWe want to eliminate counterparty risk.\"\nSo we're thinking about a platform, you know, we, who are the counterparties?\nIs this thing actually decentralized?\nDoes this thing have anyone that can like turn it off or change things or whatever?\nWho becomes our counterparty by using a platform?\nAnd banks and institutions are like, \"We love Ethereum because we love decentralization because we hate counterparties.\"\nUm, so it's kind of cool and and I think that's one of the reasons there is because because they they deal in very high value things, right?\nAnd I think that the consumer will also learn this through maybe the decisions of others, maybe through some education, but maybe through wallet standards, but consumers when they're thinking about their life savings, when they're thinking about where their 401k is going to be and that kind of stuff, the decision is probably going to be very different than when they're thinking about like these low, low value kind of like quick in-n-out type things.\nUm, and so I do think that institutions that lens is very important and valuable and the answer becomes Ethereum.\nAnd I do think that as we really are significantly thinking about onboarding significant portions of the global economy that that lens is going to become more and more important and valuable and digestible for consumers as well.\nSo, uh, let's talk about where you're planning to publish this report.\nHow are you going to push it out there?\nHow are institutions going to look at this?\nDoes this become incorporated into kind of your meetings with them about, you know, you know, getting their tokens on Ethereum?\nHow is this going to be distributed?\nAll of the above.\nThis is a community effort.\nIt's very important.\nThis isn't just an Etherealize thing.\nWe think that ETH has a place in a digital asset portfolio, very large place in a digital asset portfolio.\nWe think it's one of the best store of value assets out there.\nBut we want to inspire the community.\nWe want everyone to, I mean, we have a lot of contributors and co-authors and just we want to push it out to all channels as a public good to the entire ecosystem saying, \"Here's this asset, here's this amazing economy that's powered by the asset.\"\nAnd um, we'll take it to every single meeting.\nI mean, it's the ETF issuers, um, some of them don't have narratives, and so we'll give them some narratives here.\nHere's a lot of different ways to look at ETH, um, RAAS and people that are going to allow for most banks are going to have Bitcoin and ETH trading.\nUm, they've all announced that.\nSo, with that, let's give some sellside research.\nLet's give some content around ETH the asset.\nSo, this will go everywhere.\nUm, family offices, hedge funds, etc.\nAnd and it'll go global, too.\nSo, this is a piece for the community by the community saying that here's an amalgamation of everything that we've we've learned about ETH simplified into a lot of different bite-sized pieces into memes, into the actual economics, into a comparison of the pros and cons of Bitcoin versus ETH and let's take it and let's split it out and hopefully the part I want to come back to is ETH doing well price-wise is the most positive something for the ecosystem.\nEvery L2 token is beta on ETH.\nEvery DeFi token is beta on ETH.\nEven alt L1 should be happy if ETH goes up because it means the whole ecosystem is going up.\nSo I can't see a more positive sum outcome than more awareness around ETH.\nAnd if it transcends and becomes a store value asset, which I think it will, becomes a treasury asset, which is starting to become, the world becomes a better place.\nSo we're here to help facilitate that.\nThat's fantastic.\nAnd VC and Danny, thank you so much for leading the charge on really like coordinating around kind of a message and a narrative.\nUm, I know this is, um, the entire Ethereum community has kind of waited for someone to take this narrative to the institutions.\nYou guys are doing a fantastic job and by the way, did a fantastic job in front of Congress.\nI think that was like last week, like well done.\nIt was so cool to hear Ethereum, basically the narrative, the story in a congressional hearing.\nUh, how surreal was that experience by the way?\nIt was the most surreal experience.\nIt was an honor.\nIt was a responsibility.\nAnd it's just very, very cool to see that Congress, government, they care about decentralization.\nThey care about seeing the network that Ethereum has built and having some representation for it.\nAnd it is the most decentralized.\nIt's not run by a company.\nSo, we got the tap to come represent it, but we're one of many that represent this giant amazing ecosystem.\nAnd yeah, it was honestly an honor and I'm glad the Ethereum is showing up now.\nAll right, we heard the price prediction, 740k ETH at some point in this century.\nUh, Danny, VC, thank you so much for joining us today.\nThanks for having us.\nBeckless Nation, got to let you know none of this has been financial advice, of course, though the report will be in the show notes.\nYou can evaluate it for yourself.\nCrypto is risky.\nYou could.\n\n\nLose what you put in, but we are headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.\nThanks a lot.\n[Music]\n",
