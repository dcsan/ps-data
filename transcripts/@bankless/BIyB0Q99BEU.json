  "cleanText": "Anklas Nation, we got a pretty timely debate on the podcast today. Coinbase versus Robin Hood. Two competitor companies that are going head-to-head into the crypto world. Coinbase, of course, the incumbent, the established cryptonative company, but Robin Hood coming right into crypto with pretty big announcements right on the heels of this, uh, right on the heels of this podcast. Maybe kind of just set the table before I introduce our two contestants here. We got Robin Hood with the ticker HOOD at $81 billion at the time of recording. It is up 135% year to date. HOOD went public in July of 2021, which is not too far off from when Coinbase went public in April of that same year. Coinbase compared to Robin Hood's $81 billion is currently coming in at $85 billion and it is up just 30% year to date. Uh, but all of that 30% increase year to date has just come within in the last 30 days. So while these two competitors, these two financial aspiring super apps are about the same valuation, there has been a little bit of trajectory difference in order to get here. Taking the side of Coinbase, we have David from Blockworks. David, welcome to the pod.\nDavid, thanks for having me.\nAnd then taking a side of Robin Hood, we have Omar from Dragonfly. Omar, also welcome to the pod.\nThank you very much for having me.\nOkay, so Omar, I have been informed that you are the most bullish person on Robin Hood that a few people on my timeline know. And then David, also respectively, same thing to you with Coinbase. Uh, so we're framing this as a debate because I think you guys all have your domain knowledge in their respective companies. I'm sure your knowledge overlaps. Uh, we're not counting points here. We're not actually trying to go for a winner. We're trying to build a productive conversation so we, as myself because I'm curious about this answer, but then also the listeners as well, can kind of just get a download on the nature of these two businesses because I think who wins or how they win or really just what the future lies for the for both of these companies will shape what our industry looks like. Like I said, just uh, two days ago, Robin Hood announced their L2. They launched tokenized stocks, uh, and you know, really for the first time putting pressure on Coinbase, at least, you know, preliminarily, uh, in order to kind of shape what the future of crypto can look like. My take is that it's nice to have two very strong competitors come into this market, uh, and we'll kind of like sus out what the differences between these companies look like as any advantages that each one has. David, I want to throw it to you first. Uh, we'll start with Coinbase. Maybe you could just start us off by giving us a sort of like lay of the land of the Coinbase company. If you popped open the hood and you looked at where Coinbase makes its money, where the coin valuation comes from, uh, and future drivers, just kind of give us the the 101 download that we need to start off with in order to understand Coinbase as a business.\nYeah, for sure. Um, so Coinbase has been around for at least this point like 13 plus years. Obviously, it started out as like a Bitcoin fiat on-ramp, um, in in the United States and, you know, over the past few years as it's evolved to a full stack, you know, uh, I would say on-chain brokerage with various financial services, uh, really the premier US-based exchange in the United States and obviously it's expanding globally today with uh Coinbase International, Coinbase derivatives. Um, today the business generates generates a majority of its revenue from transaction revenue or transaction fees or trading fees on its Coinbase platform, um, on its Coinbase exchange. But it increasingly has leaned into subscriptions and services through Coinbase One and also stablecoin, uh, rewards with its partnership through uh, through Circle, which is like the second largest stablecoin, uh, in, you know, the on-chain economy today. Um, Coinbase has done a really good job, I think, in the depths of the bear last, uh, you know, last cycle of diversifying its revenue stream. It was heavily weighted towards trading volume, um, and in trading fees in general. So, you know, in bear markets like we've seen in this very cyclical, um, industry, uh, you know, it can have peaked the troves of like 80% revenue declines, but I think it's done a very good job as of the past few years, uh, through its USDC partnership of, um, you know, I'd say increasing the floor of how much revenue, uh, it it can generate, uh, throughout bear and bull cycles. Um, but now it's taking on a new life. Uh, it is not just a, you know, the premier exchange in the United States. It does not just have its, uh, relationship with Circle. Um, it is now becoming, I would say, like a full stack infrastructure provider for moving the entire world's economy on-chain. Um, over the past year or so, they've launched wallet as a service. Uh, they've launched more recently over the past two, three weeks during their product announcement, they launched crypto as a service and Coinbase business. What I see Coinbase today becoming is instead of just a front end or like a thin front end for, uh, you know, the the economy coming on-chain, is now becoming like the back end. It's more trying to become like the AWS. Uh, they will not win the distribution game compared to TradFi incumbent or even a Robin Hood coming on-chain. What they're trying to be is a B2B platform, uh, is where I think the company's going forward, looking to offer services, uh, to help other players come on-chain. Um, and they already have like pretty mainstream adoption as custody providers for major ETFs. Uh, and they already have over 200 institutions leveraging its crypto as a service platform, um, to tap into Coinbase's backend infrastructure to offer digital asset services to their customer base.\nOmar, before we get into that same kind of prompt with Robin Hood, what comes to mind when you were listening to David give his kind of like, um, lay of the land for for Coinbase? He talked about not really actually going toe-to-toe with distribution. You talked about kind of being a backend. Uh, what stood out to you?\nYeah, I think from all David's comments and everything I know about the company, I think what they have managed to do so much to point is build a best-in-class crypto infrastructure platform that offers a fully end-to-end service for retail customers and institutions. And like, if that is the framework for the business, I think it is a great point to leverage all of their institutional know-how and all of their tech that they've built into this next leg of growth for the company, which is going to look materially different than it has the last 10 years. And so I I think he encapsulated it really well. And I think they come from a really strong place with a lot of things and a lot of pieces of the puzzle already in place. And now it's just like, what does that go to market look like over the next 10-15 years?\nFrom the crypto side of things, Coinbase has always had the golden goose of distribution inside of crypto. Uh, and I'm hearing both of you kind of agree that Coinbase is more is going to keep its, you know, retail trading base. It's going to keep keep its like front-end on-ramps. You know, that's how I get my money into crypto when I need to do that. Uh, but it sounds like you guys are both aligned in the nature that Coinbase is going to refocus itself towards less distribution and more towards just kind of, you know, backend logic, business management services towards companies, services towards corporations, and kind of being being like the, you know, the on-chain service provider to whatever that means in a variety of different contexts for the pre-existing institutions out there. Would you guys agree with that kind of encapsulation? What would you change? David, I'll throw it to you.\nYeah, I I would directionally agree. I think they're going to try to walk and chew gum at the same time. Like I think they're still going to try to grow their distribution. You know, they already made a a buy for, uh, launching tokenized stocks. Uh, I believe I saw something like a couple weeks ago talking to CFTC or the SEC about getting legalized in the US. Um, I think they're going to try to grow their distribution platform, uh, or or grow their distribution as like a centralized exchange and like a, a brokerage, uh, or an on-chain brokerage firm. Um, I do think though that the revenue composition of the business forward-looking though is largely going to come from this backend infrastructure service that they're going to provide for businesses. But, um, I, you know, they, I, I think I'd be bearish if they didn't continue to try to grow their distribution. I just think that it might be an uphill battle compared to the likes of Robin Hood or the JP Morgans, Bank of Americas of the world that are inevitably going to come on-chain.\nMaybe you could shine a little bit more light on that part of the business, David. What does that look like, that B2B service? Uh, what are some of the products there? What can you say about the margins? What can you say about the growth? What can you say about really just the the aspirations that Coinbase has in that sector?\nYeah, I I think it's very early still to know what the margins are going to look like. They just launched crypto as a service, uh, two, three weeks ago, or at least publicly announced it, but there they came with 200 plus institutions that are using it. Um, my\nCrypto as a service, what is that?\nYeah. So, they're going to be offering, um, the ability for FinTechs and like financial institutions to offer digital asset trading, custody services, um, and maybe potential other financial services that they're already messing around with. Let's say like the Morpho integration with, uh, you know, taking out mortgages or taking out, uh, loans through Morpho in the backend. Um, TBD on exactly what that looks like, but at a high level, they're going to be offering digital asset custody trading solutions. So, what I imagine is Coinbase is like the backend exchange, and then JP Morgan wants to offer digital asset trading for their customers, or Morgan Stanley does. And what you don't know is like, you're trading and you're buying and selling or even custodying, uh, your Bitcoin or ETH, whatever asset on Morgan Stanley or on that front end, but in the backend, it's actually Coinbase's, uh, exchange infrastructure, custody infrastructure, uh, even payments infrastructure. So they launched Coinbase business, which I think is more of like a, um, a mom and pop, uh, or, you know, um, proof of sale or POS, uh, offering for merchants. Uh, they obviously like launched their announcement with Shopify. Um, one of the more interesting things that I think that they launched, uh, two weeks ago that I think was under discussed is I think it's called the Coinbase Commerce protocol. Um, effectively what it is, it's like a generalized payment solution that's launched on Base, and, uh, getting into the more technical details of it, it actually looks like it has an opportunity to distance to media, Visa, Mastercard, uh, where it's going to allow large big box retailers, the Amazons, Walmarts of the world that have these huge ecosystems to effectively become their own Coinb, uh, their own credit card issuer. Uh, and they're going to be able to like tailor their own logic to to know like how their user base is going to be allowed to like use chargebacks or like different reward systems for like for users that are inside their economy or their ecosystem. Um, but TLDDR, like it's still very early to know exactly what this looks like, but I think that they have the distribution with businesses that the brand and also like the know-how to know like where, uh, where they need to grow their business lines, uh, as like an infrastructure player.\nOmar, I'm seeing you nod your head. What did you, what did you like about that? What did you agree with? Give us a little bit more color.\nI I think it, I think it was all very well said, and I, I would say like, just going back to one of the earlier parts with respect to, is it purely going to be an institutional platform? I think to some of the stuff that David spoke about, um, they're still very much leaning into Base as the ecosystem for retail going forward. I do not think that's going away anytime soon. Like I think they fully intend on building that out based on everything that they've said, all the product launches that they have planned, all the protocols and things that they're incubating over there. It, it is certainly like a big part of their business going forward. And then the other thing I would add is on the stablecoin front, USDC distribution is something that is obviously bootstrapped with Coinbase commerce, um, what David just talked about, but, um, getting USDC into the pockets of a number of people around the world, leveraging Base, leveraging the Coinbase wallet, all of these different pieces of infrastructure that they've built over time is like a big part of their strategy as well. And I think similar to what David said earlier, it's not truly going to be transaction revenue as like the primary monetization vector for the business over time. There will be this B2B component. There will also be this heavy consumer payments angle. There will also be business payments, uh, that go along with it. And then if you tag on Base and the whole consumer ecosystem, it starts to give you a better sense of what like the business looks like five years out. And then the last piece I would add would be they're they're still trying to integrate the whole on-chain economy into the Coinbase platform as well. And you see that with the the DEX integrations that they have or that they're working on to integrate all the range of DEX tokens. And I think their view is just to make everything that you can trade on-chain tradeable on Coinbase, the platform. A and like that's what the business ends up looking like in addition to all the B2B stuff over time.\nThe the last thing that's like kind of the call option on Coinbase is like also Coinbase Ventures, right? They're like one of the largest VC firms in the entire industry. Um, you know, that's very much not discussed today, and like we already see how well Circle did when it IPOed. The industry or, you know, Wall Street clearly wants crypto equity exposure. Uh, I have to imagine a lot of their VC portfolio is in Base, in tokens, but I'm sure a good amount of it is also in crypto companies that plan on IPOing in the future. So, there's a world where like that that VC book that other competitors don't have, uh, is worth a lot of money in over the next five to 10 years.\nYeah, I guess it's hard to ask you to give a valuation on what is fundamentally a VC portfolio. Like, really can't really do that. But if you had to do that to compare that to Coinbase's like revenue, how how do you compare apples to oranges here if we're trying to compare sizes?\nYeah, I mean I, I would know actually. Uh, I don't know, Omar, you might, you might be more versed in in that.\n\nSubject, but I, no, to your point, there hasn't been enough disclosure around like the size of their holdings and what they're marked at to like really have a good sense. Like we, we all have a good idea on the names that are in there, but we have no idea the amount of money. And so, so it's really hard. We don't know how much they raised. My understanding was that it's all balance sheet capital, but uh, I, I don't know if there's any external LPs. I, I'm not sure. So I don't believe there is, but I, I don't think it's ever been publicly disclosed. Okay. So it's a true dark horse. So maybe we could just like fairly guess somewhere in hundred million of like total investment into this thing. I think we're just kind of like blindly throwing darts here. It seems maybe around there. And then you know, in the optimistic scenario, you know, you get a 10x, 15x, 20x over the longest of terms, it starts to come in at like 1 to 2 billion. These are just my rough napkin math. Maybe Omar, you would disagree, but over if it's a 1 to 2 billion valuation, I don't think that's moving the needle too much on what is currently an $85 billion valuation on Coinbase. That's my logic. Omar, check me on that. Yeah. No, I think that uh sounds like reasonable. Well, I, I'm sure if we dug around the financials, we could see like what they have it booked at on in like some of the disclosure there. So, um, but you know, off the top of my head saying that it's between like worth 1 to 5 billion somewhere in that wheelhouse, depending, that's probably high to be quite honest. Um, like probably skews closer to a billion, but um, yeah, I mean, sounds reasonable. Um, yeah, unclear to me to be honest. So, not true. We'll treat that as a as a cherry on top. Let me uh, let me go back to kind of the the backend infrastructure angle and then we'll uh, turn to Omar to lead the the Robin Hood section. It sounds to me that like Coinbase is packaging up their their strategy is to package up their software, package up their exchange, package up their, you know, I don't know if this if this is right, but USDC on Base as a Visa competitor along with some of that that logic, uh, and really, you know, start duplicating some of the efforts that they have already made building Coinbase in the first place and then, you know, allowing Fidelity to like slot that right into the back end of their brokerage or really any sort of, you know, entity who's like, oh, you know, crypto's is real. We are we now need to serve crypto to our clients. Do we need to build an exchange or can we just like hook in some, I don't know, SDK. I don't know if that's the right uh technical term, uh, but just like allow some sort of uh integration of what is effectively the Coinbase backend, but it's whitelisted for Fidelity customers or TD Ameritrade customers. And that's a very good distribution strategy as I understand it. Rather than going like in the trenches, going individual customer by individual customer. They're just going to brokerages and getting all of their customers in at once. I would imagine those they're charging those customers lower fees in order to make that work. But on an aggregate basis, when you add everything together, then if you just acquire all of the trading demand of every single brokerage that integrates Coinbase in the back end and their software products, sounds like a pretty strong uh arena of growth to me. David, check me on that. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think uh maybe not one to one parallel, but like looking at AWS's business, it's extremely high margin. Uh, Amazon built AWS largely for their internal purposes in the early 2000s and they realized like, look, like every s, every startup in the world, every business in the world is not going to want to have their own uh on-prem server or on-prem, uh, you know, compute, uh, and why not try like white label that or why not try to offer that as a service? And I think the same could be said for, um, you know, backend infrastructure for for crypto. Um, yes, some firms will want to bring that in-house. I imagine maybe Robin Hood might be one of those uh folks that want to do that because they have the chops to do it. Uh, maybe some fintech and traders might want to bring that in-house as well. But I think a large majority of uh businesses that want to come on-chain will not. They will outsource that because it's cheaper. They don't have the technical experience. And the reality is like custodying crypto is extremely risky, like right, like even the largest centralized exchanges in the world have gotten hacked before. Allah, like Bitfinex and other centralized exchanges and other like major protocols before. Coinbase has proven that they have like a trusted and secure brand, um, secure like uh, you know, security as a as a crypto business has been operating for 12, 13 plus years, um, and they know what the friction points are because they have themselves been moving more on-chain as a business over the past, you know, decade, um, and I think they know exactly what the innate pain points are to offer a really nice packaged service to other companies in the future. So I have to imagine long-term it's going to be very high, high margin of business. Um, but yeah, I think it's akin to AWS, maybe not exact parallels, but that's how I have my mental framework for. So Coinbase to me, like the thesis for Coinbase, if I can sum it up in one sentence, is the entire world moving on-chain. Like it is the pure play of the on-chain economy growing. Yeah. I also enjoy the notion of uh, if Coinbase is integrating things like Morpho or DEX aggregation directly in their front end, well, that too can also get packaged up, put in a piece of software, integrated into TD Ameritrade, and if it's providing a value to T, like to Coinbase's customers, then it can also, you know, provide a value to, you know, any generalized broker brokerage that integrates Coinbase, and then Coinbase, uh, just becomes the conduit for, you know, TD Ameritrade customers and assets and logic to, you know, touch the chain, uh, pretty seamlessly with that Coinbase brand. Okay. So, that's, I feel like this conversation is pretty young in the Coinbase world. Like there's starting to be some brewing conversations about it, but like there's a lot of work to be done. It's a big sector of growth that Coinbase is just at the starting line for. Feel like we've covered that pretty well. There's other parts of Coinbase growth there. Uh, go ahead, Omar. What do you want to say? No, the the only thing I would add to the Coinbase infrastructure play is like similar to what we discussed, there's always this option which is like buy versus build. And a lot of the time companies don't want to build this stuff internally because they don't have the expertise. You end up having to hire, you end up having to go outside the organization, bring the talent in-house, and then ultimately you end up trying to build a product. You have to test that product, and that's like a whole time lag, especially when crypto, crypto is relatively time-sensitive today. But and and so a lot of companies do want to outsource this and use an infrastructure provider. That being said, I think one of the big challenges for Coinbase with this play and and not to push back on it, but I do think that there is an inherent tension between Coinbase's retail business and this exchange infrastructure as a service business because ultimately the profits that they do make from the exchange as a business, exchange as a service business, end up going back to funding their operations, which then they use to fund incentives to then try and bring customers into the retail side of their business and get them onto Base and and the whole range of transaction activity. And so, you know, some potential customers of Coinbase or even Kraken's institutional offering, um, they definitely think twice, I would say, about who they're going to give their business to. And we've kind of seen some of the infrastructure providers, whether it's on the staking side or the custody side, go and pitch directly as opposed to getting the bundle from an exchange itself who they're going to compete with for those same customers. So that's the only thing I'd say in on like the things to just think about for anyone that's looking at that side of the business because there is attention and Coinbase does compete with all of these platforms, like they rightfully should. It's the one of the highest margin parts of their business, um, for those customers. Uniswap is your gateway to a more efficient DeFi experience.

So, David, there's um, we could talk about USDC income into Coinbase. We could talk about Base on-chain revenues. In terms of just like, kind of understanding the future growth of Coinbase, I feel like we've laid down the uh, you know, back end to TD Ameritrade thesis pretty well. What's worth adding to that list of growth venues for Coinbase before we wrap up the Coinbase out of this conversation? I mean, they're they're making 60% of Circle's revenue, right? And like, it's still very early. It's very early days for for stablecoins. Uh, how locked in is that? Is that just a permanent part of the Circle deal? Is that going anywhere? I believe and I, I might be mispeaking slightly, but I believe that that it is subject, it is up for renewal at the end of 2026, but Coinbase pretty much has say in any material changes to the contract. So, for example, um, that partnership Circle did with Binance to hold, I think they had to hold like 1 billion USDC on uh, on Binance's balance sheet and then they had like a revenue share agreement with Binance. Circle had to go to Coinbase to get their approval in order to allow that to happen. Um, obviously that's in the contract, that's in the terms of like this current contract, but my understanding is like it's effectively a perpetual contract, but uh, there is room for negotiation at the end of 2026. Uh, again, might be mispeaking there slightly, but I think the power is definitely in Coinbase's hands. So, uh, look, it's very early days for stablecoins. Uh, that is not to say the stablecoins of today are going to be the stablecoins of tomorrow. Uh, obviously, we probably talk about like Global USD, which is Robin Hood's like consortium uh, stablecoin. We talk about PayPal USD and even JP Morgan trying to tokenize uh, deposits on Base and what have you. It's like every fintech company or every bank that is anyone will try to get into the stablecoin game and o, over time that will be a low margin, very highly competitive business, but uh, Circle is the largest regulated USD uh, stablecoin in the US economy today. Um, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. And if anything, you know, stablecoin and USDC market cap is probably going to 10x over the next two to three years. I'd be surprised if it didn't. And even with future rate cuts, like that is going to be a large uh, a material revenue driver for Coinbase. Um, so, you know, that that's also I think like a major thing that I think everyone has already baked into, you know, maybe not to their valuation today, but everyone already cognizant of that revenue share agreement. Um, and it just like, it's a really stable, I think, income stream for them, um, to continue to, you know, build out Base, build out their trading infrastructure, build out their Coinbase, their crypto as a service offering. As I understand it, uh, Circle pays the operating expenses after uh, Coinbase takes their 50% cut. So like Coinbase feels like they got a really sweet deal, taking a lot of it's all profit for Coinbase and they don't have to pay for any of the employees or any of the anything else. That's my, that's my understanding. Is that correct? I believe that's correct. I mean, they definitely they max extracted on that one for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Like the the rough, the rough calculation is uh, Coinbase gets all of the interest income of USDC held on their platform and then it's a 50/50 split on the rest, like on the rest, 100% of everything that's on their platform and 50% of the rest. That is a sweet deal. Yeah, that's like the rough calc. There's nuances to like where USDC is held and Circle has a portion that they retain on their own, but it's relatively small. But uh, that's that's the mental model for how to think about it. And it was funny because at one point Circle had flipped Coinbase last week, um, which is kind of counterintuitive when one company makes more off the product than the other does. Right. That is the market. Right. Right. Right. David, there's um, Base revenue from from transaction fees there. Coinbase is a Bitcoin custodian. Any last subjects that are worth touching on uh for sources of future Coinbase revenue? Yeah, I mean, I think there's so many different, um, there's so many different revenue streams that are non-material today that will, you know, I think will be in the future. Base revenue, obviously being being one of them. Um, but I think if the listeners today were going to take away something, I think it's look, there's still a they they have a high\n\nUh, stable revenue stream come from stable coin rewards with the partnership with Circle. They make a material amount of their revenue from trading fees. I don't see those two changing for the foreseeable future. Um, but there's all these other things, largely their infrastructure as a service offering for, you know, the on-chain economy growing or bringing on fintechs and and traditional banks into the on-chain economy. Like that, I think is going to be just a more material portion of their revenue over the next three to five years, and I think will over time become the majority of their revenue, uh, if my thesis is correct. So that's that's a yes. But yeah, there's a bunch of other services that, uh, are not, you know, staking rewards, right? Like they're the largest institutional staker in the entire industry at this point. I couldn't even tell you how many tens of billions of dollars they have under their their management. But, you know, as I really understand all of this, uh, revenue sources, uh, it doesn't seem that competitive with Robin Hood. It seems pretty differentiated as a product line. Now, I think we can kind of extrapolate into the future and be like, yeah, eventually these two giants will like butt up against each other. As it stands today, it feels like the product lines and where they get their revenue are pretty like at harmony, at peace with each other and not actually going toe-to-toe. That's that's my understanding. Omar, check me on that take.\n\nYeah, you're you're right. But, uh, happy to go into it whenever when we talk about Robin Hood.\n\nYeah, let's do it. Yeah. So, give us give us that same kind of lay of the land. What's the current state of Robin Hood? Where do they get their money from? And then we'll touch on, uh, vehicles for growth.\n\nYeah. May maybe just like going back in time to to kick it off.\n\nSure. was so Robin was founded at a similar point in time to Coinbase back in 2013 and it was founded by Vlad Tenev and Baju Bot and they both had met at Stanford and initially they were working on HFT software that they were selling institutions. Over time that ended up pivoting and they ended up building a retail-first platform and they had like two key insights that had driven a lot of their decision-making at that time. They were of the view that the world was going to be mobile and that retail users didn't want to pay fees. And that was the core premise of the business at the time, which was we are going to build a really slick intuitive user interface that people can use to trade on their phones. They can get all of the relevant information and they don't need to pay fees. And the world's youngest generation, which is like a big part of the Robin Hood story, it it this is going to be the way they live. Everything will be mobile-first and native and that is what they want to do. And so the Robin Hood story story started back then and over time it has just been a compounding growth story in terms of users. And so like if you rewind the clock a little bit, if you go back to like 2017, they had 2 million users. If you go up to like 2020, they had 12.5 million funded accounts. And then if you go to today, it's a business that has like 26 million users. And for context, the US population is roughly 340 million people and so they're just like under 10% of the US. Um, but it has been like a story that has been built on the back of like what does the next generation of investing products look like and that's the way they started and that's the way they've built their business over time and as as Robin Hood today. So, the way to think about it is there's $256 billion of assets on the platform across these 26 million roughly funded accounts, which means there's roughly $10,000 balance per account on the platform is like a very simple way to think about it. The platform itself does like $3 billion of revenue and the bulk of that, so like half of it comes from transaction-based revenue and then the vast majority of the rest comes from interest income. Now like interest income isn't to be construed the exact same way as it is with USDC, but it tends to be the large chunk of that is margin-based interest. Then there's some cash sweep. There's a range of other interest products, but largely Robin Hood operates off of a trading fee-based model, which they similar to Coinbase are trying to diversify over time. And I think for the listeners that aren't that familiar with the story, um, the big thing that they did to have no trading fees directly was a concept called payment for order flow. And what payment for order flow is is market makers will pay you for price-insensitive flow effectively, which is I'm a retail order. I put in order to buy one bitcoin. They give me a quote and they will pay me for that quote. They'll go execute it and they'll execute it across a range of different venues and there tends to be a spread in there, which is why they're paying you for that flow. And, um, Robin Hood gets a portion of that. Robin Hood gets what they are paid for that flow. And so like that's kind of how the business model works, which is payment for order flow, and that's how they make the revenue. So, uh, unlike Coinbase, which is direct fee, um, that it gets executed on the back end, it this just slightly different, but there's still a revenue model associated with it. Um, and and so that's like roughly what like the business looks like today. And if you were to just like kind of break out, okay, like of the of their transaction-based revenues, like where does crypto fit into this whole piece of the pie today? The half of their business effectively is options with, you know, if you look back to 2024, it's like 760 million, I think is the number. And then if you look at crypto, crypto is $630 million roughly. And then if you look at traditional equities, like buying Nvidia or SpaceX or Tesla, that's 177 million. And so like that's the way to kind of think about the business. Historically, crypto has been like relatively small. Like if you go back to 2019, I believe they made like $10 million off of crypto. And so like the crypto story has been a relatively new in the broader Robin Hood story, uh, vector for growth. And it's been something that they've leaned into really, really heavily in recent years. But, um, the Robin Hood story for most people out there is has been one of traditional financial products. Um, and I I think like that's probably the easiest way to think about Robin Hood's revenues and broad business today. But, uh, there's like a huge other component which is like part of my like whole thesis on on the business, which I'm I'm happy to get into, but I'll just like pause there and we talk about that. And I think that was great. I want to talk about the two big events that Robin Hood has had this year. The one just happened, how the to catch a token. Uh, that was their crypto event. And then maybe three months ago, they did more of a like a traditional finance event where they introduced Robin Hood banking, uh, the Robin Hood credit card. Uh, so that's kind of like their more, you know, more, you know, trady, uh, not crypto, but, you know, retail forward, you know, retail banking and trying to looks like become a full-stack financial company. Um, I'm guessing if we're going to talk about venues for growth in Robin Hood, they're going to come from these two announcements, which is like very convenient that we have these two like announcements to talk about. Uh, so I'll throw it back to you and give us your broad thesis and then we'll go into those individual announcements.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, like my my thesis on it is Robin Hood is building the multigenerational financial super app for our generation. And they were brilliant in the sense that they went after the youngest cohort of customers with their initial product back in 2013. And if you like just think about it 10 years ago or 12 years ago, all of us were much younger and you know, we probably had a lot less money and and you know, we were probably starting out our careers and they went right after this cohort of customers that was young, didn't want to pay fees, but was on their phone. And over the last 12 years, they've managed to grow with them. And at the same time, they've added cohorts sequentially of younger and younger and younger customers. And if you like look at the population of Robin Hood's customer base, 75% is under the age of 44 roughly. And so like you have this platform that skews really young, that's really active on their phones and that trades a lot. And what does this generation want to do? They want to do everything off their phones. I don't want to go into a bank branch. I don't want to go deposit checks at the teller. I don't want to go to an ATM to pull out cash. I want to literally do everything from my phone. And so Vlad, what he's trying to build is like stage one of Robin Hood was like, I'm going to build like this great active trading platform, which they continue to do and we can talk about, but like the next arc for Robin Hood is like the all-in-one super app for your everyday needs. And similar to what David mentioned earlier, it's like this is where Robin Hood Gold comes in. And for people that aren't familiar, that's their subscription program. And through Robin Hood Gold, and they have a Robin Hood Gold card, what this allows you to do is use Robin Hood for your day-to-day spending. And that comes with a 3% cash back which can be redeemed in the app. It allows you to get matches on retirement accounts. It allows you to get cash sweep in your Robin Hood account. It allows you to have margin interest reduction fees, all kinds of different benefits that they are enveloping into a full-stack financial services platform that covers your day-to-day needs. And so whether you want to spend day-to-day at Chipotle, whether you want to deposit money in the bank, which you'll be able to do over time through their bank partners, whether you want to trade equities like Tesla or yeah like Tesla or Nvidia or what have you, you can do that directly on the platform. Whether you want to buy crypto, you can do that directly through the platform as well. Um, if you want to punt out options, you can do that. Now they've obviously integrated contract markets and so if you want to have Robin Hood's um prediction market offerings, like you can do that directly through Robin Hood as well. And so like you can kind of see the whole Robin Hood story, which is I'm going to grow with this cohort of customers. They're going to get richer and wealthier over time and I'm going to sandwich them with the full range of financial products so that they don't need to go anywhere else. They can use me for literally everything. And I think that is like the part of the product that I or the part of the business that I'm like the most bullish on because like I see it with everyone my age. I see it with people under a younger me and even some of the people that are older. It's just everyone wants consolidation. I don't want to use a credit card from MX. I don't want to bank with Chase. I don't want to do all these things across all of these different places and have 10 different accounts. I want everything to be mobile-first and tailored and optimized to the way I conduct my day-to-day life with like extremely limited friction. And Robin Hood is certainly going in that direction. And I think when you think about the crypto part of the business, that's where it fits in. It's like our generation is younger. We recognize the importance of crypto, how big of a role it's going to play in society, and it's a great way for them to continue to sandwich these users with the full stack of financial service offerings. But I I will pause there. I've gone on for a little bit, but, uh, yeah, we can talk about any\n\nI think that was beautifully articulated. I I I redownloaded Robin Hood. Um, I I initially got into investing like I think many people here through Robin Hood even before crypto, like right out of college for me. It was like two years before I got into crypto and I was owning like semiconductors. I was owning like 2x long semiconductors cuz I really like risk. Uh, then I left Robin Hood because I got into crypto and so I didn't touch Robin Hood for for years. But then, uh, it was sometime during like the last bare market in 2022, 2023 and we we were all looking at coin at like $30 and I was like, well, you know what, I'm gonna I'm gonna buy some coin. And so I redownloaded Robin Hood for the first time and that's where that's that's where I got my first coin shares. And in that process I was thinking, oh, where do I even go to buy equities? Oh, yeah, I can go download Robin Hood. And I was thinking in that moment, if it wasn't Robin Hood, where else would I go? And I I thought like, yeah, I guess I could do a TD Ameritrade. I could do a Fidelity, but like that just doesn't feel right at all. That just feels so boomer. So like Omar, the question is like, who is Robin Hood's competition? I know there there's pre-established brokerages that already have their base, but I couldn't think of a single alternative that was like interesting to me as a millennial who just wanted a basic exposure to spot stocks.\n\nYeah. I I mean like it looks like all of the people that you know, which is the Fidelity's of the world, the E Trades of the world, um, the Ameritrade's of the world, um, and IBKR's of the world. Like every traditional broker is kind of who they're competing against, but our generation kind of has this tech-first approach. I would say it's like we want something that's super simple, easy, not hard to onboard onto, which Robin Hood abstracts so much of the pain away at. And then once you're on there, you want it to be super simple and and like relatively few clicks before you're buying an equity. And, uh, and so like all of the traditional brokers is who they are competing against is is the way I think about it, especially in the US. Um, and, uh, you know, they they compete against the banks more directly on like where they're going with the business today, but, uh, all of the boomer products that you can think of is who they compete with.\n\nRight, and I can't imagine any of them are innovating or growing nearly at the rate of speed that Robin Hood is.\n\nYeah, this plays into the other, uh, into David's thesis, which is the exchange managed infrastructure as a service play on which is like everyone recognizes what's going on and they're like, okay, I need to provide these customers with the full range of financial services offerings. Crypto is certainly one of them. And so like, how do I get that into my platform so I don't lose them to Robin Hood? And, uh, you know, it's the very it's exactly the reason we've seen Robin Hood's accounts grow from 2 million in 2017 to 26 million today. It's just like people are looking for s\n\nSomewhere to do everything in one place, and Robinhood is arguably one of the best places to do that. David, when you hear Omar's thesis about Robinhood, what do you like? Uh, anything you disagree with? Anything that you think Coinbase can actually like push up against Robinhood with their uh, you know, future aspirations? I love Robinhood. Like, I I'm a user, I'm a power user of it. Like, I don't see like a coin bull here, but like Robinhood, Robinhood's a great company. It is a master class on like product strategy and just their their pro their whoever their product team is, like every single Web2, Web3 company should be trying to poach them because it is, it's a beautiful app. It's so easy to use. It's simple. My first foray into investing, very much like yourself, David, I'm sure Omar as well, maybe was like downloading Robinhood back in like, uh, early 20 or like mid 2014, 2015, like right out of college and just messing around with options. Like it was just so simple as someone that like did not do like any prior investing prior to that, like in my college days, like it was, it was, it was investing for dummies, and they made it so simple. Um, but they have obviously large aspirations and like they, they've done a killer job with their product. They've done a great job with Robinhood Gold. I think what Coinbase can learn from is like product first. Like they don't, I don't love Coinbase's major main app. Um, it is clunky. It, I would argue that maybe it's gotten a little better over the past year or so, but um, it is, does not have a cohesive, it doesn't feel like a mobile-first app, even though like it, it probably is. Um, but it doesn't feel like it. Um, I can't easily buy and sell assets um, in like the the same like user interface that I'm used to or accustomed to with Robinhood. Um, I think Coinbase is going to learn a lot from like the product and user experience side. Um, but I mean, I largely agree with everything Omar said. Like they are the, they are the the millennial Gen Z and future generational uh, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley. Um, they, they're killing it. Um, and I think what Coinbase, I don't know if Coinbase has the product chops candidly to be able to compete with Robinhood in that arena, but I think they do have the chops to do and the expertise on is like everything in the back end. Don't get me wrong, they should absolutely still go toe-to-toe with Robinhood becoming a financial super app. And I think they're obviously trying to make strides in that. They see obviously the the future of uh, subscription, you know, subscriptions like Gen Z's millennials love paying for subscriptions. So they launched Coinbase One where you get like pretty much free trading uh, on the app. Um, you obviously can now get the Coinbase credit card, which is like very similar to what Robinhood did with Robinhood Gold. So they're definitely converging on the same offering for retail uh, and like B2C strategy, but I think where Coinbase is is differentiating is obviously more on the B2B side. Yeah. May maybe just like one of the things I want to add for like the listeners is uh, is on the Robinhood side in '21, there was like an existential crisis for the business, and I'm sure many people that are listening probably remember it, but um, the whole GameStop saga, and I think one of the things and to draw a parallel back to crypto maybe is um, the Maple and Oiler stories of this year, which have been like two incredible comeback stories. Um, Robinhood just had like its own version of that in 2021. People hated Robinhood. And if you went on to WallStreetBets on Reddit and you went and like checked out any of the comments, people were seething at Plat. They despised it. And I think there is certainly something to be said for the businesses that can survive existential crises, rebuild, and come back stronger than ever, and at the same time have their customers be some of their loudest supporters and sources of referrals. And like, if we look back in the history of time, I do think like Robinhood's '21 crash will be looked back at as one of the defining moments in its in its history, which is like it survived what could have been like the end of the business, and it came back stronger than ever with an reinvigorated product strategy that changed the arc of like what this business is going to look like for the next 10-15 years. And so, um, I I think it's like worth noting that just because like resilient management teams as an indicator for good businesses, you don't necessarily see that too often. And so, I think it's worth just noting. Yeah. I'd actually like to learn a little bit more about that because to this day, Robinhood's brand still has echoes of that uh GameStop event. Like when I I posted the recent interview with Vlad I did, I had like a, I mean, you get reply guys on Twitter of all shapes and sizes, so this shouldn't be any sort of particular surprise to anyone, but like somebody was like, \"Oh, Vlad's corrupt because they yanked the sell button on GameStop.\" And so, you know, there's some leftover notes uh uh left from from from that PR crisis back in in 2021. Uh, now that we have like four years of hindsight behind us, my I don't really know the true details of what happened. The accusation towards Robinhood was that they yanked the sell button because the guy from Citadel called them up and it was like, \"Hey,\" or no, it was the buy button. They yanked the buy button because the guy from Citadel called them up and it was corruption. And then there was like a rebuttal from Robinhood that I don't really remember the nuances, but there was like a seemingly just like perfectly valid explanation for this that no one really wanted to hear. That's my understanding. I'm probably, I think listeners are about probably where I am. Omar, do you have any more clarity about like what happened and if like Robinhood was like vindicated or or not, or maybe there was corruption? I don't really know the details. What what can you say? Yeah, you're you're pushing the limits of uh my recall, but uh I I would say that um my my understanding still is with all the GameStop GameStop volatility, Robinhood had to come up with tens of billions of dollars, if I'm not mistaken, uh to post um uh with the DTCC, if I'm not mistaken. Um and like they did not have access to that amount of money at the time. And so what they ultimately end up having to do was just restrict trading. And it was largely a function of the regulators requiring them to post capital as opposed to anything like nefarious on their end. And obviously like that impacted retail the most. And a lot of people that were bidding on the runup didn't have the ability to sell the stock because of like these crazy capital requirements that Robinhood had to come up with. And so it just turned into a PR nightmare which right ultimately end up being like, oh, Robinhood is going after me, and their hands were tied, and there wasn't really anything they could do. I think the messaging could have been much better, and they could have been much clearer at the time if I'm, you know, recalling everything um perfectly, but uh I yeah, it it was a function of capital requirements as opposed to anything nefarious. Right. Right. Yeah. That's my loose understanding as well. One thing I want to touch on because this will start to bring up some pretty good comparing and contrasting between Robinhood and Coinbase is um Robinhood's announced a banking platform that is coming, I think in like Q3 or Q4 of this year. They are just announcing the fact that they can become a bank, and so retail uh customers can just deposit money in the Robinhood banking platform, which you would think has a very thin wall between their brokerage equity stock platform. Uh, something that Coinbase does not have because Coinbase still has banking partners that it needs to bank with. Robinhood itself is a bank. What kind of advantages does Robinhood being a bank give Robinhood over Coinbase? Or is that not really much of one? My my understanding is that they're not actually going to become a bank. They're going to use banking partners. Um, I could I could be mist I could be mistaken, but um, like even if you look at their credit card, they're using Coastal. Like the, if if they become a bank, there's just a lot, first off, there it takes a lot of time, and second, um, there's a lot more regulation from a capital perspective. Now you have various amounts of capital that you have to post across different tiers to maintain your status with the OCC and all of the different bank regulators that there are in the US, and so Robinhood doesn't want to do that, but they want to become uh a financial technology company. And I'm sure at some point down the road, they will arguably try and become a bank, but uh today, from my understanding, their strategy is to become a banking service provider. And like the way you can kind of see it even on the mortgage side, they're not the one providing the mortgage directly. They're they're sourcing mortgage rates for you to then switch your mortgage over, which then they get paid for versus underwriting every single new mortgage application um on the platform. Okay. So, they're still more operating as a portal. They're a front end for a different bank that they are just managing for users. Okay, that that makes more sense.

Mantle, bridging TradFi and DeFi so you don't have to. Let's get into some of the things that are definitely running up head-to-head. So Robinhood just announced the Robinhood chain. They also announced tokenized stocks, which I think is one of the more exciting things that we've seen in crypto perhaps since the Bitcoin ETF. I can't really think of another thing that was more exciting, more new for crypto since since that uh Coinbase maybe two or three weeks ago filed some requests with the SEC for a regulatory sandbox for tokenized stocks. So, you know, Coinbase is eyeing this as well. Robinhood, I mean, it's just an announcement, but you know, you can kind of see Robinhood beating Coinbase to the punch in tokenized stocks. And then also the tokenized private equities like SpaceX and OpenAI, I think is extremely exciting to people. uh only available for EU citizens because of compliance. Um, but nonetheless, you are now seeing Robinhood chain being announced, which of course goes up toe-to-toe against Base. Both Coinbase and Robinhood want to produce tokenized stocks for the crypto world. And so we are now seeing at least some of the spheres of influence but up right against each other. Omar, when you saw this announcement um from Robinhood just earlier this week, what were your first initial thoughts? Yeah, I think you know Vlad's kind of teased the announcement over the last uh I'd say 6 to 12 months, and so you had a decent sense that it was coming. No one had any particularly great insight into what it was actually going to look like, but um when it was announced, it it made perfect sense. I'd say like the important thing to understand or think about with respect to Robinhood and it's slightly different relative to Coinbase, but Robinhood wants to be this place that allows our generation to trade everything. And so if you like think about it through that lens, like having an onchain strategy is like critically important, right? Because like now you can have this liquid playground for a bunch of people to trade a range of different stocks, securities, non-securities, and everything that you can kind of imagine under the sun. And like what better way for them to do that than have their own chain? And like in the traditional financial world, trades get routed to the range of traditional venues or liquidity providers, but here this now allows them to be their own venue. And it's kind of an alternative take on like what the world looks like, whereas Robinhood was facilitating access to the traditional financial world. They're almost building the infrastructure for the new world. And I and I think like it's important to understand when you think about the business as a whole because if you look at like their long-term arc and you like go and you read and you listen to them speak about it, um phase one of the business is be this active trader platform. Phase two is like the all-in-one neo bank platform, which is like all of your financial services needs, and phase three is like the world's financial infrastructure. And so if you think about it through that lens, this is like a perfect piece to add into their product strategy which allows them to offer like tokenized equities. It allows them to like use\n\nThat as an infrastructure for the range of foreign markets that they're going to enter into over time. It allows them to offer a range of things like private stocks again, which people can't trade. It'll allow them to do private real estate over time, like a whole bunch of different products. Now you have the flexibility to do in an environment which you control as opposed to going and trying to back into the traditional financial system and working with a range of players. David, from the Coinbase side of things, what do you think was going through Coinbase's head when they saw this announcement? Um, I'm sure that they thought that this was inevitable, but now they have a moat to defend, right? You know, Base, you know, pre-existing ecosystem, and Robin Hood just Robin Hood chain just an announcement, uh, and so, you know, already has a huge head start, but you can see like Coinbase's like, you know, biggest rival in this space start to appear. So what does Coinbase need to do to defend its moat? What do you think its next steps need to be? Yeah, I mean, I think that Coinbase is still largely like the premier US, uh, based crypto exchange, and like they're obviously trying to expand internationally. Obviously, Robin Hood is starting largely with international, you know, largely EU markets for its crypto strategy, which which makes sense given the regulatory environment there. Um, I think that I think they're thinking like, we have to be first mover advantage to all US based crypto products, and in order to continue on like, if they're going to try to tackle Robin Hood against like the BTOC, um, vertical. Um, they're launching US perps, I think July 21st, so two and a half, three weeks from now. Um, their hope, I'm guessing, is like similar to what Robin Hood did for options, right? They made Robin Hood, they made options easy for our generation, um, for high beta chasing risk on, uh, customers, and like, per the next evolution of, you know, pretty much options, uh, for crypto natives, and they're trying to introduce perps to the US capital markets, the, you know, the retail base for them. So I don't know if Robin, I don't know why Robin Hood hasn't announced US perps yet. Um, obviously, it's not a regulatory thing. Maybe it's because the acquisition of Deribit for Coinbase effectively allowed them to do this. And they're not effectively perpetual futures, they're actually just like long-dated, uh, options. They have like a five-year expiry, but who really holds perps five years straight? Um, so I think Coinbase is is thinking two things. It's one, we have to grow US perps like ASAP. Uh, that could be a material, you know, revenue driver for the business if they succeed. We already know how much like, you know, Binance, for example, I think 90% of their entire trading volume is perps compared to spot, and is like a large revenue driver for Binance and other like offshore centralized exchanges. Um, I'm unsure how worried they are about Robin Hood chain. Like they should be worried, but if history repeats itself, like other centralized exchanges or, uh, with large distribution, large customer bases have not done that well launching their own L2 or their own L1. BNB may be the exception given like they're the 900-pound gorilla in the room. They have a 100 million plus global US base. But like if you look at every other centralized exchange so far, like haven't done that well launching their own L2. Bybit, I think they've reported they have a 60 million global user base that is, um, significantly larger than what Robin Hood has. Has anyone used Mantle? I haven't. They're now launching on Solana with their own like, you know, DEX. Um, has anyone used Ink? Nothing against Kraken. I think they're a great exchange. I am a customer of theirs as well, but like I haven't used Ink, and now they're launching tokenized stocks on Solana. Um, World Chain, like I not the exact same thing, but like World Chain has also found limited traction. Coinbase has a crypto-first culture. They have the brand. Um, and I think it's going to be very hard to unseat Coinbase, uh, as an L2 or as your own like execution environment. But if any team is going to beat them, it could be Robin Hood because of their operational excellence and their just their ability to execute. Um, but I I I think obviously they're probably worried about their international expansion plans, like Robin Hood going into the EU, um, is is obviously like, uh, a risk for them. Um, Coinbase's international derivatives platform has like grown a decent amount over the past, um, you know, six, six or so months. I think they recently hit over 10 billion OI. Uh, I could be mistaken there. Uh, but they it has seen like some like really well good growth over the past, um, you know, I guess year to date. Um, I'm not personally familiar with how strong Robin Hood's brand is in the EU. Um, I think that'll be very interesting to see in the coming quarters on the earnings report, like how well is their international expansion plans growing. Coinbase hasn't done exceptionally well on that front. Um, and I don't know if that's an execution problem or the fact that like Binance and all these other offshore exchanges just have like such a a moat, and Binance themselves in their own right are trying to build their own super app, right? And they have again, order of magnitude maybe of of more users than than Robin Hood does, and they have shown their ability to execute over the the past few years. Um, yeah, if I'm Coinbase, first thing I'm thinking about is like, make US perps like the go-to venue for high beta chasing retail users. That should be the product that can potentially absorb, uh, or take users away from from Robin Hood. Um, yeah, I I I'll stop for now and see if what you guys thoughts are. Yeah, Omar, rebuttal thoughts, arguments, what comes to mind? No, I think like that is one of the Coinbase strengths, which is like it is a crypto-first brand and a crypto-native company, and because of that, they have like a range of different advantages that they can play in when Robin Hood starts encroaching on their territory. I think, you know, if I was to articulate like the bull case for Robin Hood is, uh, on the crypto side today, anyways, um, I think like it's like a fee story largely, um, which is like Coinbase still charges like 1.4%, 4% roughly on retail trading volume, and Hood comes in at like 40 basis points. It's just like materially cheaper to trade crypto on Robin Hood. But at the same time, like I I'm here in New York, and if I go to the Robin Hood app and I try and buy crypto, there's like 22 tokens I can buy or roughly that number. Whereas if I go to Coinbase, I can buy 200 plus tokens. And I think like this crypto nativity and the willingness to take risk is like what really does allow Coinbase to build out its product offering, customer base, user base, and like retain customers relative to, you know, a challenger that's entering into its space and trying to poach its customers on the retail side. And so like I largely agree with every everything David said, like, uh, they they do should lean into perps, it is a great product. Robin Hood doesn't offer them yet. I'm sure they will at some point. Um, Providence is doing it out of Europe. Um, and like leverage is capped at 3x. Um, but it, you know, it's still like a very nascent battleground which Coinbase has like a really, really good advantage in. And so like they should just like push on push on the gas if if I were them. Yeah. I think also, uh, a story for both companies, especially like with Robin Hood launching Robin Hood chain, is gonna be what does that take rate look like over time? So Coinbase is obviously trying to in in a way disintermediate its largest revenue driver, which is transaction revenue. Like I think its mixed take rate is approximately 30 basis points between the retail and the, uh, the institutional user. Obviously, retail gets absolutely fleeced, but it's, uh, the greatest, the greatest business in the world. But, um, that's not, but but, uh, if you look at Base, right, and they're obviously trying to, they're going to be, um, enshrining, I guess, decentralizing all the all the assets launched on Base onto their their front end on the Coinbase main app, and eventually go after other, um, assets on other ecosystems. Um, the the take rate. So if you look at like Base's DEX volumes as a function of its sequencer revenue, it's an order of magnitude less. So they have a 30 basis points take rate on centralized exchange front end. Base gets approximately a three basis points take rate. Uh, and I think their thinking is, we're going to, you know, move more on-chain, the lower take rate. No other centralized exchange or no other traditional financial company can compete with us if we can offer a three basis points take rate. Uh, but they're gonna take like maybe the Solana approach, which is like low fees, high throughput equals more rev, more revenue, whatever you want to call it. Um, and I'm curious to see what Robin Hood's transaction revenue is going to be as more of its trading does move on-chain. Is it going to be a similar take rate? Probably. Um, another thing that I think about when I think about Robin Hood's business is, you, you know, called out earlier, Omar, which is payment for order flow. The EU has banned payment for order flow as of the end of 2026. So what does that revenue model look like in the EU? And I obviously US, it's it's still legal today. Will it be legal tomorrow? Probably. We have probably like a more, um, progressive regulatory environment in that sense. Um, but I will be it will be interesting to see like how well Robin Hood does in international waters. Again, I don't know what the brand is internationally. I I have a tough time believing that anyone that is using an offshore centralized exchange today will move to Robin Hood because by, uh, Bybit, Binance, OKX, you know, objectively offer great products for crypto users. Um, but you know, again, Robin Hood is is a behemoth and like really does have really strong execution, uh, and operational excellence. So maybe they can take users from those, uh, those players. Yeah. The only thing I'd add to this is like on the Robin Hood side, if you like listen to Vlad talk about, you know, Robin Hood chain, I think one of the things that he said recently is like he's going to focus on having an active developer ecosystem. And so like that's Robin Hood very much coming into Coinbase's territory, and like obviously Jesse's done a great job and like they have really built out that ecosystem, and so like there are going to be challenges for Robin Hood as they like move on-chain. And I and I know I'm the Robin Hood bull here, not trying to give too much of a bare case, but, um, it it it will be a challenge for the business, and like they have 10 different business lines that roughly do $100 million plus each. And so like they have a lot of shovels in the fire and lots of things that they are trying to do, um, to build out that business across a range of vectors, and going to be Coinbase on its own game is really, really hard. And so, um, you know, there are things to like keep in mind and be careful of and just watch out for as Robin Hood expands to this on-chain ecosystem. I'm I'm sure a lot of people will build there, to be honest, just given the captive user base that Robin Hood will funnel, but at the same time, it's like if they have prided themselves on building great products, and like they have to continue doing that. And I bet you Robin Hood's developers that launch on Robin Hood chain are going to be using Coinbase developer platform to build their app. Yeah, funny. Yeah, that's funny. Guys, I've learned a lot, uh, so far in this conversation. So, really, really I'm glad you guys were able to come on and shed some of your knowledge. As we kind of wrap this up here, let's go back to the very beginning where I talked about the current valuations. Hood took the ticker is HOOD, $81 billion. Coin, $85 billion. So, again, roughly neck and neck as it kind of stands today. Omar, when it comes to future Hood aspirations, I know I can't ask you to ever predict the future of the market. You know, we have macro there, we have to can be concerned about. But obviously, you're bullish Hood. Like, what kind of numbers are you looking for? Are you looking for, you know, a 50% gain? Are you looking for a 500% gain? What kind of timelines are you thinking about? Just shed some light about your your future, your future imaginations for where this could go. Yeah. I I haven't sold any Hood and I've held it for a while. And I think that one, the one aspect to this story that we like didn't talk about, which is like really important to think about when you look at Hood's valuation, is there is like our parents' generation and our grandparents that unfortunately aren't going to be with us forever, and like the way Robin Hood is building their business is to very much be the primary recipient of like this generational wealth transfer. And if you like look at a range of different forecasts, like the numbers look something like $10 trillion over the next decade plus. And so like if you were to just like truly think about what happens in that bare scenario where someone that you love or in your family passes away, um, where does that money flow? Does it end up sitting on like the traditional platforms that your parents are using? Does it end up coming to what you're using? And I think like I have a quite constructive view on that, which is I think Robin Hood's going to be one of the primary beneficiaries, especially if I do my banking, my payments, and all my investing. And if that number is anywhere in that wheelhouse and they're able to capture, you know, 10% of that, which is like a trillion dollars, which is insane, you know, so 1% you know, you are talking about a business that can more than double, triple, and quadruple without like having to go too far out on the imagination spectrum. And so it's part of the reason why they bought a company called Trapmore, which is if I have money passed down, I want to do it in the most tax-efficient and optimized way. And so when that money does come, I have access to the right financial advisors, I have access to the right tax professionals, and I have right access to like the range of different investment alternatives to make sure my family is set up. And then when you think about it in the construct of their whole business, which is like if I have a Robin Hood gold card and I have virtual cards for my kids, and like my wife is on it, and everything is encapsulated, Robin Hood will be one of the primary beneficiaries of all of that in the future. And so I think when you look at $80 billion, like it is expensive. There's like no doubt about it. The stock's, to your point, it's run up a lot recently. Um, but I do think like if the business is the primary beneficiary of this wealth transfer, and like you don't really even need to believe anything else, like you can almost discount the\n\ncrypto stuff. Um, it is, it's a business that should be worth a few hundred billion dollars over the coming decade. And like, I think it's probably underselling it relative to the opportunity set globally and the financial infrastructure globally and the range of different ways they can monetize. Like today, it's $150 million or $150 ARPO per user. And so like, I think there, yeah, I'm not going to like put on a specific price target on it, but I do think it's expensive relative to the business today, but it's not relative and not expensive relative to what it can potentially grow into. And so like, for that reason, I continue to be bullish and I like am a big fan of Vlad and everything he has done. And I feel like it sits at the perfect intersection of changing technology, just global societal trends with populations and the way we interact with technology. And so I love it for all of those reasons. They've done a great job. And so, um, I think, you know, even if the valuation does seem expensive today, if you look at it on a reasonable time horizon, they can more than grow into that and exceed it by a large margin. I definitely, uh, really enjoy that thesis because, um, this is also one of the same thesis that I make me bullish about crypto. This is something that the crypto industry has chanted is chant is like when that wealth does come down from the boomers and the Gen X's down into the millennials and zoomers, those generations are going to buy assets that they relate to, which is Bitcoin and, you know, crypto assets Ether. And so I've heard that same thesis, Omar, but I've also heard in the crypto context too, which definitely benefits Coinbase, uh, in a in a similar fashion. Maybe Robinhood has a bigger net and I could totally take that argument, but nonetheless, like I think that's generally bullish for crypto assets, which I'm going to take that same argument and give it a plus one to the Coinbase side as well. David, I want to throw the same kind of question to you again. $85 billion Coinbase is where it currently sits. Again, I don't want to pin you down to any sort of time frames, but give me a similar kind of like ending thesis to Coinbase and its future aspirations. Yeah, I mean, I said something, uh, to Omar, I would say yesterday or the day before. Um, I think the target for both these companies is higher on a longer time frame. Uh, the near-term target is Bank of America, $300 billion plus, uh, market cap. The long-term target is overtaking JP Morgan, $800 billion plus. I think both of them can do that in a decade, potentially by the end of this decade, depending on how large, uh, the shift is in terms of global wealth transfer from from demographics and also a technology shift from off-chain to on-chain. So I think Robinhood is the demographic wealth transfer play. Um, I think Coinbase is the technology shift play to the global on-chain economy. The on-chain, sorry, the global economy moving on-chain. Um, Coinbase is the preeminent, uh, US-based crypto company, the largest capital market, uh, in the entire world, $100 trillion plus, uh, you know, global, uh, economy. If you believe that the industry, if you believe that the capital markets will move on-chain, I think Coinbase is the clear play. It has $930 million, um, dollars of like adjusted IBRA in Q1 alone, um, compared to Robinhood sitting at about $430 to $450 million adjusted IBRA. Yes, Robinhood does have a higher ARPO. I think it's like 30 to 40% higher, even though it's largely an estimate on Coinbase because they don't share, uh, their, you know, their monthly transacting users anymore like they used to. Uh, Robinhood does have like a larger, larger net today. Um, but I think if you look at the overall growth rate of Coinbase, uh, year-over-year or even quarter-over-quarter over a year-over-year basis, it's growing about 25%. Uh, obviously maybe a little, a little harder to discern because of the cyclicality nature of the crypto industry. But if you look at its subscription and services revenue, it's growing at about 35 to 36% year-over-year. Um, very much like what Omar said, I think both companies are expensive today. Uh, but I think that if you look at both, both, uh, businesses, they have a very clear line of sight to 10xing their revenue, uh, over the foreseeable future. Um, I think Coinbase's revenue growth is largely going to come from maybe in the short to midterm, maybe it comes from US per, if it is a, if it is a hit, in addition to the growth of, uh, stable coins on-chain and obviously getting the large revenue share from Circle. I think the long-term thesis on Coinbase is that it is the thin layer. It is a thin infrastructure layer for the for the economy moving on-chain and is going to power every single frontend, uh, tradi or fintech front end in the world, maybe outside of Robinhood. Uh, but every single developer that is building in the on-chain economy is going to be using some tool set that is developed through Coinbase and they're going to figure out a really, you know, uh, intricate or really, uh, elegant way to monetize that and have a high margin, high growth business, uh, for for years to come. Uh, yeah, so very bullish both. Uh, I think that I'm, I think Coinbase is just a bet on the industry growing. Robinhood is a bet on Robinhood. And I think both will extremely, will do extremely well. Well, I mean, I went into this, uh, episode thinking like it's going to be Coin versus Hood, but I think as we wrap this up, it's going to be Coin and Hood. I don't really see why they actually need to be there. They they are doing very similar things, but in pretty different lanes that definitely do touch in certain arenas, but overall, I think it's just a story of two new companies bringing the world of finance into modernity in their own particular ways, in ways that are very necessary and meaningfully differentiated. And so, uh, this was a great discussion, guys, and, um, I think my big takeaway is going to be Coin and Hood in the future. Awesome. Thank you for having us. It was great. Agreed. Omar, we will get your Twitter into the show notes. You are from Dragonfly, and David, we will also get your Twitter from, uh, in from Twitter into the show notes as well. You, you are from Blockworks, guys. Uh, I learned a lot. You guys were, this is a phenomenal episode. Uh, really appreciate you guys coming on and sharing your knowledge. Thank you very much. Thank you again. Bank, you guys know the deal. Crypto is risky. Equities, they're risky, too. But you know what? Being sidelined also risky. Uh, so you can lose what you put in. But nonetheless, we are headed west. This frontier is not for everyone, but you're glad you are with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.",
