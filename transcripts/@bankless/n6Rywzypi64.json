  "cleanText": "Welcome to Bankless, where today we explore the frontier of wealth.\nThis is Ryan Sean Adams.\nIt's just me today.\nI'm here to help you become more bankless.\nSo, today's episode is kind of personal.\nI uh did this episode for myself, but also in hopes that it will help the entire BANKLESS community.\nUm maybe my story will help some of you guys if you're grindaddicted overachievers like myself.\nSome context for this.\nAt the end of January this year, some of you may know that uh I took a sabbatical.\nAfter 5 years swimming the crypto media ocean and uh another public lynching, I realized I was feeling kind of cooked.\nSomething had crashed out in my operating system.\nI felt exhausted.\nI felt burnt out.\nI felt done.\nAnd uh I talked to David and I said, \"David, I've got to leave.\"\nAnd truthfully, I wasn't even sure if I'd come back to Bankless.\nSahil Bloom's book, which is the one we're talking about in today's episode, was essential for me.\nIt's called The Five Types of Wealth.\nAnd um a lot of the lessons here are how I uncooked myself and came back for from my sabbatical with renewed purpose.\nNow, I wrote this freedom was why I started the bankless journey, crypto as an escape hatch from the systems that run our lives.\nYet somewhere along the way, I chained myself to a price chart.\nI forgot to define enough.\nToday's episode is about defining enough.\nIt's how to measure wealth and how to dollar cost average into the areas of wealth that will provide you real compounding returns throughout your life.\nPlease enjoy.\nBagless Nation, we have Sahil Bloom on the podcast today.\nSahil, how are you doing?\nI'm doing great.\nThanks for having me.\nHey, I wanted to thank you for writing this book.\nUm, it came to me at the right time.\nSo, uh, I don't know if you you probably recall, we had a podcast booked.\nI think it was like in February with the launch of your your book.\nUm, in February, I wasn't working at Bankless.\nSo, I had actually taken a 3-month hiatus from Bankless due to burnout.\nUh, and so I got this book in the mail at a time I think I needed it most.\nAnd and you wrote this on a you know I don't know if you remember this but you wrote this you like um handwritten note to me in the book itself you said Ryan thrilled to share this with you marked a few spots I think you'll love please share it if you find value in it I did find value in it we are now sharing it on bank list it was actually kind of my my burnout book right book at the right time and uh it taught me a lot so I wanted to begin by saying just like thank you for writing it and uh thank you for this note and bring it to my attention well I'm glad that it hit you at the right time.\nIt is um it's one of those funny things in life that I have found that sometimes you can hear a message a hundred times but for it to really create an impact and a chain reaction and a ripple it needs to hit you in the right moment.\nOne of the things I often think about is the fact that awareness is perishable and what I mean by that is it's not enough to know something in the abstract sense.\nYou need to know it at the moment when it counts.\nYou need to know it at the testing point, right?\nAnd so, you know, people often say like, well, I already know this thing.\nBut, uh, knowing it at a moment is much less important than knowing it at the moment.\nAnd so, I'm glad that, you know, in in your the moment, uh, when it was really important that these ideas hit you.\nYeah.\nThere's also an opportunity to apply it.\nLike the book is very practical.\nIt's not just knowledge, but it's also like uh implementing systems in your life.\nAnd so, I had time and space to actually implement some of these systems.\nBut let's hope we meet some of the BANKLESS audience at kind of the right time with this message because I think it's pretty important for investors for people in the crypto community.\nThe core element of the book is how we measure wealth and I want to begin with this question.\nHow do you think most people measure wealth today and where do they go wrong?\nIt's pretty simple.\nUh money.\nUm look, historically um our scoreboard, if you will, for our entire lives has been money.\nUh you you may factor in other things.\nYou may think about other things, but at the end of the day, when you walk into a room and you're trying to create a hierarchy among the people that are in there, you're trying to stack yourself up.\nYou're trying to measure your entire worth as a human being.\nHow do you do it?\nIt's around this one figure.\nIt's around your net worth.\nYou know, the amount of money that you have or that you make.\nUh, and my big call to action around this entire idea is to recognize that what you measure in life really matters.\nThat is not something that we talk about a whole lot, but what you measure really matters.\nPeter Ducker, the famous management theorist, uh, once said, what gets measured gets managed.\nThat is the idea that the thing that you measure ends up being the thing that you narrowly hone in on and optimize around.\nAnd look, you don't have to look very far to find examples of that in your own life.\nLike, you know, anyone that you know, or maybe you've done it, you put on one of those like sleep tracker bands or rings.\nAll of a sudden, they become the most annoying sleep person in the world.\nOh no, I can't go out cuz I, you know, my sleep score, all these things, right?\nAll of your actions suddenly surround this one thing that you are now measuring.\nAnd historically for us in our lives that has been about money.\nIt was the one thing that we measured that we tracked against.\nAnd so as a result, all of your actions go in a line around this one thing.\nAnd unfortunately, while money is a part of building a good, wealthy, fulfilling life, it is far from the only part.\nAnd so when all of your actions go to surround this one thing that you are measuring, you may end up with a situation that I talk about I call the pirick victory.\nThe idea of the the battle won but the bigger war potentially lost.\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense.\nI I think people investors and and people in crypto um their scoreboard is often their net worth and in particular you check prices and you're looking at net worth on almost a daily basis.\nThe entire Bankless podcast was sort of based on this concept of um freedom and uh freedom through growing your crypto net worth essentially.\nAnd like one of the things I've realized like I knew this but I also re realized during my uh my hiatus period of time was I was actually measuring wealth in a myopic way.\nSo, if the purpose of this podcast uh is freedom and freedom equals just net worth, that wasn't like enough.\nAnd so, I guess one of the misconceptions I had probably um you know, going into this this period of my life was that I could focus on net worth first, get that out of the way, get to a number that I'm comfortable with, and then I could go focus on the other, you know, areas of wealth.\nAnd we'll we'll get to those areas of wealth cuz I want to be very um deliberate to to guide folks through this content.\nBut like you know things like time, things like you know more mental space, more time with my family, work on my relationships, I could do that all later.\nWhat's the flaw in that logic?\nBecause I think a lot of people are grinding for net worth right now.\nBut why is that?\nWhere can that go wrong?\nSo there's really two sides to this.\nThe traditional logic is exactly what you said, which is um look, it's it's Maslo's hierarchy of needs.\nIn the early days, money directly buys happiness.\nAnyone that tells you otherwise is just flat out lying to you.\nI'm never going to say money doesn't matter because it does.\nWe know that.\nWe've experienced that in our own lives or we've seen it where it reduces fundamental stresses and burdens.\nIn a way, what money actually does is it doesn't buy happiness, it reduces unhappiness.\nAnd so you remove those things that were making you unhappy, the stresses, the burdens, the things.\nMaybe it starts to allow some like incremental pleasures like you know couple vacations a year uh you know making sure that you can take care of all of those people around you.\nThat is happiness.\nUm beyond that level though it starts to show diminishing returns and these other areas of life are what are going to contribute to all of you know the incremental gains and happiness.\nSo, the traditional logic has been exactly what you said, which is, okay, well, I'm going to just just focus on money.\nI'm going to flip that switch on and everything else is going to be turned off until I get to my number, quote unquote, then I'm going to switch, you know, later I'll worry about all these other things.\nThe reason that logic is flawed is because it relies on this idea of like onoff switches in life.\nThat you can turn one on and that all the others get turned off and that just later you're going to have the wherewithal, the self-awareness to be able to adjust what switches you have on and off.\nThe reality is that that whole idea of later uh is flawed.\nUh you know, my grandfather used to say later will be dead.\nUh and it's really true.\nLater just becomes another word for never.\nYou you say things like, \"I'll spend more time with my kids later.\nI'll focus on finding my freedom and purpose later.\nI'll focus on my relationship with my partner, with my friends later.\nI'll invest in my health later.\"\nAnd later just becomes another word for never because those things are not going to exist in the same way later.\nYour kids are not going to be 5 years old later.\nYour partner, your friends won't be there for you later if you're not there for them right now.\nYou won't magically wake up with freedom and purpose later.\nYou won't be able to find your health later.\nSo, either you find a way to design those things into your life right now in some tiny way or you're just going to end up regretting it later.\nAnd so, the call to action around that and the actual framework or system that I would think about is stop thinking of your life as existing on these onoff switches.\nStart thinking of it of these dimmer switches, right?\nThis idea that yes, I'm going to focus primarily on financial wealth building on my career during this season of my life in your 20s and 30s.\nGreat idea.\nTurn that dial up.\nBut the other areas don't get switched off.\nThey just get turned down low.\nThe recognition being anything above zero compounds.\nYou don't have to do something dramatic to make steady incremental progress.\nYou know that when it comes to your money, you know that dollar cost averaging a tiny amount into any of these assets is going to benefit you in the long run because it's going to stack.\nIt's going to compound.\nExact same principle that mindset shift needs to occur.\nThe exact same principle applies to these other areas of life.\nThe tiny investment in your relationships on a daily basis stacks and compounds.\nTiny investment in your physical health, in your mental health, in all of these areas, it stacks and compounds.\nSo figure out a way to dollarc cost average into all of these things in your life and you'll benefit from it in the long run.\nIn the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance, the protocol revolutionizing

I'm\nwondering, Sahil, if, like, does it take\npeople, most people, to realize that\nthey're sort of allocating their their\nwealth in the wrong ways? Does it\nusually take some sort of life catalyst\nto have them wake up and realize it?\nLike, I feel like there's an element of\nthat for me was the symptom of burnout\nand this feeling of loss of purpose. But\nI can imagine other people wake up to\nthis. There's some kind of sickness or\nmedical scare, perhaps, maybe a death in\nthe family, maybe like kind of a mental\nbreakdown. It almost feels like when you\nwere talking earlier about you need to\nhear the right message at the right time\nin your life.\nSometimes these catalysts can be pretty\nkey. Is this how most people realize\nthat they've allocated wealth in the\nwrong places? I would say that most\npeople need that jolt. Um, it's like\nanything, right? You know, where this\nyou guys talk a lot about financial\nmarkets on this podcast. Um, you know,\nif you're going to make an investment in\na stock or in a crypto asset or\nanything, you always think about what is\nthe catalyst for this to have a big\nprice change. Uh, it's no different for\nyour life. You're like, you know, what\nis the catalyst going to be? The sad\nthing is that that catalyst is often\nsomething traumatic. And we shouldn't\nneed in life a traumatic event in order\nto make steady incremental changes. You\nlike, I write about in the book my own\npersonal traumatic event experience that\nled to the big life change that I made.\nAnd the sad reality is that that didn't\nneed to happen. We could have been\nmaking steady incremental changes from\nfour or five years before it and avoided\nthe entire thing. Um, you know, there are\nplenty of examples in life of things\nthat we don't need to learn the hard way\nin order to understand that they're\ngoing to be painful to us if we keep\ndoing them. I don't need to, you know,\nelectrocute myself in a socket to know\nthat I probably don't want to do that,\nright? Like, we there there's certain\npieces of information that we seem to\ninternalize and understand. I don't need\nto get bit by a shark to know that I\nprobably shouldn't, like, you know, go\nchumming up some waters and swimming\naround with a shark. Um, and that's\nreally what we're doing when we march\ndown these paths in life. Uh, you know,\nfocusing entirely on the one thing at\nthe expense of everything else. We are\nswimming around in shark-infested,\nchummed up waters thinking that we're\nnot going to get bit. And it's\nridiculous.\nFor me personally, I feel like the last\ncouple of years I knew something in the\nbackground was kind of wrong or off, that\nI was slowly kind of losing purpose,\ngetting too, uh, like, just time poor.\nAnd the way I sort of was able to\ndescribe it in words, uh, you know, in\nthe last couple of months is I felt time\npoor, relationship light, mentally\nscattered, and physically soft. But I\nthink there is a trap for people who are\nmaybe like me, who are kind of, um, grind\naddicted overachievers, I would say,\nwhich, like, life has kind of taught me\nthat, hey, sometimes you will achieve\nincredible results if you just grind\nharder and you have to stick it out. You\nhave to grind. You have to have sort of\na, you know, a long-term gain mindset if\nyou are to get to the other side and\nachieve some level of success in your\nlife. And so what can happen, and what I\nrealized was happening to me, was I was\ngetting caught in this grind cycle where\neach day I would kind of wake up and be\nlike, wait, okay, why am I doing this\nagain? Ah, put that aside, don't ask\nthat question, just continue the grind\nand keep going. Uh, how does someone\nwho's a grind addicted overachiever like\nmyself, like, what are some of the\nsymptoms that they might be, uh, going on\nthe wrong path or allocating their their\nwealth in the wrong ways? You know, one\nof the most important concepts to\ninternalize here is this idea of\ncreating space in your life. Uh, the\ngrind addict, uh, I would bucket myself\ninto that, uh, is very bad at creating\nmicro space, meaning like little pockets\nof space on a daily basis to recharge.\nUm, uh, you know, to that feels like\nthat feels like you're not doing\nanything during those. It feels like\nyou're not doing anything. You know,\nthat, like, the greatest challenge for\nany ambitious person is to reframe rest\nand recovery as a part of your\nperformance rather than as a reward for\nyour efforts.\nLike the grind addict, which again I\nwould categorize myself as that for much\nof my life, is convinced that rest and\nrecovery are a reward. So, okay, yeah, I\nworked a year straight grinding on this\nthing. Now I get my reward of the, like,\ntwo-week vacation where I do nothing.\nAnd what that person finds when they\ntake that two-week vacation, when they\ndo nothing, is that they're miserable\nfor some reason. You know, maybe they\nget sick, maybe they're there and\nthey're restless, they don't know what\nto do, they feel like it actually\ndoesn't provide the relief that they\nthink. The much better way to do it is\nto, on a daily basis, have a few things\nthat, you know, provide that recharge so\nthat you don't really feel like you need\nthat enormous macro break on, you know,\nsome recurring basis. People always ask\nme that, like, you know, how do you\nprevent burnout? I'm like, well, on a\ndaily basis, like every single evening,\nI try to get in my sauna and do some\nreading. I love doing that. Recharges\nme. Every single night, I feel a level\nof relief going to bed. I do a little\nbit of journaling, like three, five\nminutes of journaling, get in my sauna.\nIf I can, like, handle these couple of\ndaily non-negotiables that provide that\nsensation of recharge and rest, I could\ndo that every day for the rest of my\nlife. Sure, am I working hard during the\ncourse of the day? Absolutely. But I\nalso have built in that rest and\nrecovery. It's it's no different than\nhow you would expect an elite athlete to\nlive. Like, we all need a little bit\nmore of that elite athlete mindset. You\nyou like watch Lionel Messi playing\nsoccer. He walks around the field 95% of\nthe game. He's just walking. People get\nmad. They're like, &quot;Oh, it's laziness,\nright?&quot; It's it's not. It's strategy.\nHe's, you know, he's conserving energy.\nHe's creating space. He's creating a\nmental map of the field. And then he's\ndeploying energy in the exact right\nangle in the right moment to create the\n10 or 100x outcome. We all need to\noperate a little bit more like that in\nour own lives if we want to thrive\nacross multiple seasons. You can grind\nyour way to success over a very short\nburst, but it's really hard to do over\nmultiple seasons. Sometimes just\ncreating that space and just forcing\nyourself to create that space, whether\nit's, uh, like, on a vacation or like on\na daily basis, which, uh, you like, I\nwould encourage, or or even if you, like\nme, you get to a point where you're just\nkind of you collapse due to burnout and\nyou just sort of need to take some time\naway. Part of why it's helpful is I\nthink it breaks the addiction cycle for\num, grind people like myself, right? Like\nI didn't actually realize still that it\nI was I was rationalizing the grind,\nacting like, oh, this is what working\nhard looks like. This is what you need\nto do to achieve, um, to achieve, you\nknow, incredible outcomes, but really\nthis was a rationalization for like an\naddiction that I had, an addiction to\njust like being busy. And so, I think\nforcing yourself, even if you don't\nwant to, even if it doesn't feel right,\nto create that space, is something that\ncan break the addiction and help you\nrealize that you've been addicted this\nentire time.\nCuz sometimes that just occurs in the\nbackground without you realizing it.\nAbsolutely. And the other thing to\nrealize is that\nthere are many times in life where the\ngrind is really just an avoidance\nmechanism.\nYou are grinding because you are afraid\nto ask the questions that will really\npush you to grow. It's much easier to\njust continue doing the things that\nyou've done. That blind consistency of\njust continuing to show up. Uh, blind\nconsistency is ignorance masquerading as\na virtue.\nOver and over again, you show up and you\npound your head into a wall and you\nconvince yourself, yeah, like I'm\ngrinding, right? You know, you kind of\npump a fist. You're like, I'm grinding.\nBut really, what you're doing is that\nyou're avoiding asking the challenging\nquestions that would force you to\nconfront parts of yourself or parts of\nyour vision or parts of your actions\nthat are not aligned with what you're\ntrying to create. I did that. I did that\nfor seven years. I just I convinced\nmyself that all of my happiness,\ncontentment, and fulfillment was on the\nother side of some achievement, some\nbonus, some promotion, some goal, some\ntitle, some fancy thing. And it's called\nthe arrival fallacy. You know, you\nconvince yourself that you were going to\nfeel like you have arrived once you get\nthat thing. So, you put your head down\nand you grind to go get it. And all you\nfind is that it is a fallacy. You get\nit, you immediately reset to whatever\nthe next horizon is. You feel a dread of\nnever having done enough, of needing to\ndo more. And the truth is that if you\nallowed yourself to slow down, you would\nbe able to ask those questions. Am I\nactually on a mountain that I care to be\nat the top of? Like, is this a race that\nI chose or is this one that I was just\nhanded that I have stepped into by\ndefault? Are my actions actually leading\nme to the future that I want for myself?\nThose are hard, uncomfortable questions\nto ask. And the truth is that the\nanswers that you are seeking in life are\nfound in the questions that you avoid.\nSo if you just keep grinding over and\nover and over again, day in, day out,\npounding your head into a wall, and you\ndon't create the space to ask those\nquestions, you're never going to find\nthose answers that you're looking for.\nThat's such a good point. I think your\nmessage is being so much more\nintentional with the way you live and\nthe way you dollar cost average across\nthese, uh, these wealth categories,\nright? And it's like, yeah, addiction is\none aspect of why I grind, why people\ngrind in general, but so is avoidance.\nAnd that resonates for me. I I realized I\nwas kind of like, uh, I was doing the\nfinancial wealth thing, net worth thing,\ninvesting thing, work thing, because I\nwas good at it, like really good, and I\nwas like not so good at some of these\nother areas. It was harder for me. So I\nwas basically avoiding them and putting\nthem off, procrastinating, saying I\ncould get to those, uh, elements of\nwealth later, and, uh, again, the the\ntrap being later, you know, can never\ncome, and you can find yourself living a\na life without purpose. And you, like, I\nmean, look, we live in a culture, we\nhave not helped this as a problem, uh,\nand even, um, with positive intentions,\nwe have not helped this, right? Like, I\ndon't know if you've read the book\nMindset, Carol Dweck, very, very famous,\nyou know, has probably sold multiple\nmillions of copies now. It was the\norigin of this whole idea of growth\nmindset versus fixed mindset, right? And\nthe culture around growth mindset, I mean\nthe idea says that basically, uh, you\nknow, you should focus on inputs and\neffort, um, because you you have an\nability as a human being to grow and\nchange and be dynamic, and that we\nshould praise\neffort rather than outcomes, especially\nin kids, to instill in them this idea\nthat that's where they should focus and\nthat's what they should focus on, not\nthe outputs, you know, intrinsic versus\nextrinsic.\nAnd that only works up to a point. Um,\nbecause, you know, look, look, if we\ncontinue to praise input and efforts, we\ncreate a culture where everyone is just\nentirely focused on those efforts. It's\nall about the grind. It's all about\nshowing up and pounding your head into a\nwall. And the truth is that you may feel\ngood about your inputs, about your\neffort, but the world is going to judge\nyou on your output. Um, and so it\ndoesn't matter how you feel about your\ninputs. Yeah. I had a conversation once\nwith, uh, Adam Grant, the, uh, you know,\nauthor and and, um, uh, professor, and\nhe was talking about the fact that he\nhad a student who turned in a paper, and\nhe gave the student, like, a B on the\npaper, and the student came to him and,\nuh, you know, at the end of the semester\nand was like, hey, I, you know, I don't\nagree with this grade that you gave me.\nIt doesn't adequately\nuh, you know, capture the effort that I\nput into this class and into this paper.\nAnd his point and his response to the\nkid was, &quot;I'm not grading you on effort.\nI'm grading you on the output that you\nput together.&quot; So, it doesn't matter if\nyou grinded your butt off on this paper,\nyou put in so much effort because\noutcomes are what actually matter in\nlife. And the key to outcomes is\nbalancing the push with the recovery,\nwith the space, with the, uh, you know,\nyou know, with the with the rest. And so\nunless you find that balance in your\nlife, if you obsess over just the input\nand the effort and the energy that\nyou're putting into the thing, uh, you\nmiss out on a really vital part of all\nof this. All right. So let's talk about\nthose outcomes and the revised\nscoreboard that you put forward in in\nyour book, The Five Types of Wealth. So\nif you know Bankless listeners are with\nus this far, you know, they hear sort of\nwhat we're saying. They're saying, you\nknow, they they hear the message, okay,\nnet worth isn't the only thing that\nmatters. It is one thing that matters,\nis one measure of wealth, but it's not\nthe only thing. So what are the other\nfour, besides financial, what are the\nother four categories of wealth that you\ntalk about? Time wealth, social wealth,\nmental wealth, and physical wealth are\nthe other four. So time wealth is all\nabout freedom to choose how you spend\nyour time, who you spend it with, where\nyou spend it, when you trade it for\nother things. It is about an awareness\nof time as your most precious asset.\nSocial wealth is about relationships.\nMental wealth is about purpose. It's\nabout growth. And it's about creating\nthat space to wrestle with some of those\nbigger picture questions, whether it's\nthrough spirituality, religion,\nmeditation, solitude, what have you. Uh,\nand then physical wealth is about your\nhealth and vitality. It's about taking\ncontrollable daily actions, uh, to\npromote that vigor over long periods of\ntime.\nAnd are all five of those equally\nimportant, or how would you kind of, like,\nrank them? Your life has seasons and\nwhat you prioritize or focus on during\nany one season\n\n\nWill change. The key is that you consider all five as you make decisions across those different seasons of your life. But you will have seasons when you have the dial, the dimmer switch that we talked about earlier, way turned up in one area and turned down in the others, and then in a future season that may adjust and change. But the important point is that you consider and factor in all of them across these different seasons of life.\n\nNow, how fungeible are these things? I want to go back to my earlier comment and maybe you could disabuse, uh, like me, of this like previous perspective I've had, but the perspective that once you have the financial wealth, you can basically, they're fungeible with the other types of wealth. So you could basically buy your time. So why, why do most people not have very much time wealth? Well, they work a demanding job. You know, they have 50, 60-hour weeks, and in order for them to graduate from wage slave type status, right, they need to be in a, you know, a state of financial freedom. And so you get financially wealthy, and then you can kind of like buy time, and then with time, you can invest further in your social wealth, you can invest further in your, your, uh, physical wealth, you can invest further in your mental wealth. So it seems there's an element of like financial and time might be like more important than the others or or provide kind of a base pad for the other types of wealth. Anyway, how do you read this, and how do you think about the fungeibility of these different things?\n\nFinancial wealth is, uh, important in two ways here. First off, yes, you need a baseline amount of financial wealth to be able to think about any of these other types of wealth. Maslow's hierarchy of needs definitely applies here. Like if you cannot take care of basic needs, food, shelter, security, safety of the people around you, you're probably not worried about your purpose, um, you know, or about your time at that point. You're really focused on this core set of needs. The second point here is that, um, financial wealth can be an extraordinary tool for building these other types of wealth, but very, very few people treat it as such. What they do is they become a slave to it. And so the financial wealth, rather than being a tool, which we all know it should be. In the back of our mind, we all say like, well, I'm going to make money and then I'm going to be free, right? You're like, okay, so you're saying, I'm going to make money and then it's going to be a tool to get me my freedom. What actually happens is that money along the way, whether you realize it or not, becomes the goal in and of itself. The goal is the freedom. The goal is not the money. Like money on a screen doesn't do anything for you, right? People don't dream of just having a bigger number on a screen. What you dream about is having the freedom to go take a month and go sail around, uh, Croatia on a, on a nice sailing boat because you earned a whole lot of money. Exactly. But that same person that said that that was their dream is the person that sits there staring at the screen once they have way more than enough money to go and do that thing. Because what they actually got addicted to along the way was the idea that money was the goal. And they got to $10 million, and then they convince themsel that 30 was the number that they needed. Then they get 30, and they convince themselves 90 is the number. And we have science to prove that. Michael Norton, this Harvard Business School professor, ran this study where he went and asked a bunch of high net worth individuals, you know, worth anywhere from a million through 100 million plus, how happy are you on a scale of 1 to 10? Then he asked, how much more money would you need to be at a 10? And across the board, whether the person was worth a million or 100 million plus, they all said they needed two to three times as much money to be out of 10. It makes no sense. It, it does. There just should be a happiness number at some point, but that's not what humans do. Those numbers reset. Money becomes the goal along the way rather than being recognized as a tool to get to that thing that you really want.\n\nWhy do you think that is? Do you think this is greed? Is it just like the G word? Is that, is it that simple? No, it's what we can measure. It goes back to the scoreboard. It's the thing that you can measure, and it's the way that you measure your life. It's the way that you measure how well you are doing at the life video game. So, it's not like a Scrooge McDuck, like I just want to swim, like dive into pools of, of gold and kind of swim around with it. It's, it's more about like a high, high score in a video game, basically. Yeah. You feel like you're getting better at the game, and you see it, and you can track it, and you can measure it, and you're like, \"Wow, I'm getting better.\" It's very hard to measure the quality of your relationships, and you can't flex on that. It's or it's harder to at least. It's hard to flex on your, you know, free time necessarily. It's hard to flex on your mental health, on your physical health. You kind of can now with, you know, biomarkers and, you know, shirtless pictures, but really money is kind of the way that people do this. And so people hone in on and focus on that thing. The other thing to realize is that money does not equal freedom. That's a thing. You look, look how many times on this podcast have people said or thought that. How many of the listeners assume, oh, money equals freedom? I'm going to have money, therefore I am going to be free. I think I was one of them. And I think that has been part of the fallacy of this, which is like it's part of freedom, but it's incomplete. But yeah, continue.\n\nYeah, I think it was in Fight Club, uh, that there was the line, uh, the things we own end up owning us. And that is true like over and over again. What you find is that you get caught on this endless cycle, this treadmill. I, I mean, I have a friend who was a senior executive at a big public company, probably making about $10 million a year. Uh, you know, net worth 200 million plus, like endless, endless money. And, um, he could not leave that job and cannot leave that job, uh, because he's afraid of what will happen if he removes that income because their lifestyle has inflated to the point where they're basically spending all of it. He can't go take, uh, you know, like a cool new job or something that he really wants to do or go start a new startup or do something like that, uh, because he's afraid of giving up the, uh, you know, stable, uh, treadmill running income and cash flow that he's creating that is not free. He has all the money in the world. Like for me, I'm like, if I had that, I would be the, you know, you, you wouldn't catch me anywhere. Like you couldn't get me to do anything. But if, if you were in that situation, you do not feel free. I, I mean, I have friends who make an extraordinary amount of money working at hedge funds in New York that if they get a call on a Saturday night, you know, from an LP or from their boss or from anyone to do something that, you know, the kids like recital, the little league game that they were supposed to go to, too bad, right? They're, they're working, and they could be worth $100 million. They could be making 10, $20 million a year, but that is not free. So the money doesn't equal freedom. A thoughtfully freed designed life can lead to freedom. You know, recognizing that money is the tool to get you freedom and designing that along the way to be free is what's going to lead to that. Yeah. I mean the case of the hedge fund manager who doesn't go see their kids recital, right? Money is doesn't equal freedom. It also money, money also does not equal wealth because I mean that is, uh, an individual who's probably relationship poor or at least not as relationship wealthy as they could be. And that's why the the message of your book is so important. We've got to completely redefine how we measure and how we see wealth.\n\nI actually want to tackle, you know, we'll tackle each of the areas of wealth individually, but I want to talk about financial first. It's actually last in your book with some purpose, but, um, let's talk about it first here because I think you're speaking to a lot of folks who are, uh, looking at screens for price charts, uh, more than they need to be, more than they should be. Perhaps they're addicted to it. Perhaps they're kind of in a place that I was where it's like money equals freedom, and it's, uh, either for me it was not very much by way of, um, lifestyle inflation. It was more about kind of the game and the thing I measured for success. And so that that became my barometer of how free I was and how well I was doing, basically. Um, the number one thing I think people can do who are listening to this is do something that you recommended in your book, which is define enough. Define what enough actually means. And I'm guessing there's a lot of people listening to this podcast, maybe who've been with us, you know, for years listening to this podcast, who actually don't have a definition, I'm talking about like a numerical definition of what enough means in their own life. Can you talk about that, Sahil?\n\nYeah, there's this famous story that I love of, uh, Kurt Vonagget and Joseph Heler, these two famous American authors, uh, walking around the like palatial estate of this billionaire in the Hamptons, and they're walking around in these gardens, and Vonagget turns to Heler and says, \"Joe, how does it feel that just yesterday the owner of this home made more money than your most famous book, Catch22, made in its entire lifetime?\" And Heler thinks about it and looks back at him and says, \"Yes, but I've got something that he'll never have.\" And Vonagget says, \"What's that?\" And Heler replies, \"The knowledge that I've got enough.\"\n\nThat is this idea in a nutshell. The knowledge that I've got enough. What does that mean? An understanding of when you have enough. It is about the fact that your expectations are your single greatest financial liability. If your expectations rise faster than your assets, you will never feel wealthy. You'll never feel rich. Well, we don't need to look far to find examples of that, right? It's the rich yet miserable person that never seems to have enough, that continues to chase the thing. It's the billionaire that commits suicide cuz they chased the next thing, made way too many, uh, levered bets, ended up losing it all, and their whole life comes crashing down. Why did they do that? Because they didn't understand their own definition of enough. They were lost in the chase for more, that treadmill. And when you say define enough and you say you know numerically, really understand it, there's an addition here, the number has a tendency to disappear and reappear. I talked about that study Michael Norton did, you know, it does the 2 to 3xing dance. So what I would add to that in addition to having some sort of number in your mind is really visualize the life. What does your enough life look like?\n\nBecause one of the most important and overlooked concepts on your entire journey as you're making money, which by the way, I love making money. I want to make a lot of money. I, I enjoy it. I, I have it. I find it fun, you know, uh, you know, playing the game, doing things better. I'm not saying money is bad. And my enough life is not a Spartan life, but it's very important to not overlook what is the money for. Like what is the money for? Why am I doing all these things? What am I actually trying? What is the life I am actually trying to build? What does it look like? Where am I living? How many houses do I have? What am I, uh, you know, what am I thinking about on a daily basis? What am I working on? Who am I surrounded by? What am I able to do or work on? That is your enough life. It doesn't have to be spartan or bare. It could have multiple houses. You could have all sorts of nice things, be surrounded by people. But the important point is that it is clearly defined. Because when it's clearly defined, it doesn't do this like subconscious irrational disappearing act where it reappears on the horizon. You actually appreciate it when you're coming into it. And I know this from experience. Like I, you know, when I was making this big life change from, you know, the prior track that I was on, feeling really miserable, seeing a lot of areas of my life starting to fall apart to this new life that I'm currently living. When we went and bought our house, this new place, I had this sensation when I was like looking at it and like we were about to close on this house, I was like, man, this is it. Like, I don't need anything else. That doesn't mean I don't I'm not going to go try to build things and I'm going to chase my purpose, try to scale the impact that I can create. I think I will make more money in the future, but it was enough. And all the time I find myself just appreciating it as a result. Like I my enough life is being able to take my son in the pool at 1 pm on a Tuesday. If I can do that, like this is it. That's what the money was for. So that I could build the life where I could do that, where I had healthy, loving relationships, where I had enough money to have a pool in my backyard. So that's nothing to laugh at. Uh, you know, where I had the freedom to be able to do that, control of my time in that way, healthy enough to go in and do that. And so I just really encourage people to take the time to really ask that question. What is the money for? What is the life I am really trying to build?\n\nYeah. So I actually took this exercise very seriously. And, uh, you, you've got some steps in your book that I encourage people to do is literally coming up with an enough plan is what you call it. And so you have a relationship or someone in your life, for me it was my spouse basically where I sat down with her and we talked about what we're doing this for and what the number, uh, we need to achieve in order to make what we're doing this for possible. So like one of the guiding things of I think why I got on the grind in the first place, my own personal life is I got married young, you know, in my 20s. We had kids very early. I had a son with, uh, some, you know, special needs. He had some difficulties. And so my life\n\n\nOkay, how can I make sure that my family is taken care of and, you know, my son in particular, that he has everything that he needs? And then I just got in this grind cycle where I was just kind of stacking up points, you know, playing the game, and I had never stopped to actually create a number around, okay, what does my, what do the my loved ones, what do the people in my life, my family, what do they actually need in order to have what they need through us throughout the rest of life? And through this plan, I actually went and we came up with numbers around this. Okay, so like my son, what's he going to need throughout the rest of his life? Okay, that's a number. Now I have a goal, which is take care of my family, make sure he's supported, and I have a number that goes along with that, and it's kind of enough. Like that's the sort of granular detail that you can get to, and you and you can advocate it. It really creates time to think about what's important to you and like why you're doing this in the first place. And it just, it was a arucking to me that I had never done this exercise before. In all the time where I've been on a financial podcast talking about crypto, talking about building wealth, I had never gone through the exercise of defining like what was actually enough for me. And so I just did that, and it removed a like a burden and a weight in my life just even going through this exercise and having a plan around like what is enough. Yeah. And it's funny because there is again to the point we made at the very outset around this whole like grind set, you know, um, the mentality, the grinders, ambition. Um, there's an element in you that is going to feel uncomfortable when you go through this because you're going to be fighting this urge of like, what do you mean enough? You know, enough is when I'm dead. Like I'm just going to keep, you know, I'm just going to keep grinding. I'm just going to keep working. And again, it's not about giving up your ambition. Like I, it just, it's it's a reminder that when you do chase more, after you get enough, when you chase more, it has to be grounded in something more meaningful than money. You're like, I, I got this life. I built this. I created things um to earn this in a lot of ways. It's And again, I'm not a super fancy person, so it's not like some crazy, crazy life that I live, but that that wasn't the end of my ambition. I wrote my book after I already had that life. Like I, I did all of these things that I'm doing now after I had that life. It was a reminder that as I went and chased more, it had to be grounded in purpose. It had to be grounded in something more meaningful to me than money. And as a result, what I have found is that I actually make a whole lot more money when I'm grounding things in the right reasons. I want to ask a question uh on the financial wealth piece before we leave it. You have the story of you're talking about the catch22 author who says, \"I, I'll have something he'll never have.\" Speaking of the billionaire hedge fund manager, I, I have enough, basically that whole story. There is a deep cynicism, I think, in financial wealth circles and certainly in crypto that says something like this. Yeah, Sil, that's what like, that's cope. That's what people who don't know how to make money say, that's kind of an excuse. What's your response to that? Um, I guess my response is that this is entirely individual. So, like I, I don't, I don't judge anyone else's definition of enough. Uh, and I don't expect anyone to judge mine because it's individual. Like I, I actually don't, if if a hedge fund manager that makes hundreds of millions of dollars um wants to build a life and chooses by design to live a life where they're not able to make it to their family or kids stuff, um, what they really care about is trying to like leave a legacy and or like make the species interplanetary or go and do these things that'll force them to sacrifice all these other things in life. As long as they do that by choice and not by default, that's your prerogative, right? Like you, you go and build the life that you want. What I want everyone to do is to ask these questions. If you have asked the questions and you've come to the determination that you want to go and chase building in one area with all obsession, I think that's great. Go and do you. It's not what I want out of my life. It's not my definition of a successful wealthy life. But if it's yours, that's perfectly okay. And so I think that that is really the point here. It is this recognition that I had personally that I would never want to trade lives with the people that I was reading books about. Like I spent my whole childhood and young adulthood reading these like biography. I mean, still have them sitting around like all of these great men from history. Have you ever read the um Walter Isacson like Steve Jobs bio? Steve Jobs, you know, like Titan about um Rockefeller, like all of these books you can go and read, and we're taught that this is success, right? Like I'm going to celebrate these success stories, and we pat these people on the back and we admire them and we celebrate them, and then we tell them that they won the game, and we ignore the fact that they had three ex-wives and four kids that don't talk to them. And I had to ask myself in my own life, is that actually a game that I care to win? Because for me personally, that's not what success or wealth looks like. If it's your definition, that's totally fine. No judgment. But it's not mine. And so I do not feel a need, and I don't think it makes sense for culture or the way that we define things or social media to pressure me into chasing and running that race. I'm just going to opt out of that and choose to run my own. Create my own by design and go and live that way. And it's weird to people. Look, like I'm not saying this is easy because the thing is a lot of people won't understand it. Like when you start living differently, when you kind of opt out of some of these games that everyone wants you to chase and play, it looks weird to a lot of people on the surface. Like what do you, what do you mean you're not doing that? You know, like look, I, I have a big platform, um, reaches, you know, several million people every single week, and I don't have courses. I don't sell courses. I don't have a mastermind. Uh, you know, I don't have some coaching offering. Could I make $10 million a year doing those things? Probably. Like, look, I'm just being completely honest. Probably. I could probably sit down, come up with a bunch of stuff, sell a bunch of things like that, have a mastermind, have a Discord group, have all these things, make a whole lot of money. A lot of people don't understand why I don't do that. They're like, \"Well, what, what's the game? What's the launch?\" I'm like, \"Dude, I just don't care to do that. I don't need that money.\" And so, if I don't need the money and I don't want it and I don't want to do it that way, then I don't need to play that game. No one's forcing me to do those things. And trust me, the second I need the money because my family needs it for some reason, I'll, I'll go work at McDonald's if I need to make the money to go and take care of my family, but I don't need it right now. And so my whole thing is like you get to design and choose the games that you actually want to play, the races that you want to run. You do not have to step by default into the ones that other people hand you. Okay. Well, let's talk about the, you know, if the system default is really wired towards uh wealth being measured by financial net worth. Let's talk about the the other areas. So uh time is next. I think a lot of people feel time poor in today's society. Actually, maybe they would describe that as kind of like attention poor. Why do people feel this way? Why is there time poverty? There's this um scene that I love in uh Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to Alice and Wonderland, where the Red Queen is running hand in hand with Alice, and they're running faster and faster and faster, and Alice notices that they're not actually passing anything. Like nothing's moving even though they're running really fast. And this this became known as the red queen effect. It's the idea that you actually have to run faster and faster than your surroundings in order to make any progress. It was like an evolutionary biology concept of like you actually have to evolve faster than your predators and the people around you if you can hope to survive. Uh applied to our own lives. This is the idea that we are constantly having to run faster and faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And you have to run even faster than that if you hope to make progress. That is the sensation that many of us, I think, have in the modern day and age. It's like the treadmill, this invisible hand is just turning the treadmill up. You're running faster and faster. You're not actually getting anywhere. One of the biggest reasons for that is because we're wasting most of our time on stupid low value things that aren't really making progress in our life. We say yes to every single thing rather than focusing in on the two to three things that really drive the progress and outcomes in our life. Goes back to the Lionel Messi analogy that I gave you earlier. Like he doesn't sprint at every single ball that rolls his way all over the field because if he did, he wouldn't have any energy for the one moment when it really matters. There's this um ancient Greek concept, these two words for time. Kronos is the idea of like chronological, linear, quantitative time. All time is created equal. And then there's chyros, which is the idea that certain moments, certain windows have more texture. They have more meaning. They're more important. And that time or, you know, energy invested into those moments actually creates dramatically better outcomes. Uh, that is really a an analog for how we all need to live. We, we need to focus on what are those moments or opportunities or windows. When energy deployed into them, concentrated attention and energy deployed into those specific moments or opportunities can create those dramatic outcomes. That's how you break free of some of this time poverty trap that we find ourselves in. Speaking of breaking free, just as we were talking earlier about um having to break the grind addiction, I think there's another type of addiction that maybe a lot of people listening can relate to. Something I, I certainly found myself in, which is like the dopamine addiction of being on a phone or being like too online. I would say that led to this attention poverty, and you were talking about not spending your time in the right places, like so before my my break, I couldn't go 15 minutes without checking like prices or Telegram or Discord or Twitter, and I didn't even realize I, like, again, it was a trap where I felt like that was productive because I'm learning something, right? I'm keeping up with the the tip of the latest, and I can use that to inform my investing. I can use that in a podcast. I can, you know, see a guest maybe we want to have on the show. And there was this like dopamine drip addiction, this pressure of urgency. And so what I had to do in order to create space for myself and time to think about kind of the the rest of the the life plan as it were, is I had to just flat out cold turkey break that addiction. So, for me, it was just like, okay, I'm going to actually like delete apps from my phone. I'm going to go into my time settings of my phone, and 60 seconds a day is all you get on Twitter, if that, right? And so, I actually did that. I, I treated myself as as almost like a toddler in this way or like how I might, you know, put um constraints on uh, you know, on a young child or something like that. And I had to do that in order to break this addiction. There's a lot of things like that that are vying for our time and stealing our time, things that we're not even aware of. Yeah. I think that what you did is a good example of forcing the sort of like discomfort to break you free of these underlying assumptions that you've had um about how you have to operate and the things that you have to do. And it's it's very uncomfortable to make those changes. I mean, one of the big ones for me was uh that I think a lot of people probably experience is I am very bad at saying no to things. Um, especially uh, you know, when things are going well, you know, like what I find is that when things aren't going well, you don't get a lot of opportunities, and when things start going well, all of a sudden you get a million opportunities. Um, and you, it's sort of like, uh, you know, you're in high school and, uh, if you don't have a girlfriend, it's like impossible to find a girlfriend, but the second you find a girlfriend, every girl wants to date you. Uh, you know, it's like it's the exact same thing for professional opportunities. Like, all of a sudden, when you're when you're gainfully employed or you're occupied with a whole bunch of stuff, all of these opportunities come out of the woodwork uh, wanting your attention and vying for it. And so, like, in the aftermath of my book launch, all of a sudden, there's all these amazing opportunities. And one of the things that I've learned and had to really struggle with is that uh, the single greatest threat to your progress is distractions masquerading as good opportunities. Like there's all these things out there that are good opportunities, but they're not the opportunity. They're not the right one for you. They're not the main point of focus. And if you chase all of those good opportunities that are around you, you never have headsp space or bandwidth to capitalize on the one great opportunity that comes your way. Uh, and so learning to say no, creating better systems, and embracing the sort of just space that that creates in your life, even if it's uncomfortable, is a real challenge that creates a whole lot of time wealth. Um, and for again, the person that is ambitious, it feels very uncomfortable because what it creates is this weird middle period where you feel like you don't have enough going on, but you know that you're just waiting for that one juicy pitch, as the Warren Buffett likes to say, to come along so that you can really hit one out of the park.\n\n\nImagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language.

Basically, one of them I liked was um the two list exercise. We could talk about that. What is the two list exercise? This is uh a byproduct of a fabled conversation um between Warren Buffett and his his personal pilot, a guy named Mike Flint. Uh and the story goes that uh Flint was basically complaining to Buffett about the fact that he had way too many uh you know goals and priorities and he didn't know how he was going to accomplish all of them. Uh and so Buffett asks him to write all of them down on a piece of paper. So Flint goes and writes all these things down. and he comes back with this list of 25 things. And Buffett says, \"Okay, now circle the top three to five most important things out of that entire list.\" So Flint kind of struggles and goes and spends a half an hour and comes back with five of them circled. And Buffett says, \"Okay, well, what are you going to do with the other 20 items?\" And Flint says, \"Well, you know, then uh after I kind of get through these five, and I'm I'm working on these five, but after I get through those five on a day, then I'll do the other 20.\" and Buffett says wrong. That's incorrect. Those are your avoid at all costs items because those 20 things, any time spent on those is just a distraction. It's just pulling you away, pulling away your energy from the things that really matter that you've already identified. So, he tells him to split the lists. Split it into two lists. You've got your priorities and you've got your avoid at all costs. So now when something new comes in, you can look at it and say, \"Does this fit into my priorities or is it one of these avoid at all cost items that I just need to say no to?\" Creating that for yourself is a really helpful framing to allow you to say yes or no much more effectively and efficiently. Another thing that I found very useful I've added to sort of my daily regimen is um the morning bootup sequence. So, uh, before I had kind of a morning boot up sequence, I would fall into defaults, kind of like grind over achiever defaults. And I think maybe some people can relate to this. So, you wake up, you're, you know, you get hit by your alarm, the very first thing you do is you grab your phone and you check on things. So, you check your email, right? And like, oh, what are the things I need to work on, navigate? You check maybe your socials, you check like all the different communication tools that you have. You're just like, you wake up, eyes open. you don't even have a minute to reflect and you're already on the grind uh train and like the gears are turning maybe go downstairs you have some time for a coffee you know bake breakfast whatever but that's the very first thing I used to do now I have a different bootup sequence much more it's like so much of your book is about being intentional with how you are living your life and what you are dollar cost averaging into te tell people about the morning bootup sequence yeah this is an idea a of just creating a sort of like fixed sequence or set of rituals that get you into your kind of like primed state. Um, you know, everyone always talks about flow state. You're like, oh, you got, you know, you got to get into flow when you're working. But very rarely do we think about like, okay, what are the couple things I can do to reliably get into that state? And why don't I just make it like a bootup sequence the same way my computer has a boot up sequence to get started or any program that I run. Uh why don't I just incorporate those into a very short hopefully easy to execute ritual. It's not super useful if your boot up boot up sequence is like you know I need to spend 4 hours like you know Brian Johnson or uh human protocoling my way into a flow state. Uh if you have four hours and you've achieved that level of mastery then uh good for you. my my boot up sequence cannot be that long because uh you know I have a three-year-old who wakes up in a couple hours and I need to make sure I get some work done before then. Um but I uh I think that just like a couple of very simple rituals like what are you drinking? What are you listening to? You know, are you doing a quick cold shower or a cold plunge or a few push-ups or a walk or some movement or something like that? Um to kind of lock you into that and prime you for whatever the important thing is that you're going to work on. That's really important. We've sort of lost the plot when it comes to these morning routines in general. You know, like we're living in this and we're recording this sort of in the aftermath of this uh you know, morning routine craze of like the Saratoga water and dipping your face into ice water, right? Yes. You know, all of these things that we see on the internet. And the truth is that uh a lot of the routines that were designed to serve us end up owning us. And you know if you have a routine but you get stressed the night before about your ability to execute the routine the next morning that's not a good routine. That is the paradox of routines. Right? The best routine is the one that you can actually break and still get work done. My my entire life changed for me personally when I realized that if I need to I can just wake up in the morning, grab a coffee 2 seconds after I get out of bed, go to my desk and just get [ __ ] done and it still gets done and I can still work. I don't need to do my cold plunge and push-ups and go for a walk and do a million different things. If I have the space to do it, I'd love to, but if not, I can just go get work done and do those couple of tiny little things of my boot up sequence to feel good and ready to go. Yeah, my boot up sequence is really simple now, right? It's uh you basically wake up at 6:00, don't hit the snooze, do not check my phone, like no screen until like basically after 7. you know that you go downstairs, drink some water basically, you know, 16 ounces of vitamins, take the dog for a walk, and then by seven o'clock, make sure I have some time with the family for kind of like a daily sit down and and breakfast. So, it can be very simple, and you can change it over time. It's just the key for me was just like don't do the overachiever thing first thing you wake up and just start, you know, grinding away uh like you're you're some kind of a machine. Okay. Yeah, fight dogmas. Just like in general, everything we're talking about is like fight dogmas both internal and external. Dogmas that other people tell you to follow, you should definitely question and ask, but also the ones that you have in your own head about the way that you have to do things, just question them every now and then and test something different and see if it doesn't work better. Like, you know, I I used to have a very um focused morning routine that was the exact same every single day for many years. Um, and I've recently experimented with like reading first thing in the morning when I get out of bed, uh, for 20, 30 minutes, just like whatever kind of grabs me. And I've loved it. Like I I've found that it opens up my mind in a completely different way than some of the stuff that I used to do. And so I think that um, you know, you change, you adjust. And it's important that you allow yourself to uh, to do that. So, if you're saying no to things, if you're prioritizing the the few things that matter, if you've got things like a, you know, boot up sequence so you don't get stuck on on on tracks. We didn't mention the energy calendar, but you've got this concept of like you track a week of your activities and you categorize things as either they create energy or they drain energy or they're neutral. And then you just eliminate the things that that drain energy and are neutral. And you you focus on the things that create energy. And then you basically work those things into your calendar. moving forward. There's a lot of that goes into uh being much more deliberate about how you spend your time. And I would encourage folks if you feel like you've got some sort of a screen addiction where you're always checking prices. Let that be the first thing, right? Just like cut that and see what happens. And you'll know, by the way, if you sort of get the the urge to like just like pick up your phone that you were way too addicted in the first place and should have done that a long time ago. Okay, so that's time. And the idea here is once you have time wealth then you can invest that into other areas of your life including this next one which is uh social. So there are a lot of people out there who feel what I would call maybe relationship poor. Um lonely could be one example of this or even even the relationships that they do have they're not dollar cost averaging into those relationships and maybe the way that they should be and so those relationships are not not thriving not blossoming. What are the symptoms of this and why why do you think so many are feeling relationship poor? I think that the biggest mindset shift is the recognition that investments in your relationships are the single greatest investment you can make. Um, we don't often think that way. Relationships are really for most people the first thing that fall by the wayside when we get busy. uh you know, you get busy, life gets chaotic, [ __ ] hits the fan, and you stop, uh, you know, texting the friend, you stop going for the walk with your parents, you stop getting the old group of friends together for the annual trip, uh, you stop having the call with, you know, your sibling. All of those things fall by the wayside when in reality, the science and our own anecdotal evidence suggests that uh, relationships are the single greatest predictor of a happy, healthy life. Uh the Harvard study of adult development, I would argue the most important study of the last hundred years, followed the lives of 2,000 people over the course of 85 years. They found that the single greatest predictor of physical health at age 80 was relationship satisfaction at age 50. Not blood pressure, not smoking or drinking habits, not cholesterol. How you felt about your relationships was what determined how well you aged. And so what better reason do you need to invest in your relationships to design those tiny investments to dollar cost average into your relationships on a daily basis? We know those are the things that make life worth living in the long run. One way you describe the key relationships in in your life is the front row funeral people. So these are the people who are going to be in the front row at your funeral. So when you say optimizing for your relationships, there's kind of a prioritization you like system here. and the people who who are the people in the front row of your funeral, are you investing in those? Can you talk about that? Yeah, I mean the idea is to recognize that relationship wealth means something different to every single person. Um, you know, one person can feel really relationship wealthy, social, you know, they you can feel like a social billionaire if you have like two deep close friendships. Um, some people need 20, some people need 15. It's just a natural uh disposition of, you know, extroversion versus introversion and uh where you kind of sit on a spectrum in that sense. And so the point is you need to identify who are those people that are really going to hold this esteemed place in your life and what are you doing on a daily basis to recognize to cherish them and what are you doing to be that to someone else that's out there? Because that's an important recognition that over and over again in your own life, we say there are all these things that we want, but then we are not embodying those things that, you know, like I have friends that are in the dating market, they'll make these long elaborate lists of all the things they're trying to find in a partner, but then they're not living by any of those things that they want to find. And you can't expect to find things that you're not embodying yourself, right? Like the best dating advice I've ever heard is make that long list, then go out and embody those things yourself and you will attract that into your life. Mario Kintana wrote, \"Don't waste time chasing butterflies. Mend your garden and the butterflies will come.\" So how do you do this practically? Is it basically identifying the key people in your life, you know, family,\n\n\nFriends, and almost coming up with a connection plan for each of them? So, like, hey, I'm gonna call my mom, you know, every week at this time, and I'm gonna put that in my calendar. I'm gonna make that happen. Is it things like this you create kind of a connection plan for each relationship in your life and make it very deliberate?\n\nI think it depends on your natural personality type. Um, there's a lot of cynicism around making and systematizing relationships. Like anyone that talks about having a personal CRM and things like that, it gets turned into do that. Wow. Yeah, they're a personal CRM company. So, you get like all these companies have tried to raise money on that thesis in the past. Um, it depends on, like, you know, kind of how you operate. If you need things to be on your calendar, your schedule in order to do them, then by all means, go do that. Um, I personally just like to operate on a few default rules. Like one of my default rules is, uh, when I think something nice about someone, I let them know right then. So, if you go through your day, think about how many times you have, like, a random thought about someone in your life. Um, something that you thought they did well or nice, or like, \"Oh, I haven't thought about that person in a while.\" If you just send that person a text, just saying, \"Hey, was just thinking about you. Hope you're doing well.\" Not like, doesn't have to be a prompt to catch up. Doesn't have to be like, \"Hey, would love to get drinks sometime.\" It can just be as simple as just letting someone know you were thinking about them or like tell them the nice thing that you thought about them. It goes a long way to just creating these little touch points with relationships. Uh, the iPhone has this, like, photo memories feature. I love just like scrolling through that on a ride to the airport and sending some of those photo memories to the people that are in the pictures. Again, just like a super easy touch point that creates a level of connection with people on an ongoing basis. So that rather than having these relationships that feel like they're atrophying over long periods of time, you have these relationships where you've created these simple, innocuous, very low time requirement touch points that makes them feel fresh and present.\n\nWhat's more important? Is it quantity of kind of, you know, connection points or is it quality?\n\nQuality, quality. Quality. Yeah. Um, I mean, you could have a hundred loose connections and it's less meaningful than one truly deep one. Um, but again, uh, you know, for the individual who needs more in order to feel really wealthy in this regard, um, it's important that you kind of just like find what your baseline needs are in life. There's a lot of people who can feel very lonely surrounded by 20 loose connections at a bar, um, but they don't have that one person that they could call at 3 in the morning when they're down and out. Um, so understanding who those people are, who your roots, you know, your front row people really are in life, um, is critical.\n\nWhat's the big impediment here? Like, why don't, why don't people do this by default? If I were to kind of guess, at least for my own life, is you, you tend to sort of just let, you were talking about this earlier, but you tend to let relationships go on the back burner. And because you're so time poor and you're allocating your time in other ways, you just don't carve out the time to kind of like, I don't know, tend to the relationship garden, you know, pour water on it, make sure it gets sun, like it takes time to invest in these things. And I think people just take them for granted and maybe, uh, let them atrophy. Is that the, is that the main impediment?\n\nI guess it's different, uh, for every single person, but for me, that's kind of the thing. Life gets busy, and then suddenly your relationships go in the background, and you're not tending to them in the way that you should. I think there's a couple things. I think for existing relationships, that is very often the case. Um, you know, we get busy, we lose sight of it, we don't, you know, place it in the same regard as these other areas of life, and so we don't invest in it. We don't do the tiny actions. We also just constantly think that, um, something has to be perfect for it to be beneficial. So, you know, if we don't have 30 minutes to call our mom, we just don't even text them. We allow optimal to get in the way of beneficial when the truth is that the tiny thing is better than nothing. Um, you know, like I once called my dad for, like, 2 seconds. I was on the way into something, and I had just had this thought. So, I called him and just said this two-second thing. And, like, a few weeks later, my mom mentioned to me how my dad had talked about that two-second conversation all night at dinner one night because he was like excited about the thing that I had told him. And it led to this, like, entire dinner conversation that my mom and dad had about this two-second interaction. So, this tiny thing that I otherwise wouldn't have done had been so meaningful to him in some way. And it was a reminder of that exact fact that, like, the tiny thing that you don't think about can really mean a whole heck of a lot to someone else. But we very easily allow those moments to pass by. We allow that inspiration to just disappear.\n\nLet's talk about mental wealth, which is, uh, another category of wealth. Okay. So, what are the, what are the pillars of mental wealth?\n\nI think of the three pillars of mental wealth as being about purpose, growth, and space. Purpose is really this idea of the hero's journey. It's like the idea that, uh, you know, you sort of leave the confines and safety of home, go off on this journey, experience these, you know, struggles, trials, and tribulations, and then come back better for the experience. It's a tale as old as time, right? We all go on our own version of that hero's journey in life. And the degree to which we embrace it being our own and not consenting by default into someone else's, um, is the degree to which we truly experience that feeling of purpose. Uh, purpose scientifically is, uh, one of the keys to living a good, healthy life. Um, a whole lot of science now has developed that shows that people who have a clear sense of purpose live longer. It reduces all-cause mortality. Um, so that's the first one. Growth is about what we talked about earlier, the feeling of being dynamic, of changing, of the ability to learn and grow over periods of time, being curious, engaging in that growth mindset so that you can change and develop. It, it is very much like the fountain of youth in a real sense. You know, when you, when you stop learning, you start dying. I think it was Einstein maybe that said that. Very, very true. And then the third pillar is space, which we talked about earlier. This ability to create these moments and pockets of space both on a micro and macro basis to zoom out and create more perspective in your life to wrestle with some of these bigger picture unanswerable questions.\n\nOne of the things I was feeling earlier in the year when I went on the, uh, sabbatical was, um, a sense of, like, lost purpose, like just like waking up being like, okay, wait, remind me why am I doing this again? Why am I in this grind? And one of the tools that I found helpful in your book about you kind of like finding your purpose, finding your true north was this concept of a life razor, which is like, you know, I think of it as a couple sentences, no longer than a paragraph description of, like, what you're about your life. Maybe, maybe you could put words to this. What is the life razor?\n\nI really think of it as this kind of single identity defining statement for how your ideal self shows up in the world during this season of life. Um, so to kind of give you an example, I mean, like my life raiser is that I will coach my son's sports teams. Uh, he's 3 years old, so he's not actually on any sports teams yet. Um, this is all about how my ideal self shows up in the world. That I am the type of person who coaches his son's sports teams, that I prioritize my family, my community, these relationships above chasing every new shiny object out there. That I'm the type of person that my hus or that my wife and, you know, I'm the type of husband and father that my wife and son would want to have around. Um, uh, and community member in that way. Um, so that is like this idea of understanding how your ideal self operates, um, can allow you to cut through the noise much more effectively. Like when you are facing different challenges or opportunities, you can ask yourself, like, what does the type of person who coaches his son's sports teams do in this situation? Uh, and you can put yourself into that mindset, into that frame of mind to then go and answer that question more effectively.\n\nYeah, I realized for me it was like, um, when I went through this exercise, creating my life razor had nothing to do with my work or my job, right? It's like my, my Twitter bio, like, professionally, it's like crypto investor, you on the bankless journey, something like this. I found that that was not anything to do with my life razor. Like mine, uh, you know, turned out to be, I show up with love for the people who matter most. And this was an emphasis on, I'm the type of person who's there for my family, prioritizing relationships, like trying to be better each day, failing, but then getting up and trying again, staying, staying grateful and grounded, and choosing connection over distraction. And maybe that's just because that's kind of the area that I felt was kind of missing in my life, uh, or at least the area that I had underallocated to. Uh, but that's what it turned out to be. I guess for some people it could be their profession, depending on the season of life that they're in. Others, it could be something else. I mean, for you, it was being coach for your son's, uh, baseball game games, and like that, that, that was your identity and and your life raiser. But it was a fantastic exercise to see through, like, the purpose, like, why, why you're waking up, like, why you're actually doing the things that you do and and viewing it through that lens.\n\nYeah, I think that's exactly right.\n\nOkay. Um, is there anything else in, like, the mental wealth category, right? Um, having kind of a calm mind that, uh, that comes to mind here? Um, I mean, we could talk about zone of genius mapping, which, uh, I found to be a useful exercise myself. Um, what comes up in your mind? What's the most useful tool?\n\nI, I really think that if we're, if we're just going to talk about, like, a very simple tactic that anyone can take today, um, I think this idea of, like, the 1-1-1 journaling method is, it's probably the thing that anyone can go take and go do now to experience a benefit in their mental wealth. Um, this is the idea of just before bed, before you get into bed, take a piece of paper and write down one win from the day, something that you felt good about, one point of stress, tension, or anxiety, something that you want to get off your head and onto the paper, and one point of gratitude, something that you felt grateful for during the day. It takes 2 to 3 minutes to do that in the evening before going into bed. And you will feel an immediate sense of calm, reduction in anxiety. You'll feel better. You'll fall asleep quicker. It has helped me enormously, and it is such a high ROI activity given how low the time investment is.\n\nThat's great. All right, let's, uh, finish with the last category here. So, we're at number five here, which is physical wealth. So, and I guess this is, you know, that Naval quote, a calm mind, a fit body, a house full of love. You know, these are the things that that can't be bought, they must be earned. I think Naval says that. I guess we've talked about, um, the, uh, the calm mind and the house full of love, and now we're on the fit body part of things, but it's not just like fitness. It's also about sleep. It's also about nutrition. What are the pillars of physical wealth you like that that you measure?\n\nMovement, nutrition, and recovery are the three pillars that you talk about here. Sleep is a piece of recovery, obviously. Um, I think the important point here is that, uh, all of the sort of content and social media fodder related to physical wealth, um, is a little bit overblown and and slightly dangerous in a certain way in that it convinces you that what it looks like to be healthy or vital is this, like, complex, very expensive series of routines and protocols that you need to follow. And the truth is that this is really more like a video game, and if those are all, like, level 100, you don't need to worry about that. You need to start at level one, and then from there, you can kind of slowly work your way up. But the truth is that level one is basically freely accessible to anyone, and it'll get you ahead of 90% of people out there. Level one is what I would think of movement. Just move your body for 30 minutes a day. Doesn't matter whether it's walking, biking, hiking, jogging, dancing, whatever you like doing. Move your body for 30 minutes a day. Nutrition, just eat whole unprocessed foods at about 80% of your meals. That's 17 out of 21 meals during the week. And then recovery, just try to sleep 7 hours a night. If you can do those three things on a consistent basis, you're ahead of 80, 90% of people out there. From there, you can start thinking about doing more complicated, fancy things, starting to add resistance and different types of cardio and, uh, you know, any of the recovery therapies or fancier diets and nutrition. But the truth is that that baseline level is where it starts, and anyone can go out and do that.\n\nThe biggest blocker for me was always back to, like, I'm too busy to do this. Other things get in the way. Um, I mean, do you find that that's the case for a lot of people who don't prioritize their physical wealth?\n\nI think that that is grounded in the mentality of, um, it needs to be optimal for it to be beneficial. Um, you know, we say things like, \"Well, I don't have an hour to work out, so I'm just not going to work out today.\" Uh, and the truth is that a 15-minute walk is better than nothing. Anything above zero compounds positively in this domain and in all of them. So, the tiny action done well is better than doing nothing. Uh, so, you never have a real excuse that you truly don't have time. Five-minute walk around the block, a few push-ups in between phone calls, all of those things stack and compound positively.\n\n\nAnd they contribute to, uh, you know, the positive change that you were trying to experience in this domain.\nSo, time, social, mental, physical, financial, we've gone through them all.\nIs it really possible to do all five of these at the same time?\nI know we talked about the idea of dimmer switches and different kind of, um, seasons of life where you might, you know, spin the dimmer switch up on one and down on another, but is it possible to do all five well throughout the course of your life?\nI think you can do all five well.\nI don't think you can optimize all five at the same time.\nYour life is going to have seasons when you have different dials turned up and different dials turned down.\nThat is the reality of life.\nYou're going to have seasons of unbalance that contribute to future seasons of balance.\nUm, and stressing yourself out over those seasons of unbalance doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\nWhat you need to do is just lean into them, recognize that they are a part of reality, that they're going to exist, and that's okay.\nUm, and you can and should have those seasons of unbalance as long as they are in service of a future season of balance that you are building towards.\nUm, that's really how I view that.\nSo, is it okay, say, you know, you're kind of, um, in your 30s establishing a family or something and you're, you're really focusing on, look, like I got to, I got to, I got to work, right?\nI got to, you know, set myself up for the future compounding returns.\nAnd so, that's going to, um, be one of the areas I'm dialed into.\nAlso, maybe you're having a family and so like you have small kids.\nThere's like any parent with small kids realizes that they just like there's no time.\nThey have no time to do anything else.\nAnd so you're maybe like time poor.\nYou invest in your relationship, but you're not, you let the physical side slip a little bit.\nIt's like you don't exercise as much as you'd like to.\nMaybe that hits a back burner.\nIs that okay in the Sahil Bloom, you know, The Five Types of Wealth framework?\nYes.\nAs long as it is by your design, right?\nLike that is a perfectly reasonable and normal arc that I think a lot of people face.\nIf that were me, here's what I would do.\nI would say, okay, I'm going to have the dial way turned up on financial wealth and my career.\nUm, and I'm going to have the dial turned up on time with my kids.\nThat's kind of the remainder of my time.\nI'm probably not going to have a whole lot of time wealth during this time in my life because I'm really focused on those two.\nUm, I'm probably not going to have a whole ton of time to spend with friends.\nI'm probably not going out for 6-hour golf rounds with the buddies on the weekends.\nThat is a sacrifice that I'm willing to make for this time that I have with my kids and for my career that I'm really trying to progress for this future.\nUh, mental wealth, it's kind of going to be neutral.\nYou know, I'm, I'm hopefully working on something that I kind of enjoy.\nIf not, maybe that's going to be turned down slightly, but hopefully I'm growing.\nI'm able to create little pockets of space.\nAnd then in my physical wealth, I'm just going to try to do the like 15 to 30 minutes thing each day.\nI'm going to like wake up a little bit earlier and go out for the 30-minute run or I'm going to do the 30-minute hit body weight workout in the basement or in the garage.\nAnd like, is that optimal?\nIs that the one and two-hour workout that I really want to do, uh, to feel perfect?\nNo.\nBut it's what's required during this season of my life.\nAnd as I come out of this season, as my kids are in school and I have a little bit more time and things are changing, maybe I can adjust that.\nI can turn that dial up a little bit, but it's not an excuse to have it turned all the way off.\nSo, say someone has gotten to this point in the episode and, uh, you know, they're convinced, they go out and they create a wealth plan.\nThey're much more intentional with where they're allocating all of their resources to these different areas of wealth.\nUm, how do they keep to the plan?\nSo what often happens in life is just like you have a great plan and was that Mike Tyson, uh, yeah, everybody's got a plan till they get punched in the mouth.\nLife punches you in the mouth, like something happens, just, it could be an illness, it could be a sickness, you, some, you get let go from your job, just life interferes and throws your plan into utter chaos.\nLike how do people stick to the wealth plan that they have once they draw up these intentions?\nYou just need to create monthly check-ins.\nUm, you know, course corrections are necessary no matter what.\nNo matter how well things are going, you're going to have course corrections that you need to make.\nUh, and you just need to create a cadence on which you can see that they need to be made so that you can start to make them.\nThat could be monthly or quarterly.\nUh, but make sure you are doing something that allows you to zoom out so that you can see a little bit of the bigger picture about what your trajectory is, about where you're heading, about how your course looks, so that you can make those sort of micro adjustments along the way.\nSahil, this has been so great.\nThank you so much for writing the book.\nI, I want to maybe end with kind of a personal question.\nSo, 3 years ago, we actually had you on the BANKLESS Podcast.\nWe're talking about something totally different.\nI think it was, um, about you like China's crypto ban or there was like a real estate bubble, something like that.\nIn, uh, the last 3 years you have had a tremendous amount of success, uh, you know, uh, including recently over the last year I've just seen you sort of blow up and it's well-deserved, I think, to a lot of people.\nIt looks like an overnight success, but I know you've been working on kind of these ideas and this platform for a very long time.\nAnd so I, I guess I'm, I'm curious, um, when you think about like your success, how do you feel at this moment in your life and how do you stay grounded?\nWell, I don't feel success stressful.\nUh, I, I will just say that I mean, I don't, um, my goal is impact.\nMy goal is to feel like the ideas that I'm sharing with the world are creating these positive ripples that people are taking them and running with them.\nThat there are stories like yours of people reading the idea at the right time and then going and making changes in their life.\nAnd I feel very good about that.\nI feel very, um, lucky that I was able to share a book that is so permanent that is going to hopefully help people for a long, long time and a long, long, uh, ways into the future.\nUm, but I don't feel like I've changed in any way.\nLike I still have, you know, feelings like there are things I could be doing better.\nLike I'm try, you know, trying to improve at things, games, you know, uh, things that I don't feel like I've created or that I've done.\nI, you know, I always sort of have this, it's the underlying, you know, grind set mentality that's stuck in me of like, man, I got to go faster.\nI got to do more of these things.\nAnd look, I think the overlay all this, which we could do a whole another episode on, is all the stuff happening with AI and the changes that are coming, which to me create a sense of urgency, um, and a desire to just do more and share more, uh, because the future feels so uncertain.\nMaybe we'll end with that and that's kind of a to be continued.\nUm, actually, uh, I think you clued me into a blog post called, uh, it was like high agency, uh, your post that was written earlier this year.\nI think it had an impact on you and, um, it's basically the idea that high agency people are the ones that are going to, um, like do very well in this world and I think that, uh, is particularly true in the world of AI, right?\nWhere just like high agency people are going to have much more leverage over AI.\nLike in this world of AI, how do you think the, I guess, The Five Types of Wealth and high agency kind of apply?\nOr is it, is it just, uh, is it different or is it all the same principles just in kind of with new technology?\nI think it's going to be even more important to identify the things that you really care about and the life that you want to build.\nUm, because I no longer think it's going to be a really viable option to just, uh, coast through life and just accept things, um, as they are.\nI think the world is going to change so quickly that if you don't define the things that you want, uh, you're going to be handed a life that you don't really like.\nWell, let's end it there.\nUh, a lot of homework in today's episode for you guys, including living, you know, a life that you really contemplate, something that's intentional.\nSahil Bloom, thank you so much for joining us today.\nThank you for having me.\nGuys, got to let you know crypto is risky.\nWe didn't even talk about it today, but, uh, you could lose what you put in.\nWe are headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the BANKLESS journey.\nThanks a lot.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
