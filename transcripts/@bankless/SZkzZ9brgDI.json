  "cleanText": "I remember having a private meeting with Michael Saylor last year, a year and a half ago, who probably won't be too happy about me admitting this and what was the content of the conversation.\nWe were in the boardroom together, and he was telling me how Bitcoin Mining was a business and that I should really think about just being a Bitcoin treasury business.\nAnd I said, \"Well, that's interesting.\nI kind of agree with you halfway, but I'm thinking about doing that, but for Ethereum.\"\nHe gave me the dirtiest look.\nThe conversation kind of died.\nIt was a pretty bad vibe in that room.\nBankless Nation, we are here with Sam Tabar.\nHe is the CEO of BitDigital.\nBitDigital is one of the ETH treasury companies that has recently come online and is already one of the largest ETH treasury companies among publicly traded companies.\nSam, welcome to BANKLESS.\nThanks for having me.\nSam, why ETH?\nLook, I don't think there is any second best when it comes to rewriting the financial system.\nBitcoin doesn't have the ability of smart contracts to change value to exchange value without a middleman, and there's a lot of reasons why Ethereum didn't really have its time and its sort of like sun in the day because there was a lot of um the era of Gary Gensler was a really dark time for Ethereum.\nThere are many developers, friends of mine, who didn't, you know, they were wondering if they were going to go to jail the next day if they were working on a project that Gary Gensler would pursue them on.\nThat era is now done.\nAnd you're seeing a lot of congressional acts such as the Genius Act that did a lot of clarified a lot of rules about stable coins being used as payment instruments.\nAnd as we all know, more than half of stable coins are built on Ethereum.\nAnd we're seeing also upcoming acts like the Clarity Act that's being passed hopefully by Congress.\nAnd you're just seeing a lot of this regulatory clarity right now in Ethereum.\nAnd you know, it's ETH that powers the most widely used blockchain in the world.\nIts utility is irrefutable.\nAnd frankly, I really do believe, I think it was Ryan that mentioned that posted a tweet that really resonated with me.\nI think it was your tweet, Ryan, where you said that if Ethereum and Bitcoin were launched on the same day, we probably would never have heard of Bitcoin right now.\nAnd I completely believe that.\nThat's a that that was a real excellent post if that was yours.\nSo, you know, Ethereum, you know, there was a lot of FUD around it, and, you know, Gary Gensler couldn't even admit whether it was a commodity or a security.\nAnd now, you know, we're seeing that Ethereum is now being classified as a commodity just as Bitcoin.\nAnd you know, Michael Saylor did a really good job marketing Bitcoin, and he brought it really far, and it was a very easy story to tell.\nAnd you know, some people would be ashamed to admit it, but I'm not.\nI am shamelessly, and some of us in the industry are shamelessly copying Michael Saylor's playbook.\nIt does work.\nThere is a reason why that works.\nI remember having a private meeting with Michael Saylor last year, a year and a half ago, who probably won't be too happy about me admitting this and what was the content of the conversation.\nWe were in the boardroom together, and he was telling me how Bitcoin Mining was a business and that I should really go into I should really think about just being a Bitcoin treasury business.\nAnd I said, \"Well, that's interesting.\nI kind of agree with you halfway, but I'm thinking about doing that but for Ethereum.\"\nHe gave me the dirtiest look.\nThe conversation kind of died.\nIt was a pretty bad vibe in that room.\nHe said as I was walking away because the vibes just died.\nHe said, you know, don't do that because that thing is going to zero.\nSo I was like, if you say so.\nIt It's sort of funny, Sam.\nActually, just on that really quickly, like why do you think Michael Saylor has never purchased Ether, the asset?\nIs that just part of the persona?\nDo you have to do that?\nIf you're Michael Saylor and you're pursuing this strategy, you have to be the biggest baddest Bitcoin maxi in town.\nListen, to be successful in anything, in anything, whether it's working out or business or podcast, you have to be extreme.\nThat's the formula.\nThe formula to success is you have to just be kind of extreme.\nYou have to like you have to be as as biggest and baddest and outspoken as as possible.\nGrandian.\nYeah.\nAnd so I get that.\nThat's what he's doing.\nHe's he's just being a maxi maxi, you know, that's that's that's his that's the marketing campaign that he's doing.\nHe can't be measured.\nIf he's measured and if he's, you know, talking about, you know, the grays, the light grays and the dark grays, he's going to just the marketing message will get lost.\nHe's not talking to an academic audience.\nHe's talking to a retail audience.\nAnd the retail audience is, you have to remember this retail audience, they've been holding fiat as a way to basically build up their savings, let alone I'm not talking about stocks, I'm just talking about fiat for now.\nAnd if you look at fiat, that's the basically the ultimate shitcoin.\nIt's lost basically 97% of its purchasing power since the 70s.\nAnd that that is that's a real problem.\nAnd so Bitcoin did solve that issue to a large extent.\nIt has a limited supply and so on, but it doesn't have utility.\nAnd Bitcoin's real competitor is the gold markets.\nThe gold markets is $13 trillion market cap right now.\nAnd what is Bitcoin right now?\nI think two or three trillion in market cap.\nAnd so I do agree with Michael's thesis that that Bitcoin is an incredible store value that if you hold your savings in fiat, it's not going to end well for you.\nThere is a 100% track record of fiat going down, not up over time.\nAnd so Bitcoin does does truly solve for that.\nBut its main competitor is truly the gold markets.\nAnd I tell you what, the gold markets are going to be replaced by Bitcoin, especially when guys like you and me and you know millennials and Gen Z when they become in positions of power to create portfolio construction for family offices and institutions, they would have normalized crypto and they would have normalized Bitcoin and they would very likely use basically around 5% of the overall portfolio for that particular family office for Bitcoin to hedge inflation bets and not gold, which is what boomers do.\nSo, generationally, Bitcoin will go up and it will replace the gold markets.\nAnd so, that is that's a sure bet.\nBut when it comes to rewriting the financial system, that's Ethereum.\nThat's not Bitcoin.\nAnd it has the it has the ability to to, as mentioned earlier, to exchange value without an intermediary.\nAnd the financial system makes a lot of money creating friction.\nThat is how they make money.\nThe friction being you have you need a contracts lawyer, you need a banker, you need an escro agent.\nEthereum gets rid of all of that when you're transferring value.\nSo that's what I mean by rewriting the financial system.\nImagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language.\nThat's Mantle Banking, an all-in-one fiat and crypto account.\nIt lets you save, spend, and invest all from one dashboard.\nSwipe for coffee, stake me through yield, or even use virtual cards for payments through Apple Pay.\nSo, it feels web 2 simple yet stays web 3 sovereign.\nFor allocators, meet Mantle Index 4, the S&P 500 of crypto.\nA tokenized institutional-grade fund seated with $400 million from the Mantle Treasury and balance across Bitcoin, Ether, Soul, and Yieldenhanced Stables.\nOne asset, broad exposure, pure DeFi, composability.\nThe momentum is real.\nME faults, FBTC bridges, and a $2.4 4 billion dollar community treasury are all powering the next phase of onchain finance.\nMantle brings real world access,

um I mean we like big numbers.\nWe like benchmarks here.\nI mean, how what's the total addressable market for this thing?\nAnd how do you view ETH, the asset itself?\nLook, I think I think it's I think it's 10 times bigger than at least to 10 times bigger than the gold markets.\nIt's the entire financial system.\nThe entire financial system is kind of hard to put a number on, but it's certainly bigger than the gold markets.\nAnd so, it's really almost infinite.\nAnd and it's just now that Ethereum is coming out of the dark ages and that's why you're seeing a lot of these ETH treasury trades because there's a formal classification of Ethereum becoming a commodity and so on and so you're going to finally see Ethereum's valuation go up but to answer your question Ryan it's very difficult to know what the total value is of the entire financial system but a lot of bank functions a lot of contract lawyers a lot of escro agents a lot of friction that's not necessary that can be completely removed using solidity, using smart contracts, using atomic swaps in Ethereum.\nThat's all going to happen.\nThat's my thesis.\nOkay.\nSo, let's you you mentioned the key here is uh you got to be to do anything big to do be successful, you got to be a little bit extreme.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, let's uh let's measure how extreme you are and how extreme Bit Digital is right now, which is um I can I can measure this quantify this by the amount of ETH you own.\nSo, how much does Bit Digital own right now?\nAnd where does that place you in the ranking of ETH treasury companies?\nWell, I know there are a lot of ETH treasury companies coming out, but um I think we're um I think we're behind uh Joe's ESP.\nI just had a chat with him a week and a half ago.\nUm, you know, right now, uh, they're ranked ahead of us, but this race just started.\nUh, and, uh, there's going to be some friendly competition.\nWe're just over 100,000 now.\nThat was our first salvo.\nAnd, uh, we're currently cooking on the next trunch.\nAnd so, it's going to be a race.\nUm, and, um, I, uh, you know, I'm pretty I'm a very competitive person.\nAnd, uh, this actually started, frankly, years ago.\nWe actually started putting Ethereum in our balance sheet.\nAnd we have a real business, by the way.\nWe didn't just grab a a shell and do this play.\nWe have we had a Bitcoin mining business.\nWe even have um a data center business.\nOne of our subsidiaries is a is a is a uh an AI infrastructure company that's doing extremely well with over hund00 million of contracted revenues per year and growing exponentially.\nSo, we actually have a real business.\nWe have a profitable Bitcoin mining business that I declared that we're no longer going to invest in.\nThe infrastructure business is that for AI is different, but we actually have real businesses in our company that we didn't just grab the shell.\nSo that's a huge difference between us and the others.\nNo one else has that.\nNobody else.\nThey are just grabbing they're just grabbing shell companies and pumping that up.\nWe actually have a real truly real business with locked up revenues that last for years.\nThese contracts that we have are years.\nSo kind of different.\nBut with respect to um you know uh building our ETH treasury play, we know exactly how that works.\nAnd I'm reminded by like the basically like the in the in in the oil industry with oil companies, they traded above their NAV.\nIn other words, their NAB was proven oil reserves and the markets traded them above their proven oil reserves.\nWhy?\nBecause the markets knew or predicted that these oil companies would find new reserves.\nAnd that's the whole point of these ETH treasuries.\nThe reason why these ETH treasury plays are trading above their NAV is because they expect the CEO of the company to buy more Ethereum.\nOtherwise, it doesn't make any sense for that premium between what we have and where we're going.\nSo, we have to be very aggressive about it in order to make sure that premium continues.\nAnd that's why Mosella worked because people knew because if you look at his NAV and the underlying Bitcoin, it's totally out of whack.\nBut he's very aggressive in buying Bitcoin and that's what people are buying.\nThey're buying the momentum.\nThey're buying him the his future purchases of Bitcoin.\nSo for the thesis to work, you have to buy a lot future, you know, Ethereum.\nSo that's what we're doing.\nAnd um and it's a friendly race.\nAnd the reason why it's a race is because of Mind Share.\nThe more we can plant flags in this space early on, the the sooner that Bit Digital is on the map in terms of a capital markets proxy for Ethereum, the better.\nSo it's it's two it's twofold.\nIt's it's mind share and it's your your rates of aggression in buying Ethereum.\nSo with all of the ether treasury companies out there, Sharkling Gaming, they're coming in at the number one spot with about 205,000 ETH.\nAnd then we have Bit Digital, your company at 100,000 ETH.\nAnd then third place very far in in the third with just 15,000 uh ETH.\nThat's the BTCS Inc.\nSo like you talked about this is you guys\n\n\nAre frenemies, you know, friendly competition. You're very competitive. I'm assuming what that means is that you want to see your company to be the number one spot, the number one ETH holder, treasury company.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you see other ETH companies like coming online or raising more money or, you know, otherwise doing well, are you like, how do you think about these things? Is that like, oh, there, there's more energy happening outside of my company, or are you thinking it in the in like, oh, there's more momentum going into ETH in the first place, which is going to make my job easier? So how does just the sheer number of ETH treasury companies online making your job harder, or is it making your job easier?\n\nIt's a weird, I, I love the question. So there's this weird tension with there's more Ethereum, there's more of these plays, so they're going to buy Ethereum, so the price of Ethereum is going to go up. So that's nice. That's good. And then so from a, from a financial perspective, it comforts me. But from a mind share perspective, it doesn't, right? Because you can, you could only have so many of these ETH trades. You see it right now with respect to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin capital markets proxy of like these, these trades is saturated. So you can't have like a, you can't have like more than 20 ETH treasury trades because then the, uh, the mind share, uh, pie just doesn't work. So that's why it's very important to be aggressive just to get that mind share. But, you know, at the same time, all this friendly competition is good for the Ethereum ecosystem and the price and the awareness, and, you know, again, it's friendly competition. I, I've known Joe for a long time. And I co-founded a company called Fluidity was an Ethereum company, and the team built AirSwap. And, um, and, uh, and then in 2020, um, we sold the company to Joe Lubin. Um, so the relationship goes back many years, and, um, and so, you know, it, the, the story, the journey in Ethereum continues.\n\nYeah, it's, it's really a matter of like, I think when people are evaluating these ETH treasury companies, are kind of like sizing everybody up, like, you know, it's like, what are the different, uh, skills on the, uh, you know, the, the Avengers that have assembled here, the ETH Treasury Avengers here. And we, we've already mentioned, uh, Joe Lubin and and Sharlink Gaming. David mentioned, uh, another firm, BTCS. They've got, I think, and they, they announced this week another 225 million raised that has not yet converted into a buy, but they're trying to get more funds in order to buy ETH. So, those are some competitors. And also, a couple weeks ago, Tom Lee from Wall Street entered the fray here. And, uh, I've been, uh, watching Tom Lee on Wall Street for like, I don't know, the past like 10 years talking about crypto. He's got Bitmine immersion technologies and 250 million buy. It's really a race to the first treasury firm to a billion dollars worth of e, uh, of ETH. I've also also saw this week, um, game. This is another company that wasn't even on my radar. A hundred million that they're trying to buy in. Great ticker.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's a great ticker. They also had, um, you know, the, uh, the, the game streamer, uh, Ninja, he's somehow like involved as a chief innovation officer. So I don't know how all that works. There's a lot of competition here. But also, I've heard, um, you know, people like Tom, for, for instance, mention that, hey, there might be some consolidation here at some point. So, like, are you going to buy Tom Lee, or is he going to buy you? Sam, what do you think, man?\n\nI, I, I saw that quote, and I mean, if he's for sale, I'm happy to consider it.\n\nThere you go. I love that energy. Um, you know, just FYI, just in terms of these ETH Treasury trades being launched, I think I saw this funny meme. I think it was even on yours, Ryan, but it was a meme where like, you got to start at 100,000, or you basically, you're just mini me. Like, you have to, you have to start at 100,000 ETH in order to like make a statement, and then anything below that, you're going to be in the longtail.\n\nYeah, I won't take credit for that meme, but I, I believe I saw that too. It was Joe Lubin's baldness, and then it was literally mini me from the Austin Powers. He's baldness, and that's what you look like if you're 100 under 100,000, uh, E. That's the entry price here.\n\nIt is the entry price. I agree. I think that's the number, and let's see who gets to a billion first.\n\nOkay, Sam. So, we're talking about the sheer number of treasury companies that are coming online, not just in Ethereum, but just broadly across the space. It has just become a huge theme inside of just the, the traditional stock market. You talked about earlier how, uh, Michael Saylor just built this thing, and it's a real thing. You emphasize it being a real thing. A lot of people's, um, instincts in CRYPTO, if they've seen a cycle or two, their instincts are like kind of perking up and like, \"Oh, I know this pattern. There's this pattern. It's kind of, you know, filling up with hot air. There's copycats. They're also filling up with hot air, and eventually this whole thing pops.\" Uh, and so like people are all kind of like gearing up for, you know, maybe it's bullish for six months. Maybe we could get six months of bullish price action, but then it pops. Uh, and then other people I've heard say, well, actually, no, like structurally the thing is designed to not pop. Structurally, it's sound. Maybe you could like walk us through your thinking on that debate.\n\nYeah. Well, I think that the longtail, I think some players in the long tail will pop. I think that'll collapse if you're in the long tail. But if you're in the top three, I think it won't. It, it, people have like cognitive overload issues if there are just too many of these ETH treasury plays, and of course, you can calculate the NAV, uh, and you can make these like apples to apples comparison. Ours is a little bit more complicated because we have an actual real business, um, in our in our structure that's making a lot of money. So it's, it's a little bit difficult to do apples and apples since all the other guys are shell shell companies. I think, uh, but mathematically, David, like to that to the metaphor of the these oil companies, and the reason why they were trading their NAV was trading above the valuation of their proven oil reserves is because the markets expected them to find more oil reserves. And so, so long as the market has a perception that you're going to continue buying more ETH, mathematically, you're going to have, you're going to be trading above your, your the valuation, the assets under your NAV. So I think that's how it works. But there are mind share issues. There's cognitive overload issues, and that is something where I think the top three can enjoy. But I think after that, the long tale of of of people who are doing it, it may not work out.\n\nWhat do you think of the risks here, uh, Sam? Because we're trying to get a a hold of that too. So there's premium DAV, of course, and, uh, that can be generated, has been generated. And I think there's definitely the case for for that being generated. But the nightmare scenario, and we've seen some things previously, not in the Treasury form, but in previous cycles, we've seen GBDC trust, for instance, uh, trade at a deficit to NAV for a long period of time. And that was, that was weird. That was scary. That destabilized a lot of things in CRYPTO. What's the risk there for, I guess, your company and ETH treasury companies in general?\n\nYeah, I, I never understood that mathematically. There were, there was another company I had ETH. Uh, and it was in Canada, and it had a great name, and it, it had the word ETH in it. Um, like Ether Capital, I think.\n\nYeah, it was Ether Capital. That's right. And it always, I, I, you know, as I was building my ETH on our balance sheet, we had tens of millions on our balance sheet. And I remember looking at Ether Capital and just scratching my head wondering why they were trading above below NAV. I, I was confused. So that, I'll be honest with you, gave me pause. And then when Joe Lubin, uh, did ESB, I, I was like, \"All right, I should have been first at this.\" And my doubts, uh, my doubts, including the examples that you came up, you, you brought up, kind of went away. And so I, I, I, you know, worked very hard and very to get this to market very quickly. And so now we're off to the races. But, um, yeah, it was, it was weird that that some of those other companies, um, it didn't really work out the way it should. And I think it, it's related to Mind Share, and, um, people paying attention, and now people are paying a lot of attention, and they're realizing that there's a combination. There's like a, a virtuous perfect storm. There's regulatory clarity, right? That helps Ethereum. Uh, the investigations against all these projects on Ethereum are not like they used to be under Gensler. Uh, so that's very good for Ethereum. Um, you have, you have, uh, Bitcoin just had a huge run, and there are so many people in the space who feel like they've kind of lost, uh, they kind of missed their, uh, their chance with Bitcoin, but Ethereum is not at all-time highs like Bitcoin. So now there, they feel perhaps there's like juice in Ethereum. And I truly believe there is. There's more developers now in Ethereum than there was when during all-time highs. So now with the regulatory clarity and all the development activity going on and all these stable coins that are now about to be built, and more than, more than half of stable coins are built on Ethereum, I think people are starting to understand that Ethereum is about to have its, its day.\n\nSam, the way that I think about these treasury companies is that there's really two core ingredients that goes into them to really make them work. Uh, the first is RZ, and then the second is alchemy. And RZ is just your ability to promote your ability to capture mind share, as you've been putting it, really, your, your ability to to really preach about the nature of the asset that the company is collecting. Uh, and so that's the first one. And then the second one is alchemy, which is, you know, Michael Saylor has just done a pretty remarkable job doing some financial engineering to really just squeeze the juice, squeeze the sponge out of the capital credit markets in TradFi. And he's, you know, so he's has the master equity, he has all of these coupon bonds, he has different tiers of stuff to just to max out every possible line of credit. Uh, talk to us about the alchemy side of things. What kind of like ingredients you have cooking over there?\n\nI mean, that the financial engineering that Michael Saylor uses, it's all public information. It's all, it's a public company. We, we see the financial instruments he's using. We're going to use exactly the same financial instruments. And, uh, so that, that is, you know, again, we're I'm plagiarizing that shamelessly. So that's the, that's the financial engineering part. Um, and with respect to the RZ, I mean, I'm, I can't, I'm not going to claim RZ, but I'm going to do my very best to explain to, uh, the markets and to our audience and to whoever is going to listen to me why Ethereum and why now and the utility of Ethereum and why that has the ability to rewrite the financial system, which is not something that could be done with Bitcoin. I'll do my very best.\n\nYeah, there's another piece of alchemy that, um, comes into play with Ether, the asset, that's really just not available to Bitcoin, and that is making use of Ether, the asset, uh, productively. So, of course, the kind of the risk-free quote unquote way to do this is you just stake your ETH, and you coming from kind of a company that did Bitcoin Mining, validating blocks for Bitcoin essentially in exchange for issuance and and rewards. Uh, you know that very well how that works in Bitcoin. So I guess my question is, what are you going to be doing with your ether in general to increase yields? You can of course stake. You can get into some more exotic DeFi types of, uh, things with the ether and generate returns that way. That has different level of risk and reward. But at the end of the day, I think a lot of the, um, the, uh, premium to NAV is going to be based on your ability to generate, uh, the highest amount of ETH per share in, of course, like a risk adjusted way. So tell us about that type of alchemy. What are you going to be doing with the ETH?\n\nYeah, that's a great question. So like, so most, most entities such as ETFs are just passively holding CRYPTO, holding ETH. We're taking a more active approach. We're staking all our ETH and operating validators, which generates yield. So that puts the capital to work and reflects a deeper operational commitment to Ethereum. It's interesting that ETH ETFs cannot stake. They don't have the legal ability to do that for now. So, that puts us at a, at a competitive advantage to ETFs because we're earning yield, and that compounds. Um, and in terms of yield and using more alpha maneuvers to juice up yields, you're right, we have to, we are looking at that already, and we have to be a little bit careful as well as balancing the risk reward tradeoff on that, and but we are planning on being a little bit more, um, aggressive on the risk curve to make sure that our yields are above average. So that's what we're doing now. And I, I think that's true, Ryan. Like I would like to put out, ideally, in fact, I think I'm going to commit to it. I'll commit to it. Uh, that every month we're going to show our ETH holdings, and if there's a way to show our yield, I would like to show that too, because I would like to call out the other companies and see if they could show their yields, and we could, you know, perhaps, you know, the audience and the markets can compare us with our peers and see who is generating more yield for their ETH. And I think that would be that would be really good. And of course, you know, you got to disclose what risks you're taking. So, I think that'll be a good thing to do. And I think that should be done monthly.\n\nIn the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance, the protocol revolutionizing stable coins, DeFi, and Rolex. The core of FRA Finance is FRAUSD, which is backed by BlackRock's institutional bidded FRAUSD for best-in-class yields across DeFi, T bills, and carry trade returns all in one.

Use UniSwap's web app and wallet for a more efficient way to use DeFi.\n\nYeah, that's fantastic. So, I guess this is not only a wreath or sorry, a race wreath, a race to acquire the most amount of uh ETH between all these treasury companies, it's also a race for more yield on that ETH as well. And one of the things that I love about this is I think there are a lot of um traditional investors, Wall Street investors who just for whatever reason structure, like um, you know, concern, I think a lot of this is structure though, they just can't dabble in ETH yields and DeFi yields at all. There's no mechanism for allowing them to do that. As you pointed out, you can't get that in the ETH ETFs, and a lot of them just aren't structured to be able to use, you know, like non-custodial wallets and kind of like, how do they do this? Where do they park their assets? And so these ETH treasury companies can be a vehicle to unlock a whole lot of capital in addition to showing them what ETH can do inside of the Ethereum economy as a productive asset. It's part of this is about just like saying, \"Hey, Wall Street, look at our books. Look at our yield. Look what we're doing with our ETH, you can go do that, too.\" And so, I think that is a very bullish um statement and it's a differentiator when it comes to Bitcoin, which is much more of a, you know, it just stays there. It's not generating the yield. There's no staking mechanism. So, that's definitely a positive for this stuff. I wanted to ask another. Yeah, maybe reflect on that. And then I got another question for you.\n\nSure. I mean, look, we serve both institutional and retail investors. For institutions, I guess we offer a regulated liquid way to access ETH and staking rewards without them managing custody or infrastructure. And for retail, you know, it's an accessible way to participate in Ethereum's upside through the stock market. So, it solves both retail and institutional needs by offering both the youth exposure and the staking rewards. It's incredible how fast all these ETH treasuries have really developed. I mean, just like um a month ago, you know, like six weeks ago, there was literally nothing. There was nothing. Now we've got like at least five in a race to a billion. And actually, there's more that I've heard rumor of that are coming up. So, there are at least two more.\n\nYeah, this is all moving very, very, very fast. Uh, and Sam, another trend, uh, aside from ETH treasuries going public is the the trend of former Bitcoin mining companies actually converting to this ETH treasury strategy. And of course, you would be one of those. Um, but uh, it's Tom Le's company, Bitmine Immersion Technologies. I believe this used to be a Bitcoin mining company as well as I got to think the other ETH treasury company BTCS. I think the B probably stands for something like Bitcoin, and you with Bit Digital used to be a mining company now moving to ETH treasury and ETH staking. Do you think this is a trend that will continue and why is it? Was Michael, was part of Michael Saylor, right, that like, hey, Bitcoin mining is kind of a business, like it's really hard, and like maybe this is a better way to kind of maximize the capital and also the intellectual capital that you've already built up. Do you think this is a trend that will continue?\n\nYes. Bitcoin miners already know that Bitcoin mining is not a promising business. This is a business that guarantees that your profits are halved, are taken out 50% every four years. Imagine being in a business where your profits are guaranteed to be cut in half every four years and you have to buy the latest hardware, and so you have to dilute your shareholders and to raise the money to buy this hardware that lasts for like not very long. And so it's just this hamster wheel where uh you're trying to squeeze out whatever profits you can before the next having, and on top of that, the hash rate is going up. So, it makes it even more difficult to squeeze the profits. And then I tell you what, I guarantee it almost that if Bitcoin gets to 200 or 300,000, and it probably will eventually. And by the way, with Bitcoin going up, it doesn't mean that the Bitcoin miners make more money. That's not how it works because you have to look at that the hash rate and so on. But putting that aside, if Bitcoin gets to 300,000, then the sovereigns are going to come in. You're going to have companies, you're going to have countries that have basically free access to power unlike Bitcoin miners. And so they're going to really go for it, and they're going to start minting their own Bitcoin. And the Bitcoin mining companies are not going to be able to compete with that, and they're going to go out of business. That's why you're seeing a lot of Bitcoin miners doing either two things: leveraging their skill set to go into GPU, the GPU business, or basically transferring themselves from Bitcoin to Ethereum because that's a much more um valuable way to maximize shareholder value. And so, yeah, Michael Saylor was right in that meeting. We didn't agree on everything, but we did agree on his thesis that Bitcoin mining is a business.\n\nDo you think that becomes a pro? Like I, I mean, I think all of us in crypto, obviously, we want the best for Bitcoin. We want it to uh succeed.\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nDo you think that it, that could cause a problem over the long run? So what we're seeing is maybe the the flight of smaller uh Bitcoin mining companies and they have to kind of abandon the business, and so you get a lot of consolidation. I mean, we were talking to um Paulo from Tether not too long ago. He's got a 100 million uh, sorry, 100,000 Bitcoin on his balance sheet, and he's like launching the largest Bitcoin miner just to make sure that he can still produce blocks when the uh the subsidies, the inflation issuance subsidies for Bitcoin kind of go away that happening that you discussed over four years time.\n\nWell, if you kind of play that forward a little bit, doesn't, does it become the case that Bitcoin mining gets more and more consolidated, fewer and few players, there's no longer room, like it just seems to be the issuance policy of Bitcoin that that would be the case. And you see a time when um, you know, transaction fees on Bitcoin are at basically all-time lows because everyone is holding Bitcoin, they're not, they're not moving it onchain, or they're leveraging, they're getting access to it through uh, you know, like Michael Saylor and other ETFs. Is this a concern to you over time? I mean, I know we don't want to bismerch Bitcoin, but it just seems to be like a growing concern in the network itself, right?\n\nI mean, there's a reason why we exited the business. That's that's why we exited the business. It's just not a promising future in that business. And those who who continue to become, say, you know, become pure plays on Bitcoin and just being stubborn about it. I mean, I wish them luck, and and I and some of some of those guys are my friends. I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to like prematurely dance on their graves or anything, but it's just a very difficult business, and it's just not promising because it just becomes harder and harder to squeeze out a profit, and there's going to be a point where you need basically free access to energy. Your energy costs have to be basically zero for uh your Bitcoin mining to uh to work. And I don't think any Bitcoin miner has free access to power. Only countries do. And once Bitcoin gets to about 300,000 or so, countries will just get involved in Bitcoin mining. And then the hash rate, the hash difficulty will explode upwards. And then it's going to be very difficult for Bitcoin miners to be profitable. And then you have the having coming up, and then it's just game over.\n\nWell, countries mining Bitcoin actually doesn't really sound like there's a problem with the Bitcoin security budget in that scenario.\n\nYeah, I guess not.\n\nSo, Sam, all this brings up the question of um how big do you think this could grow? And I, I, I run the risk of somebody correcting me in the comments because I'm just like remembering some numbers uh on the fly, but I think the total amount of um Bitcoin in ETFs right now is something like 6% of total supply. It's closer to 3% for Ether, but that number is kind of ratcheting up. And uh, I don't know the total amount of Bitcoin in Bitcoin treasury companies, but god, how much does Saylor have? He's got to be close to, you know, 2 to 3% of all supply, something like that, and uh, we are less than half a percent of all Ether supply in uh, treasury companies right now, right? And of course, that is just like from, you know, gone up from zero uh, about 6 weeks ago. Question to you is, how big do you think ETH treasury could actually grow, maybe as a portion of supply, maybe in terms of um, you know, billions of dollars, however you measure this, is it going to be as big as Bitcoin?\n\nI think it will be, but I hope it's not fully concentrated on one party because there is, there is sometimes I wonder, like, when you Michael Saylor, it's just like all this is concentrated on one guy, and when you're that much of a percentage in the entire supply, it's not a good thing, actually, it's it's a bad thing, and I'm sure people who understand decentralization, decentralizations. Um, they agree with that. So, I, I, I hope it's basically, you know, my, my, I really hope that it's basically a top three horses, and it'll be as big as Bitcoin, but it's going to be shared amongst the three, just, and there's a friendly competition amongst the three. That's that's what I hope will end up happening. And I, I hope there isn't a an MSTR of Bitcoin, although I'm aiming to be that, but the others are too. And I, I just think if there's like one giant MSTR that and that dwarfs everybody else, then you have sort of a key man risk. And that's what I think is happening right now with Bitcoin. You have a giant keyman risk with Michael Saylor.\n\nSam, as we bring this conversation to a close, we've talked about um your ETH treasury company. We've of course mentioned all the other ETH Treasury companies that are out there. Uh, as we close, inform our listeners about what sets yours apart. Why is yours special?\n\nWell, ours is very different for a couple of reasons. First, we have an underlying business. We have a digital infrastructure business that's spitting out contractually over $100 million per year. So, that's a big deal. We have a profitable Bitcoin mining business that we're going to eventually sunset. So from a fundamentals perspective, we're very different from the others because we have underlying real businesses. And secondly, I think it's just basically, you know, I'll call it rate of aggression. Like we're going to be as very as active as possible in buying Ethereum. And uh, I think ESB has um set the standard, and I and I, I think that's great. That's the standard to beat. And I, you know, we're going to, we're going to do our best. We already have a road map. We're, we're going to be executing that road map in order to to be, to be placed at number one. And um, that's all I can say. There is another thing I'd like to say is that I, I didn't just wake up and think, oh wow, this is a very sexy thing to do. Let's do it. I've been in the Ethereum space for a very long time since 2017. When I, when I became CEO of Bitcoin, of of Bit Digital, I almost immediately said, \"Let's put some Ethereum in our balance sheet.\" And we had more Ethereum in our balance sheet than anybody except Coinbase before ESB came on. So, but we didn't market it. We didn't talk about it. We st that whole thing. So, we had the pipes, the infrastructure, we already had that going. And so, this is not something we just woke up and thought, \"Hey, this is trendy. Let's take what? Let's take advantage of it.\" This is something we've been building for a long time.\n\nWell, Sam, uh, we're so glad you stopped by. Best of luck on this mission. We want you to propagate this, uh, far and wide. Of course, I think David and I have talked about Ether and Ethereum for a very long time, but to crypto natives, this is crypto media. We want you to go forth and talk to CNBC, get on Bloomberg, talk to traditional finance as well, because I don't think the story of Ethereum and even more importantly, Ether, the asset, has propagated as far as it should. And I think uh, part of what you're doing with your ETH treasury is to make that happen. So, thank you for your work. I know you've got some important meetings coming up. We appreciate you stopping by.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Thanks, David.\n\nBank Nation, got to let you know none of this has been financial advice. Of course, crypto assets are risky. So, our ETH treasury companies, they can be at least. You could lose what you put in.\n\n\nBut we are headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.\nThanks a lot.\n\n[Music]\n",
