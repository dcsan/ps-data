  "cleanText": "Bankless Nation.\nI'm here with Sreeram Kannan and JT Rose from EigenLayer.\nUh, JT, your first time on Bankless.\nWelcome.\nThank you for having me.\nAnd then Sreeram, good to have you back.\nThank you so much, David.\nAlways a pleasure.\nBig day in the EigenLayer universe.\nEigenLayer is announcing EigenCloud.\nNow, there are a bunch of things that when you pop open the hood of EigenCloud, you'll see a bunch of different modules, and we're going to talk about EigenDA, EigenVerify, EigenCompute.\nI kind of want to just like speedrun through the history of EigenLayer as it stands so far because I think when people first hear the words EigenLayer, uh, we think of restaking.\nThat's the big primitive where you stake your ETH, you stake it again, and then there's this notion of shared security and AVSs, where AVSs are providing services using EigenLayer to uh, sell, package up, and sell trust to end users.\nAnd I think the average like crypto, crypto personnel in crypto Twitter or the average Bankless listener might actually kind of like lose, uh, lose the idea of what EigenLayer is around there.\nThere's this notion of intersubjectivity.\nThere's this notion of renting security.\nUh, Polkadot has tried to do this.\nCosmos has tried to do this.\nUh, there's something there, and and the precise nature of like what EigenLayer is and how it actually reaches mainstream is, I think, still a little bit cloudy.\nBut today, we are really EigenLayer is introducing EigenCloud, and I'm gonna kind of call this as like EigenLayer and EigenDA and AVS's.\nThese are all kind of like components in a car, right?\nYou got a transmission, you got an engine, you got a carburetor.\nUh, and that's what I think when people really like zoom in on EigenLayer and they see these different components, and they're like, what, what is it though?\nWhat is it doing?\nHow do these things work?\nEigenCloud, what you guys are introducing today, I'm going to call the whole entire car.\nIt is actually like kind of the packaged up modules, and you know, in crypto, especially the crypto natives, we kind of like to like open up our cars.\nWe don't really want things abstracted from us.\nWe actually like to see the bare metal.\nWe like to poke around.\nWe like to, you know, do contract calls from Etherscan.\nBut really, we know that like if we're going to take crypto mainstream, we actually need to package these things up.\nUh, and so I, the way I see EigenCloud, which we're going to get into today, is like the packaged, sellable vision of EigenLayer, and EigenLayer is just kind of this foundational layer of of this whole entire vision.\nIt's the thing on Ethereum.\nIt's the layer 1 smart contracts, but EigenCloud is like AWS, where it's a place where developers can go and like buy access blockchain properties.\nAnd so, EigenCloud is this end consumer product, the consumer being developers that actually allows some of the blockchain properties that we have, verifiability, uh, trust, really, uh, economic security, really, is being packaged up by this EigenLayer system and then made accessible in the same way that a developer would go to AWS and rent out some hardware, they can go to EigenCloud and access properties that blockchains tend to give things like economic security, like trust.\nThat is my like kind of high-level pitch for EigenCloud.\nNow, I am the a podcaster.\nI am directionally correct, but technically imprecise.\nSo, Sreeram, maybe you can kind of like fill in the gaps a little bit and like assist the listener with understanding what EigenCloud is.\nAmazing.\nThank you so much, David.\nReally excited to be here to talk through this.\nUm, as I mentioned, we're announcing this new package cloud where we want to make the whole greater than the sum of the parts, right?\nSo, the parts people have seen, and frankly, people are a little confused, right?\nSo, we're building on EigenLayer, which is this staking layer.\nI think if you go ask anybody about, to the extent people know it, they know it for staking, restaking.\nSo, that's what you know, the single word that you would hear, but we've also been doing other things, and people are like, what are these guys doing?\nThey did, they seem to be doing a lot of unrelated things.\nWe have EigenDA, right?\nLike a data availability engine built on top of EigenLayer, so that's already there.\nYou know, it's one of the, it secures the most DVL of all offchain DAs on Ethereum today.\nIt's the fastest, highest throughput DA.\nUh, so we have these two parts that people have seen.\nWe've talked a little bit about, oh, you know, you can use Eigen to power AI, and people have seen that.\nAnd so today, what we're unveiling is this whole, which is greater than the sum of the parts, which gives coherence to all these things in a single, clear message, as well as a packaged up product.\nSo, uh, David talked a little bit through our history, so I'll just spend a minute on like how we got here.\nUh, so we started with EigenLayer, like this whole restaking protocol, you know, we, we went and launched that, I think, June, July 2023, the staking contracts, you know, we got stake, and you know, today we have like $12 billion something of stake.\nOn the other side, we have operators, people who run the computations for these stakers.\nWe went from, uh, again, zero to now like 2,000 operators on mainnet, going from home operators to professional operators to things like co, you know, Google Cloud running a first-party operator.\nAnd then we have services built on top of EigenLayer, we call them AVSs.\nare, hey, I'm renting the economic security and running a certain specific, specialized service.\nThink of like data storage.\nI want to run a data storage service, right?\nSo, you need a group of nodes who store and make a promise that they're storing these things correctly.\nSo, that's a, that's an example of a data storage service that people\nSo, you have these specific primitives.\nMany people building AVSs, you know, is one of the hardest categories to create because, you know, for somebody to come and build a service on top of a platform like us, they're taking a massive amount of platform risk because their entire protocol there is dependent on like this EigenLayer set of interfaces.\nAnd so we have like, you know, 50 plus on mainnet and 100 plus in other stages of development showing up.\nSo, really excited to have created that category.\nSo, that's kind of history so far.\nAnd we separately also talked about the token in a white paper, right?\nSo, we had the Eigen token white paper, which we published, you know, around a year back, the famous intersubjective paper, the famous or infamous intersubjective paper, where we introduced this idea of like, hey, what is the kind of like foundational value prop of blockchain?\nHow do we abstract it into a token?\nAnd I think it was kind of like too abstract for, you know, most people to track, and you know, rightly so, it was not meant for the general public.\nIt was meant for technical people to understand like what sets of things you can unlock.\nBut I think what we're doing now, so that's history, right?\nAnd one of the things I'm very happy to say is we've pretty much delivered every single thing we have stated till like 18 months back.\nSo, if you think about like tracking the say do ratio, like what we said to what we did, right?\nEverything we've stated till say November, December 2023, we actually delivered.\nLike we have EigenDA working, you know, it's the slashing went, five redistribution, which is this new idea of like when when you're slashing in Ethereum, the stake is just burnt, right?\nOn EigenLayer, you can redistribute it to, you know, the harmed parties.\nSo, we introduced this in an academic paper called stake share with redistribution, that's going live.\nSo, essentially, like the whole sets of ideas that we had introduced till like 18 months back are all live and in production.\nSame thing with DA.\nWe claim this big thing that, okay, you can run a DA with insane throughput, you know, live on mainnet with 15 megabytes per second.\nWe did an experiment 6 months back where we dumped the data from every single blockchain.\nThis is Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, um, you know, Celestia, Base, everything, and then put it, wrote blocks into EigenDA, and still it couldn't saturate bandwidth.\nSo, that's how much bandwidth I had.\nYet we continue to scale it.\nWe, you know, that that's at 15 megabytes per second.\nRight now on testnet, uh, we're running at 50 megabytes per second, a 3 and a half x increase.\nAnd you know, internally, we're running at 100 megabytes per second.\nSo, we're just, we're just, uh, you know, moving the throughput barrier out of the question.\nSo, that's like a say ratio of the history, right?\nSo, what we said versus what we do, because we're saying new things now, and you know, obviously a question in people's mind is, oh, are these guys just saying things, right?\nNo, so we have a track record actually delivering these things.\nSo, that's the the context, and then now I can switch into EigenCloud.\nAny questions on the context, David, JT, you want to?\nNo, that, that all that all makes sense to me.\nYeah, in the wild west of DeFi, stability

just want to return to the metaphor of just like the car being built.\nAnd I think like EigenLayer, I'll call EigenLayer the actual thing on Ethereum, the restaking.\nI'll call that the engine because that's the thing that you know, powers trust.\nThat is the, that's the thing that takes cryptoeconomic security, you know, the stake on the Ethereum layer 1 and then turns it into like this raw material that other modules can hook into, and those are the AVS's.\nYou need data availability in order to actually have that be like interoperable and verifiable.\nUh, and so all these extra layers because you can't just have an engine, right?\nThe engine needs to connect to things, needs to have a transmission, it needs to have wheels.\nUh, but EigenLayer being the engine and then these additional modules to really fill out the form of the car.\nAnd I think what what I'm hearing you saying is like, okay, the other modules we've actually built and hooked together.\nAnd so now it's time to talk about the car.\nUh, the car being EigenCloud.\nThat's how how I'm going to carry that metaphor forward.\nThat's absolutely right.\nIn fact, it's funny, like, you know, if you look at some of our earliest, uh, papers on like, what is EigenLayer, like, you know, this is even before we knew about restaking, you know, the ideas you'd see are like a cloud, and like, hey, you know, here's a cloud, it connects to Ethereum, it connects to it, it then lets many people build applications on top.\nYou know, some of the early visuals are identical to like what we're trying to build.\nSo, this has always been in our mind that this is the orienting direction, the Northstar.\nBut it needed all these primitives and boxes to, you know, it needed, okay, how do you, how do you build an engine?\nHow do you build a drivetrain?\nHow do you build, you know, fast tires?\nHow do you build all these things, and then you can slam them all together to build this cloud.\nOkay, so what is this cloud and what is this in service of?\nSo, the high-level concept is we want cloud scale programmability.\nCloud scale programmability.\nAnything you can program on the cloud, you should be able to program on EigenCloud.\nOkay, so what's new with that?\nThat's like AWS or Google Cloud, like what is new about that?\nThat's those already exist, right?\nWhat is new is you want that, you want cloudscale programmability, but you want cryptograde verifiability.\nYou want to verify things just like, you know, is normal course of business in crypto.\nYou don't want to trust that Sreeram or like I Labs or somebody else is going to run their stuff correctly.\nYou want to make sure that these things are all running correctly.\nSo, that is the kind of goal, the Northstar, the promise is we want cloudscale programmability.\nAnything you can program on the cloud, you should be able to program on EigenCloud with cryptograde verifiability that if\n\n\nYou, if you do it on this, you don't need to trust anybody. It's verifiable, it's secure. It has a measure, measurable unit of economic security or other kinds of security attached to it. Economic security is our starting engine. That's like, you know, David said, that's our foundation on top of which we're building a lot of this stuff. But as we expand out this cloud, you can have different grades of security models and stuff that can be built on top. But the core promise is cloudscale programmability and cryptograde verifiability. So if you take this premise and then deconstruct it, you know, I was talking to David like a week back, and he asked like, \"Hey, aren't blockchains already Turing complete? Like, what is this new cloud, you know, programmability you're talking about? Aren't blockchains already like universal and Turing complete?\" If David, if you want to. Yeah, there's just like a bunch of blockchains out there that are doing the IBRL thing, right? Like Solana has, you know, to its credit, incredible scale. Base has incredible scale. We have Mega ETH coming down the line, incredible scale. And and so we already have Turing complete blockchains. You know, Ethereum invented that with smart contracts. Now with this like next generation of blockchains, we have, you know, seemingly so much scale that we can't actually figure out how to congest these blockchains other than in very like narrow paths, like very specific meme coins being contested. But other than that, scale is I kind of consider scale to be solved. And so my question to you is at the time is like, okay, what does it mean to have even more scalability and verifiability under that context? Because I kind of thought that we had like already solved both programmability with smart contracts and scalability with like things like Solana, Base, Mega, uh, Monad, like all of these things. And so like, where does that fall through? Amazing. I think if you look at, you know, the ambition of Crypto, like, let's say in 2017, 2018, when I kind of got in, my opening lectures would be, we're going to bring the entire, disintermediate the entire world, right? Like, we're going to bring Uber onchain. We're going to bring insurance on chain. We're going to bring everything that is intermediated through trust parties. We're going to remove it, and then we're going to use blockchain to disintermediate trust, make it verifiable, make it permissionless, all the core value propositions that we know and love in the blockchain space. That's, that was what our goal and ambition as a Crypto space was in 2017, 2018. And I think what happened is that as we traverse that path, we hit a bunch of like foundational infrastructure bottlenecks. Say, \"Oh, you know, I want to build Uber onchain, but okay, you know, this really can't support any of that throughput.\" So I, I say, \"Okay, let's just do token transfers and payments for Uber onchain,\" right? So I, I want to just point that out. Even today, if you ask today, people like, \"What is, what is blockchain for example? What Solana's like northstar? Decentralized NASDAQ, right? Like trades. I want to trade. I want to have assets on chain and I want to do trades.\" This is a great, like, really high value, value proposition, but it's not the entirety of Crypto. Our thesis for the entirety of Crypto is how do we bring the entire cloud? How do you bring the entire economy, even like, forget cloud, entire economy on, on chain, because the, the economy is built on trust, and how do we upgrade the trust rails for, for all of that? So specifically, how does this, what are the specific bottlenecks in blockchains that actually like make this not possible? Let's say I want to build x.com, Twitter on chain, right? And you say, \"Okay, now like Base or Mega or somebody has enough scale, so I'm going to just like take the x, you know, take some open source code base and then slam it on top.\" Is it going to work? No. You can't even use any open- source software library directly on a blockchain. You have to rewrite it in the specific languages and formats that are okay to be built on top of blockchains, right? You would have to rebuild Twitter with Solidity or with um, Rust for to get on Solana, right? Is that what you're saying? That's absolutely right. And so the, the programmability and the software limitation is massive. JT, you want to add something to it? Well, yeah. One of the things when we first started talking before I even joined EigenLayer, um, I think the, the belief that you had was that many, many more things could be built on blockchains that just weren't, that we had sort of applied the superpower of Crypto, the verifiability of Crypto very narrowly at this point. DeFi, stable coins, real world assets, things that you can tokenize, things that you can, you can coin and you can bring on chain. Uh, but your ambitions was, was, was more in line with, like you said, 2017, 2018 Ethereum, when I think is all of our particular vantage. Um, and and your, your approach was, instead of saying like, \"How do we remake apps to fit on chain?\" it was, \"Can we remake the app architecture so that we can apply cryptog guarantees to anything?\" And so restaking and EigenLayer was, David, as you pointed out, it was, it was a means to an end. It was a, it was a way to aggregate capital and willingness to monitor transactions and apply it, and that kickstarted a bunch of AVS development. But ultimately, the vision, as I understand it from you, is that we want to apply that power to many, many more types of applications. But there's a, there's sort of a fundamental constraint that remains that we're trying to address within cloud. Yeah. And the reason why we're talking about 2017, 2018 is like, we're kind of talking about actually the ICO meta, where there were these incredibly imaginative ICO projects that were so incredibly pie in the sky that I think really struck at everyone's imaginations, which is why the ICO meta became the ICO meta. Is like, everyone realized, \"Oh, blockchains, trust, verifiability, we can, we can rethink things, we can rethink the internet,\" and then there were a lot of people who were like, \"Yeah, and I can like package this up in a big narrative and sell this as an ICO.\" But that's aside from the fact, I think what Sreeram is really calling out is like, there was this era in Crypto where people's imaginations were just completely unbridled and just were running rampant because they saw these core primitives of trust, verifiability, uh, uh, you know, security, and kind of just like applied it and then kind of forgot about how those things were connected, how the application, and like there was some missing links there, but nonetheless, the ideas were there. And we also tried out like things like peepth, people, this is like old example that I try that I keep on come bringing up on Bankless over and over and over again. It was Twitter on the blockchain, and you would write a tweet, you would pay ETH in gas, and then uh, peepth would actually write that tweet into the Ethereum layer one. And this is back in the days of zero gas fees. So it actually was like free back at the time because no one was using Ethereum. And this was an example of a web 2 app. We're coming onchain. We're going to make Twitter be onchain. We're going to have like, you know, the immutability and verifiability of Twitter be on Ethereum. And that was back in like the experimental days of of 2017. It's like, \"Sure, why not? Like, no one, we don't really know what blockchains are good for. Uh, why not put literally Twitter on the layer one?\" Now, if you, if anyone like wrote, like, tried to like start up a Twitter on the blockchain project in 2025, no one, everyone would understand that that's not how you do things. And I think EigenLayer understands this too. It's like, \"No, we're not going to put tweets on chain. We're not putting tweets on chain. We're actually packaging up properties of blockchains with EigenLayer, with restaking, and we're turning those into modules that can be exported and like sold as a SAS business offering by AVS's using EigenCloud to things like Twitter or things like web 2.\" And so we're actually exporting, it's going the other way. We're, we're taking economic stake, we're turning that into a product that can be sold to web two, to, to other things. And sh, I'll hand it back to you in a. But there was um, my one of my favorite uh, like deep cut Bankless episodes was our, our first episode, I think, with Terrun Chitra, and we went through the evolution of um, just digital marketplaces uh, with like starting with how they, how the stock market traded in like the 70s, moving into where like the NASDAQ came in and and like different, different technologies. And like the main takeaway from that episode is like the markets that we trade on all got improved in this like step function way every time some technological innovation happened that found a way to remove lawyers out of, out of, out of like a core part of the product, and then the markets just got 10x larger. And like there was some like transition in like the late 90s where like markets went digital, and it was because somebody found a way to like just completely remove an entire layer of lawyers. And that's actually what I see EigenLayer doing. Is like, you don't need an SLA, you don't need a service license agreement, you don't need to like get a a lawyer to draft up a a contract between these two companies, you could just go to EigenLayer, pay some like fee for renting security from an AVS that has provided you this service, and in instead of having the legal system, the nation state legal system, you know, ultimately backed by an army sponsored by Coinbase, uh, having that be back up the contract, you actually just can have an economic weight back up that contract. And that's actually far more interoperable and like verifiable because of EigenDA. I'm going on a little bit of a rant here, but I think that's some of the context I think is worth bringing into this conversation. Then I'll throw it back to you. That's right. So there is a famous saying that says civilization progresses as we find one more thing to automate, right? So that's like lawyers is one thing, but like, you know, it's it's lawyers, it's audit firms, it's, you know, trust is the fabric on which the entire society is built. So as we try to automate trust, like how much bigger can our economy size be? Like that's I think like much, much bigger than what I think right now the ambition inside Crypto that we're seeing. And it goes to like how do we disrupt digital marketplaces? How do we build trust in an era where there is like, you know, AI as a kind of like a dominant force in society? It goes to how do we reimagine societal scale incentives at a global, global level, where like all these contracts can be self-enforcing. So that's like our big goal and vision. And then like, I, I think it's shared, like a lot of us here came to Crypto because of these these ideals and ideas. And uh, but what happened, I think, like you, you mentioned the ICO era, David, like you can go back to like 2010, 2011 Bitcoin talk, right? Like people were like, \"Wow, there's this Bitcoin thing. Now, you know, what other thing can you build on top or build other things like this?\" You see that thing. And similarly, I think what happened is 2014, 2015, 2016, Ethereum came on the scene and showed that this is not just theoretical ideas. This is actually like right now possible. You can write a smart contract. You can build a Twitter-like app and deploy it, right? And that kicked off a set of imagination that like, you know, was pretty contagious because now there's like a developer tool along with an, you know, with a kind of like an idealism, and those two like meet and really interesting. But then like what happened was CryptoKitties happened. Like we ran into the kind of throughput bottleneck. Like the zero gas era ended, right? CryptoKitties was this NFT kind of game project, and you know, took up pretty much all of the Ethereum mainnet uh, bandwidth, and then everybody realized, \"Hey, we need to scale.\" We went through the whole L2's road map. I think very successfully. It's really amazing to see, David, that I was sitting, you know, as an academic, right? We, and I, I think in long time scales, looking at the ZK rollup road map and then thinking, \"What are these guys smoking?\" Like, why is this a solution to, it's not, it's a long-term solution, I know that, but it's crazy. It's Ethereum and the culture around Ethereum that made this kind of absolutely crazy, imaginative road map of ZK rollups become real in this time scale, beyond the wild, wild bets. I think it's parallel to something that happened in AI that, you know, even the most bullish of people underestimated the timelines. There's something similar there. But those solve the core scaling bottlenecks of Ethereum. They solve the cold scaling bottlenecks of Ethereum and like the blockchain in the blockchain architecture, but they do not solve the programmability bottlenecks, which is really what we're speaking to. Is I, as a developer, should be able to take any code anywhere and then slam it on top of a blockchain. I should be able to take use any hardware that I want. I should be able to use like H100 GPUs to run my AI. I should be able to use the latest, you know, GPUs to run my gaming engine and still have it be verifiable. I should be able to run trusted execution environments and have it be private so that other people don't have to see every single transaction for it to be verifiable. So I want as a developer much, much higher control than what blockchains offer today because they're built on this idea of every node comes to consensus on a deterministic state transition. This is the whole premise. In fact, you know, David mentioned earlier that if you look at today, like what's the biggest things going on, it's things like Solana, like meat, like Base, like Sui, trying to accel, accelerate like the throughput bottleneck. And if you look at what they're primarily trying to do, they're trying to primarily do parallelism, right, inside the blockchain architecture. And if you ask like, \"Hey, isn't parallelism a 1980s computer architecture thing?\" you know, multi-threaded, multicore, like, you know, why are we like talking about it like it's a new thing today in Crypto? It's because the underlying assumption of consensus on deterministic state, and so you want basically like blockchains to arrive at consensus on a common deterministic state, and that basically means I'm going to force everything to be very rigidly deterministic, so I build a rigid construct, like the EVM is a rigid construct that says you can only do certain things, and anything else you have to like say that, \"Oh, somebody's signing off on it, it's an Oracle problem, somebody signs off on it and then brings that data in.\" And so you, you build this very rigid wall of determinism, which gives you very strong grade of security, right? But it restricts massively the developer surface area of what can be built on top. So that's, that's what our goal is, cloudscale programmability, cryptograde verifiability, where blockchains are is they took this original decision, which is to to like bring this tight consensus on highly deterministic state. You have to fix a\n\n\nVM\nbecause you have to fix that VM to be\nvery rigidly deterministic. You can't\nhave parallelism because when you do\nthings in parallel, maybe the threads\ndon't meet back at the same time. There\nis asynchrony, there is mistiming,\nthere's all kinds of complexity that go\nwith it. And so that has led down to\nlike a path where you have like specific\nVMs. And then now, like the next\ngeneration of like updates to these\nblockchains are like parallelized\nVMs, like Move or you know, Calele, and\nso on, which actually solve some of\nthese problems. But there are many, many,\nmany problems like this. There's\nmulti-threaded, there's multi-core,\nthere's multi-compute, there is cluster\nprogramming. Are we going to invent new\nand new like systems and blockchains for\neach one of these, or are we going to\nhave like a foundational framework that\nsays I can throw pretty much anything on\ntop of a common substrate, anything that\nI can do on cloud on top of a common\nsubstrate, and have it be programmable\nand verifiable? So the big question mark\nis how do you get any of these things to\nbe verifiable?\n\nAnd speak to it a little bit, but JT,\nyou want to add something there?\n\nNo, I think probably David, for a lot of\nyour listeners who don't have PhDs in\ncomputer science, like Sreeram, the um,\nthe thing that we're looking to solve\nhere is, like you said, there were two\nkind of primary constraints hindering,\nhampering, blocking the creativity of\nkind of early Ethereum days. One was\nscalability, which we've thrown the\nkitchen sink of VC money and talent at\nand has largely solved. Um, we've got,\nwe've solved the throughput problem. Um,\nbut I think the uh, the constraint that\nremains is the programmability or the\nexpressivity of the onchain VM. It's\nconstructed in a certain way to maintain\nasum, says the determinism that makes it\nverifiable. And so we can either, we can\neither accept that and just accept that\nthere's always going to be limits of\nwhat we can put on chain, and thus we'll\njust try to find new creative ways to\nbuild DeFi applications, or we can say,\nwhat if we could take the application\nlogic that doesn't need to be sort of\nadjudicated on chain up into an off-chain\ncontainer? Are there ways that we could\nguarantee an L1 like verifiability of\nthat execution so that you could offer\ndevelopers cloud-like programmability,\ncloud-like developer experience, just\nrun application logic in a container, and\nthen underneath the hood, a product like\nEigenCloud can abstract all of the the\nunderlying blockchain verifiability? And\num, that's that's what the the original\nthesis of EigenLayer was, is that we\ncould, we could do that. ABS's have have\nbeen building those those models for for\na while. And so we're we're taking this\na step further with uh, with EigenCloud.\n\nYeah. And that container word, I want to\ndouble tap into, because that's something\nthat if you're familiar with computer\nscience, it probably just made instant\nsense to you. But if you're not, then\nyou're like, okay, offchain container,\nlike, what, what does that mean to me?\nAnd so, like, I think we pretty\nestablished this, like, notion of just\nlike, building onchain is rigid because\nwe need it to be deterministic. And so\nwhat it means to build on chain is like\nfundamentally constrained. Now it's\nTuring complete. Yes. And now we have\nscale also. Yes. But nonetheless, like\nthe rest of the internet is not built in\na way that fits onchain. And sure, you\ncan rebuild Twitter to go on chain if you\nreally want to. But does that really make\nsense? Uh, and so there's this notion of\na container in computer science. Maybe JT\nyou can kind of unpack that a little bit\nmore, but really how I think about this\nis just like, there are parts of a\nwebsite, parts of any sort of like code\nthat uh, we are going to write that is,\nwe want to relate to some important\nproperty. And so we're going to write\nthat in a container, and that can go in\nlike your Amazon S1 bucket. I think I'm\ngetting this computer science right. Um,\nor, or it could go on chain. But like\nwhat EigenLayer does is it provides a\ncontainer for you to write your code\nlogic to for very important information.\nAgain, things that would otherwise go to\na lawyer, things that would otherwise be\ndrafted up in a legal contract. And now\nyou can write it inside of a container\nthat would go again, like previously a\ncontainer would go on Amazon AWS.\nEigenLayer, via EigenCloud, is offering\nsomething very similar where logic about\nstate transitions can be put into this\ncontainer, and then using I, a truly\nEigenLayer, like the L1 security that\nwill be adjudicated in a particular way\nthat will um, uh, uh, enforce a certain\noutcome. Uh, that's my interpretation of\nthis, like, but also I'm quite\nconstrained on my ability to talk about\ncomputer science.\n\nJT, like, talk about that container\nthing uh, in the offchain world context.\n\nYeah, I mean, I, I came from Azure, and\nand a container is really just an, is a\nalternative deployment tool similar to a\nvirtual machine that you might get in in\nAWS or Azure. And so it's a, it's a\nplace to house your uh, house your\napplication code. And so in an AWS uh,\nenvironment, you would deploy that\ncontainer against uh, AWS services. And\nhere we can deploy it against uh, nodes\nthat uh, that operators have offered to\nto run um, with the security behind it\nthat will ensure the correctness of\nexecution. That's that's the diff here\nis that AWS is just a uh, a public cloud\nwhere you can run the container, but\nthere is no, there are no uh, penalties\nor rewards for for correctness. And um,\nin a in EigenCloud, we have an\nadditional actor. The raw material is not\njust a piece of hardware that runs the\ncode. uh, the raw material is stake\ncapital that that forms sort of a penalty\nu, and operators that are taking an\nactive role in ensuring the correctness\nof execution. And so there's a slight\ndifference in the raw material of the\ncloud uh, and the the sort of\nabstraction that I cloud is performing\nversus an AWS.\n\nI think that I think that's really\nhelpful. I think at this point in the\nconversation, we run up against a new\nconstraint, which is the listeners and\nmine uh, imagination as to like what\nhappens next, because I think we all\nunderstand, like, okay, we need to have\nour blockchains verifiable because, you\nknow, asset ownership, all of these\nthings, we need to run on trust, but\nwhat does it mean for these same\nproperties to be extended to like\nTwitter or Facebook or like anything else\nlike Amazon? I don't really get that\npart of this notion of like, okay, we\nhave trust, we have verifiability, we\nhave cryptoeconomic cryptoeconomic\nweight. I can make a promise about\nsomething, but like, what is Twitter\ndoing for me? And maybe I'm like over uh,\nfixating on Twitter, maybe it's a\ndifferent use case, but how would you\nlike illustrate the notion of we're,\nwe're taking blockchain properties, IE\nEigenLayer is taking blockchain\nproperties through EigenCloud, is making\nthis developer-friendly cloud service\nthat can allow them to access blockchain\nproperties to build their applications,\nbut like, but what applications? Like,\nwhat does it mean to imbue web 2 with\nlike trust and verifiability? Can you\njust make that a little bit more real\nfor us?\n\nYeah, so I, I don't know that it's, it's\nTwitter or Amazon or Uber that that made\nit hit for me. The one that uh, that's\nreally resonated over the last six months\nfor me is like a chat GPT, right? There\nwas a story in the New York Times just\nover the weekend about um, users that\nwere interacting with models and sort of\nuncovering that the model was optimizing\nfor engagement over necessarily telling\nthe truth to the user. And so in very\nharmless ways that can manifest as like,\nthat's a great idea, Dave. Let's explore\nthat a little bit more, right? Like how\nthey respond to your prompts. Perhaps in\nmore pernicious ways, they could reveal\ncertain parts of an answer, but not\nreveal certain parts of an answer in an\nattempt to get you to ask another\nquestion. Um, and so we don't know how\nthese models are built. And perhaps\nthat's not really important for like the\nway that most of us are using chat GPT.\nUm, but as we offload more and more\nreasoning to agents, as we offload more\ndecision- making and perhaps in the\nfuture, like sovereign action to agents,\nif that's a world that we believe is\ncoming, then there's always going to be\na cap on how far we can let those models\ngo without us fully trusting them and\nhaving some sort of accountability guard\nrail built in. And so the question is,\nhow do you build that? You can't really\nbuild it on a public cloud. But if you\nhave the ability to slash the results of\na GPT model, a hallucination, for\ninstance, yeah, says, you know, for uh,\nfor a given, a given output, I'm going\nto, I'm going to commit that this is\ncorrect, and if it's provably incorrect,\nthen it gets penalized. And you have\njust a different relationship with with\nAI agents. That one, that one stuck out\nto me for, I know we've talked a lot\nabout that in the office, but I'm\nwondering if there's other examples that\nyou've got that maybe resonate.\n\nYeah. No, ju, just adding a little bit\nto this kind of like highle picture that\nDavid asked, like, why do we need\nsomething to be verifiable? I think\nlike, that's, that's maybe like a big\nkind of question. Think of what needs to\nbe verifiable is things whose\nconsequences are material, right? Like\nI'm going to load, for example, here is\nan AI agent. If this AI agent says go\nbuy this coin, I'm just going to go buy\nit. I'm not going to intermediate it.\nI'm just going to make it autonomous.\nThat the AI agent says something and\nthen it just does it, right? Like it\nmoves those tokens on a blockchain,\nlet's say. That's the most material\nthing you could kind of like put\ndownstream of like, um, of an action. So\nfor those actions, they would absolutely\nwant it to be verifiable because\notherwise, why am I giving my money to an\nagent that is going to go do some\nactions, and those actions are going to\nkind of like cost me either loss or harm\nunless I know it is verifiable. This is\nthe kind of basic grade of why we need\nsmart contracts, right? We need smart\ncontracts because I know that this smart\ncontract always executes using this\npiece of code in this way. What's the\nequivalent of that for something like\nAI? I would say, oh, here is a, you know,\nmodel, a specific open source model,\nlike a llama 4.2 or something, like, you\nknow, take an open source code, say,\nhere is the model, here are all the\nmodel weights, here are the inputs that\nit will read, you know, it's either on\nthe blockchain or comes from some fet\noracles, and then it is going to run\nthis piece of code at this time and then\ngive you an output, and you pre-commit\nto all of this stuff, it's this model,\nthese inputs onchain, and bring the\nresults back, like, that's the the\ncovenants or the condition under which\nyou want to run this AI. Okay. And that\nis going to immediately cause some\ndownstream material token movements,\nright? That's very understandable for a\ncrypto audience. You know, as we were\nthinking about this whole like cloud\nidea, we were thinking, like, should we\nstart from the outside in, more of the\npoint of view that David brought in? Are\nwe going to go to Twitter and like, you\nknow, Microsoft and bring them on chain,\nor are we coming to crypto developers\nand saying, hey, you know, you can\nuplevel, you know, whatever chain you're\nbuilding your applications on, you can\nuplevel what you could be building\ntoday? And so we took the latter\napproach, which is to go to, like, our\napproach is tailored towards you're\nanyway working with tokens, right? So\nthat's what like crypto developers do,\nlike build things which are conditions\nupon which tokens move around, right? And\nI'll give some concrete examples to make\nthis very clear. And so all of those\napplications, we absolutely want these\nupstream actions to be verifiable. So\nwhat are some examples, right? So we'll\nstart with the most kind of DGEN or fun\none, meme coins, right? So, you know, we\nwe say, like, in crypto, there's only\nthree use cases today, it's Bitcoin,\nstable coin, memecoin, right? So, the,\nlet's take memecoins, the most fun one\nof these. Um, you know, one of the\nthings you want to do in Um, the word\nsays memecoin, right? So meme, somebody\nshould be propagating the meme, right? A\nmeme is an idea that needs to go viral.\nAnd so if you look at like the evolution\nof memecoins, one of the things that\nPump Fun did, what did Pump Fund do?\nPump Fun just made it possible for\nsomebody to verify that here's a\nmemecoin with this much supply. So they\nmade the supply verifiable, and so that\nany, every token that comes out of Pump\nFund, if you make a Pump Fund token, it\ncomes out with the same supply that's\nhardcoded. Everyone knows that. All\nother interfaces, front ends know that\nthat that's true because that's just\nwhat a pump fund token is. That's right.\nSo, this is a very important mental\nmodel. So, when you make something\nverifiable, you can make it\npermissionless. Okay? Right. So, so let\nme just state it again. When you make\nsomething verifiable, you can make it\npermissionless. Now, because the the the\ntoken supply is made verifiable, no,\npermissionlessly 30 million tokens have\nbeen created. Mhm. Right. It opens up\nthe aperture that I don't need to be a\ntrusted person to like with a vetted\naudited smart contract to actually go\nlaunch like a token with a fixed supply.\nI can just press a button and do it\nright. So that's what pump fun did. But\nwhat is missing there is what is the\nincentive to continue growing the meme.\nSo you see this typical curve, like\nsugar high and then like, you know, goes\nup and then bonk, everything crashes\nafter that. I mean, it's fun and like we\nall love playing or all the agents\nsomewhat here, otherwise we won't be here\nbut that idea is the the superpower is\nlike the verifiability and the\npermissionlessness. Now what can you do\nif you if you had cloud in a in a\nmemecoin world? Can you create a\nmemecoin which says not just a fixed\nsupply, but an inflating supply where\nthe inflated portion of the supply is\ngoing to people who are promoting your\nmeme on Twitter or forecaster or you\nknow, Tik Tok, whatever, right? How do\nyou do that? Part needs to have because\nI'm tying it directly into the heart of\nthe token, the token supply will go\nbonkers if I said, you know, David's\ngoing to kind of decide who the tokens\ngo to, or Chat GPD is going to decide\nwho the tokens go to. The entire token\neconomy is dependent on this person who's\ncontrolling how those new tokens are\ngoing to be allotted. And you can plug\nin cloud into it and say go verify\nTwitter, go use AI inference to double\ncheck that, you know, the people who are\ntalking about it are talking about your\ntoken. They're talking about it\npositively. They're injecting new ideas\ninto the discourse. They're getting new\npeople on boarded. Whatever your\ncriteria is by the engagement.\nYeah. Yeah. Engagement over low\nengagement. But all of that application\nlogic\n\n\nIt is not something that a blockchain could reason with today. Right.\nYou just fundamentally can't hack that into an onchain. Right.\nAnd so this is one of the places where it's the most trust sensitive.\nWhy do you have a blockchain to know why what is the big deal with Bitcoin?\n21 million Bitcoin, right?\nControlling the supply, and it only goes to miners who are mining the blockchain.\nThat's the core part of Bitcoin's logic.\nSame thing in a memecoin.\nI want to mine a memecoin by actually like spreading the meme, and the new tokens are getting printed because of that.\nThis is the core logic, and you can't express it on chain, but you can slam it on top of a cloud.\nAll the complexity that we just said, use AI to adjudicate, like, okay, you know, it's being run in this way.\nIt's only giving the tokens to people who are passing this AI check.\nIt's only given to people who are having this engagement done, all of that run verifiably, but brought on chain with a level of guarantee, right?\nSo this is a very fun example of this premise that using an AI offchain, but that brought the results verifiably on chain, can actually massively change the surface area of what can be built today.\nSo imagine in six months, memecoin launch plat la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la launchpads, which basically have all these configuration features which say quality, quantity, like token inflation, like control, all of that, and it's perceptible and verifiable to a user, says, \"Yes, okay, I can just go launch, you know, these meme coins.\"\nBut why only memecoins, right?\nWhy shouldn't I have a similar thing?\nLike, why wouldn't we want to have a portion of the supply be allocated to like people who propagate the meme of EigenLayer?\nMaybe we do, maybe we want to do it, maybe Optimism wants to do it, it maybe Solana itself wants to do it.\nSo this is not because once you make something programmable and verifiable, it can go deeper and deeper into the core logic of what what you can touch.\nWhat is this the holy cow?\nWhat is the sacred thing that you wouldn't touch otherwise?\nThis token supply, right?\nAnd so you would touch it if it is verifiable.\nAnd so that's an example.\nAnd so here I want to point out one more thing about like the trust model.\nPeople think of EigenLayer as economic security, right?\nSo, okay, you're running something offchain.\nHow is it back?\nIt's backed because people are putting up money behind it and promising that this thing is run correctly, right?\nAnd that result is brought back in.\nAnd then that's what's going to now control the inflation of these tokens.\nBut when you do this, you only get economic security or however much is being staked.\nYou don't get more than what is staked.\nSo the first thing is for what is staked, we not only have slashing that you can slash the bad parties, you can redistribute it to the harmed parties.\nSo an app can say, \"Hey, I'm slashing the guy, and I'm going to distribute it to the token holders because they got harmed because, you know, the token got inflated and went to like random guys.\"\nSo that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is you can not only do this with economic security, but like an optimistic rollup, you can wait for a settlement period.\nSo in an optimistic rollup, what happens is you make a claim, and that claim has some take behind it, and then you wait for a lag for anybody to challenge it, you know, because in a permissionless blockchain, censorship-resistant blockchain like Ethereum, which is what we are rooted on as EigenLayer, anybody can come and slam a thing saying, \"Hey, you know, this claim is fraudulent.\"\nAnd so if it is fraudulent, it gets adjudicated, and then like, you know, and the results come up.\nSo if you wait for that adjudication period or the challenge period, you can actually get much higher security than the amount of stake because if nobody's challenging, or if it's challenged and the results are already the correct execution is brought in, you can actually, it's not just economic security, it goes far beyond economic security.\nSo that's it, it goes to rollup-like security.\nSo you can build not just economic security models, but roll up great security models.\nAnd there's a bunch of technicality underneath it, I'm not going to get into, but this memecoin example is a great use case for thinking about because I'm touching the root of trust and supply.\nYou want to be thoughtful about what you can do there.\nMhm.\nI think it, it all, it goes back to 2018, 2019 when all the big public clouds were looking at blockchain.\nThey saw, they saw the potential of what smart contracts could be used to adjudicate, and there was Super Bowl ads on, you know, trusted track and trace supply chains from IBM and all sorts of stuff, if you remember, remember that, that kind of, um, I was at Microsoft at that time, and I remember Satya Nadella and Teashi Ninamoto, who's now the CMO, they were like, \"Yeah, it's great, like, this is a really interesting, this is a really interesting technology that could open up a new application pattern, uh, like a whole new category of, of sort of applications.\"\nHowever, one, these things are too slow.\nScalability, to your point, dated, and two, the point of failure of any of these applications is when you have to trust something that happens off chain.\nRight.\nRight.\nSo when you have to write something on chain that comes from an IoT sensor or an ERP software system or something that you are taking valuable action on or you're triggering a smart contract on that, you don't, it doesn't have that verifiability.\nAnd so I think what Sreeram is and and the EigenCloud tries to do is extend the sort of barrier of what can be verifiable on chain.\nSo I think the memecoin platform is a great, is a great example, a great den example, but I think it hints at something that like, in order to do what you were just laying out there, um, the blockchain would have to reason with a whole host of inputs that it just can't reason with today.\nIt can't reason with the inputs, like, how do you know what's going on in Twitter?\nHow do you know what's going on on Tik Tok?\nRight.\nSo you need the the interfaces to to be verifiable.\nNumber one.\nNumber two, not just the interfaces, the computation, like we were talking about programmability constraints, right?\nHow do I write like the latest llama agent inside a blockchain, right?\nLike, they're not meant for it.\nI don't want to write llama in Solidity or, you know, in to to write it inside a Seale program.\nI want to use the latest GPUs and slam the thing on top and say, like, okay, you know, it's, I don't want to touch like TensorFlow or PyTorch or whatever programming environments are used to write this AI, but cloud will let you do that while maintaining verifiability.\nSo that's a big unlock.\nUh, JT was talking about Satya.\nSo an episode comes to mind that I want to hint at here.\nUm, so there's a recent podcast episode in the Darkish podcast.\nSatya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, is talking to him, and Daresh says, \"Hey, Satya, do you think AI is like a new kind of species?\"\nSays, \"Is AI a new kind of species?\"\nAnd then Satya pauses, and then he says, \"Yeah, it's a fascinating idea.\"\nOur C, Microsoft's AI CEO, Mustafa Sleman, you know, Satya says he thinks the same, like, he thinks it's like something like that, but I think it's not yet there, and the reason he gives is not because it's not intelligent or powerful enough.\nThe reason he gives is that AI agents today cannot own property.\nThe legal infrastructure to own property, to take liability, to start companies, to engage in contracts.\nThis stuff doesn't exist.\nSo it's always an agent is acting as a delegate of human agency, right?\nIt's Sreeram having an AI agent, right?\nSo it's, you know, I can give my wallet ID to like an AI agent, or I can give my Stripe API to an AI agent, and and this is right now, like the AI agent meta in Crypto is like, \"Oh, AI agents are going to trade onchain.\"\nYes, that's true, but AI agents are also going to use a Stripe API to go and trade like other places.\nWhat is unique that blockchains provide that simply doesn't exist is it's a substitute to this whole legal infrastructure.\nIt's a it's a new form of property rights, right?\nAnd when you think about it like that, um, what is a smart contract, right?\nA smart contract is a program owning property, right?\nSo, let me just state it again.\nA smart contract is a program owning property, right?\nIs is a program that can hold digital assets under its custody.\nThat's what a smart contract is.\nSo, if you think about if I can put an AI agent as a program, it can hold property.\nIt can start Dows.\nIt can do all kinds of things.\nThe missing link is how do you put an AI agent into a blockchain.\nThat's the missing link, not anything else.\nEverything else already exists.\nThat's what smart contracts are.\nThat's what Turing completeness is.\nWhat is missing is the programmability to put the AI agent as a program, slam it into a blockchain that doesn't exist today.\nImagine like magic box cloud.\nYou throw that AI agent onto the EigenCloud.\nIt's a program that's verifiable, and it holds property on chain.\nNow you can create fully sovereign agents.\nKind of like the endgame of the AI agent meta is fully sovereign, fully verifiable agents whose entire supply chain.\nThe input data is verifiable, the program is verifiable, the inference is verifiable, the tool calls are verifiable, everything is verifiable.\nAnd you can do that with the cloud.\nAnd so part of like why we went with this cloud cloud branding is if you look at what is the biggest thing going on in cloud, in the same interview, Satya says the biggest investment Microsoft's making this year, Azure is making this year as a cloud company, is $80 billion into AI, right?\nThis is the biggest thing in the cloud.\nWhat is the biggest demand for computation is AI?\nIt's the same thing for us as cloud, you know, it's general computation platform that you can offload all kinds of logic into.\nWhat is the biggest demand for that?\nIt's probably going to be AI.\nAnd so like that's why we're using that as a rooting example, but you can offload all kinds of computation.\nAnd we'll we'll talk about some of the other examples.\nCertainly.\nYeah, it's probably worth just emphasizing the notion of blockchains as asset ledgers in this context where, like, what are what are blockchains really good for?\nYou know, moving tokens from person A to person B, from Alice to Bob under conditions, right?\nUm, and like, you know, Uniswap and AMM pool is like a condition.\nUh, and that's good for DeFi.\nYou know, DeFi makes sense on chain, but really all these things are are the means for swapping assets between each other, between between parties, plus conditions upon those assets being transferred.\nAnd really that's that's really all they're for is for just settling settling assets between people.\nAnd this whole like idea of like an off-chain container where, you know, Street Rumble is going to go slam an AI into this off-chain container, allows for just like more expressive conditions, right?\nLike what more expressive conditions can we create rules for for the the logic, the settlement logic between A and B?\nAnd like, you know, it's worth noting that like, you know, PolyMarket is a good example of those, like, let's talk about some some conditions upon the ways that like assets will be will be transferred from party A to party B, you know, will, you know, Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in the election?\nWell, if if this, then that.\nAnd that is actually all written offchain.\nAnd then really all the PolyMarket does is like encode a few things off onchain in order to, you know, be verifiable.\nAnd then assets get gets gets handed off.\nAnd so like the idea here is like, well, AI and AI thought and the ways that AI thinks and what AI think about can all be something that can be put into a container and ma made verifiable, you know, verify that we know that the code is the code and that that's what EigenDA is for.\nThat's the substrate that we are allowing to be able to like uh attest to the verifiability of the code being run.\nUh, and then the output of some AI and and an LLM can be turned into logic that results in assets being transferred from in a in a particular condition.\nSo it's like a pretty, it's a pretty broad, uh, I mean, boundless, I'll even say, like, category of like what can be put into a container.\nImagine if your checking account and DeFi wallet finally spoke the same language.\nThat's Mantle Banking, an all-in-one fiat and crypto account.\nIt lets you save, spend, and invest all from one dashboard.\nSwipe for coffee, stake me through yield, or even use virtual cards for payments through Apple Pay.\nSo, it feels web 2 simple, yet stays web 3

marketing for EigenLayer because it's a very complicated, you pop open the hood and there's a bunch of components.\nSo your your work is cut out for you.\nBut you know, today EigenLayer goes live, it's it's announced to the world, what does the next like week, month, quarter, year look like for you as as head of\n\n\nMarketing, what does that look like? How do you take this and to whom? Uh, how do you take EigenCloud and and how do you just like tell the world about it? Who, who, like I talked about AI is first, but I'm sure there's so many other categories. Like what, what's your job look like?\n\nYeah, it's a good, it's a good question. The difficulty of it was what I was, why I joined. The first time I met with Sam, I realized what he was, what he's attempting to do is build the first kind of cryptonative cloud, right? He wants to build a cloud that's that's backed by restaking. That's that's the the um, the stick that under underpins it. Um, and also the carrot for the stakers and the operators. But um, a cryptonnative cloud that has slashable services that can build these, these new types of applications. And that's that's a, that's not going to be something that is understood overnight. And so I think the first week, month, quarter, um, for us is just highlighting what can be built and highlighting what is being built. And so, um, you highlighted PolyMarket and prediction markets. Uh, a lot of, uh, there's a lot of innovation on top of EigenLayer, PolyMarket included. Um, that we think these new layer primitives can can open up new products for for someone like PolyMarket. Um, I think AI is going to continue to be a really useful pattern for us. Um, when I went back to in the Azure days, we were talking about this on our exec meeting this morning that the internet of things was a really complex topic to sort of explain, and what you needed was sort of one pattern that could people could say, \"Oh, I like, I understand why you would need to get sensor data off of a thing and then react to it.\" Um, remote monitoring of an elevator or a jet engine or whatever, and then predictive maintenance on that thing because it's it's a uh, it's an expensive thing to replace. So, I want to, I want to make sure I know what's going on with that machine all the time, and then when it breaks, I go fix it. And so, I think as we start to engage with developers, um, there's going to be new sources of inspiration for what can be made verifiable on chain. I think we're, we need to recalize some of that creativity that we talked about earlier on the call.\n\nUm, that channelneled that energy of builder circa 2017, 18, 19, where we were thinking about what could be disrupted on chain, what could be remade and reimagined on chain. I mean, we were thinking about what couldn't be disrupted on chain. No, in that area, you didn't know, right? In that area, you hadn't reckoned with the the sort of scalability challenges of the of the of the underlying chain, nor the fact that the onchain VM was as restrictive as it was. It was sort of unbounded creativity. Right. And so a lot of the the marketing campaigns, the stuff that we've talked about doing, um, is is going back with the developer communities at Base and Arbitrum and Optimism and Linea and all these, there are brilliant, talented developers all over Crypto that have great ideas, but they're just capped. They can't do what they want to do. And we want to go sort of redefine the design space for those developers.\n\nUm, you know, you, you talked about, you asked where, where we're going to focus first. We could probably go to web two and go to just traditional developers and say like, \"Hey, there's this new cloud and there's these new primitives that you can build verifiable apps.\" And that that would require sort of a two hop, a two, a two-step sale, right? A two-step pitch where we have to pitch them on verifiability and then why this thing looks like the clouds that they're used to building. Or you can go to the developers that are frustrated by the limitations of the VM today, that know it intimately, that know that it has limitations that, and if they could just, if they could just offload the logic and be able to interact with normal software libraries or normal API calls, they could build some really cool things. Those are the ones, those are the devs that we're going to go talk to first. And so we want to go talk to, you know, Jesse at Base and the EF and all these great developer communities, not just in Ethereum, across uh, across chains and and kind of recitalize that that ambition and that creativity around what Crypto can do because I think EigenCloud extends the reach of Crypto far beyond DeFi to a whole host of new applications. Uh, and and that's that's the most exciting thing for me.\n\nSriram, when it comes to just like the size of the opportunity here, I think we all know like the notion of the cloud is large, uh, big, big market over there. Um, how do we know what the TAM, the market size is for EigenCloud? Like a cloud but with blockchain properties, like because there it could be, you know, layer has this big like story that it that it like fell into when it got launched. Uh, and now, now the actual like existence of the product is actually here. But like is this a, how do, how do you think about the TAM here? Is this like a $1 billion TAM, a $10 billion TAM, a trillion dollar TAM? How do we, what do we know about like the potential of what this market even looks like?\n\nYeah. Uh, if you think about like what the cloud did, basically it made, you know, most of the economy programmable, right? Pretty much anybody doing anything, like if you're running any business, you're using the cloud in some way or the other. Either you're directly like using some application of the cloud or like you're using an application that is built on the cloud. So every man, woman, child has, you know, is using the cloud in some way or the other. So that's what the cloud did by making it very programmable, modular, people can build like lots of things one on top of the other. And what we want to do and what the Crypto project is, and we just see ourselves as like an accelerant to the Crypto project is to make the economy verifiable. Right? So if you, if the more of the economy that is made verifiable, the more permissionless it becomes because once it's verifiable, I don't need to know it's David or Sham or JT going and doing this, it's anybody can do this. And so once that expands, actually what you see is the verifiability is the input, permissionlessness is the output, right? So many more people can build all of these things without them having to be trusted because once you're, once you need to trust them, you need, you constrict it, right? So why is JP Morgan the only one that can offer derivatives or, you know, whatever narrow class of Wall Street firms is because it needs to be verifiable. And like what DeFi did is say, no, like anybody can write a piece of code and that code is going to be verifiable, so you don't need JP Morgan, like a kid from, you know, Goa in India can actually write a piece of code and like people can slam things on top, and that made the the uh, DeFi economy big. Now, doing that for any piece of code means basically you can rebuild the trust layer society, and like think of, you know, what the, what percentage of the GDP goes into the GDP goes into like the trust services, like legal, accounting, uh, you know, compliance, all of this stuff. If it's programmable on chain, how much frictions can it reduce and how much market opportunity it can create? I think we as Crypto should be envisioning a portion of the entire GDP rather than like starting from inside out, like, okay, you know, what, what is the addressable market? So that's our, this always our vision, like we, we say humanities coordination engine inside EigenLayer, and like part of the vision is to see how we can move more, more and more of the economy, make it more of it verifiable. And so, yeah, if the cloud unlocked tens of trillions of dollars, like that would be our ambition for like Crypto to unlock, you know, tens of trillions of dollars with this kind of, you know, verify everything approach.\n\nYeah. Another way I've heard you talk about it, Sam, is the the first verifiable app effectively was Bitcoin, and that's a $2 trillion asset class that disrupted fiat money. Um, and then Ethereum ex extended the programmability of of Bitcoin and opened up other types of programmable money, programmable finance, and that's another, call it trillion dollar uh, industry that's been built on mostly Ethereum, but now on Solana. Um, and so what happens when you extend the programmability again, David, to your point about step function improvements to uh, to technology, if you, if you extend the envelope of what can be verified beyond the sort of narrow application of finance and and token based money to anything, um, then it's probably somewhere between what DeFi has done today and what the cloud has captured over the last kind of 20 years. That's the sort of long-term, long-term market opportunity.\n\nJT, Sriram, I know it's been uh, a slo getting layer over the uh, over the finish line. So, congratulations on it actually finally getting uh, getting released. Uh, who can go play on EigenCloud today? Uh, is this for developers? Like who, who is this product for like right now? How do people get their hands on it? What does that look like?\n\nSo this is uh, this is for any developer building on any chain uh, in Crypto today that wants to build more mainstream applications or or work with AI on chain. And so, um, EigenCloud is available uh, today. There's EigenDA is is a is a mainnet service. EigenLayer is obviously the foundation on which all this is built. But we've got some exciting new services. Uh, EigenVerify and EigenCompute that are rolling out in in private preview uh, this morning. Uh, so you can go and apply for access to to private preview and start building with those today. Uh, and we lay it out on a white paper where you can you can dig into in a lot more detail. But um, those services are going to be available on mainnet towards the end of the summer. And uh, and we've got a lot more third party ABS value, really, really innovative teams building on EigenLayer uh, as well as some first party ABS's that we're building in house that are going to be super exciting coming out later this fall. So uh, so more to come, but um, you can go to cloud.xyz XYZ and and get access to all that.\n\nYou know, I think your guys's biggest challenge is actually uh, teaching developers how to think bigger or think in different terms. Uh, this notion, like with free roams, like memecoin example, like why, why did memecoins become so big? Well, like Pump.fun really like processed and like turn it into like a peeable structure via the verifiability of the uh, of the total, total supply for every memecoin. But then with EigenLayer, with EigenCloud, you can have this verifiable way of inflating the token in a way that only go the inflation only goes to like productive output of uh, whoever was like contributing to growing the beam. That's like a non-intuitive way of like using EigenLayer, but nonetheless, it is like obviously it was a great example. And so I think your guys's biggest challenge is like how do you teach people to think in these new terms, think in these new ways to like open up their imaginations or like what they, what they can build uh, using layer. Uh, I, I don't have the answers for you there, but I will kind of like leave the listener with like it's probably thinking bigger is probably going to be the biggest challenge to like opening up the the possibilities of what EigenLayer can can create.\n\nYeah, I agree. I think it's, we talk a lot about in in our meetings about making, making Crypto ambitious again. What, how can we, how can we help developers see verifiability as a tool which they can be David to incumbent Goliaths? How can they go compete in new and new ways? I think we've spent a lot of time uh, over the last probably 18 to 24 months talking about the mechanism of EigenLayer and how it technically works underneath the covers with these long white papers, and the the challenge of probably the next 12 months in particular for me is is indexing a bit more on the magic of layer and what you can, what you can build with it.\n\nWell, it's an exciting place to be. JT, Sri Ram, thanks again for for joining me and and sharing everything about EigenCloud.\n\nThank you so much for having us. Cheers.\n\nBank, you guys know the deal. Crypto is risky. You can lose what you put in. But nonetheless, we are headed west. This frontier is not for everyone, but we are glad you're with us on the bank's journey. Thanks a lot.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
