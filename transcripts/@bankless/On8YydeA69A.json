  "cleanText": "Bankless Nation, it is the second week of June. It's time for the Bankless Weekly roll up. We got Stripe buying another crypto company. We also have David, I know you're going to love hearing this. Stablecoin Summer is in full swing. Do you know how many times I've seen Stablecoin Summer on my feed this last week? It was a solid like four times from people all across Crypto Twitter. What can I say? You heard it here first. All right, this is where the narratives are boring. Uh, we got the GENIUS Act votes. We've got Circle pumping. We've got Every Bank in America, it seems like, talking about issuing a stablecoin. And there's a whole bunch of other tokens I think people should pack on Stablecoin Summer. I've got some takes on what that might be. David, I want to hear yours as well. And outside of the world of stablecoins, Polymarket and X have an official partnership, which is probably, I think, one of the most mainstreaming things I've ever heard come out of crypto. So, the Polymarket prediction market directly integrated into Twitter. Uh, and then we also got the SEC chair Paul Atkins saying DeFi is as American as apple pie, which exact quote to my ears. That's incredible. It's also uh the year of the IPO, David, 2025. I think that's what's going to it's going to be remembered by. So, who is next on the IPO list? And finally, we got TRUMP making an unexpected appearance at the Coinbase conference. He has a few words. We're going to share that at the end. Ryan, did you uh so the Limitless podcast where we now do the AI roll-ups? If anyone's curious as to where the AI rollups on Bankless went, it went on to the Limitless podcast. Did you catch that one this morning? Oh, yeah. I catch it every like it's the first thing I do on Thursday mornings. This is the second thing I do, but that's the first thing I listen to it on Spotify. So, people can get it there. They can also get on YouTube. Okay. What's the What's the um the common consensus take about Apple's WWDC that you hear on Twitter? What is it? Everyone is sad about it. Everyone thinks Apple missed the boat on AI completely and they flubbed it. They flubbed the ball. Okay, so one of our hosts, Josh, is a huge Apple fanboy. Has been for years, continues to be. He has a completely contrarian take. You listened to the episode, so I'm already telling you uh he actually thinks that Apple is doing the like high IQ high IQ 40 chess thing. I enjoyed it. I I think that I think the show is fantastic. AI rollup is just like a great way for me to get downloaded on uh AI stuff. And I also heard in that episode, David, you now subscribe to uh the $200 a month Chat GBT plan. I pay $200 a month for Chat GB. That's a lot. That's You're aware that's $2,400 a year, right? You just do the math. Those numbers. I just aped into it cuz you guys told me to. And it's 03 Pro and it's it's good, right? It it takes a long time to think. It takes like multiple minutes to generate an output, but the output is I mean it would have taken me multiple minutes to think that. So, so as you guys were talking about this, I was like, I am not smart enough to actually generate a prompt for a PhD level. Is the quality of the human's input output. That's kind of a problem. If that's a PhD researcher, I don't know how to prompt a PhD level researcher. And so, like what I I posted this on Twitter and people were like, yeah, what you have to do is you have to ask it how to prompt it. And at that point, why am I even here? Yeah, these are the existential questions that we kind of asked a lot on the AI roll up. Anyways, uh so go subscribe to the AI rollup if you just want is Bankless for AI. We cover the weekly news in AI. It's a ton of fun. Easy great hosts. Uh and then we are also looking for a growth manager for Bankless because the AI rollup is doing very well and we need to just hit the gas on that. And so if you are good at growth uh podcast growth, Twitter virality, YouTube virality, we're looking for a growth manager that's both for Limitless and Bankless. There is a link for a human person, a human growth manager, growth marketer, uh, to just help press on the gas on this podcast. Uh, there's a couple other jobs as well. Uh, there are links in the show notes to go check them out as well. Ryan, tell me about price. Yeah. What's the Bitcoin price? Up 2.8% on the week. $107,600. Pretty good. Pretty good. Uh, this last week, the Bitcoin ETF became the fastest ETF ever to break $70 billion. That's BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. Look at this chart, man. That's pretty nuts. That's pretty nuts. This is for for those that can't see, this is IBIT, the BlackRock uh Bitcoin ETF, and it's charted over time since, you know, it was first uh I guess released, and it's comparing to Gold ETF and some of the other big ETFs, and it just hits the uh what was the key number? 70 billion. 70 billion. Yeah, it hits it so much sooner than all these other four times sooner. Granted, this doesn't account for inflation, so there's like, you know, two to three times more dollars out there than there were when those ETFs, but still, it's exciting. Ah, very exciting. Tell me about ETH price in the week. ETH price up 5.6%. So, we're back to another Ryan Sean Adams week where things are up and ETH is up more than Bitcoin. Call that RSA week. $2,738 is where ETH is at this week. Uh but also I think the ETH ETF story is telling some a very interesting story. Uh what what is that story David? That story is about um green positive numbers flows into the Ethereum ETF. This is the Ethereum ETF from July 2024. That's when it was released. Uh the July 23rd 2024 all the way down. See, look at this table. Look, there's a lot of red on this table. And I'm going to keep scrolling down. We see lots of red red. as we're finishing the outflows of the grayscale e trust. Exactly. When it's red, it's outflows. When it's black, it's inflows. And so, let's look at this. Let's look at this like the last, you know, 2, 3 weeks or so. It's all black. It's all inflows. And so, black is black is good. Black is green. Black is green. Yeah. So, black is green. Black is good. We're confusing folks here. The bottom line is we've got a a total of 3.7 billion in net inflows into the Ethereum ETF with some really strong performance over the last couple of weeks, which 18 days in a row of inflows. Yeah, it feels pretty good. I mean, it's like maybe the institutions are kind of changing their mind on uh Ether, the asset. Maybe they're starting to get bullish. What are they seeing that the rest of crypto Twitter isn't? That's what some of the ETH bulls are asking, and I'm among them. There's another there's another metric. Do you remember um Jim Biano used to talk about this which is like the amount of stablecoins and how that is correlated to both uh DeFi token valuations and also valuation of Ether the asset. Uh look at this chart here. How would you describe this chart? Uh we are looking at a two two charts. We are looking at the ETH price overlaid stablecoin supply on Ethereum. I'm guessing that's on Ethereum. Uh and stablecoin supply I mean it it dipped a little bit throughout 2023 2024. that much and it's at all-time highs now. We're coming in at $130 billion. Uh and then ETH price is overlaid on top of that. And I mean ETH price, everyone knows what ETH price has done over the last four, five years. I do not consider these things to be correlated. Those don't look correlated to me. It's it's I mean you you see kind of a bump in the chart, right? And then and then ETH price follows. It's kind of maybe a lagging type thing. Maybe 2021 to 2022. There was very strong correlation, but that's because everything was up in 2021 to 2022. Maybe, maybe. Or maybe stablecoins are just net good for We want ETH to be correlated to stablecoins. It needs to go up. It needs to go up right now. Yeah. Well, uh we're up 5% on the week. I'm Look, I'm staying humble. I'm staying humble this week. I'm not making that mistake I did, uh the week before last when I got allow you to blow yourself up. Nope. Nope. I'm just staying humble. Okay. So, we'll see what happens, David. We just don't know. Uh should we do a quick macro driveby and what's going on in the quote unquote real world? Yeah. Mhm. Um let's talk about the inflation numbers. So inflation rose but less than expected, David. So that surprised some analysts. The uh the forecast was about a rise of 0.3% for CPI and uh 2.9% for core CPI and it came out not not 2.9% but 2.8. That means the annual inflation rate is 2.4%. So it's burning less hot than some people said it would. And of course, JD Vance, the Trump administration took uh no time to do a victory lap on this and call on Fed Powell, chair, Fed Chair Powell to reduce rates. Inflation's not high. You can reduce rates. This is what he said. The president has been saying this for a while, but it's even more clear. The refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice. He said this on the back of the low malpractice. I like those words. I'm going to use that. That's pretty good. I bet he plugged that into chat DBT, David, to get that. So, um, you know, others are saying, \"Look, the forecast is reassuring. Inflation's not as high as we thought, but we haven't seen the tariffs affect these numbers yet, and that is still to come.\" Sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah. The politicization of the Fed chair is, I think, going to be a reoccurring theme throughout the rest of this year. I think there's been a crescendo of like Donald Trump wants somebody else to be the Fed chair, someone who's uh a bit more easy money, a little more lenient, you know, a little more uh submissive, if you will. All all presidents want that, but Trump really really wants that. He's making it very obvious that he wants that. A while ago, we talked about dur during the the tariff media, we talked about the poly market recession indicator, recession odds market, and it got up to as high as 60% during the depths of the tariff scare. Uh it is clocking right now, Ryan, 26%. Which in this that's a recession in 2025. There's a 26% chance of recession 2025. Now granted, uh, we have like 3 months left in 2025 than we last did when we checked in when it was 60%. So, you know, there's 25% for only the last 6 months of the year. Yeah. Uh, but still it's down. It's down. So, no, I mean, poly marketing probably no recession in 2025. Maybe we'll we'll see what 2026 looks like. And, uh, David, you know, last week we talked about the breakup of Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and there was a lot of that drama late last We cut the very beginnings of it, but we ended the roll up right right after right after we ended the roll up kind of dropped that bomb. Yeah. Pedophile. He did call. Well, the relationship seems to be back on this week or at least um it's not as it's not as hot as it it was. Uh this is Elon Musk. I regret some of my posts about President Trump last week. They went too far is what he said. Well, you know, I wouldn't want to go up against the president of the United States either. Uh he's kind of he's kind of the most powerful man that exists right now. Uh so I think this is kind of a logical outcome, especially when Tesla shares got rocked and then have since uh recovered. Um but also I've noticed Donald Trump's just being a very taking a high road on this, right? Like not twisting the kn Yeah, he's not twisting the knife. He didn't fire back. He didn't fire back. Yeah, he didn't he didn't take a victory lap. He I think he like opened his arms. I think yeah they they are making up. Kiss and make up. All right. So I guess the bromance is back on and maybe that's good for assets. It seemed like assets were down uh at the end of last week as a result of the the Trump and Elon breakup. But I don't know. Maybe that's it's all fine. Who knows? Why my coin stock was down because Trump and Elon broke up. I don't know. We got a lot more to talk about in this episode, but there is a a bull tweet that maybe sums up some of the themes right now as we're heading into the summer. What's this? Yeah, this is even happened before the very recent Stripe acquisition of Privy. So, even more of a plus one to what this tweet is trying to say. This says this from Ansom. Appetite for crypto exposure has never been higher. Various entities alongside Sailor buying multi-billion dollars of Bitcoin. Circle IPO 25x overs subscribed 5x on open. Plasma $500 million ICO opened within filled within two minutes. That happened again, by the way. We're going to talk about that in a hot second. Another $500 million got opened up, got filled within 30 minutes. Wow. Uh government pushing act regulatory clarity. I'm just like this has been the sentiment going around crypto twitter this week. People are just saying like appetite for crypto very strong, very high right now. Very good. Why did you include this link, David? What this also came out this morning, just in case you were curious, is like what's going on in trad media, the New York Post put out an article titled, \"How to buy Pepecoin. This is not real.\" And is it a good investment? This is not real. This is real. This is real. This is what the normies are reading. Pepecoin. It's not even a new meme coin. It's like an older one. Yeah. This this feels very uh bull market v\n\n\nIbes. Maybe alarming levels. Hopefully, we're not there yet. Hopefully, we got a ways to go. But uh, what's next in the rollup? All right. All right, coming up next, Ryan's going to talk to us about the Genius Act because we got some in addition to the very bullish appetite coming from Trady. We have very bullish sentiment towards the Genius Act, which is, I think, from I'm going to quote Ryan Sean Adams right before we started recording is going to pass. So hopefully he's not getting too bold about that one. Uh, and then he's also going to talk to us about Stablecoin Summer even more because he just really loves those words. Circle is live on the NYSE. We're going to check in on that. Uh, and we're going to talk about the second order effects of Circle trading at five times its IPO price and holding that price. By the way, before we get to all of that and more, we're going to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible like Uniswap. It's a browser wallet to mobile wallet.

MANTLE, bridging tradi and DeFi so you don't have to. The US Senate is on the cusp of passing the GENIUS Act. This would be the first major crypto legislation coming out of the Senate ever. Goes to the House after that. It'll likely pass there. And it is the first stablecoin bill. This is a senator on the floor showing his support. Senator Bennet. This president's clear that cryptocurrency is here to stay and it's time that we bring it into the mainstream. Passing the GENIUS Act is a good first step. The GENIUS Act would provide a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. It would ensure Americans can trust who they're doing business with when they purchase stablecoins, allowing the American people to exercise financial freedom with confidence. He goes on, he talks about the stablecoin. Financial freedom with confidence, man. Yeah. And this line is great. Like cryptocurrency is here to stay and it's time we bring it to mainstream. And the GENIUS bill is the first step. The first step. You know, I love the nuances. Yeah. It's great. So, what happened this week was there was another vote. I know they have votes before the votes before the votes. This is not the final vote. The final vote will probably happen next week. But basically, because this passed in the way it did, 68 votes in favor to 30 against, it means it's pretty much certain that the GENIUS Act will get passed the Senate next week when they hold the final vote. So, uh, I'm expecting that Elizabeth Warren crossed arms meme to be passed around crypto Twitter quite frequently next week. Yeah, I think so. And she had some things to say. We we should just actually before we get to her, we should recap what's in the GENIUS Bill cuz this is probably going to be the law of the land after it gets through the House. Um and like it's it looks likely it's will get through the house as well. Uh the the first is this there are reserve requirements. So every um stablecoin must be matched with one-to-one cash reserves in the bank. Right? So these are all uh fully collateralized stablecoins. Um another thing the issuer eligibility. So who can actually issue stablecoins under this act? Any bank that's regulated can do this. Any credit union can do this. And so, you know, we've been noticing, we haven't really covered it in the rollup, but we've been noticing almost like every bank is like, \"Oh, we're doing a stablecoin.\" I saw like one from uh Bank of America this week, just we're doing a SC stablecoin. It's because now they have the legal ability to do it under the GENIUS Act. So, they're just trying to get ahead of that a little bit. Importantly, tech platforms, tech companies, Apple, Amazon cannot. They are specifically barred from issuing stablecoins. Yes. And that was uh something that Elizabeth Warren wanted to make sure happened and and she got her way on that one. But uh crypto and fintech firms can also issue stablecoins. It's not just banks and credit unions. What they do need though is a brand new OC license. Okay. The licensing for stablecoins before this was like really weird. It was state by state. It was really, you know, crappy and confusing. And now all they need is this brand new OC license. Uh there's also a state route as well, but that only is capped to uh $10 billion. Now, the thing I was really worried about in any stablecoin legislation, David, was AML KYC. All right. It's like, were they going to do a thing where you couldn't send uh stablecoins from wallet one wallet to another non-custodial wallet without doing some sort of AML KYC uh check? This is like some of the legislation going on in Europe. So, this this was kind of a sticking point for the bill. Of course, there were many folks, Elizabeth Warren, who wanted additional increased AML KYC. And where they finally landed on this is basically where we are now, that the issuers of the stablecoin would have full AML KYC rule set as they basically do today. So that means customer identification, right? If you're holding a stablecoin on an exchange, they need to know your ID, who you are. It needs to be, you know, government issued license. They're doing the the SARS report under the Bank Secrecy Act. So, if there's anything suspicious, they they file a SARS report. They're doing sanction screening, all of this. But we have preserved our ability to move assets from one non-custodial wallet to another without any additional AML KYC and importantly from a custodial wallet to a non-custodial wallet, which is unlike Europe because there are currently KYC restrictions on that right now, I believe. So, I mean, I'm not sure with kind of the latest that's going on, but that at least has been discussed. And that was my nightmare scenario for any stablecoin legislation that they would try to AML KYC everything onchain, everything in DeFi. Looks like we've basically preserved kind of the the rights that we have today, which is fantastic. Yeah, it's worth noting that that was actually a pretty big fight to to fight and stablecoins is one of those big like ask for forgiveness things where it moved because of the technology, the Overton window was moved. So like the coralate before stablecoins came out was like PayPal, right? Well, I had I had PayPal bucks in my PayPal account and if I wanted to send it to Ryan, Ryan would need to make a PayPal account and then give him his PayPal his ID. With stablecoins, that technology enabled me to send Ryan USDC without him signing up for the Circle platform. Exactly. And so that was outside of the law. That was a legal gray area that we did not know. Even though it makes intuitive sense for all people who got into crypto, it's like, \"Oh yeah, I'll send you USC. You don't need to sign up. That's great. That's good UX, but that was outside of like regulatory certainty up until right now, which is pretty cool.\" Yeah. Um, so there were 30 senators who voted no on this. Most of those were Democrats. You can, as you can guess, Elizabeth Warren was one of them. Also, Chuck Schumer, uh, Amy Kubashar, those are some names that you might recognize. They also voted no. Some of the reasons of course like Elizabeth Warren wanted far stricter AML KYC. She said like North Korea uses this stuff. You know, stablecoins are used for scams. So like we basically she wanted to kind of regulate it very tightly almost regulated out of existence. But there were other Democrats who uh said things like this should be issuing crypto while they're in office or a vice president. There's no reason any person on this floor should do it or anybody in the House of Representatives should do it. and now in a partially regulated regime. So this was Senator Bennet basically saying that, you know, I want an amendment on this bill that says vice presidents, presidents, members of Congress can't issue these stablecoins or other crypto assets. So this is a shot uh at World Liberty Financial. It's a shot at TRUMPcoin. You could kind of understand members of Congress. I don't have a problem with that. I mean, that piece of the amendment I'm like I agree with. That's great. Give give them that compromise so that we can get more Democrats to sign. Well, uh it was already signed overwhelming majority without that amendment. So, it looks like that amendment's not going forward. But you can understand Yeah, you can understand the rationale for why it was wanted. So, presidents can issue stablecoins. Yes, they can. And they are, David. They actually are. Wow. Okay. All right. Okay. So, uh the final passage will happen on Monday. Monday is the vote. Uh, so I think that is the day to tune in to this. It could bleed into Tuesday. Okay. All right. And on Tuesday, we have Senator Bill Hagerty on the podcast who's going going to be giving us an update hopefully with some good news about the passage of this bill. And uh then it goes to the House. Of course, if all goes well, this whole thing could get done by the third week of July. Could be on Trump's desk. He of course would sign it. If it doesn't go so well, it could be August or September if there's some fighting in the House. That kind of thing. Third week of July. That's six weeks away. That's soon. This is soon. We've been How long have we been waiting for this thing, David? I've been patient. Years. It's been years. Six weeks. That's it. So long as So long as Ryan Sean Adams says it's going to pass. It's going to pass and we're going to get it during the summer. Okay. Which is because of stablecoins and that's what stablecoins. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Uh there there is another bill actually I wanted to mention to you too that I've been kind of monitoring but I haven't gone deep on. We've talked about this before. That's the Clarity Act. And so this is sort of what's a what's the difference between a commodity and a security when it comes to tokens. The House is a House bill. They're trying to provide clarity for this. This is the market structure bill. Stablecoin bill. Yes. It used to be called FIT, you know, 21. Now it's called the Clarity Act. It's kind of a revision to it. But it it has a moderate, you know, chance of passing. It's not going to pass before the stablecoin bill. They're still kind of debating it. Needs to get through committee. But this is the most interesting piece of it actually. There is a a decentralization test right now in the bill. Okay, I think that's the most fascinating part. That's gonna be a big deal because there's going to be layer ones that pass or fail this test. And there are also going to be layer ones that are going to need to spend a lot of lobbying effort to make sure that their particular layer 1 passes that test. Uh-huh. And this is a core part of the bill. It's not something that will be um you're stripped out at least the concept of a decentralization test because it's providing a bright line right so if you're on one side of the line you're a commodity you're decentralized if you're on the other side of the line you're a security you are not want to be on the other side of that line yeah so I plug the text of the bill into chat GPT and there there's a few things there's a few criteria for being on the decentralized side of the line and being a um deemed a commodity the the mainet has to be functional and live can't you know it can't be in beta has to be like mostly done um there has to be program uh programmatic operations so everything is you know enforced by code no off-chain discretion uh this is interesting distribute uh distributed ownership so insiders can't own more than 20% of the supply huh it's wonder how they define insiders right and they also have uh governance li limits so no one coordinated group can unilater ally change consensus or command greater than 20% of the onchain voting power. Feel like that's a pretty stringent that's a pretty high bar. Well, so if you run it through like chat GPT and you know chat GPT who knows how it defines this, but it says it's likely if if this were the criteria that gets in the finalized bill, it's likely that Bitcoin, ETH, Monero, Litecoins, these OG things pass because by the way, if your if your asset was 2020 or before, some different rules kind\n\n\nOkay. So there's some different provisions. What flunks right now, according to Chad GBT? XRP would flunk. BNB would flunk. Yeah. Tron, Apto, and Sui would flunk out would flunk. Oh, that to me, that is the big line. Is the line before or after Solana? Okay. I think, I think it's like there's a Bitcoin, Ethereum. Those two things are pretty easy to clump together. Sure. Then there's a line there, and then there's a like a bunch of the other ones that you also mentioned, like Monero, pretty decentralized. Then there's, there's a bunch of those, and then there's, then there's like a space for another line before Solana, and then, and then Solana, to its credit, has some amount of decentralization, and then there's a line after Solana, which follows like Sui, Aptos, like it's going to be Monad, like all of those, right? And those are the layer ones, right? But there's also DeFi tokens, too. How about Uni? How about A? How about Dydx? Oh, interesting, under the criteria, they don't pass either.\n\nUh, okay. Well, yeah, it makes sense to me that like Uni and A are not commodities. That makes sense to me. Well, if they're not commodities, are they securities? I don't, I don't feel comfortable with that, right? You can't file a 10K for something that's all onchain revenue, like, like A or Uniswap. I do not envy anyone who has to deal with this. They're getting into the specific. They're getting into the specifics of defining decentralization.\n\nOkay, so I was talking to Austin Campbell a while ago at Blockwork Works, the digital asset summit. He thinks that the market structure bill, the clarity bill, is too ambitious. It's going to get uh, bike shedded. It's going to get argued all the hell, and it's going to get unbundled because it's just too big. That was his take. So we won't have the bright line decentralization test at all, cuz it's too messy. It's too hairy. There's too many vested interests. Maybe we do, but it will get like unbundled and argued inside of its own bill and then other other parts of the market structure bill, because this isn't the only thing about the bill. There are other parts of this bill. So, the bill just gets like kind of unbundled and like passed separately. That's what he thinks. That's definitely one to watch because the Sprite Line decentralization test would shake things up in a big way.\n\nUm, David, let's check in on Circle. So, this is the stablecoin summit leader asset. Okay. What's uh, what's the price of Circle in the week? Yeah. So, let's see. Over or under $100. Bankless listener, place your bets while Ryan figures out how to get Alex Honold out of Trading View. We are coming in at what is it? Under $110? $110, which is $25 billion. So, Circle is holding the line. Holding the line at a pretty, pretty juicy valuation. Still 31, still 3 to 4x times its uh, IPO price. Uh, and so the longer that it stays here, the more stablecoin summary it is. And I feel like that's the rule. You know what's funny is I don't think crypto natives are buying Circle.\n\nThere's no way. We talked about this last week. Like the $120 million of yearly revenue to justify a $25 billion valuation. If it's not us, who's buying it?\n\nTry looking for a stablecoin. Well, because you said it, like every single bank is like trying to do a stablecoin, and then there are investors like, \"Oh, stablecoins are hot. How do I get stablecoin exposure?\" You can't get stablecoin exposure via Coinbase because it's too muddy. Like they got an exchange, and they got a LAYER 2, and they got all these other things. Circle is just stablecoins. And so like to me, I see all, when I see Circle at $25 billion, I see people are people are aping in, people are not thinking. People are trying to buy a narrative, and Circle is the only way to express that narrative.\n\nUh, yeah, I see, I see froth when I see this. Okay. But, but, but what's interesting about that is the people that are doing this, the people are buying into this, uh, like in your words, they're not our people. They're not us, right? You know what I mean? What's exciting about it is it's kind of a new cohort of buyers. It's not people in crypto Twitter. This is the institutions that are FOMOing into this asset, which in of itself is interesting. This is Mike Ippolito. He says, \"Circle is a great example of price leading narrative. Two weeks ago, Circle was on its deathbed. Today, my timeline thinks it's better is a better buy than coin.\" He's speaking about basically the crypto Twitter bubble of which we are probably in as well. Yeah. I was talking about this with Brett and John on the on the rollups, like are is crypto Twitter right in their bearishness about Circle, because we, we know the, the, the actual like fundamentals, and Wall Street is just like top blasting this thing that's clearly overvalued, or are we just so disconnected from Wall Street and Wall Street appetite? And it's like, well, right now crypto Twitter's wrong because Circle's 5x current the IPO price or whatever. I just, I think crypto natives are going to FOMO into things that like appeal to them and appeal to their narratives, and institutions are going to FOMO into things that appeal to their narratives. Uh, one of those is Kathy Wood, Arc Invest. So she purchased 4.48 million Circle across, she didn't FOMO in, she bought the IPO. So she is up like 3, 4x because she bought the IPO. She's not, she's not top last. Yeah. On the uh, on the analyst side, some analysts are cautious. Market cap of 22 billion. Circle is selling at 140x earnings. 140x, that's less than Tesla. What is Tesla? 1080.\n\nAlso a big, I guess buying Tesla's worked out. Yeah. Others say the intelligent investor should just wait for like 90 to 180 days. Wait for this thing to cool down post right now. Yeah. Don't maybe don't buy it during Stablecoin Summer.\n\nUm, but that um, lends the question to like, are there other assets that are doing well on the stablecoin narrative? And I think the answer to that question is yes. And some of them are cryptonative assets. So, I uh, put out this tweet because I was just, you know, brainstorming. I didn't actually pack my bags for Stablecoin Summer. You know, you talking about packing your bags. I've previously owned some of these assets and just like they've been long-term holds. Not all of them, but like uh, many of them. But, um, packing my bags for Stablecoin Summer. What do you buy? What do you buy for Stablecoin Summer? A is doing quite well uh, recently. Kind of like market for DeFi. Maybe because of the GO stablecoin. Maybe people are just looking at the assets in a, you know, surpassing what is it? $50 billion and just being like, okay, we're in the clear. Uh, Maker, now called Sky Athena, doing quite well. FRAX doing quite well. Maybe there's a play for Ether. Maybe that's why some of the institutions are buying that ETH ETF. David, maybe that's why ETH is up on the week. Some people uh, are saying like Tron could be a good buy under these circumstances. I'm looking at all these charts one by one as you say them. None of them are Oh, Tron. Just kidding. Tron's doing great. Uh, yeah. Uh, but none of them, other than than Tron, are really expressing any sort of like anything about Circle doing well, and Tron has been doing well for a while. So it just continues to do well. A seems to be like just crushing it recently. Yeah, that's true. But also the GO stablecoin is only at $220 million.\n\nYeah. I, I don't know. What do you think about this? Do you think this is a a play for people? I think this is much more of IPO season than onchain stablecoin related assets season, like Athena, A, like none of them are responding, like I just said, none of them are responding to the Circle price, and so I think it's much more of just like, can we go public? And then I would also like to see like Kraken and Gemini go public and see where they get comped to, because I think their appetite for going public is downstream of Circle launching at like a 4x IPO price, but they're going to get comped to Coinbase, not Circle, man. I don't know. I think we could see some uh, animal spirits in Stablecoin Summer narrative uh, onchain assets as well. I mean, explain this one. So this is Plasma uh, doing an ICO on Kobe's echo platform, right? Plasma, kind of plasma. Okay. Plasma is a tether-based payments chain, is a LAYER 1 that is going to be optimized for payments. It's like, you know how like Tron is like 99% stablecoin activity, but Tron, Tron fees right now are like $4 to $7 for a transaction. So that's not great. So Plasma is making a layer one that's dedicated for Tether, for Tron, or excuse me, for, for yeah, Tether. Uh, and so it's a payments layer one that's just, just for payments for, for Tether. So it's kind of centralized, but it's super juiced. It also has some kind of Bitcoin minor settlement to the Bitcoin blockchain the way STAX does. Interesting. Oh yeah, they're trying to do, they're trying to be some like BitPM extension. That's more of a a cherry on top, I would say, for what it is right now. Right now, people are just trying to get like, well, Circle is coming in at $25 billion, but I'd like to get exposure to Tether, which is like so much time, many times bigger than Tether than Circle, and so Plasma is uh, kind of like incubated by Tether. They had their first initial checks cut by Tether, and they're not the other, the only ones. There are others as well. Uh, but it, their timing of this uh, sale, and again, this deposit cap wasn't a sale. The deposit cap was people depositing Tether onto the Plasma chain, and there's like waiting room once Plasma chain goes live, and then when Plasma chain goes live, it'll have $1 billion of people's deposits, their Tether deposits on the Plasma chain. So it'll start with a billion dollars of of Tether TVL to kind of bootstrap itself, and the people that are deposited will have a right to access the ICO. So, it's like uh, you are buying a ticket. You're not, you're not actually selling anything because you're not buying any ticket, but you're, you're reserving your right to buy into the pre-sale by depositing Tether into the Plasma chain. And the appetite for this has been incredibly high. They first started with like a 200, $250 million cap, got filled in instant in an instant. They raised it again to 500 million. They raised it again to a billion dollars just this morning. It just got filled instantly. And so people are looking towards Plasma as like a way, a more cryptonative way to get Stablecoin Summer exposure. It's fascinating, right? Like just to, just, just to see that kind of the, the animal spirits uh, jump into this. And the construction here is very interesting. It's got some pieces of Ethereum too. It's like Plasma wreath under the covers. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. So obviously we don't know. I mean, is this more narrative play in the short run, or does a Plasma just dedicated LAYER 1 for Tether actually make sense? Uh, I guess we'll have to see on that, but there, there are some other. So, I mean, that to me is animal spirits and kind of like cryptonative assets around this narrative. We'll, we'll, we'll see if it picks up in other areas, but there's this is certainly going to be the year of crypto IPOs to your point. So, you mentioned one too.\n\nWell, I mean, I think we're already seeing it, right? Like we've, we've seen, I guess Galaxy, we've seen one, we've seen Gemini file to go public. They filed their S1 or whatever. S1. Uh, yes. Yeah. So Gemini just crypto from Gemini confidentially files for US IPO confidentially. They're going next. Uh, what do you think that valuation's going to be? Um, I don't know many people who use Gemini still in 2021. Gemini raised at a uh, a $7.1 billion valuation. Yeah. Well, in in OpenC raised at a 12 billion valuation. Over or under on that? And that was before, by the way, Gemini got rocked by the whole Gemini earn thing with like, you know, I don't know. I don't know the financials, but I'm going under on 7 billion. Okay. I mean, there's some other names here, which is like Kraken could IPO. They've not filed paperwork, but you know, that's uh, something they've been wanting to do that for a while. Um, going public. Yeah. Phantom wallet was also mentioned. Really? Which would be fascinating, I think. Really? Yeah. Could be fascinating. Could be possible. Seems odd. I mean, if you're going to IPO though, 2025 is the year. I mean, I've successive Circle, every other people have named Chain Analysis, uh, Anchorage, um, there's a few other companies. Yeah. But like, oh, there's, it's also, we're going to talk about in a hot sec. There's a very hot mergers and acquisition uh, timeline right now. Not mergers, just acquisitions. Um, overall, there's just like a lot of a lot of money changing hands. Yeah. So, what are we going to talk about next?\n\nComing up next, Polymarket fully integrated into Twitter into X. Uh, so we're going to talk about what that means. Stripe, the thing that I just mentioned, Stripe buys a crypto company. And then also SEC chair Paul Atkins, the anti Gary Gendler. He's writing to support the right of Americans to self custody in DeFi. Wow. That's God, that feels so good. Progressive. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to talk about all that and more, but first, we're going to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, like FRAX, the stablecoin in celebration of Stablecoin Summer.

No hacked databases, no unnecessary personal exposure for airdrops, and no AI bots ruining community governance. Meet Self, the onchain identity verification protocol built for privacy and control. Self protocol uses zero knowledge proofs to confirm your identity safely. Users prove key details like age or citizenship without revealing sensitive personal information. Self never stores your data. It only generates cryptographic proofs. Here's how it works in three steps. First, register and verify. Use the self app to scan your biometric passport's RFID chip. Self-verifies authenticity with zero knowledge proofs. Each passport creates one unique identity. Second, you can share proofs privately. Third party apps request identity proofs like confirming you're over 18. You can also link proofs securely to public wallets for airdrops or governance participation. And then last, secure verification. Apps validate your proofs instantly onchain like on Cello or offchain. Audited by ZK security. The self app is live on iOS and Play Store. Visit self.xyz and follow self protocol on X. Breaking as of this week. This happened on Wednesday. Stripe has announced that they are acquiring Privy. So, Stripe, the payments company, is acquiring Privy, the good UX embedded wallets infrastructure company, backend infrastructure company. So, Privy just makes it really easy for people who download an app to get a wallet that's native into the app automatically without having to do any seed phrases and all that stuff. Non-custodial wallet, right? Non-custodial. Yeah, that's right. And so if you ever use friend, that was enabled by privy. There are a bunch of just applications that you might not even know are enabled by privy. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. The Bankerbot people on Twitter would like everyone to know that they are enabled by Privy as well. Bankerbot is this thing you can just at on Twitter and you have a you have a as a Twitter account, you have a wallet, really buy by buy this application called Bankerbot and it uses Privy and so you can just gobankerbot and if you don't have a wallet yet, it'll give you one. I mean, that's impressive. That shows how easy it is to actually like spin up a non-custodial wallet using Privy. Yeah, exactly. Uh yeah. So, everyone on Twitter has a a Ethereum wallet thanks to Bankerbot. You just add it and it's like and you have to add money to it obviously, but you can just like tell it to buy. It's a it's a one of those like AI things. So, it has to it interprets what you want and it interprets your intent and you can go buy me this like shitcoin and it'll take the funds in your wallet and go buy it. It's pretty fun. And anyways, acquired by Stripe. So, details undisclosed. So, I wish I kind of knew the the actual valuation that they bought it for, but um I mean six or seven to eight million businesses use Stripe. Everybody uses Stripe. And so, I don't know if they were just like using Privy just to integrate their wallet infrastructure straight into Stripe would make sense. Um pretty big pretty big acquisition. Apparently, Privy has about 75 million accounts. So, that's probably 75 million non-custodial wallets that spun up over time. I mean some of these will have very small dollar amounts but um you know seven to eight million businesses in stripe. This is the non-custodial wallet infrastructure API SDK play. Remember was it was it earlier this year or was it last year David? When did they buy Bridge? They brought bridge this year, right? This year. Yeah. Okay. And so Bridge was basically a um a stable coin play. So, Bridge has its own stable coin and it enables companies to create stable coins with reserves in US treasuries and it handles all the compliance and regulatory stuff. And since they acquired Bridge, they've really expanded it. So, Bridge now active in 101 countries through Stripe and allows people to hold balances in in stable coins like USDC and their own Bridge stable coin. So, you got non-custodial wallets, you got bridge, you got bridge level stable coin stuff. It seems like Stripe is like just going all in to stable coins. Yeah, it really doesn't take a big imagination to put those two things together. That's wild. Uh, okay. What's happening with Poly Market? Speaking of imagination. Yeah, so I also want to start to actually see this roll out, please. Uh, but they announced X and XAI. So, this is a this has been a theme that has been brewing around the media space where I mean I think kicked off by poly market. I think everyone in crypto was talking about post election they that they were watching the TV watching the news but they were really watching poly market report the news way faster. Uh and so media companies of which we would be familiar are all talking about there's something about prediction markets and markets generally that need to be integrated into news sites and I think this is downstream of that. So Twitter and Poly Market X and Poly Market formally integrated. So you're going to be able to just see poly market things on Twitter and I would imag some sort of outcome and be like buy sell express some bet on that outcome pretty natively in Twitter. I don't know how that would work, but details will come out, I'm assuming, over the time. And so pretty pretty crazy partnership from maybe with like a privy wallet inside of Twitter, right? Within reason. Yeah. Um X already uses Stripe um like under the covers as well. So maybe that's something that you know they could do right now. You can also see Grock in the poly market UI. So I think that's happening too. And so in the poly market UI on the poly market side of things if you have a question about a certain you know prediction market so what are the odds of us tell me more about this prediction market then Grock is right there to tell you more too. It it really makes sense like the AI plus X citizen news plus prediction market team up. It's like um pretty good synergies here. Yeah. Yeah. Shane Coplin the CEO of Poly Market tweeted the top two truth seeking apps on the internet are stronger together. It's pretty pretty good synthesis I would say. Yeah, I like that. Um, David, tell me about Morpho Labs because according to you, they are doing the whole DeFi token thing, right? Tell me what they're doing. Yeah, so they've always done this pretty well. Maybe I'll start with that or something slightly unrelated but definitely related. Did you know that all the Morpho founders when they started Morpho, they all signed a contract with each other to not angel invest and not advise other companies? I don't know how long that contract like stands for, but yeah, they're like, &quot;Yeah, we're not going to get distracted by anything else.&quot; No distractions. No divided loyalties. No divided loyalties, just Morpho. No one's going to we're not going to use our position as Morpho execs to gain access to exposure. Just morpho. And so down in spirit of that, uh, they have always been pursuing this idea of just like this single asset to control an or morpho. I think this is full alignment. This is in like kind of contrast to the equity uh token split that we see at Uniswap Labs versus the Uni token. There's just misaligned incentives there. And like I'm not going like people love to harp on UNIS swap for this. They were born inside of the Gary Gendler era. That is downstream of that environment. I'm not really blaming them at all. It's unfortunate. It is what it is. There's no malpractice there. Uh, Morpho is was not well they they were created in in um the Gary Gendzor environment but really at the tail end of it but but the the unis swap example shows divided incentives right because there's unis swap labs with separate kind of equity separate set of holders and they're optimizing things for unis swap labs right and then there's the unis swap token which is the uni token which some some people feel like it gets kind of the leftovers it's not fully aligned at least with everything that labs produce yeah it doesn't have a big voice it doesn't have unis swap Labs is not advocating for the uni token and so the front-end fees and unis swap.com is owned by unis swap labs and the unis swap.com fees goes to unis swap labs uh and then the token holders are like but what about us and so there's no like strong leadership that's like advocating for the uni token holder specifically and so again this like a byproduct of the Gary Gendler you can you can blame Gary Gendler for that I totally I'm happy to yeah uh Morpho built just later like a couple couple years later after really um it was like started like two three three years ago. Uh there's only one asset for Morpho. There's just the Morpho token and they made a blog post around around this which is like really trying to focus on just like there the Morpho Labs entity is owned by a structure that is controlled by the token. Uh which is pretty cool. Pretty cool. So no equity uh alignment issues. Uh and then also they also released Morpho V2. Uh, so there's a second version of Morpho coming out on the back of this, which it's not technically correct, but like think about it as like an order book for loans. So you have buy you have bids and asks for loan terms and then they have like kind of a kind of a matching engine. Again, these things aren't technically true, but they're meaning they're directionally true. Uh, and so they're just and there's like a lot of modules here. So KYC and compliance so that institutions can come in uh just like a lot more expressive features in Morpho. I think this is this is about more than morpho, right? It's about sort of uh converting our DeFi tokens from sort of you know lemons with divided loyalties into sort of you know unified uh aligned like assets that you want to hold to get all of the upside of both the initial product and the protocol and any other product or protocol that the team spins out the way the way you get with equities. You sent me that uh a link to a presentation of a bankless guest that you had on the podcast when I was out Felipe from Thea Capital. Mhm. And his point was he he called like existing a lot of existing DeFi tokens sort of like lemons, right? They're they're sort of they're sort of neutered. They they don't have, you know, like the the full alignment that equities have. And so, I mean, he made the point that if um if like something like Amazon spun out a different, you know, token, essentially, a different equity asset for every business it created, right? AWS token. Uh imagine that. Amazon Fresh token. Yeah. Yeah. What would you invest in? How how would you get Amazon exposure? How would you exactly? There would be like an Amazon book token and then when it expands you have different equity for every single thing. That's not the way equities work. The way they work is kind of compounding gains from the successful product launch of two, three, four, and five. Anyway, our DeFi tokens don't quite work like that and he wants them to. So, I guess Morphosuk is a good example of, you know, something Felipe would uh approve of. Yeah. And again, a lot of this is downstream of the SEC. Uh, and the reasons why we can't have nice things is because of the SEC. Which brings us to talking about Paul Atkins and the SEC. What happened with Paul Atkins this week? Uh, he said some pretty bullish things about DeFi. So, uh, he said this, DeFi, this was a speech title, DeFi and the American spirit. Okay. Um he said this, &quot;The American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of DeFi or decentralized finance.&quot; The movement pri the prior administration, we know who he's talking about, discouraged Americans from participating in blockchains by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threaten threatened regulatory action that participants and staking as a service providers may be engaged in securities transactions. And he goes on basically he's going to stop all of that. But think of that line, David. The American values of economic liberty, private property, and innovation are in the DNA of DeFi. That sounds like something straight out of bank list like circa 2020. Yeah. I mean, this is the chair of the SEC saying this. This is pretty cool. Um, I did wish he would say the privacy word.\nI don't think he I don't think I heard one step at a time. One step at a time. But think of, okay, this is a complete 180 from Gary Gensler. Totally. Around this time last year, do you remember the whole SAB, you know, like 121 where the SEC led by Gary Gendler was trying to sneak an obscure accounting rule to stop banks from custoing crypto. This had to go to the Senate. The Senate voted said this was like you can't do this. SEC doesn't have the authority. And then Biden vetoed it. That's what we were dealing with 365 days ago. Biden's going to pivot. He's not he's going to not veto it. And then he totally vetoed it. He totally vetoed it. And loser. It is a complete is a completely different world. And so this this speech by the way was given at a panelist kind of a or sorry a panel a round table. So Jill Gunter was there. Um Peter van Vulcanberg from Coin Center, Eric V\n\n\nOrhees was there and also Paul Atkins, Hester Pur, Caroline Krenshaw.\nSo that's they're talking about it.\nAnd I know David, you've had questions about like what is the SEC actually doing?\nSo it's nice to hear the speeches certainly, but um what are they doing?\nSo one of the things they're doing are hosting roundtables on tokenization and DeFi.\nSo they're talking about this stuff with crypto industry leaders.\nSo something we asked for that is action.\nAlso they're rolling out FAQ sheets on crypto.\nSo they're giving more clarity to the extent they can.\nI know um uh they have talked about and we've talked about this on the roll up.\nThey've signaled carveouts for regulatory ATS's, right?\nSo these are brokers that can spotless Bitcoin and Ether.\nSo like merging together the ATS kind of regulation in crypto.\nAnd I think what we can expect next is some more proposed uh rulem around Hester P's, you know, innovation sandbox idea.\nSo when crypto projects start, they're not automatically securities.\nI think they'll do more around token classification rules.\nSo we'll get some more clarity that way.\nAnd ultimately I think they'll give their take independent of the clarity act.\nThey'll give their take on which assets are securities and which are like free to trade like commodities.\nSo I think we can expect to see a lot more clarity out of this SEC.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd which is not to say that like I'm disappointed with the progress from the SEC.\nThat's not true at all.\nI know that is a very unwieldly herball of BS that like Hester Pur has been delivered from previous the previous administration.\nUh and so it's just I yeah I just want all things to happen like now and like immediately and I know it just doesn't work that way.\nUh anyone who I've ever talked to who has like interfaced with Hester is like uh they are just doing exactly what we wanted them to finally.\nUm but also at the same time I'm like okay let's let's actually put pen to paper and like do something.\nYeah.\nWell uh Donald Trump is doing something David and so is uh the World Liberty Financial.\nI'm relieved.\nSo there was news this week that World Liberty Financial was acquiring Trump the memecoin for its treasury.\nSo of course they hold other crypto assets.\nI think a is in in their treasury as well as Ether and now also Trump.\nSo uh any hot takes on this?\nTrump's World Liberty financial defy app is acquiring Trump's memecoin.\nYes.\nTo me it just reads like he's taking pocket money from one pocket and putting it in a different pocket.\nI just don't think this helps us right now.\nNo, no.\nAll of this stuff is a deal with the devil.\nYeah.\nUh it it definitely doesn't help us.\nI guess I mean we talked about this.\nWe I feel like we talk about this every week.\nIt's it's a lot better than the previous administration.\nA lot better than the previous administration.\nI wish he stopped at NFTs.\nNFTs were fine.\nNothing wrong with the NFTs, but memecoin, world delivery financial, their incoming stable coin, it's it gets really hard to defend.\nWell, uh I guess we'll have to end it there.\nIt is good to have a bullish uh crypto.\nLook at that tree.\nLook at that tree right below.\nWhat do you say?\nTrump shaking hands with Trump.\nSigned by Trump.\nThat's great.\nYeah.\nUm I think we'll have to end it there for the week.\nI mean, bullishness.\nI think we're in bullish season for sure.\nUh oh, by the way, um we have a moment of Zen.\nI believe we'll include this in the moment of Zen.\nSo, President Trump actually unexpectedly, at least I didn't expect it, showed up at a Coinbase conference.\nSo, we'll play you a snippet from his speech cuz he gave a speech, but think of this.\nThe president of the United States attending a Coinbase conference and saying some positive words on crypto.\nThat's where we are in 2025.\nWe'll leave it there.\nOf course, you know, none of this has been financial advice.\nCrypto is risky.\nYou could lose what you put in.\nWe are headed west.\nThis is the frontier.\nIt's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.\nThanks a lot one.\nAt the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit, I'm delighted to speak to some of the greatest visionaries and pioneers in the fields of tech and finance who are working to build a future powered by crypto.\nMany have called me the first crypto president.\nThat's an honor.\nI really do consider that a very big honor actually.\nAnd starting on day one, we ended the Biden administration's war on crypto.\nIt was an absolute war and very unfair.\nAnd we unleashed American innovators to do what you do best, lead the world into new frontiers.\nWe ended operation chokepoint 2.0.\nI created the first presidential working group on digital assets.\nI named a pro- freedom, pro- innovation SEC chair, a great man named Paul Atkins.\nAnd we created the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and the United States digital asset stockpile.\nBut we are not done yet.\nMy administration is working with Congress to pass the Genius Act supporting the creation of dollarbacked stable coins.\nAnd we also will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.\nCongratulations to everyone at this exciting time in your industry and in our country's life.\nI wish you all the best of luck.\n",
