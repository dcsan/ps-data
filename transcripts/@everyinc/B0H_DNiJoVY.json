  "cleanText": "I have OCD. And it was a mess for me to even figure that out. It took like 10 years, and I went to a bunch of different therapists. Eventually, I was just reading a bunch of stuff and I was like, I think I have OCD. In my own clinical practice, one of the diagnoses that seems to have been missed by other clinicians a lot is obsessive-compulsive disorder. OCD, as far as we know, it's not one thing. In fact, even from a symptom standpoint, it has fuzzy boundaries. So we have to respect that heterogeneity. But it offers us a certain descriptive potential. We can talk about it. We can identify it. We can use it for guiding treatment. Um, and so this would be a good example of something that's very helpful pragmatically. It's an entity that exists from a pragmatic point of view, but not from an essentialistic point of view. There's a lot of pressure to be able to reduce these things down into a checklist. Right. One of the things you're saying is, yeah, you can do the checklist, but really a good clinician has a little bit of like a smell for it, observing clinicians and then reducing how they operate to diagnostic rules. That's exactly how machine learning researchers started in AI, and it's exactly what didn't work. What ended up working is deep learning.\n\nAwais Aftab, welcome to the show. Thanks, Dan. I'm I'm happy to be here. Happy to have you. So for people who don't know you, you are a Psychiatrist. Um, you're also the Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University and the editor of *Conversations in Critical Psychiatry*. And for people who are listening who were watching who are like, why are you on AI? I promise there's an explanation. Um, in in particular, for anyone who's been a listener of the show for a while, I've been really obsessed with how AI might change science and and and in particular how it might change psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, um, more complex areas of science where science has historically struggled. Um, and um, while you don't write specifically about AI, um, I I've been reading your Substack for a while, and we'll link to the Substack in the show notes.\n\nUm, and I love it and I love your perspective, and I just feel like there's a lot of overlap in some of the things that we've been thinking about, and I I wanted to understand more about your ideas and then and talk through some of the AI stuff and see if you think I'm crazy or not. That that sounds great. Um, cool. So I think one of the if I had to like pinpoint one of the things that I like most about your work is I think most people who work in psychology or psychiatry doing research um want to come up with a single theory that's like depression is anger turned inward or you know uh it's uh serotonin imbalance or it's this or it's that. I think those kinds of single theories are are are quite valuable. I think they're they're uh it's it's the intellectual lineage of them which we can sort of trace back to like physics and stuff makes a lot of sense, but they haven't worked that well in uh in the domains that you care about and the domains that I care about. Um, and I think you you tend to advocate for something called explanatory pluralism. Um, so the idea that when we're when we're working in a domain like psychiatry uh you have to bring to bear multiple different perspectives to to really get a sense for the thing that you're trying to understand.\n\nCan you like unpack that a little bit more for us? Yes. Yeah. And um uh you know, I'm glad to hear that that this is this is an idea that has resonated with with with you uh quite a bit. Um, and what one of the things that I've been trying to do is is to promote more pluralistic thinking in in psychiatry and and and clinical psychology. And I I think that there are there are two ways we can we can understand you know this idea of pluralistic kind of thinking. Um, one one is is kind of, you know, takes inspiration from this general philosophical attitude, what we call scientific pluralism, that that things can be explained um, you know, even within the realm of science through a variety of different theoretical perspectives that rely on different assumptions, different background kind of ideas. And that that each perspective might offer certain theoretical advantages or empirical advantages, but there isn't necessarily one single correct true perspective, but but things are multifaceted, and and that multifaceted nature is not captured by one theoretical um kind of perspective. And this applies particularly in situations where phenomena do not possess a singular essence. When when when something you know possesses a hidden property that makes it what what what it is kind of often identifying that essence is the single best way of characterizing that. I mean, I think a good example of that would be the periodic table of elements in chemistry. You know, it captures something really very real and objective about the the structure of elements, their their atomic you know you know the way their atomic nuclei constituted has predictive you know tremendous predictive power, and and if different kind of you know chemists at different points in time you know start off from different theories of you know what chemistry is, if they do science well enough they will all kind of converge on onto that that kind of thing, but there are other phenomena that that don't have that kind of single you know, hidden essence behind them, and they they can be theorized and conceptualized differently. And this is particularly the case in, you know, in in in psychology and psychiatry where these phenomena are really complicated. And so the one one idea simply is that, you know, there is there, you know, there isn't a hidden essence. You know, we we have different ways of describing, explaining, understanding these ideas. And they come with advantages and disadvantages, and one is not a you know knockout winner. One doesn't displace the others. Um, I I think that that's the you know that's the fundamental sentiment behind explanatory pluralism you know as an implied inside science. This is particularly true because we are dealing with the mind-body split too. So there there are theoretical perspectives that are more grounded for example in neuroscience you know trying to look at\n\n\nBrain circuitry and receptor actions, and other biological processes, are involved.  There are also explanatory perspectives that utilize cognitive terms or psychological forces, including unconscious psychological dynamics.  So we are dealing with that split. A related idea is that of levels of explanation—things can be described at different levels of organization and coherence, invoking different relevant concepts. There is the physiological level (neurophysiology, biology), the cognitive level, the psychological level, and the social/interpersonal level (multiple brains interacting).  When things interact, new properties emerge that cannot be adequately described using concepts of the lower level.  Sometimes people talk about pluralism in psychiatry and psychology, in the sense that these phenomena transcend multiple levels and can be described at multiple levels of organization.\n\nThat's really interesting. You said a lot there that I want to unpack.  The first thing that made my brain go \"ding ding\" is your discussion of the periodic table of elements and the idea of objective things that anyone doing science well will find.  The periodic table organizes elements in such a way that you know when you're going to transform an atom from one element to another.  Anyone will find that. But there are other things that can only be described with different ways of looking at them and different perspectives.\n\nI'm curious about your thoughts—this is getting a little philosophical—but many philosophers of science might argue that even the periodic table of elements is just one way to look at carbon, for example. If we had a different set of requirements or intuitive ideas about how to interact with reality, we might find something else or structure things differently.  So, what are you saying? How far does the pluralism go?\n\nEven in physics and chemistry, with something like the periodic table, we don't necessarily have to rely on the standard description at all times. Other things have a role. It's very context-dependent. There can be other theoretical ways of looking at how to think about elements or how to divide or map them.  There might be certain contexts or situations where a certain goal is best achieved using a classification of elements that is not the one from the periodic table. I don't know enough about fundamental physics to know what they would be, but I can imagine situations where an alternative classification offers some advantage or benefit in a particular context. In those contexts, it would be useful to utilize the alternative one.  The periodic table possesses such immense explanatory power that, in the majority of situations and contexts, it will be the useful one to use.  However, there are other situations where there isn't a single perspective that dominates in the same way—maybe 60% of the time or something—but there will be significant cases in clinical or scientific work where we are relying on and using other perspectives.\n\nAren't we sliding into something fundamentally unscientific? Science is about finding context-free, ultimately generalizable rules or facts about reality.  Once you start to say \"well, it's contextual,\" is that really the goal of science? Philosophers of science have been thinking about this for decades, if not centuries. Ultimately, it all comes down to some form of context.  We don't have direct access to mind-independent reality. We only have access to what we perceive or detect by means of instruments or experiments. We have to make inferences based on the data we gather, and any data gathering takes place in a certain research or scientific context. It's guided by certain theoretical assumptions.  Philosophers often talk about all observations being theory-laden—there is no theory-free observation. Any observation is made within a certain theoretical context, framework, and with certain goals, and these can change.\n\nSome of the most fundamental theories in science work really well in basically all contexts we can apply them to, until we start encountering situations in which they don't apply (e.g., quantum physics). There are many aspects of quantum physics that we don't understand, and there's huge debate. But as far as empirical predictions of quantum physics are concerned, they have been unsurpassed; they have repeatedly proven true.\n\n\nKnow powerful theory that you know gives us a lot of power. Um, so there are, you know, the fundamental theories tend to apply in all situations that we currently possess, but there would be new, fewer, you know, future situations in which they may not apply versus then there are more, then there are theoretical models that are more circumscribed in scope that that work well within certain contexts but outside of that don't they don't work very well. And this may be because they approximate something about that larger theory. You know, consider Newtonian, kind of, you know, laws of motion. They they work very well within ordinary speeds, uh, but once we cross certain thresholds that, you know, they're not they're not as applicable. Um, so so one way of thinking about about this is in this respect, and then there are other situations in which we're simply dealing with very different kinds of phenomena. So you know, in physics we we have, you know, the general theory of relativity at one end and we kind of have quantum physics on the other end, and at the moment physicists kind of juggle and they they, you know, they move back and forth between the two depending on whether they're looking at, you know, galaxies or whether they're looking at, you know, and and right now we don't have a way of unifying them. Probably there is, you know, there may be a theoretical way of unifying them, but you know, but we don't know. And you know, in a similar kind of way we can think about theories that that are examining the psyche from from the perspective of, you know, um, from the cognitive framework, you know, in terms of predictive processing of beliefs. You know, again, these are things we are inferring because we don't, you know, we can observe them or we can kind of, you know, look at look at these things from, you know, from a from a brain circuit perspective or kind of neurotransmitter perspective. Um, so some some of it is methodological as well, you know, can we unify them at some point? Perhaps we we would want to. And what that would look like, we don't know, but but we're not there yet.\n\nYeah, I agree. And and it seems like probably the history of science is like if you go back to Newton, it is um finding something that we think is super general and then realizing that it's actually contextual. We just didn't like have a way to access the context in which it wouldn't hold.\n\nYes. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Uh, this is yeah, and and there's this again, you know, we hear these term the terms realism versus anti-realism in in philosophy of science, which refers to the idea that that these unobservable entities that we are hypothesizing, what what kind of status do do they have? And uh, you know, realism, the at least the kind of naive realist view is that the unobservable entities really exist versus kind of the anti-realistic and anti-real kind of view would be that these are perhaps useful fictions that, you know, we we don't know what kind of reality they possess. We just know that they are useful enough that they guide our empirical work and they make predictions that that that turn out to be true.\n\nWhere do you fall on that continuum? You know, I I take a more pragmatic kind of view towards these things, which, you know, in some ways bridges the two, which it has kind of one leg in in realism and one one leg in anti-realism.\n\nAnd you mean philosophically pragmatic, not like pragmatic? Well, like the school of philosophy pragmatism.\n\nYes. Yeah. Yeah. Can you just tell us uh for people who don't know what that is, like generally what that is?\n\nYeah. It's it's basically uh, you know, it's it's a pragmatism by itself is a it's a pretty broad, you know, broad term, but um, but generally what it does is that it shifts the focus away from um certain metaphysical questions towards our ability to make use of of concepts in in in the world. It it asks questions like what it is that we can do with a certain theoretical concept. What are its uses? How are we applying it? And and it it it it judges um what a theoretical perspective is offering or how we understand uh, u you know, any particular phenomena based on how it is being utilized in practice. Um, yeah. So it's sort of like um instead of asking is this true, it's asking like is it useful for me to think of it as true and what can I do with that if I if I do?\n\nYes. Yeah. And that's a simp yeah, that's a simplistic version of that. Yeah.\n\nUm, there's a there's a lot in there, but I want to get into like psychiatry, psychology. And I think like the reason that I'm so into this other than like it's just fascinating is just like I have OCD and it was a mess for me to even figure that out. Um, um, and it took like 10 years and I went to a bunch of different therapists and eventually like I was just reading a bunch of stuff and I was like I think I have OCD. Um, and you know, there's a lot of debate uh about whether that's even helpful, right? Like for some people the label is bad. For me it was quite freeing cuz I was like well, you know, for OCD, typical talk therapy tends not to work that well until you're much until treatment is much better managed. Um, and even once I had gotten into the correct treatment for it. So like exposure and response prevention uh uh that it took me a while to get to someone who actually even practiced that well enough for it to work. Um, and then it it was a nightmare to get on medication. Um, but once I did, it's been amazing. It like literally changed my life. Um, I'm like a completely different person. And, um, during that whole time, I've also just always been interested in philosophy of science stuff. I was like, um, the way that this works is fundamentally broken and bad. Um, and it's bad philosophy, too. Um, yeah. Tell talk to me about that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And um, actually, you know, I I I think a lot of people, you know, will relate to what you're saying. And in in my own clinical practice, you know, one of the diagnoses that that seems to have been missed by other clinicians a lot is obsessive-compulsive disorder, OCD, where people will have histories of being treated for depression, anxiety,\n\n\nAnd yet, kind of, you know, I do a comprehensive interview and I'm like, you know, I think you may have OCD. And suddenly, like, you know, things are clicking into place for them. I think the reason is that, for one reason, I think it's not as popular a diagnosis in the cultural imagination as things like depression, anxiety, or ADHD. So, often times, here's the thing, in the psychological realm, even when we are describing, characterizing, talking about a phenomena, it is very sensitive regarding the language we use to even talk about it. So, what happens is that if someone, for example, if a person has no idea of what OCD even is, they have never heard of it, they're not familiar with obsessions in the technical sense, they might notice that they're getting really anxious. They might notice that they're having a lot of repetitive, intrusive thoughts that kind of make them uncomfortable. One person might just think that, oh, I'm just a really nervous person, or I just have really bad anxiety, and this anxiety is causing me these really nervous, anxious thoughts. Another person might think that I have some kind of paranoia. I'm getting these really weird, scary thoughts that make me uncomfortable, make me suspicious. I may have paranoia or something like that. Another person might just interpret them like, I just get these racing thoughts, maybe I have some kind of bipolar disorder. I'm getting these weird racing thoughts. So, depending on how someone uses language to describe them, it might shift them in one or a different diagnostic direction. So, it takes familiarity with a number of different diagnostic categories to begin to recognize which direction to go. So, often times, patients themselves don't tell the clinician that they are having obsessions because they don't use that language. They'll say, I'm anxious, I'm having nervous thoughts, etc. And it would take a somewhat astute clinician to do a good interview and pick up on the fact that someone is having intrusive thoughts and then ask further questions. So, I think that's one big difficulty. But when you do have the right match, when you can match someone's presentation with this idea of OCD, you can guide them towards the right treatments that have been studied and are known to work better—exposure and response prevention therapy, other forms of psychotherapies, and then medications as well. Often times, we are using the same kind of serotonin-based medications and other ones, but the dosages required are often different; different augmentation strategies are often different. So, you're probably familiar; there's a lot of anti-psychiatry discussions in the mental health realm, and some people just say that we should just abandon all diagnosis. And I think, how can we talk accurately about these things without diagnostic language? So, I feel strongly that we need more sophisticated ways of talking about these phenomena. Now, the challenge here is that we can reify that category. We can think, obsessive-compulsive disorder; it's a thing in the brain that explains this category. There's some kind of singular brain dysfunction that explains all of these symptoms. And so that's where I think people go wrong if they start thinking of categories in that manner. And so, OCD, as far as we know, it's not one thing. In fact, even from a symptom standpoint, it has fuzzy boundaries. So, its boundaries overlap with other anxiety disorders, overlap with depression, with other things. And biologically speaking, there is no one single thing that makes OCD, OCD, but rather it's a variety of different things. So we have to respect that heterogeneity, but at the same time, it offers us a certain descriptive potential. We can talk about it; we can identify it; we can use it for guiding treatment. And so this would be a good example of something that's very helpful pragmatically; it's an entity that exists from a pragmatics standpoint, but not from an essentialistic point of view. Well, but the interesting implication of the pragmatic idea is that, for some people, it's not helpful. And so, part of being a good clinician is knowing when it is and is not helpful. And I mean, you're going to mess it up sometimes, but that's a really interesting thing, right? Because I think the entire—you've just led me into AI land. So, thank you for that. I think there's a lot of pressure to be able to reduce these things down into a checklist, right? That even if you don't have any clinical experience, you can just know, I checked it off; I checked off the box, he has OCD or whatever. And I think what you're saying is like, yeah, you can do the checklist, but really you need to have—a good clinician has a little bit of a smell for it, and they're just like, I know, and I can kind of explain in this case why, but like I can't fully, you know. But I think there's scientific, academic pressure to have a really clear-cut theory that you can just write down—this is exactly what it is. And then there's also a lot of cost considerations and scale considerations. If we want to make treatment available to a lot of people, then we need to be able to reduce it down into, here are the rules for how to diagnose it and how to treat it, and we make basically a manual.\n\n\nIzed therapy. Um, which has some works to some degree but is not the same thing as with a really skilled clinician. Um, so to get to my AI point, these questions are exactly the kinds of questions that early machine learning researchers faced, which is like if you want to recognize a letter, you want to do character recognition. Um, do we like how do we define what an A is? Do we like create a bunch of rules for it? Um, and if so, like there's a lot of different situations in which something might be an A, but it like doesn't look at all like an A. It's very contextual. So some people went down the route of like let's define all the rules. Um, which did not work. Um, but what ended up working is deep learning where basically what you can do is feed in a lot of examples into a neural network and the neural network um creates distributed representations of whatever the examples are such that um no individual neuron knows like hey this is like a this is an A, but altogether basically when you feed something into a neural network, what the network is doing more or less is testing out a bunch of different hypotheses for what the letter could be and whether it could be an A all at once in a non-rule-like way and then outputting yeah I think this is basically an A. Um, without any individual neuron knowing the rules, um, but at a high level you may be able to say like yeah generally if the A has a little thing at the end then it's going to say it's an A. Um, and so that's the like the basic kind of parallel I see to like machine learning stuff. I'll stop there, but there's more stuff going on there. Does that is that something that you've run into before or thought about?\n\nHey there, Dan Shipper here. I wanted to take a 1-minute break from the episode to tell you about our latest sponsor. All right, let's play a game. What powerhouse productivity tool is also free for individuals? Nope, not that one. Try again.\n\nYou may not expect this, but it's Microsoft Teams. Yep. The same Teams that big enterprises swear by also has a free plan for individuals. Whether you're jamming on a side project or bootstrapping a startup or building a community, Teams has all the features that other platforms nickel and dime you for using. You can get unlimited chat, 60-minute video meetings, file sharing, and collaborative workspaces, all for free. And the real magic is that everything is integrated in one seamless collaborative workspace. That means there's no more hopping between different applications for messages, meetings, and file sharing. Teams puts it all at your fingertips to save you time and money. So ditch the app overload and the subscription fatigue and use Teams to experience effortless collaboration today. Are you ready to streamline your workflow? Head to aka.m/Every to use Teams for free. Your productivity will thank you and so will your wallet. And now back to the episode.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I think I think there's this um, you know, there's this recognition that the you know what we call the space of psychopathology. So this kind of you know this abstract conceptual space of the way symptoms are distributed in the mental health realm. Um, what are you know what are the ways in which this you know the space of psychopathology can be carved. Uh, you know, the original kind of idea, the hope for a lot of people was that we can find single big causes or we can find essences and that'll provide us the way to carving this space. You know, we can carve it at its joints kind of thing. And then now we recognize that oh it's just this big fluid fuzzy mess of interacting causes and mechanisms and you know and you can just really map it in many different ways. So you know we we have used different strategies uh you know the basically the what the what the DSM/ICD etc have been doing in over the past 50-60 years is that they have been relying on clinician observation. So they they started with clinician observation and kind of refined it through operationalization etc. There there is kind of an alternative effort called HiTOP or Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology and and that uses more statistical techniques like factor analysis and and other kind of PCA analysis to to see patterns of symptom co-variation uh you know like what if if you change one one symptom what symptom changes with it and it has come up with an alternative dimensional mapping of these symptoms that but the the space of how to classify um is very flexible and there there are more innovative ways you can do that and this is where probably you know like um AI and you know um kind of like machine learning deep learning come in. It can help us identify new patterns and new ways of talking about the space of psychopathology that we might not have thought of ourselves and I think people are looking into it and you know kind of approaching this um you know to my understanding I I don't think it has produced any actionable results yet. I don't think it's come someone has come up with a new mapping that you know it that seems very useful and that has gen but but I think in theory that's possible and you know we you know and it would be I think it would be exciting um you know to to see.\n\nYeah, well I think the interesting thing to me is so so one is um talking about like observing clinicians and then reducing how they how they operate to diagnostic rules that's exactly how machine learning researchers started in AI and it's exactly what didn't work. It does work now once you have a deep learning foundation. It does work now. Um, but at the very beginning when you're just trying to make it like a checklist of rules instead of like a sort of fuzzy pattern matcher, it does not work very well. Um, but I think the interesting thing to me is um about you know uh like factor analysis or HiTOP or whatever is you're still trying to say like why. Okay. So like if there's like a uh you know OCD is caused by some constellation of different factors but like we can at least say what the factors are and I think um one of the interesting things to me about uh or one of the other interesting parallels to\n\n\nMe about AI stuff with, um, psychology and psychiatry is I think, um, the development, for example, of OCD, or whether or not you're going to have OCD, or whether or not it's going to work. That predictive question is a little bit like, um, the way—I don't know how familiar you are with the way that language models work—but it's a little bit like, um, the way that language models work to predict the next word.  So the way that a language model predicts the next word is it looks at the context of like all the words that came before it, and it's been trained that all the words that came before it each, um, change the probability of the next word in the sequence, and each affect each other. So all the words get a chance to talk to each other, and then all the words get a chance to basically figure out what comes next, and there's no like one set of rules, and there's—and it's—and you can't really—I mean, it does learn the rules of grammar overall. You can look at it and be like, \"it knows grammar.\" Um, but if you're trying to understand, for example, um, when it might use the word OCD, uh, that's very hard because it's so multifaceted. It's like millions and millions and millions and millions of parameters all interacting with each other to like say OCD comes next. Um, and I think that actual OCD probably works a lot like that, or can be—can be worked with a lot like that. Let's just say that.\n\nAnd the reason that we haven't done that is because in science, um, we prioritize explanatory power over predictive power a lot, um, because in order to get your paper accepted by a journal, you have to like have a theory, and deep learning doesn't have theories. It just says, \"we know it works.\" Um, and so my—the—my like, I don't know what it—my stump speech is basically like, \"we should just like throw out explanations, uh, in a lot of these cases and build predictive models with large, large, large data sets.\" Like instead of throwing 16 undergraduates into a brain scanner and being like, \"I think 15 minutes of meditation like slightly affects OCD on average in these 15 undergraduates,\" we should just like gather tons and tons and tons of, of, um, of, you know, both, uh, contextual data and biological data and like whatever, like chat logs, whatever, and just throw it into a deep learning model to predict, um, when you're going to get OCD or what interventions might work or whatever, even if we don't have a theory. And I think science is generally blind to that idea.\n\nThat's a great, you know, um, question, and you know, their suggestion, and, and you know, to my understanding is that, you know, researchers have been trying that kind of thing in, in, in psychiatry and psychopathology for a while. And so, for example, we, we have had, um, kind of people look at risk of suicide, for example, in large data sets and trying to predict, you know, um, what kind of factors lead to suicide and, you know, to—to what—what kind of accuracy we can predict the risk of suicide over, over a certain time frame. And, um, and there, there were publications that reported really, really high accuracy or really high predictive power, you know, 90% or more in some samples. Um, what has happened so far is that, um, that accuracy hasn't translated very well outside the samples on which the program was trained. So, so you know, so a program might do very well, you know, in, in a large data set, but then you take a wildly different data set, and then sort of like, you know, it, it, it—the—the kind of predictive power goes down. Now, that may change in the future as, you know, as the training gets better, but that's what has happened so far is that you get exceptionally good at the, you know, at the algorithm predict what happens in one, one group, but then it fails outside. And so they, they have tried that with, you know, things like disease progression. You know, if you take people at risk of psychosis, can you predict, you know, which one would transition to psychosis? They have, they have used development of bipolar disorder. If you take people with depression, can you predict, you know, who will go on to have a manic episode? So I think that's where I have seen most kind of, you know, like machine, machine learning, machine learning, deep learning kind of stuff being, being used. Other stuff where this is kind of happening is in kind of understanding, um, patterns of brain circuit activation or, or patterns of kind of neuroimaging finding. So, uh, there, there were, for example, um, kind of, you know, a series of papers, um, kind of last year that looked at, you know, brain, brain circuit activation patterns in depression, anxiety, and, and identified various kind of subtypes that correlated with certain clinical features, etc. So that, that's another kind of situation where, where people have used, but I, I, I, I think we're still waiting to, uh, you know, for, for this kind of methodology to deliver really kind of, you know, results that are really actionable or, or that work well across many, many contexts.\n\nYeah, I think, um, my, uh, my response to that—I think that's a really important like con—let's say concern. My response to that is the same thing was true of earlier versions of, uh, text prediction or image generation. Um, and the thing that worked was more data and more parameters, more compute. Um, and so I, I'm not familiar with all of the, all of the studies that have done this, but my guess would be that, um, one, what counts as a large data set in, in, in like, in that world is actually comparatively not large to like machine learning researchers who are like dealing with like terabytes of data. Um, and that's even that is like probably pretty small. So one is, is, is compile—like the task becomes how do we get an actually gigantic data set. Um, uh, and I think a lot of the big tech companies have these data sets. If, if they wanted to donate them to science, I think they should. Um, and the second thing is I think a lot of these studies use, um, more simplistic, underpowered statistical models that are more understandable but, uh, end up overfitting and aren't able to represent the like complex, nonlinear interactions that end up actually predicting, um, things like suicide or depression or, or whatever. Yeah. You know that you're probably right. I think, you know, I, I think, you know, we're still, um, you know, early in this space, you know, and, and that there's, there's so much innovation.\n\n\nHappening in the, you know, neural learning space, and I think it probably takes some time before these kinds of methods start trickling into the clinical research space. So we probably haven't optimized what can be achieved using that. So I agree with that. Um, so, you know, I think there's reason to be optimistic, and there's reason not to give up on that, but rather continue exploring these methods. One thing I'll say is that I think there are things we can practically start doing, even sort of start exploring, even now. For example, one area where AI is getting some practical application in Medicine is in note-writing, where there are now softwares that have been developed that listen in on the clinical encounter or the interview and generate a template of a medical note based on what the patient and the doctor discussed. Right? That's a way, you know, because it's relatively formulaic and follows a certain template, and I think it could have a lot of utility in clinical interviews as well. So, as you probably recognize from your clinical experience, the average clinician is not super skilled at picking up the nuances of the presentation. But you could easily develop an AI version of a clinical interview that exceeds the average clinician. Someone like you, for example, could have a clinical interview facilitated by a large language model, and the language model will have the time and resources to go into the nitty-gritty of the symptoms and inquire about clarifying what you're experiencing, rather than a rushed clinician who just has 10 minutes to talk to you in an appointment. So I think we don't even have to wait for new scientific discoveries to talk about clinical application. If someone develops a good clinical interview AI, I think it would be usable straight away.\n\nYeah, I agree. I mean, there are definitely a lot of people who are working on stuff like that, but ChatGPT is already sort of that, to be honest. Um, and it is this interesting thing where I go to therapy every week, and I'm a big fan of therapy, and I have a real human therapist and a real human Psychiatrist. So, um, but the dream is obviously for everyone to be able to have that and for everyone to have a skilled clinician. But the reality of how expensive it is means that the clinician has to probably be undertrained, understaffed, have 10 minutes to talk to you, have a checklist, and is going to get things wrong more. Um, and I think while ChatGPT is not being used as a therapist, I would bet you that if you look at the way people are using it, a lot of them are using it for things that are sort of therapy-like, and that's probably a good thing because it's democratizing access to the most basic level of mental and emotional support, meaning some people won't develop problems that might have otherwise developed. Um, but it also becomes this sort of funnel so that by the time you get to a therapist, maybe it's told you, \"Hey, here are some things you should talk to your therapist about,\" or whatever, that helps the human clinician make progress more quickly.\n\nYeah, I agree. I think many of my colleagues, especially in the psychotherapy world, are wary of these developments and are looking at them with suspicion. I am more optimistic in my orientation about these things and generally see this as a positive development. I think it's good, and I think there are problems more amenable to this kind of self-directed therapy through ChatGPT, etc. And then there are other more entrenched problems that might require a relationship with a human. And to the extent that there are problems that can be addressed in a somewhat satisfactory manner by AI, then why not utilize that? And I think a lot of people are drawn to the promise of that, and they like having more control, and they like having, you know, I think a lot of times clinicians can have all of the quirks of humanity. They can be arrogant. They can be dismissive. They can be rushed. Right? Versus ChatGPT is patient. It's always there. It's nonjudgmental. I think a lot of people don't want to say that, right?\n\nYeah. No, it's not just nonjudgmental, right? So you can manipulate it in ways that you cannot manipulate a human clinician. I'm curious if you've used it at all for this kind of thing. Because, for me, I've been having these stress dreams the last couple of nights, and so I just record a voice note of me talking about my dream and then throw it into ChatGPT, and I have a whole vlog of a bunch of dreams from the last few nights, and it's just like talking to me about different little patterns in my psyche that I think are for real. Not in a necessarily predictive kind of way, just like, \"Here's the emotional landscape that you're in right now that might be useful for you to have in mind as you go through your day,\" which it definitely has been. Or I often record all my meetings and throw them into ChatGPT, and I'm like, \"I'm having a problem with this person,\" or whatever, like, \"Can you walk me through...\"\n\n\nThrough like, what to do about it versus maybe I would go to therapy, but like that's once a week, and it relies on me having to be like, \"Well, he said this, and she said this, and then I said...\" It's just... it's just different, you know.\n\nYeah. Uh, I, I, you know, I haven't used, uh, kind of ChatGPT or Claude or anything in, in, in that, you know, from, from, from that angle. I have mostly used it for kind of brainstorming ideas or doing kind of, you know, superficial research on some topic that I'm not very familiar with, or um, you know, used it for, you know, editing. For example, if I wanted to edit a piece of writing and wanted, you know, input on how it could be worded differently or improved. So I've used it for those purposes. Um, I have not personally used it for psychological exploration, although this is something I should probably try.\n\nWell, one thing I guess, like, you know, since since we're talking about this stuff, so if we are talking about AI applications in the classification realm, for example, right? So, you know, to the extent that the process is going to be, you know, um, guided by, you know, uh, by human decision-making, right, it's going to be about teaching the algorithms to kind of detect, you know, diagnostic categories as clinicians do. But if we wanted to think about new forms of classification, you know, how might an AI kind of, you know, uh, training algorithm approach that kind of thing if we wanted to, if we wanted it to detect class or, you know, come up with classification proposals that are different from the ones we already have?\n\nI think it's a great question. Um, I think the, the, the thing to think about is, um, one is they work on examples. So if you, if you give it a bunch of examples and um, ask it to, uh, you can, you can give it a pre-existing categorization scheme and say, \"This example is like this, or this example is like that.\" Um, but you can also just say, um, for example, \"Predict whether or not this person will be helped by searching.\" Okay. Um, and it will do its own internal classification of, you know, search lane or no search lane that goes across diagnostic categories, um, and that we probably don't—it's super high-dimensional; like we, like we probably very, very hard to understand—we probably could get some understanding of how it does it, but it's doing its own internal sorting. Um, so, so I think the best way to get it to come up with its own categorization is to set it a task that it would require it to categorize it in a novel way, and then it will find a, a, a categorization that works for that task. Um, sometimes, like, in, like, by default, that will be an internal one. Um, but you can also get it to, uh, write out its categorization scheme or write, write out the reasons for why it does things in the way it does it. It takes a little bit more work to do that, but it's, I think it's possible.\n\nYeah. Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And one of the, you know, interesting things is that sometimes, uh, cultures do that, you know, you know, we have different, you know, there's cultural variations, and and then sometimes different cultures talk about a psychological phenomena in, in ways that are, you know, you know, radically different. So for, you know, so, so we get these kind of, you know, culture-bound syndromes, for example, in, in, in the mental health realm. Uh, but um, a while back, I, I, I, I came across this cultural description of this thing called *igoria*, which essentially translates into \"self-leakage.\" Um, it was kind of like this, this idea that a person's, um, uh, you know, boundary essentially has, has been violated in some way, and a person is, you know, elements of their psyche are leaking, kind of leaking out in certain ways. And, and then this was a, this is a way of thinking that transcends, for example, traditional psychiatric classifications, cuz you know, it can cross into things like, you know, it could be, you know, delusional experiences, could be hallucinatory, but could be kind of, you know, other forms, even, even some forms of, you know, obsessive-compulsive, you know, phenomena. Sometimes cross-cultural comparisons of mental health descriptions, you know, can, can really be surprising, and there's like, \"Oh wow, this is a really, you know, this, it's a really different take on, on, on a familiar, uh, psychiatric concept.\"\n\nYeah, I think that makes sense. Um, the way that I think about that generally is, um, for things like psychiatric diagnos[is] or classific[ation], it's emergent. So, it's super—we're talking about something that's super high-dimensional. So, any classification system is only going to—and I think you agree with this—is only going to give you like a slice, or slice it in a particular way, but it's not going to be the slice. Um, and it's a lot like, um, musical genres, you know, like what, what really counts as rock.\n\nThat's might seem obvious, but if you really think about it, there's a lot of stuff there, there where it's like they're, they're on the border, you know, like what are, I don't know, what are the Beastie Boys like? There's some rock influences there, but they're kind of wrapped. They're like, there's that kind of thing is, I think, is, is the same question. And you can come up with your own categorization schemes, but the question is for what purpose? Like, in order to reduce it down into, into a dimension that we can understand, you have to, you have to understand the purpose for which you're, you're doing the ranking. Um, otherwise, the way that, the way that language models do this is, um, they just create, they just map things into a high-dimensional space. So they put like things near each other and unlike things that are unlike things further away, but in, in across many, many, many, many, many dimensions, and they don't have a like a huge dictionary of each thing that each, you know, or they don't have, they don't have a full map of each thing. What they do is they—you give it a thing, and then it generates its location in that space. And once you have its location, then you can kind of say like, \"Well, it's near this, or it's not near this.\" And that's how you get away with not having a, um, like universal understandable categorization scheme. You just map it in, in a space that allows for thousands and thousands of different dimensions.\n\nYeah, it's, it's all really fascinating. Yeah. Um, anyway.\n\n\nThis is fantastic. If people are interested in reading more of your work, where can they find you? The place where I'm most active these days is my Substack newsletter, *Psychiatry at the Margins*. That's where I'm talking about various controversies in the field, various debates, and other developments. I'm also present on X/Twitter.  As you mentioned, a volume recently published by Oxford University Press is called *Conversations in Critical Psychiatry*. It's an edited collection of interviews I did for Psychiatric Times. I encourage people to check that out if they're interested in debates in the field. So, Substack and other social media platforms are probably best.\n\nAwesome. Thank you so much.
