  "cleanText": "You're figuring out how to do compounding engineering. There's two people on the team, but it really feels like there's 15. Coding with AI is more than just the coding part. Utilizing it for research, for workflows. It should be used for everything. We haven't touched Cursor in the last 3 weeks. Both of those have agent coding capabilities, but Claude Code just takes it one step further by simplifying it by a factor of 10. We've been really leaning into let's AI do the work for us and we're just managing the AI. You speak your feature into Claude Code and then it does all the research to create that long document and then just adds it into GitHub issues. That's really cool. What you did first is spent time building a prompt that effectively builds other prompts. Having an idea that has a lot of outcome. This is part of the compounding effect. We had, I think, six or seven running at the same time because we were just like, \"New idea, let's go. New idea, let's go.\"\n\n[Music]\n\nKieran Klaassen, welcome to the show.\n\nThank you so much for having us, Tom.\n\nI'm psyched to have you. So, for people who don't know, um, both of you, uh, work on Cora, which is Every's AI email assistant. Um, Kieran, you're the GM. Natasha, you're an engineer. And beyond the fact that Cora is a really cool product, and I'm really excited to bring that to everybody who listens to this show or watches this show, I wanted to do an episode with the two of you because I think that you're figuring out a new way to do engineering. Um because really Cora has, you know, there's two people on the team, but it really feels like there's like 15 because you've got uh you've got agents who are uh pulling down PRs and working on branches and then you're like pushing them up and other agents reviewing and it's just like this kind of crazy thing that um it's a new way to build software. Um and and Kieran, you said something the other day that like really stuck with me, which is like um you're figuring out how to do compounding engineering. So with each piece of work you do, you're making it easier to do the next piece of work. Um, and I just think that it's really important to bring what you guys are learning to everybody that watches this show because it's like uh we we have new tools and so we need new principles and new workflows for using those tools and so I'm really excited to talk to you about that.\n\nYeah, thanks. It's really fun to build Cora, but like being part of Every and like being in an environment where you get access to tools, like access to thinking, access to exciting new ways to to work really helps us rethink how we build. So like it's it's really an experiment. We're building a product Cora, but at the same time, we're figuring out how we should build. And and that's super interesting. And we're like right in the middle where people say, \"What do you think of this new model?\" Like, like how do we use this research tool and we're just trying things out? And Natasha and I, we've been like really feeling a shift in the last weeks, I would say, where we're like like things are changing and we're not the only ones. Like we hear other people say that as well. Um but not a lot of people. And what we've learned is a lot. And we want to share a little bit of what we learned. And also what we know is like we're just barely starting. We're scratching the surface of this. And it's a big shift that's happening right now uh by new models, by how people think, by MCP, by like just it's a lot. And uh yeah, like it's great to talk about that from different perspectives. Uh yeah.\n\nYeah. Um I I I agree. And and I think it is so special to be at Every because we do like every day there's someone new in the discord who's like I built an AI agent. Do you want to like use it before we launch it? Um and so you know we get access to uh open AI models before they come out and and sometimes Anthropic models and so we have this like early edge and then and then you guys are so good at figuring out how to actually incorporate them into like a production process. Um so you said Kieran that something changed. So, I guess I I want to get a sense of uh what you think changed and what like draw the broad strokes of what the workflow is that's starting to emerge for you guys.\n\nYeah, for me like obviously it's it's like everything coming together but I think the biggest thing is a realization in myself that uh coding with AI is more than just the coding part and it's really about uh like utilizing it for research uh for workflows for for everything like it should be used for everything and we're now at a point where the agents are good enough that they can actually do everything. So we need to rethink again like hey Cursor, WinSurf, like the old school way of coding was great like more of the vibe coding like that was one step and then now um it's a realization oh actually we can just give a task and it will do it but still the work needs to be done by like what do we do how do we do it and just the realization that we should lean into that more and really go deep and and it's like Claude Code, like it's just good coding agent or agents available that actually start to work with new models like Claude 4, like really good at following directions and instructions. And it's all that coming together um that that I realized like oh we're here like the future is here. This thing we've been talking about that was going to be the agentic evolution. Suddenly it works and it's working in real-world non-experimental playing thing. It's just like we're building an app and it's working building the app.\n\nSo what I'm hearing is like it's not just about developing with AI. It's all the things that go into developing that you're using AI for. And that the the thing that you're using the most for this is Claude Code. Is that right? And if it's right like tell tell me about like for people who don't know Claude Code or haven't used it give us a little introduction to Claude Code and then tell us about like exactly how you're using it.\n\nYeah. Claude Code is basically the coding agent version from Anthropic uh that uses Claude under the hood and it runs in your in your terminal as a CLI tool which is kind of Do you want to share your screen and like show us?\n\nYeah. Yeah. So um this is like uh like one day before uh the Claude live stream was scheduled. We were like okay tomorrow um coding is going to change. We'll have\n\n\nA much more capable model, which will be able to work for everything that we want.\nWe're basically going to get like a coding genie for us.\nSo the best, most productive thing for us to do today, instead of doing our regular scheduled programming, we should just jam for a 2-hour call where we make a massive list of issues that we want the future, like tomorrow's superior model, to solve.\nAnd uh, we did that.\nWe created like 20 issues uh in terms of, you know, like what we want to fix, uh what were the things that we were uh uh planning to work on, and um prepared uh the system for uh the new cloud model.\nYeah.\nAnd it was funny because uh Natash had, like, he prompted uh ChatGPT to say, \"Hey, tomorrow we have a, we reached AGI.\nUh, can you, can you uh, yeah, can you help us come up with everything we need to do and like prepare the AGI to solve everything we did?\"\nAnd then we fed that into the prompt improver uh of uh Anthropic, and then we used that as a prompt and we created uh, wait, before you move on, before you move on.\nSo, so uh, for people, for people who are listening, so basically you have this sort of Trello board type thing inside of GitHub um, combon board, and for each thing that you've identified as what you want to do, it looks like you have a document that um lays out in detail, okay, if it's a feature or it's like a bug fix or whatever, it lays out in detail what it is and how to actually do it.\nCan you open up one of one of them?\nOkay, so like a feature is you want to generate um, you want to have AI generated synthetic data um, and it has this document has everything from a problem statement to like a solution vision to all the requirements um, and all the technical requirements and like a bunch of a bunch of stuff, but it's and even it has seems like it has implementation steps with day counts and stuff like that.\nSo which is funny.\nSo this is one day is like one second.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo this we use Claude Code, and we have this custom prompt that we generated to create these um, because like it, it's a lot of work to create these, and even with ChatGPT, like there's a lot of steps you need to look at all the code, you need to come up, you have to think about it.\nYeah, there's a lot of thinking, so it's really hard to do well.\nSo what we did, we created an command in Claude Code, and command is kind of a custom prompt that you use a lot, and ours is like, \"Hey, there's a feature.\"\nSo, this is a command in Claude Code or a command in Cursor, cuz you have Cursor open.\nYeah, I have Cursor open because that's how I edit files, but it's Claude Code.\nSo, you can see we're in Claude, and I can use this command um by hitting CC, which is Claude Code, and then I say something like a problem, I have like a bug, a problem, anything.\nSo, it's very low friction.\nSo, I have this CCI command, and Nachesh and I were just jamming.\nWe're like, \"Oh, what if we do this?\nOh, that sounds cool.\"\nAnd then uh voice to text, and it starts um, so, so let's, let's see how this works.\nAnd then uh while it's running, we can go over the thing.\nSo I want infinite scroll in Cora, where if I am at the end of a brief, uh it should uh load the next brief, and it should go until every brief that's unread is read.\nSo like, so yeah, I, I just want people to understand, like Kieran almost never types anything um, and uh, and does all voice text.\nSo he was just doing voice to text into his, into his terminal, into Claude Code with, I believe, an internal as of yet in unreleased internal Every incubation called Monologue.\nUm, which he is the number four uh biggest user of uh, but still, still under wraps, but uh, but you know, a little preview in here coming soon.\nAnd basically uh, what, what it seems like it's doing is it's, it's taking that, is it turning, is it turning that into the that document that we were looking at earlier, or is it actually going and executing it?\nYeah.\nSo what it does is it will insert whatever I said here in the f uh feature description, and then it will follow all these steps, and these steps are research, research best practices.\nSo one is grounding itself in the codebase.\nSo researching what exists.\nThen it's researching best practices.\nSo it's searching the web, finding open-source patterns.\nSo it's like grounding it in like best practices in general.\nThen it's uh will present a plan, and when I say, \"Yep, sounds good.\"\nLike I like that review human in the loop for the plan because sometimes it does it wrong, but most of the time it's right.\nThen I say, \"Yep, sounds good.\"\nAnd then it creates the GitHub issue and it will put it in the right lane and all that.\nOh, interesting.\nSo, it's like that whole conbon we were looking at in GitHub earlier.\nYou've created a way for you, you speak your feature into Claude Code, and then it does all the research to create that long document and then just adds it into into GitHub issues.\nThat's really cool.\nYeah, it's, it's an important step because it's like this is different from Cursor coding because in Cursor normally you skip this step because the tool is not really made for it, like the tools made to code.\nYes, you can do create, you can create markdown files and all of that, but let's lean into like an issue tracker.\nIt exists and it works well and people use it and it already hooks into existing uh like patterns, like it, like we, we can give this to a developer and they can implement it.\nYeah.\nAnd one of the things um that just to point out is like you're running this, and I, I think one of the special things that when we saw Opus 4 for the first time, we were like, \"Holy shit.\"\nIs that it just runs forever with without any intervention and then gives you a pretty good result, which we've had sort of agentic type things for a little while, but it, it's just a way different level of autonomy and quality than um than we've ever had before.\nAnd and it's like just checking things off of this to-do list in a way that I think other agent loops are just going to be a lot less thorough.\nYes, absolutely.\nMe and Kieran have like a fun thing going on where we're trying to see who can have Claude Code running for the maximum amount of time, and uh Karen uh is stopping the rest right now.\nHe ran it for 25 minutes.\nI'm only at 8 minutes right now.\nOh man.\nUm, how uh, how did you get it to go so long, Kieran?\nA very, very long plan.\nUm, includes.\nYeah, it's just very, very complicated, long plan, and also include a lot of tests and just make sure that it runs all the tests and fixes all the tests and interesting.\nIt goes pretty long.\nYeah.\nMhm.\nT take me through.\nWait, I want to understand how did you make that prompt that that creates the prompt, like the prompt that creates the research document.\nSo like um, how did you know which elements to put in?\nDid you just use, did you just do the same thing where you, you used like a the Claude prompt improver, the Anthropic prompt improver to make that, or yeah, why, how did you think about putting that together?\nYeah, this is part of like the compounding effect.\nIt's like having an idea that has like a lot of uh, a lot of outcomes.\nSo this was what Nesh sent me.\nHe said, \"We just got AGI.\nUh, it got delivered and uh, we can write software.\nUh, that, that this was your initial prompt, which is kind of fun, like uh, like it's very dramatic.\"\nAnd then Ch said, \"Uh, I'm ready.\nOkay.\nSo now do this.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Okay, yeah, that's fine.\nUm, that's fine, but like uh, do you know uh, the Anthropic console prompt improver?\"\nLike what is that?\nUh, well, anyone that doesn't know this is the Oh, they changed it.\nIs this console?\nYeah, it is the Oh, yeah, it is.\nOkay, they changed it a little bit.\nBut this is great because basically you paste in a prompt or something like that and you can say, \"Yeah, we will have thinking,\" and you click generate and it will improve the prompt automatically and you think like how good can it be?\nIt's pretty good because it's also very low friction.\nSo, like it's very easy to just take a minute to see if something comes out, if it works.\nIf it doesn't work, delete it.\nDoesn't matter.\nWe were just jamming and we were like, well, we're going to come up with 30 research tasks, so like we better have a prompt.\nSo, I just copied this prompt and that became the document.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nInto here and change the arguments.\nAnd then you can trigger those in Claude by doing slash.\nAnd we have these two custom prompts here.\nH.\nAnd then I think that actually gives me a much better idea of like what you mean by compounding engineering because what it says to me is what you did first is spent time building a prompt that effectively builds other prompts because those research documents are effectively prompts for Claude Code.\nAnd so now that you have a prompt that builds prompts, um, every time you want to make a new feature, you have to specify less.\nLike you just say the little feature and then it'll go do the research to like build it out into a big document versus before every single time you have to do a feature, you have to say at first I want you to research it and then I want you to like think through all these like different corner cases or the ways that you know I like things built or whatever.\nI think that's so, that's so cool.\nAnd and what's also really interesting to point out is um, it's working while while we've been talking, and that's just a different way to code.\nLike I, we were, you know, we were on the phone together like last week or the week before um, and we were testing this out together, and I shipped a feature that went to prod while we were talking, which I'm not in the codebase at all.\nSo it's like kind of crazy that that actually happened, and it's, it's like it's a kind of more social way to code.\nLike we're coding right now, building stuff which was not possible before.\nHey there, Dan here.\nI wanted to take a 1 minute break from the episode to tell you about our latest sponsor.\nAll right, let's play a game.\nWhat powerhouse productivity tool is also free for individuals?\nNope, not that one.\nTry again.\nYou may not expect this, but it's

year.\nThat's at io.com/every.\nAnd now back to the show.\nYeah, absolutely.\nAnd uh, Oh, so it while we were talking, we did the research and we created this issue, which is cool.\nAnd we had, I think, six or seven running at the same time because we were just like, \"New idea, let's go.\nNew idea, let's go.\"\nAnd what we also did, we went through user feedback.\nWe read emails.\nWe just everything we could, we we gathered and we were just like brainstorming.\nAnd it's really fun because if you're in this brainstorming uh place, you can just kick off agents and see what comes up, what they come up with and take another time to then review.\nSo what we do also is um yeah, like to agree with you on like it's really fun to do this together on a call um because that's where magic happens, and there is still a human review step here because we found that we want to look at it, see if it makes sense, if anything is missing, like this is having taste, experience, intuition, um, like this, this uh, the the bug I solved earlier with the email not going out.\nNate did the same with his Claude Code, but it didn't give the right answer.\nYeah.\nSo, so there is like there is still like a human touch of intuition, like I hinted at, look at the history, and that actually made it think into the right direction, and then Tesh didn't add look at the history, and then it said no, everything works fine.\nSo there is still like intuition, and it's, it's still a skill.\nIt's still a skill.\nIt is a skill for sure.\nYeah.\nIt's not.\nYeah, it's absolutely a skill.\nThere's no magic prompts that does everything, like it is about using it the right way and using it to its strengths.\nFor sure.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nNatash, how have you found this all?\nBecause I know I, you know, Kieran is like a longtime like Rails like expert person who's just like an incredible programmer, and I think you're a little bit earlier in your programming journey.\nSo what has that been like to come to Every, uh, start working on Cora and start working on it in this way?\nYeah.\nI know.\nUh, this has been like incredibly eye opening, I would say, because um, honestly, uh, like my experience with programming is that 2 years ago when ChatGPT came out, I thought, okay, now it's uh, perfect for me to teach myself programming and build that SAS application and uh, that I always wanted to.\nSo I taught myself programming using ChatGPT from the very first day.\nSo I have gone through all the transitions.\nSo I went from ChatGPT, and then when Cursor came out, I shifted the workflow to Cursor, and then then Windsurf got better, we shifted into Windsurf, and\n\n\nYou know, I was always thinking, like, okay, I am at the forefront. I don't know any of my friends who are doing so much with AI, and I'm at the forefront. Then I join uh Emory and start working with Kieran, and Kieran is at a whole other level. Like, he's in our meetings. He's like, never writing code. He's never typing. He's always speaking into uh computer. And um uh so I was like, okay, I need to log that into the overflow. Um and then uh even when Claude Code came out, um Karen actually pushed me into using it. And uh clearly it it is now the the way uh to program. Like me and Ken both, I was like, we haven't even touched uh when ser or Cursor uh in the last like three weeks or so. Um or even if we do touch it, like it's it's usually uh just because we want to read something. It's it's basically like we're using it because we don't have VS code on our computer. Like it wouldn't matter if it was VS code, like the older VS code or Cursor and stuff, because uh all the AI stuff is happening with Claude Code now. And um it's uh really fun to uh you know, have in be in this position where the entire coding landscape just changes completely every three months. And uh you realize, like, nobody's at the forefront. I got to say, I'm jealous of you learning to code right when ChatGPT came out, cuz I learned to code from books like 20 years ago. PHP for dummies.\n\nYeah. Like basic for b learn basic in 24 days, like Sam's teach yourself basic or whatever. Yeah. Deli55.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, and and also it's so funny for you to say, like, I thought I was I thought I was sort of at the at the forefront of AI coding, and then I joined Every and started working with Kieran, because it just reminds me of, I don't know if like there's this scene in um Star Wars uh the prequel episode one where like they're they're under the water and and they're like being attacked by a sea monster, and it looks like they're going to die. And then another bigger sea monster comes out and just like eats the eats the the one that's killing them. And Qui-Gon is like, \"There's always a bigger fish. There's always a bigger fish.\"\n\nAnd um yeah, Kieran Kieran is the bigger fish.\n\nBut I feel I feel the same. Like, like you say that about me, but I'm like, I'm I have no idea what I'm doing. Like, I need to like I'm running behind. We need to do like a million more things. So that's just the reality of the landscape. Like, there is always more. But it's really about practice. Like, you should practice using AI. You should push yourself every day. If you don't, like, you'll miss very cool stuff. Yeah. Well, what are I I I guess I'm curious, like, personally and also for people in the audience, like, what are the problems with this? Right. So basically, it sounds like you're moving to a form of coding where you don't touch the code. Um, you're one level above. And so what are the problems that come up with that, and how are you solving them? Like, what are the new engineering practices that you need to incorporate in order to make sure that things go well? For me, like the the most important realization uh for me has been like this thing uh that I always uh keep going back to uh especially with broad code. I read this in that uh management book like High Output Management, which the Intel CEO wrote like 50 years ago. And the first chapter he mentioned something like how um uh in in any production process, you should fix any problem at the lowest value stage. And uh I just can't uh stop thinking about that uh statement because um because AI and Claude Code can now do so many things for us, it has become really important to focus fus on the earliest part of things. So what I mean by that is uh when when we see that uh you know, when we are using uh the workflow that Kieran just showed to create a GitHub, like a very detailed GitHub issue, um then it's very tempting to uh like start another Claude Code to uh ask it to just, hey, go now uh work on this GitHub issue and fix it. But that's actually uh going to be a problem because um there are chances that uh you know, the the plan that Lord was able to uh in that issue, it wasn't the direction that you wanted to go. And you want to catch that uh before you ask CL to go and implement the solution, and then you want to fix it over there. That makes perfect sense. I really, really like that idea. The thing it reminds me of is just um it's like all this stuff is like it's like a lever, and like the further out you get on the lever, like the more power you have, but also um the more power you have to go in the in the wrong direction. Like every little inch makes a big difference at the end. Um and uh and so trying to catch it earlier, I think is the thing that makes sure that you're not shooting off into space, or this L this lever met metaphor is totally breaking, but like you know what I mean? Like if you if you point a rocket at the moon, like uh one inch means thousands of miles of difference. Um, and so I guess the same thing is true with AI stuff. And I think that's actually a good lesson for me, cuz I I tend to want to like rush through the planning stuff. It's like it's just hard for me to like look at a document like that, like the thing that's that caught us writing and concentrate on it. Um, so how have you guys found that?\n\nYeah, it's it's kind of boring to read most of the time.\n\nBut you can make it more fun, like you can say just like minimal minimal this is too much, just but but then the thing is, then it misses things again. So it's actually important. So for code, I like it to focus on user stories or like asking questions and answering them. So let's say, like, hey, what are some questions a good PM would ask about this, like, that we should consider and give like two options, like that's it's more fun to read that than like week one, we'll do this, week two, we'll do that. Like that's it's like PRDs are boring, and you can make them a little bit more fun or give more examples or like you can shape that research, and that's normally what we do in the in the human review step. It's like, do we see any red flags?\n\nUh, do we need more stuff to be added? Uh, because it will save so much time. Yeah, that actually reminds me of something that we're finding in another part of the business. Um, so Dan Shipper, who's been on this show, is the GM of Spiral. Um, and inside of Spiral, uh, we're building a writing agent. So um you can think of it sort of like hot code, but specifically for writing tasks. And I think there's something similar about that where sometimes you want the writing agent to shift into like an interview mode where it like tries to understand more about what who you are and what you want. Um, rather than just like spitting out a bunch of stuff that you then you have to read through. And it sounds like there's maybe something missing here in Claude Code or these sort of coding work coding workflows where it would be really nice instead of having to read that like long document. It's finding ways to like ask you questions so that the thing it outputs is more likely to be right without you having to read through the whole thing. Yeah, absolutely. That's an interesting idea for a custom command click here. We should totally try that.\n\nYeah, for sure. Like this is something we should automate and make better. Like for sure. And at the same time, it it knows a lot because it has access to your codebase and your style, and like that's that's very powerful. So like like you have the code base and it's actually pretty good um doing it. Like I I think in addition to like making it very good at the beginning, I think just boring traditional tests and emails are very important as well. Um because how do you know what you did is actually working? Well, you can open a console and click through it, but like why just ha have it test it, write a test for it. Uh like just just a bare minimum. Smoke tests are great where you just see does does it kind of work? Uh because otherwise it does way too much, but it's a very good way to have it iterate and fix things by itself. And we haven't tried it as much yet, but we we use the Figma MCP where we say, \"Hey, implement this from Figma,\" and then now there's like you can have Puppeteer take a screenshot for a mobile version and then say compare the two.\" Like we haven't really tried it out, but like we want to try more of that out. So there are these checks in place, tests in place that you normally do manually.\n\nUm, and the same for prompts, like eval uh for prompts. So I kind of think of uh an eval as like writing a test for uh code. An eval is a test for a prompt. And what I've seen last week as well, I had Claude Code run an email and then say actually it fails four out of 10 times. I said, run it 10 times. Does it always pass? No. Four times it doesn't. I said, \"Oh, look at the output. Like, why didn't it call that tool? It was a cool tool uh uh tool call test.\" And it says, \"Oh, yeah, it wasn't specific enough.\" And I said, \"Okay, just keep going and change the prompt until it's passing consistently all the time.\" And it did it. Like I just walked downstairs, got a coffee, walked up, and that was it. So, emails are also very powerful because they will tell you if a prompt works, and similar to writing code, a test says your code works. So, leaning into those more boring traditional ways is also very powerful. Does that make sense? Um, I have a thought. Um, and uh, because one of the things I think is really special, and I think Natasha, you're in this boat, too, so tell me if I'm wrong, but one of the things I think is really special about you, Karen, is that you just test everything. So, like you've tested every single agent. Um, Natasha, have you have you used like a lot of the agents as well? No, that's Karen. Okay. Well, I I think we could I think we could still do this. I think it'd be kind of fun. Um, I want to spend five minutes um with Kieran doing a S tier through F tier ranking of agents. Um, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to share my screen and I'm going to uh I'll call out an agent and then you tell me where it ranks. Um, are are you game? Yeah, let's do it. Okay, cool. Uh, let's see. Uh hm. Uh does I guess cur? Let's do let's do Cursor.\n\nYeah. So it it's fun because Cursor, like what Cursor is it? Claude 4? Is it max? Is it Cursor on the best possible settings and is it the background agent or is it the the okay Cursor traditional best possible setting clause? Like that's the confusing part about Cursor windsurf. Like there are like a million versions of it, and like why don't you just have the best version and that's what I love about certain agents, they just say, \"Look, this is the best agent.\"\n\nUh so that's why it wouldn't be the best. I would say uh A. Okay, Cursor is Cursor is very good with Claude.\n\nUm all right, uh Windsurf.\n\nC because they don't have Claude 4. It It's ridiculous because three three weeks ago they would be A, and now now they're not. Wow. Wow. Okay. Uh because I I switched from Windsurf to or from Cursor to Windsurf uh like a few months back, but I switched back.\n\nUm okay. So we've got Windsurf is a Windsurf is a C. Cursor is an A. Uh let's see. Devon,\n\nit's a B. B. Why?\n\nUm, it's like it's not as integrated. It's a little bit hard to set up, and the code quality is like it's not as well-rounded as Cursor or Claude Code. I don't know if they use Claude 4 in the background, but like it's not as usable as the the others. Uh Charlie,\n\nCharlie is like for code reviews. So we use Charlie for code reviews mostly. So uh I haven't really used it as an agent as much. Um I think Charlie as an agent is B, but it's A as a code reviewer. Like I I really like the code reviews it does. So that's interesting. Like it it's really good at something. And then what about Friday?\n\nUm I put Friday uh higher than Cursor, maybe between S and A. And and it's funny because they don't even use Claude 4 yet. They're still wow, like they're still working on how how they like really make it work. Well, it's 3.7, but like why I like it there. It it's definitely different than Claude Code, but Friday has a very opinionated way of working, and and I love their opinions, and it really works well, and it just does it. Like you give give an issue, they make a plan, you approve, and it does it. Uh it creates a pull request, and I've I've seen it do this stuff that I couldn't do with Claude Codes. Like for example, implement this Figma design. It just oneshoted a Figma design for the assistant, and uh and I've seen moments where more multiple moments like that where it it did things where like, wow, okay, this I taste the future, which is really unique, and it's a small team as well, so really cool thing. Uh Codeex.\n\nUm This is B for me. All right. Codeex is a B. Uh C-pilot.\n\nUh I haven't used Copilot.\n\nYou never used GitHub Copilot? No.\n\nI mean, I used it three years ago, but I like No, I I Okay, let's be fair. I tried it maybe a half a year ago, and after one second I stopped using it. So, where do you rank it? Uh, D. It was not agentic, but but I mean, I should try the new version for sure. We have not tried. Yeah, we we haven't tried the the agentic co-pilot. So, that's that's not totally fair. But, um, okay. Uh, are we missing anything? I feel like we are. Claude Claude Code.\n\nWell, obviously Claude Code, but I I assume S tier, baby.\n\nWe have uh Factory as well. Oh yeah. What's how where do you rank Factory? Uh it's interesting. Factory with certain things is like better than any others, but it's not my style. It's like Factory is for more enterprisey people that are very nerdy and want like absolute bangers of code. And it's actually good, like multi-reo stuff like that. It's a little bit hard to use because it's on the web but also local. So I rate it B uh maybe a little bit below Codeex and and Devin. Yeah, but it's like there is a use for it for sure. There's something going there's something good there, but it's maybe not not for us. It\n\n\nIt's not my thing.\nYeah.\nAMP also.\nM.\nWhat's that?\nAmp.\nA P.\nAMP.\nOh, AMP.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nHow's that?\nYeah.\nUh, I would put it um S tier under cloth coat between another S tier.\nYes.\nAll right.\nWhy?\nIt's It's very good at just getting work done.\nThe ergonomics are pretty good.\nGood tools already.\nLike like people people use that tool that build it.\nThey're dog fooding.\nLike you can feel from Claude Code and AMP, they're developers that love agents and they're just building the best thing and they're trying new things out.\nUm, so yeah, that's it.\nLet's see.\nThis is exactly why Kieran is the big fish.\nI mean, you are you're stringing them together like you're using Claude Code and Friday and and other stuff all at the same time, which is Yeah.\nThe thing that is really cool.\nYeah.\nLike like there are Yeah.\nLike how I think about like I'm I'm thinking about it more is like you're interviewing for a role and you find a developer to like solve a certain problem.\nI think it's similar with coding agents.\nLike Friday is good at like doing UI now.\nSo if I need UI work, I will go to Friday.\nIf I need to do research, I go to Claude Code.\nUm and and yeah, there's a if if I want a code review, I use Charlie.\nLike it's it's fun and agents work together.\nYou don't need to have one agent.\nWe have called code and that's because Charlie like works in GitHub.\nSo you can just like CC Charlie and and Charlie will do the the code review on the PR.\nYeah.\nSo we use GitHub and pull requests and normal developer flows.\nSo humans can hook in.\nSo we can hire someone that's very good at specific thing and review code and then close code will just do the work.\nBut it's very powerful because it is just an ecosystem that we refined over like 20 years or whatever like and it works.\nSo let's lean into that.\nAnd that's probably why Copilot will probably be fine since it's in there already.\nYeah.\nWait, you actually did that recently like we had some infrastructure things where you know we've handled tons and tons and tons of emails at Kora.\nSo we had some infrastructure issues to work out and you seemed I think you brought in someone who's like a real expert and then worked with them in a specific agentic way that you got what you needed from them but it was less work for them.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo like like there was no issue yet but we wanted more visibility in in delivery of like the most important things.\nUh and like I'm not very good at it or like I know stuff but like let's bring in someone.\nAnd what we did, we just had a conversation like a 2-hour call and I recorded everything and at the end I just fed that into Claude Code and say okay can you make two issues resource issues from this and like 10 minutes later I said okay here are the issues can you re review them and he was like holy what what like this guy like he's not an AI skeptic but he's like he he's very good at what he does and normally what he does AI is not good at yet because like there are things AI is not as good at yet.\nUm but he was very impressed with it and he had like very good uh like comments on it to iterate over it and like what we basically did we just iterated more quickly through ideas because we had something to talk about and then I said the next day when we he was like did the human review like let's go I just use Claude Code to implement it and we sat down and did the code review.\nSo, it's like it's just accelerated.\nWhat would have taken 2 weeks maybe is now in like a few hours, which is really cool.\nI love it.\nWell, there you have it.\nYou've got your tier list of agents.\nClaude Code takes the cake.\nWe've got AMP coming up uh coming up in second and uh GitHub Copilot unfortunately uh bringing up the rear, but with room for improvement once we try out their their agentic capabilities.\nUm, anything else you guys wanna want to say or talk about before we uh before we end today?\nEveryone should use Claude Code or try it out.\nEven if you're not technical, subscribe for their max or pro plan.\nIt's only $100 per month.\nYou have unlimited access.\nIf you're skeptical about being technical that it's very easy and I've seen people, a friend of mine, he he used Cursor and I said just use Claude Code is better.\nLike h how much better can it be?\nand he said yes it's better and he rebuilt everything he did with Cursor vibe coded uh into Claude Code and he's like yeah this is great he felt that next step and you should everyone should try it and really push push their tools yeah\nNityesh, any other words of wisdom um just be sure to uh check the AI's work at the lowest value stage uh you want to catch those problems uh early\nyeah that's that's a Great one.\nUh, and also use Kora.\nUm, Corora.computer.\nCheck it out.\nIt's pretty awesome.\nWe're shipping new things all the time.\nUh, thank you both for coming on.\nThis is a true pleasure.\nI cannot wait to see what else you cook up over the next couple months and we'll talk soon.\nThank you.\nThank you so much.\n[Music]\nOh my gosh, folks.\nYou absolutely positively have to smash that like button and subscribe to AI & I.\nWhy?\nBecause this show is the epitome of awesomeness.\nIt's like finding a treasure chest in your backyard, but instead of gold, it's filled with pure unadulterated knowledge bombs about ChatGPT.\nEvery episode is a roller coaster of emotions, insights, and laughter that will leave you on the edge of your seat, craving for more.\nIt's not just a
