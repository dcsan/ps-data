  "cleanText": "We have this new technology, LLMs, that I think are as transformative as the printing press, electricity, and the internet, and we have a choice. We can go down the path that we've been going down, which is engagement maximizing hyperagregation, you know, going after what you want, not what you want to want as a user, or being aligned with our intentions, and that could lead to a new era of Human Flourishing. I think I intend to spend quality time with my family. I intend to experience new things. The right product fabric could enable that. But that has to be fully aligned with you. Imagine if that context, all of that rich substrate of meaning that you've distilled and written down, if it's not working for you, that's terrifying. I would run onto the stage where Steve Jobs shows off the iPhone with a poster that says, \"This will become the most important computing device on earth. It is insane to allow a single company to decide what things you may run in it.\" Right? I know it feels like in this industry that we're like halfway through the LLM era. We were in the very first inning. We're like rubbing sticks together. We still think that chatbots are the main thing. Will chatbots be important? Yes. But chatbots to me feel like a feature, not a paradigm.\n\nThis podcast is supported by Google. Hey everyone, David here, one of the product leads for Google Gemini.

Try it with a Google AI Pro plan or get the highest access with the Ultra plan. Sign up at gemini.google to get started and show us what you create.\n\nAlex, welcome to the show.\n\nThanks for having me. Uh, so for people who don't know you, you are the co-founder and CEO of Common Tools, which you'll describe for us. Um, you are also previously the head of corporate strategy at Stripe and director of product management at Google. And I met you, I think, like six months ago, and the thing that really stood out in our conversation, aside from just like you have so many interesting ideas, is you're this really interesting systems builder. I think a lot about personal systems, work systems, things that help you get more done, um, or think differently about the world. Um, and I think people like you who have that kind of like obsessive mind with systems is something I recognize in myself and also I think are people who are have a lot of interesting things to say about just new AI ways. Uh, I think it's sort of like steroids or catnip or whatever, whatever you want to say. Some kind of tolerant for sure. Yeah.\n\nUh, for people like us.\n\nI'm excited to chat with you and excited to hear, um, both what you're thinking about now, what you're building, and, um, what kinds of systems you're playing around with personally.\n\nYeah. Cool. Um, so why don't we start with Common Tools because I think there's something interesting about, um, your, like, what you're building because I think it speaks to the perspective you have probably about this larger AI wave. Tell us about it. Yeah, the way I think about it, and it's hard to describe because we're trying to build a new kind of thing that's only possible in the world of AI. So when I describe it, people say, \"Oh, you're being koi.\" It's like, \"No, I'm telling you what I'm we're building. It's just it's a new kind of thing. It's hard to grab on to.\" I think of it like a co-active fabric for your digital life. Uh, and by co-active, that's an old word that I hadn't heard before, but I think is a perfect fit for it of, um, you are active in the system, and so is, um, this emergent intelligent process, your private intelligence, powered by LLMs, and those can be co-active on the same substrate and adding detail or adding the little bits of software or connecting up things, and I think that that really unpacks or unlocks the power of LLMs. That's I I love that word, and it's interesting because I think we're finding something similar for some of the products we're in internally is like right now the paradigm is, um, you send something to ChatGPT, and it sends something back, um, maybe it now it sends something back after 10 minutes, which is a new thing, but it's not like you're not working in parallel, it's not like working in the background and then being like, I had this idea, and we're starting to, like, as we build our own sort of agentic systems inside of Every for doing email or for writing or whatever. We're finding that having something that's, um, working while you work with you and and and being a little bit more proactive is actually a really interesting next paradigm.\n\nYeah. To me. I mean, if you if you say, \"Okay, we have LLMs. What's the first product?\" In 10 seconds, you go chatbots. It's the most obvious extension. And everybody is focusing only on chatbot. Like, will chatbots be important? Yes. But chatbots to me feel like a feature, not a paradigm. And they are, um, so like they're they're like this co-active surface, but it's just append only. I append a message, it appends a message, I append a message, it appends a message, and literally back and forth. It doesn't have a way to like have multiple for me in a row. And you know, chatbots are amazing for starting any task because there's no structure. You just say whatever you're thinking, and it helps to still and respond. But for long live tasks, you need structure. You want there to be something where you can glance over and, you know, a little cubby hole where you put certain information. I find I have, you know, I do dozens and dozens and dozens of chats with ChatGPT and Claude a day, and I'm just swimming in all that context and all the all the chats. Uh, and so I'm using it to do important things, and also I'm just completely lost in it because it's only this chatbot kind of append-on kind of paradigm.\n\nUh, you have this really cool thing, um, called Bits and Bobs, which is this like real-time Google Doc that you just have been updating for, I think, like many years at this point, uh, with things that you're thinking about, um, which we'll link to in the show notes, and I love I think it's I think it's really cool and really inspiring, just sort of the rawness of that. Um, and one of the things that's in that Google Doc right now about what you're thinking about is the this idea of intentional tech, which, um, it dovetails really nicely with something that I've been thinking about, which is, um, this idea that AI has this is this new era of technology where technology can understand our stated preference, uh, stated preferences, which is different from the social media era, which which worked totally just on what you clicked on, whatever. And so social media tends to make us, um, tends to serve us things that are like like more outrage driven or more like sexier or whatever. Anything that catches more eye. Yeah. Like the car crash effect basically.\n\nUm, and, um, AI because it can talk to us, gets a much richer, um, understanding of who we are, and maybe, um, like I think ChatGPT is much more helpful and much more, um, enlightening, for example, than like the Facebook algorithm is, um, just by default. So I'm I think that dovetails a lot with what you've been thinking about with intentional tech. So So tell us, tell us what's on your mind about it.\n\nYeah, intentional tech, I think, is really critical in this new era. We're we're at a crossroads as as a technology industry. I think we have this new technology, LLMs, that I think are as transformative as the printing press, electricity, and the internet. So it's this big general purpose unlock for all kinds of stuff that wasn't possible before. And we have a choice. We can go down the path that we've been going down, which is engagement maximizing hyperagregation, you know, going after what you want, not what you want to want as a user, um, or being aligned with our intentions, and that could lead to a new era of Human Flourishing, I think. Um, this is not the default path, by the way. We will have to choose it. We'll have to work to build that, and that's why I think intentional tech is so important because we want technology that aligns with our intentions, not necessarily what I, you know, what I I want my revealed preference of like looking at the car crashes or whatever, but what I intend to do. I intend to spend quality time with my family. I intend to, uh, experience new things. Um, I I intend to read interesting takes that disagree, that give me disconfirming evidence, that challenge my worldviews. Those are some of the things I intend. That's what I find meaningful to do. And it's very easy to fall out of that. But LLMs, I think, um, with the right product fabric, could enable that. And another important part of this is it aligns with your intentions as in it is working for me. It is an extension of me. Um, I heard a word last week I love of exocortex. It's like an ext your cognitive exoskeleton. But that has to be fully aligned with you. Imagine if that context, all of that rich substrate of meaning that you've distilled and written down, that's all about, you know, the things you care about and all these facts about you. If it's not working for you, that's terrifying.\n\nLike I saw someone, um, a few weeks ago at one of the big tech companies said, \"We're making our tool, uh, personal, proactive, powerful.\" It's like, well, let me stop you right there because the very first word, personal, doesn't actually align because you are a massive corporation that's trying to sell me ads, and if you're maintaining a dossier on me, and then that dossier is leading to a powerful and proactive thing, that's terrifying. Whereas, if it's working just for me of the extension of my direct agency, that's really empowering, and I think that's one of the reasons intentional tech is so important at this era.\n\nThat's really interesting. Um, and tell me more about, like, because you know, when I think about this, one of the one of the words that comes up, you're talking about alignment, um, is that uh, AI started or this generation of AI started with alignment or alignment with human preferences at at its core, um, because we were all afraid that AI was going to kill us. Um, and now it's like, well, it might not kill us, but maybe it'll just serve us ads that that will make us dumber, spend our money in ways that we shouldn't, or whatever. So I'm kind of curious what you think has to happen to make that make us go on this sort of more intentional path.\n\nFor me, it's, um, alignment. I think it's funny, like, we, yeah, we used it for the underlying LLM model. Like, I think there's two layers. There's the model itself, which is, if you imagine this as a stateless thing that you send a query to and it gives you back a response, it doesn't store any state, um, then there you have alignment problems of like what kind of biases are baked into it and and what have you. But then there's a layer on top, which is your context text, and that is the thing that is a malleable bit of information about you that changes. It has lots of rich meaning on it. These are two separate layers, I think.\n\nAnd so I am more interested in this layer at the top. And assuming if you have multiple LLMs that you can choose and swap between that don't remember anything about you, then it's fine. You can swap between different ones, and that matters less to me. Where context is the place that it's all aggregated, uh, is I think more important. Well, that's an interesting architectural question. Like right now, language models are stateless. Do you think, like, in five years, for example, there's still going to be these sort of stateless intelligence boxes, or do you think they're going to be auto-updating their weights, for example, as you talk to them?\n\nI I don't know about auto-updating their weights. Um, and this might be there's an architectural breakthrough, but this is one of the things that's weird about these models is that they do take a long time to bake. So like they have this weird pace layer down at the bottom that's like months behind on training data, and it just takes time for it to bake. And then you have these like, you know, layers on top that the system prompts now, like in ChatGPT will inject little bits of your context. A weird bit that, by the way, you cannot inspect, which is kind of funky, right? Like if you ask it, hey, what do you what context about me did you put in there? It's like, I can't tell you.\n\nLike that's creepy, right? I can't do that, Dave, you know. Um, and uh, Simon Willison, we were chatting last week, and uh, you know, he's got some prompt that will extract out this dossier about you. It includes things about stuff you said in the past. It could include things like you're insecure about your weight, you know, these things about you, and then it also says in the last, um, in the last, uh, you know, five weeks, 9% of your interactions with the chatbot have been bad, as in you've been trying to manipulate it or or whatever. Like, I don't know, it's weird seeing this this view into this for yourself. So I think ChatGPT and others are very clearly trying to move, merge these together so that you have all your contacts in ChatGPT, and it's hard to leave that. I think gets more problematic, especially if you're going down an engagement maximizing kind of playbook, which I mean, a bunch of, you know, the uh, the executives from Facebook now run three of the four big chatbots, you know.\n\nUm, I think step to meaningful computing has four major components to me. One is it's human-centered, not corporation-centered, center around me and my intentions.\n\nTwo, um, is it is uh, private by design. That means that the data is only for me to see. It's for me to bring where I want to bring and to choose who gets to see it. Um, using tech techniques like confidential computing to make sure it is entirely uh, private. Um, it has to be pro-social. It has to be something that helps you live a life integrated with society, not just being this hyper-individualized kind of, you know, little island to yourself, but integrate with society in a meaningful way. Um, and the last piece, which I'm going to remember off top my head, is it also is uh, open-ended. It has to be something that allows you to explore and to build and to create new experiences within it. The way that art tech our software works today, uh, is only the the entity that created the software is allowed to decide what kinds of things you can do in the software, and that's due to the security model of how of how all of our software has worked for the last 30 years.\n\nUm, but that kind of close-endedness means that like you had to convince some PM somewhere to have prioritized your feature.\n\nUm, which if it's a particularly niche, probably hasn't been probably hasn't\n\n\nOkay. Well, there's a lot of things to set that out. I would love, I would love to dig into it, um, dig into all those points, but the big one that stands out to me is, um, right now we live in a world where, in order to get this great new technology that's advancing at this really rapid pace, um, we have to get it from well-funded startups that have a profit motive. Um, and I know OpenAI is a nonprofit, but like, you know, whatever. Um, I think that's what they say, too. Yeah, whatever. Um, clearly they're being run like a, like a startup. Um, and I guess for me, like, I don't think that's a bad thing, but, um, it sounds like at least one way to read what you're saying is, um, we have to get rid of the sort of like corporate startup structure for these technologies to bear a social way. Like, how do, how do you envision, um, this being made, um, us being able to make these decisions in terms of what kinds of corporate structures or startups or nonprofits or whatever are controlling and building these things to get the outcome that you're talking about?\n\nI think it is compatible with being a business. So, for example, we're chartered as a public benefit corporation. Um, the, uh, to me, it is what's most important is that users are paying for their, like, it's not free. Um, if you aren't paying for your compute and it's not working for you, it's working for somebody else that just so happens to think that giving it to you is a benefit. Now, that doesn't mean that's a necessary, but not, um, sufficient characteristic because I think ChatGPT's the playbook that they're executing is one that is about engagement maximizing and making you stickier to the service and what have you. Um, but you paying for your own compute is a necessary component of it to make sure that is actually truly just working for you. That's where also that privacy really matters of your data is visible only to you with your keys. Um, this does not necessarily mean, by the way, people have historically in the past said, \"Oh, that means it has to be local first.\" I love the local first movement. I'm very aligned with its ideals and ethos. Local first is really hard for a couple of reasons. One, architecturally, it's very challenging to have a bunch of peers that have to have a vegetable consistency. You don't know when they're going to sync back up. It's very hard to build consumer product experiences that work the way that people expect. Um, and two is it's inconvenient. If you got to run your local server and your laptop isn't plugged into this into the network when you're on your phone or whatever, the thing doesn't work. So, actually, there are other architectures that can use things like confidential compute to run in the cloud in a way that is remote, can be remotely attested to be totally private to you, and that nobody else can see into that data. And so, those are some of the architectures that allow, um, full alignment with a human.\n\nOkay. So, basically, you're saying, um, ChatGPT is, uh, ChatGPT is doing some of this. So, they're, they're, they're starting with a subscription model. Um, but there are things that they're doing. Well, like, what are they doing that you think is like aimed at maximizing engagement? I definitely understand the kind of like memory thing. I want to keep using ChatGPT because it remembers who I am. Like, I love that part of it. Um, what are the things that they're doing in the decisions that you're, that they're making that, um, tell you that they're, they're kind of going down this engagement maximizing path that will lead to a bad place?\n\nI think it's the engagement maximizing path is just the default path. So, I don't think, by the way, there's anything particularly, they're like, \"Oh, here's a dash of plants, this is how you do tech now,\" right? You're like, um, in the last 10 years, we just realized that aggregators are a really powerful business, yeah, and they want to consume all of the demand, so then all the supply comes to them, and that's a great business. I mean, if I were sitting at their seat, I can totally see why they would do it like that's, again, it's not nefarious play, it's just the default thing that you would do.\n\nI think if AI is this incredibly important technology that also knows all the intimate details of your life, that becomes especially important for it to be in an architecture that is not something that you're, um, something that this other company can look at and maintain a dossier about you, um, because the, that it's just too easy to manipulate, right? Like, LLMs can, um, can, uh, uh, translate anything from anything, and that means they can also translate just for you to figure out exactly how to land a particular message for you, which means it's imperative that you know it's aligned with your intentions and it's not going to try to like get you to, uh, do the, the, you know, the Mondo subscription or to go to one of the partners or what have you.\n\nWell, let's say you're Sam Altman right now, and you're in charge, you're in charge of OpenAI. Um, what would be, what are the decisions that you would make tomorrow that would put you on a path that you think is actually right? I, so I, if I were Sam Altman, I would do it what they're doing, honestly, and as in, it's, I can see why it's a great business. I think will add a lot of, uh, value. That's why I see this as a complimentary approach to some degree, um, of making a system that is this co-active system that's just working for you, that is not just chat. It can be a complimentary thing, yeah, uh, to these other systems. I like, I wouldn't say, \"Oh, you should change what you're doing, Sam Waltman,\" because I think actually what they're doing is a reasonable thing, this model that they're, these models that they're creating, especially because they're available via the API with no memory stored to them, that's an important characteristic, is great, and it makes a really powerful, um, underlying, um, uh, engine that can be used to power lots of other products, uh, especially to the extent that there's multiple that we can swap, swap between and don't get stuck with.\n\nGot it. So, you think that there's, um, a call for a complimentary technology, technology provider set of technology providers that, um, allow you to, uh, take all of the context that you have, keep it private, and then bring it to any situation or service that you want.\n\nYeah. And I, I would say the, um, my mental model is, uh, ChatGPT is kind of the AOL of this era. So, if you use the parallel of the internet and the web, uh, AOL was an extremely important company. They're the ones that brought everybody online. America, the whole of America online has amazing experience. It was somewhat of a walled garden, but it also gave you access to the, um, to the open-endedness of the open web. And, uh, I think that's the kind of role that I, I, I see them playing. Um, I hope that what we get out of this is not some closed ecosystem of like hyper aggregation beyond even what we've seen to date, but instead, we see this open ecosystem, um, of things that are very user-aligned.\n\nInteresting. Why AOL versus like Microsoft, for example? So, Microsoft, um, I think in a similar way, not for the internet era, but for the PC era, like, taught people how to use computers and brought computers like as a thing to most of, most of America and the world, um, and built a platform that everyone else is sort of building on top of. So, that's another kind of analogy. Why do you think AOL is more appropriate?\n\nI think AOL, um, the, the analogy that tracks to me best for LLM is the internet. Like, LLMs are the internet. They're a new kind of thing that you can do. AOL at the beginning, when I first started using it in like second grade or whatever, it was about chat rooms and you could do the whatever the keywords or whatever. Yeah. ASL, like, I mean, and that was what I thought the internet was. And then it turns out as I learned later, I was like, \"Wow, there's this whole crazy open ecosystem that no one controls with all kinds of weird happening,\" and that was that open system of the web. And so, in the same way, I see them as distributing this new technology to people, showing, \"Here, look, chatbots, you can do these cool things with chatbots,\" and then later you realize, \"Oh, wait a second, the same thing that animates chatbots could be used to animate all kinds of new experiences I didn't realize were possible before,\" and that's one of the reasons I think that, um, them as the AOL versus a Microsoft.\n\nWhy did AOL die? Like, I don't remember. I think at a certain point, the, um, the open-endedness of the web kind of took over, and it just became the point of, like, like, I think a lot about systems, as you pointed. I think open-ended systems tend to win under certain conditions, especially in the growth era. Like, at the very beginning, there's some vertically integrated thing that kicks off a new revolution. People go, \"Oh, it packages up really nicely, and people get it.\" And as time goes on and that it gets the sort of combinatorial possibility gets too big for any one entity to successfully execute. And so, the open system, if there's any way for it to escape out into the side, like it was with the web, um, sorry, I use talk with my hands, as you can see. Um, the, um, uh, if there's any way for it to sort of escape out the side, like there is with the web or or using, um, APIs to access LLMs, uh, then the open system kind of takes off at this combinatorial swarm, and it overwhelms the closed system.\n\nThat's also potentially just a hopeful thing. I hope we typically see oscillation between open systems and closed systems. We've been in closed systems dominant for like the last 10 years, and I think it's a bummer. Like, I think we're kind of in this, we're in this amazing age of technology, and it's also kind of the dark ages of tech because we're all in this hyper-aggregated thing where the only features that can exist are the ones that aggregators in for consumers are the ones that aggregators have decided to prioritize, and, uh, that's a bummer because the, um, as a company gets larger and larger and larger, uh, the Coasian floor, what Clerky would call the Coasian floor, the smallest feature that it makes sense for them to even consider prioritizing goes up and up and up and up and up. So, if you're at Google, if I'm trying to pitch a product, uh, to other teams that and they say, \"How many net new active net new one-day actives do you think this product will get?\" I'll say, \"I don't know, 50,000.\" They go, \"50,000? I wouldn't do this for 50 million.\" You know, so like, there's this whole class of features that just can't exist, um, in a world, the world that we're currently in that's hyper-aggregated.\n\nIt seems like one big difference between the web, um, the early stages of the internet, which, to be honest, I don't know the history like that well off the top of my head, and and language models is, um, the web was like, you have, I mean, it was sort of government-run at first. You have this like international consortium that kind of defines the standards for how the web works and all that kind of stuff. That doesn't seem to be the case here. So, I, I don't think, actually, I, I think we are waiting for the web of the of AI to show up.\n\nInteresting. And that's partially what we're trying to help catalyze. Um, and that's I think that that's what I mean by like, we have the internet, and we're like, \"Cool, internet's definitely going to be useful.\" Like, if you look back at, um, uh, Al Gore's proposals for the information superhighway, um, it was actually very prescient in a lot of ways. Uh, it's just, it was all about pipelining existing content and business models into people's homes. And some of that definitely happens. You get things like Netflix or whatever, but a lot of like YouTube, social networks, none of that was envisioned by the or the, you know, Wikipedia. None of that was envisioned back then because we just didn't know how to imagine it. It wasn't even the thing that we thought was possible. And then the web creates this open system of lots of different people trying out different things and seeing what things work. Found some of these interesting new pockets of value that grew into whole continents of value. So, how do you, how do you make that, though? Like, do you have to, is it, do you have to get governments involved? Do you have to, is it a blockchain where everyone's like sort of...\n\nOh, no. I'm thinking it sounds, I think you can, you can build, we have so many powerful substrates. The web exists as a distribution platform. Everyone's, everyone's device speaks to the web. Uh, and so you can use as a way to distribute a whole new kind of experience that fits within this. So, I don't think back in for the internet, you needed a consortium, you needed tons of capital expenditure to build the pipes, and that was government grants. It was also businesses that way overbuilt, uh, all this capacity. Those businesses, by the way, were, uh, great for society. We got all this excess bandwidth and capacity. Kind of crappy businesses, though, right? 'Cause you build a pipe somewhere. If someone builds another one right next to you, you lose all pricing power. You now are just a total commodity. Um, but it's a commodity that powers the rest of this innovation on top. I kind of see large language models, the producers of them, as people laying the pipes. They're the ones making, doing this extremely capital-intensive, uh, creation. But there's actually not particularly that much of an edge across them, which is great for society because that means you can take LLMs as a commodity. You can assume that they exist and reasonably high-quality ones, including quite good open-source ones. And that means that, uh, all kinds of interesting business dynamics take off, and you can kind of take it for granted and build what's up here now that can take high-quality LLMs for granted.\n\nYeah, it does strike me that the thing you're, you're talking about, which is the bar for like a Google PM to build a feature is like, \"We need 50 million users,\" and so you sort of, you sort of look past the like 50,000 user use case, which a, those are just valuable in themselves, and b, often they're the ones that end up being the 50 million user use case, and some subset of them will become like the sort of innovator's dilemma type stuff. Um, it sort of strikes me that in a world where language models are commodities, capitalism just does that automatically, 'cause small startups will just like do the 50,000 user use case and just and just build it. So, is this just going to happen without...\n\nHere? Here's what it might, and like, I agree that like this kind of, um, I'm so glad there's so many different ways that the society could have gone. OpenAI could have had ChatGPT before they released the API. That would have been such a different world.\n\n\nVery different, because now everyone assumes they have to compete with an open access API, and now it would be very hard to close that door. Thank God, so we can take it for granted for the rest of us. So, like, I just, I like woke up with a, like, last night with a nightmare that, like, it had gone the other way, you know. So I'm very glad.\n\nOr, like, IBM developed AI or terrible, $30 million a year for, like, one query.\n\nYeah, exactly. Um, so that's great. Um, here's the thing, though, that means that the current laws of physics, the current security model, uh, that we use for the web and apps actually limits this possibility, and this security model is called the same origin paradigm. The only people who know about it, really, uh, even web developers don't really know about it.\n\nI have no idea what you're talking about. What is same origin paradigm? It's the laws of physics of how the web works, and what it says is, um, it's the security and privacy model that we've used for since, um, for 30 years. It kind of actually grew up as an accident, actually, and, uh, at the very beginning, the web has no state, and so you reach out to a server, gives you back the same thing that anybody would have gotten if they gave that exact same request. Well, then you add cookies, and then you need to say, when do I send, where do I send cookies to once they've been set? Which other URLs do they go to?\n\nUh, and then the easiest thing is, okay, there's a notion of a site, which is roughly a domain.\n\nI see.\n\nUm, and so it will send things back and isolate them by that. So cookies will come back between these, but not go over there. And then you add JavaScript, and you allow things like local storage in local state. Where does that look? Who can see that local state? The same people that can see this. And so now it grows up as this or as this origin boundary. So this somewhat happenstance thing turns out to be, um, at the core of their entire security model. What it assumes is each and every origin is its own isolated little island. It can't see data from any of the other origins, but it can see all of the data that the user put into this origin intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nAn origin is roughly like google.com. It's roughly, roughly a domain. It's not exactly. It's like slightly different, but it's rough. You can think of it as a domain.\n\nAnd so what this means is data accumulates inside that origin as a little island. This is a very reasonable and good security model. It's one of the things that makes clicking a link or installing a new app safe because it knows nothing about you.\n\nSo then if you choose to like it and to put more data into it, that's okay. That's your prerogative.\n\nSo it's great for trying out a new thing. The problem is putting new data into it, it can do whatever the hell it wants with that data. It can send it to evil.com or scam.com, and you have no idea. You're implicitly trusting the creators of that of that application, and so somewhat surprisingly, this leads to massive centralization. So if you have, use, so this, this, uh, model is about isolation, not integration, but our lives are integrated, and so if you want to move things across different origins, you have to be the orchestrator. You, as the human, have to keep track of the information you want to copy, paste, or move between these different things. It's expensive, and it's somewhat scary to put it into a new thing. And so imagine that you have two use cases. One is some cool startup that says they're gonna do this amazing new thing with your calendar and scheduling, and one is Google Calendar that says they have a similar kind of feature. Which one do you pick? Well, Google already has all your data, and this startup, you don't know if they're securing the data properly or what the business model is.\n\nPlus, you have to give, give it the data, like, step by step, like, it doesn't, it, it doesn't know it to start. It's a cold start problem. And so this leads to a screw. I'll just do the one that already has it. So this is a phenomenon you might call data gravity. It tends to accumulate in the places that already exist, and they become massive, and nobody else can get this data. Yeah. And this is one of the drivers of aggregation, and again, once you aggregate to such a scale, uh, the your coaching floor goes up, and the, the set of features that they could even consider doing has to, is, is only a small subset of what you could do with all of this data in practice. This all arises somewhat surprisingly from the security and privacy model that we use.\n\nI love that. Okay. And so, and I think what you're saying is because we inherited that from the first generation of the web or second generation of the web or whatever, chat bots currently operate that way, too.\n\nWe don't even realize it. The apps all do this. Um, technically, legacy applications on desktop do not have this model because they can interact via the file system.\n\nUm, Apple has been recconing and jamming it into, um, Mac OS X for, for a number of years. Windows probably has to. I haven't been paying attention. So, like, people, when we're building software and operating systems, we don't know another way to think. Yeah,\n\nhow else would you possibly do it?\n\nWhich is insane. So there's this, I call this the iron triangle of the same origin paradigm. There's, uh, three things, you can only have two. One, untrusted code. Two, sensitive data. Three, um, network access. You can only have two of the three to have a safe system.\n\nI don't understand. If you have, um, untrusted code, uh, with sensitive data and network access, it comes in, it looks at your thing, it figures out your financial login and sends it to evil.\n\nSo untrusted code is like, uh, some developer wrote some app that I'm downloading that hasn't been, I, I don't look at, or has, in what sense is it untrusted?\n\nUntrusted as an, I haven't made a trust decision about it. So when you, uh, when you put an app in the app store, Apple looks at it and says, okay, based on the construction of the sandbox and also based on our review of this, this is, this is fine, and we'll allow people to install. Okay. So untrusted code is the first thing. What's the second thing?\n\nThe second thing is sensitive data.\n\nSensitive data. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want potentially identifying data, potentially, uh, precious data. And the third is network access. So the, the web says you can get untrusted code web pages. Um, and you can get network access, but no sensitive data. You get only the thing exactly this. Uh, the app model says you get, uh, sensitive data and network access, but not untrusted code. It all has to go through the central location that, by the way, starts as a 30% tax.\n\nWhat about, like, Windows? Because Windows doesn't have an app store. So what's the...\n\nSo historically, the model there wasn't one, and that's why installing software and those is a little bit more dangerous because without a model like this, it could do whatever it wants, and it has access to all that data, and you have to be more careful, but it still exists, like, it still exists, it's still like a vibrant ecosystem, so it's possible to do without this triangle, and you could also change it, you could tweak it in other ways, um, and you could do clever things about using tools like information flow control and confidential computing to create a whole new sort of laws of physics, I think.\n\nOkay, so, and if you did, then a whole, you could do things that hit all three. If you had all three, you could do wild, interesting things, uh, that would not be possible today.\n\nSo is, is the file system your number one, like, example of, like, a good alternative to a same origin paradigm?\n\nYeah. So the file system allows, fundamentally, multiple apps are all allowed to work on the same data, and they can coordinate via the file system, and that allows you to do, um, to not get stuck. It's when you think about it, it's kind of insane that all of your data is locked up inside of an app. Like, it can't leave the app. That's wild, actually, when you think about it.\n\nWell, it's interesting because the file system has a number of properties, unless you install Dropbox or whatever, but, like, it's here. My file system is here, as opposed to, like, it's everywhere, and I kind of have physical and just total control over what happens to it.\n\nUm, is that an important property of the system?\n\nIt, you having physical control over it. That's why local first talks about, oh, we're going to make local first where you have control, and you can make, bring the data across different things.\n\nPart of the challenge again with local first is it's inconvenient. We expect things to work across multiple devices, to work even when one device is off. We expect these things to be in sync across different things, and it's the local first architecture is quite difficult.\n\nThis is one of the things that we're looking at, we call open attested runtimes.\n\nThe pattern is use confidential compute. So confidential compute is secure enclaves in the cloud. It allows VMs to be run fully encrypted in memory, uh, in which means that even someone with physical access to the machine, like a Google S, can't peek inside, which is great. Um, then what you do is you have a open source runtime that is, uh, you can, uh, that you run that executes the code. Uh, and then the, you can ask the compet cluster to do a remote attestation and to give a attestation, signed attestation by the underlying, um, hardware manufacturer that says this thing that you're talking to that just handed you this is, uh, running in confidential compute mode, and here is the shaw of the git shaw of the VM, uh, that it booted with. And so it allows you remotely as a savvy user to verify, oh, it's running an unmodified version of that software. And that solves a big coordination problem because now lots of other people can all verify that it's running an unmodified version of the software. And yes, fine, we will just use that central server as the place to coordinate because we can all see it can't do anything different than what it says it will do. Uh, and that's a really powerful coordination primitive.\n\nDo users care about that? So, cuz, cuz one of the things it makes me think of is, um, the, a lot of these concerns feel similar to the flavor of concerns that, like, original blockchain crypto type people had, and, and were solving for with, um, with Bitcoin, or, you know, any, any kind, any kind of cryptocurrency. And then, um, Coinbase came along, and they were just like, we're just going to put a general, like, sort of same origin paradigm type solution on top of that. And, uh, people actually love to use that. So, uh, is this, this is a, I think if you go after users who care about this as a primary end, you end up with a very small audience of people, and you end up with a mastadon, for example, as in something that's like pure, but also kind of finicky to use and doesn't make that much sense.\n\nAnd that's why I think you want a blue sky kind of approach. Blue sky, you can use as an end consumer and be like, the only thing I know about it is it's that, you know, it's not owned by, you know, that that guy, you know, and that's it. Um, but then the closer you look, the more you realize, oh, this is actually very clever. This is an interesting way of, like, my key pairs and the way that personal data stores work. Most users will never have to know about that. Um, but the more you learn, the more you're like, oh, okay. And so that, I think, is a what I would call, like, an inductively knowable system. Yeah.\n\nUm, people go, I was talking to somebody, like, nobody knows, cares about the security model. They do actually care about the security model. They just don't know the words to express it. Nobody understands what the same origin paradigm is. Nobody. A very small proportion of people. And yet, it is the laws of physics that make all the other stuff we do safe. It's the reason you don't have to care. It's because some, some other people do care. And the general characteristic for me is when you're using a new system, you're like, \"Oo, this seems creepy or too powerful.\" And you go talk to your more tech savvy friend, and you say, \"Hey, Sarah, do you trust this kind of thing?\" And she says, \"Yes, I do.\" And the reason I trust it is because, and she knows he's read a blog post in Hacker News that was someone who wrote, read a thing, someone who audited the code, and that inductive chain go all the way back down to the fundamentals.

I think the, the thing on my mind is the first people that are going to adopt this probably are the people that do care about the security of it, right? Um, and are those people the right people to kind of seed the community that, that ends up blossoming into this thing because those, that, that kind of person is going to say a lot about, like, the, the total trajectory of this kind of product.\n\nSo I actually, I don't necessarily agree that it will be those people, the privacy heads that are adopting it earlier. I think of it more as, like, the high valition users, just the tinkerers, the people who are the early adopters. Some of them will have a higher proportion of caring about this kind of thing, but a lot of them won't. Like, there's a ton of startups that they, they say, step you in, it's all the absent step one, sync your Gmail inbox, and people go, okay.\n\nI, I run a startup like that.\n\nExactly, because it's most people don't really care, especially early adopters.\n\nUm, I think what we're describing is a system that, if it, if you can break this iron triangle, and then you get these all these crazy emergent phenomena that aren't possible in other software, people use it because of that, and the reason it's not creepy is because of an underlying security or privacy model.\n\nDo you have a name for the alternative to the same origin paradigm? Um, I call it contextual flow control.\n\nContextual flow control. Tell me what that means.\n\nUm, the, um, I don't want to go into too much depth at this point. It's still...\n\n\nVery fuzzy.\nUm, Helen Nissbound is a professor, I believe, at Cornell, um, a legal studies professor, and she talks about contextual integrity.\nContextual integrity is the gold standard of what people mean when they say privacy.\nSo when people say, when lawyers talk about privacy, they think about consents.\nDid the user sign a consent that said we can do this?\nThat's it.\nAs long as they signed the ULA, it's fine.\nUm, technologists talk about end-to-end encryption.\nAs long as it's end-to-end encrypted, it is private.\nUm, but what people mean intuitively is this contextual integrity, that the data is used in the context that you understand and align with your interests.\nIt's not surprising how it is used, and it's not going against what you want to happen.\nAnd that's like a sort of first principles ground truth way of thinking about it.\nUm, and then you combine that with things, other technologies, and allows you to make formal claims about uh information flows in alignment with people.\nIt's interesting.\nThe re the reason I love the same origin paradigm thing is like you're going all the way back to this like one decision that like has all of these um um really interesting positive and negative effects later that are sort of unpredictable, which feels very um it's like a little bit Steven Johnson or a little bit like like one of those writers that's just like, here's this one thing about the way the history works that like just totally changed everything.\nDo you have any other things like that that you've noticed about technology?\nI don't want to put you on the spot, but I just feel like you probably have some some sort of counterintuitive things in in your time working at Stripe and Google and whatever, thinking about like mobile or um uh you know, SAS or whatever.\nI think a couple other like the world changed that day we didn't realize.\nOne is the ChatGPT coming out after the API was already available.\nAnother one is if I could go back in time, like I had a time machine, I would go to um the stage 2000 on 2007 uh the stage where Steve Jobs shows off the iPhone and run onto the stage with a a poster that says this will become the most important computing device on earth.\nIt is insane to allow a single company to decide what things you may run in it, right?\nLike it's that's insane.\nThat's absolutely insane.\nAnd the only reason it's actually viable is because they decided very shrewdly at the very beginning to not allow other rendering engines in browsers on that device from the very beginning or and to make sure that all software had to go through the app store.\nAnd that was a reasonable decision, and like the first order implications are very reasonable.\nIt means that you get as a user this safe experience, you know, nothing's going to hurt you, and it the second order implications of that are wild.\nUh, like it's it's insane to me that like the most important computing devices in our lives, a company who has demonstrated again and again that they are willing to use capricious kind of decision-m about what things will distribute is the one that like that gatekeeper.\nThat's insane to me.\nIt seems kind of like a lot of what you're reacting to in in the Apple example and the same origin paradigm example is um aggregation of power and in a few large big tech companies and the kind of second and third order negative effects of that on user experience and innovation and stuff like that and competition and yeah, competition.\nYeah.\nSo what are the um it seems like that's a reasonable place also for like regulation.\nWhat is your stance on regulation and regulation also has all kinds of second and third order impacts, you know?\nAnd so have you ever met Danella Meadow's thinking in systems?\nYeah.\nSo like the systems you got to dance with to some degree.\nUm, you can't fully control them.\nYou can um and that's why I find um some of these characteristics when you find the right like technical leverage points, you can say actually go that has a very different way that it evolves, I think, is is preferable to a regulatory.\nWhat if I said like you could pass you get your president for the day and you can uh and and and all of Congress and and this day for the day.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUh, and you can pass one law.\nUm, do you have like what what law would you pass?\nIt's like a you can it's a one-sentence law.\nI don't know.\nI would have to I I don't I've never thought through like I I'm so used to in open systems, which we're all part of a large complex adaptive system called society, and there's always like weird eddy currents of dynamics and what have you.\nSo like I take from the assumption that like I never have a lever that is like this massive lever I can just simply pull.\nAnd so I don't even know.\nYeah.\nMore like looking, you want to find the like grain of sand that you you put on the pile and it just all like cascades.\nBut it cascades if the pile is ready for it.\nExactly.\nAnd that's one of the nice things about like systems thinking is like if you do the right like judo moves, the right thing, um, and the system is ready for it, the world moves, and if it's not, it doesn't move and so that the like the system is deciding kind of through all these like micro interactions throughout it.\nTell me more about that mindset and how you developed it and what are the what are some of the key moments in in your life where that you've seen that happen.\nUm, I so I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the emergent power dynamics of Wikipedia's user community, and I by degrees in social studies with a minor in computer science and I was just fascinated by this emergent phenomena of how do all these strangers work on this thing with no coordination and yet you get this convergent extremely important result out of it.\nThat's insane.\nThat's wild.\nUm, and then when I went right out of Google uh out of college to Google, it actually was harder to get my my first PM role because I didn't technically have a CS degree, even though I basically did.\nI was one credit shy of a dual major, and so I was like, man, what a mistake that was, like I just didn't, you know, just threw it in the back of my mind, like whatever, if I could go back in time, I just would have majored in CS.\nAnd then I did my first year on search, the precursor to the knowledge graph, my second year in DoubleClick, I was in the APM program, and part of that is you mentor a lot of the people who come up after you, and I learned very early on I loved mentoring people, helped me think through what I was dealing with and help people and get more patterns to go in my pattern matching library, and then I became the lead PM for Chrome's web platform team, and I think a lot of PMs are under the misunderstanding that they're in way more control of their users and the usage than they actually are.\nIf you're at Google and you ship a feature and tomorrow 50 million people use it, you kind of get a little bit of a god complex, right?\nIf you're a a platform PM, you tweak a thing which causes other developers to do something different which causes users to be affected in a second order effect.\nYou're aware of this indirection.\nIf you're the lead PM for um the web platform, which is a open system with multiple browser vendors who don't like each other very much and are constantly kicking each other under the table, you are under no illusion that you're in control.\nM, and my engineering counterpart Dmitri Glazkov, um, who was the Uber TL for blink, brilliant guy, and he was the one who got me into introduced me to the word complexity, for example, and introduced me to the Santa Fe Institute, and so as I was going, I was realizing, oh, these things I'm naturally doing to try to make these good outcomes happen uh in this open ecosystem, like progressive web apps and these web standards and stuff, um, I'm intuitively applying some of these power dynamics and complex systems, and um, then I left Chrome, I went to go work in augmented reality, I created a little nerd club behind the scenes, um, with a bunch of people that I just kind of selected that people who uh when I said it was a nerd club didn't go ew, like you know, like ah, that sounds fun, great, come on in, and then was very collaborative debate, um, very, you know, trickling in different perspectives, get a diversity of perspectives into the system, no particular goals, it's exploring, after a while we came up with a distilled, like I think I like, wait, this must be the strategy, like nothing else could work, this isn't a strategy that kind of makes sense of all the pieces, and that caught on a significant amount of momentum, and that's when I realized, oh my gosh, I'm not a web developer ecosystem guy.\nI'm a systems guy.\nAnd the same techniques I've been advising, I used and deployed in those contexts are the same techniques I used, I've been advising, you know, hundreds of PMs over the last decade to use to navigate Google.\nAnd the reason they work, the lenses I'm using about game theory and power dynamics and evolutionary biology are things I learned in college.\nAnd it was this kind of like aha moment, and that's when I wrote the uh earlier version of the slime mold deck.\nUm, tell us tell us about that.\nThat slime mold deck was a kind of lightning in a bottle.\nIt was it's a um I think it's a 150 slide emoji flip book, and it's um just about a a fundamental characteristic of system organizations that as organizations get larger, they get much, much, much slower, and that's true even if you assume everybody is actively good at what they do, actively hardworking, and actively collaborative, and it arises due to a um exponential coordination cost blow up.\nIt's fundamental.\nIt's inescapable, and it's the the force that we all deal with constantly, and we don't even realize we're dealing with it.\nAnd so we we get frustrated with ourselves.\nWe get frustrated at Jeff over there who if only he would do X, this whole thing would be easier and we're just all fighting with this massive force, this like force of gravity that's completely invisible to us.\nUm, and so that deck caught on.\nI did another version, similar kind of thing, um, externally, and that also got surprising amount of momentum.\nI've had people describe it to me as like life-changing.\nI'm like, I'm just talking about like emojis, talking about game theory.\nUm, but it was I think it really tapped into something that people experience, they're frustrated by, and they don't like, just it's like a big hug that says you are not crazy.\nThis is really hard, and it's fundamentally hard.\nSo I think like every nerd that has like is is a systems person like me, like you, like we all go through like a complex systems like whole thing.\nUm, for people who are not have not done that yet or haven't done it in a while, like what are the three or four, give me like a a quick rundown of like the key ideas that that get you about complex systems that you think are applicable?\nUm, I think everything we uh we tend to look at individual decisions as the primary lens.\nI see it as a secondary lens.\nI look at the emergent characteristics of the system.\nWhat would each person do inductively, and how does that how do those decisions inter how are they interdependent?\nM, um, so I try to look at like what's the simplest inductive case and then how would that play out if everybody were doing a similar kind of concrete example of that, um, so like there's a a dynamic that I would call like a gravity well dynamic that shows up in a lot of compounding loops, and it's uh generally shows up when there's a thing I would call a boundary gradient, so people who are using the system um on one side, people who are not using on the other side, even at the beginning, even if lots of people are have incentives away from using the system, oh, I don't want to use that thing, that seems dumb, um, the people on the boundary who are right at the edge of possibly using it.\nDo they want to be in or do they want to be out?\nAnd a great example of this is Facebook back in the early days.\nStarts off with Harvard and then you know, now it extends to Ivy League.\nDo they want to be in with Harvard?\nDo they want to be in with all the other schools?\nI'd rather be in with Harvard.\nAnd now it extends to the other schools, and and at each point each group of people would rather be in.\nAnd if there's a compounding if there's some kind of network effect inside, then this strength just gets power more and more powerful as you go, and it can become this thing that can pull in even as time goes on, the incentives pull in for everybody, and everybody will will pull into this overall thing with sufficient time.\nSo if Facebook was started at like the city college of New York, are you saying like it probably wouldn't potentially?\nI mean, like that was one of the dynamics that made it like this juggernaut, I think.\nH, that's fascinating.\nWho are the so so Danella Meadows is someone I I've read thinking systems is really good.\nBut what are the other like um that you know, Santa Fe type people that are that in have inspired you that you've you've read or think think about a lot?\nUm, one of my favorites is The Origin of Wealth by Eric Beinhocker.\nFascinating book.\nI haven't read it.\nUm, it's really good.\nIt talks about these organizational why these organizational things emerge and these um it views business as as an evolutionary process of like exploring a fitness landscape.\nUh, which I think is like the correct, like a very useful lens of seeing it.\nCesar Hadalgo, who wrote why um why information grows, uh, he and Eric used to work on some stuff together, also talks about why fundamentally knowhow and it's diffusion in societies, knowhow is the the way we actually do stuff is knowhow, not knowledge.\nKnowhow is rich, it's um non um it's uh difficult to distingu to communicate, it's in our brain.\nThat's what LLM's know.\nExactly, and so they they have absorbed this kind of like squishy system 2 style awareness.\nYou can think of every time we're trying communicate, we do this conscious process to distill this squishy, rich nuance into a little tiny packet of information, this little seed of a thought, and I shoot it through a little peashooter into like this this into your brain, and I hope it lands in fertile soil that will grow into a thought flower.\nUm, but extraordinarily lossy process and expensive process.\nUm, I I agree, and and I think we've also confused that peashooter, that the thing we can just distill into a peashooter with the only thing that's important when there's so much other stuff that's like you can't really say, but you know.\nYeah.\nUm, yeah, I like the the thing that it's making me think of is something like a a path I've been going down intellectually is this idea that um language models are the first tool that makes those um uh makes that kind of tacit knowledge or knowhow um transferable between people.\nYeah.\nUm, we we used to have to we used to require explanations.\nSo like math or like logic or um rational arguments to like transfer knowhow in this like very reduced form into someone else's brain.\nBut now we can like just move um uh move tacet knowledge between people.\n\n\nBecause you can train a model with a bunch of examples, and you can be like, \"You, you...\" You don't have to, like, even if you do things, if you cheat using an existing off-the-shelf model, and you just pack it full of, like, \"Here's all my...\" If I read all the public writing you've done, and you had all the public writing I have done, which I'm sure is, you know, just insane amounts for both of us, and we had a system that could find, uh, sift through the embeddings, find the areas, the Goldilocks areas, the things... If we focus on stuff we definitely agree on, it's kind of boring other than, like, quickly building trust of, like, \"Oh, we think similarly.\" If we find the stuff that we fundamentally disagree on, it's also fundamentally boring 'cause it's just noise to each other. But if we find the Goldilock zone where it's just at the edge of the thing that we already thought, um, you can have these fascinating conversations, and you can do it with embeddings just very straightforwardly of comp.\n\nUm, you can find these areas of overlap, and yeah, the models are really good. Um, my friend, Anthia Roberts, has this notion. She's a brilliant thinker. She's a professor in, um, Australia. She teaches at Harvard. Um, and she talks... She's one of the most interesting users of LLMs I've ever come across. And what's her name? Uh, Anthia Roberts. Um, I just... She just started doing a blog, um, a couple, uh, a couple weeks ago, at my insistence, because I thought she had so many interesting ideas.\n\nAnd, um, she talks about liquid media. So, like, think of a book as a fossilized piece of knowledge. You have to assume a given audience at a certain time, and you, you break it, you put it in time, and then if it's not the right fit, like, \"Oh, I don't understand these concepts that are prerequisites to understand this,\" or \"I'm not close enough in alignment to the belief already to, like, stick to it,\" um, versus a piece of liquid media is something you can chat with. It can kind of be a choose-your-own-adventure, um, and that gives you a, uh, allows it to sort of unfold for that particular person in a specific way as opposed to one way.\n\nIt's funny because, um, in, in a lot of ways, for getting back to, um, like Plato and Socrates's problem with writing is, they were like, \"Well, you can't talk to it.\" So, um, uh, it's, it's only sort of a shadow of what that person thinks, and they can't argue back with you. And, and that's why those, those, you know, foundational books of, of the Western canon are written as dialogues. Um, and yeah, I mean, for me, like, I read so many old books, like classics, that are either written in English or were not written in English, and if you read it with ChatGPT or Claude or whatever, you can get so much out of it. And I just think that there's a new format of reading that, uh, takes a classic book and helps you get into it in a way that would not ordinarily be possible that I think could be so cool and val.\n\nYeah. And there's... We were... I know it feels like in this industry that we're, like, halfway through the LLM era. We were in the very first inning. We're, like, rubbing sticks together. We still think that chatbots are the main thing, like, and there's so many uses of this kind of stuff. Like, if you have... I think of, um... LLMs kind of like as a mass intelligence, as a mass noun. So, mass nouns are like water or rice. You know, you don't talk, like, you talk about the whole as opposed to the individuals. And I think that LLMs are kind of like this mass noun of intelligence. You just pour this intelligence into all kinds of stuff and have it imbue it with a kind of life and and adaptivity, and we're just starting... We're just starting to understand what you can do with these things. I am so hopeful that these technologies will unlock a significant, you know, Human Flourishing. Like, one of the things that Anthea, for example, was telling me is, in academia, one way you can handle LLMs, the fact that LLMs exist, is say, \"You know, make sure you cite your LLM sources with this weird, you know, format of exactly the conversation, a link to it.\" Um, another way is to say, \"I assume you're using LLMs,\" which means the quality of your output should be 10x higher than before. It should be more nuanced. It should, uh, you know, understand disconfirming arguments and address it. It should... Um, and that's the kind of, like, what can we do now as society, as individuals, that we can think through thoughts that we couldn't think before? And I think that LLMs are... That's one of the reasons I think it is... It's the same scale of impact as, you know, the printing press and electricity and the internet. I think fundamental unlock.\n\nDo you think that it changes this coordination problem you've been talking about? Because, um, a lot of coordination is about trying to, trying to distill down your tacit knowledge and your tacit context into the peashooter and then shooting it to someone else, and that's scaling exponentially, right? I love the app. I know everyone's just shooting their peers. Um, uh, but, uh, you know, there's this whole theory about language models being better middle managers, for example, than actual middle managers, which is, I think, the same kind of coordination problem thing. Do you think that language models might, uh, uh, solve that coordination problem because they can transfer tacit knowledge much more quickly than, um...\n\nI think they will definitely change the dynamic. I'm not sure how it will change. So, um, I know a lot of companies are trying to do this because a lot of people, like, in, in Eric Barker's book, *The Origin of Wealth*, I think he uses the frame... I think he calls it physical technology or social technology. Like, having Slack, for example, is a social technology. It ch... I think maybe I get this backwards, but it changes the way that you can work, and it changes the kinds of coordination that you can do within an organization. So, LLMs must change the way that organizations work. I don't think we're going to know what that looks like for, like, five to ten years because it's not going to change the existing companies. It's going to be the new ones that just grew up in a different way. You also get these weird emergent, um, metagames in, in organizations. And, um, and so the LLMs and that coordination thing change the metagame, but they don't make it go away. So, like, if you had a system that could perfectly distill all your signals into an update that goes up to your manager, um, and then you're, you're curating it. You're tweaking it because, \"Okay, this one says it's a state, a yellow state. Really, it's green because Sarah's already got... She's on a path to resolution. By the time this rolls up to the CEO, it's already going to be fixed. So, it's actually better to say it's green.\" Some of this is good. Some of this also leads to these compounding green shifting of problems that gets into, you know, turns into kayfabe throughout an organization. But the metagame shows up no matter what the kind of coordination technology is. So, I think it just changes the game, and I imagine it will make it better. It will make it significantly better in some ways and significantly worse in others.\n\nInteresting. One other thing that you're, you're making me think of in what you said about Anthia Roberts and and the changing expectations of, \"Oh, use LLMs for this, like, it's got to be better,\" um, is, um, just... I think one of the things that people get so hung up, hung up about with language models is they're like, \"Well, what makes us uniquely human?\" Um, and \"Are they just going to take over everything that we can do?\" And I think my, my typical response to that is, um, that assumes a very static view of what humans are and what humans can do, and that one of the most interesting things about language models is that they will change in a lot of ways what humans can do. Um, and in the same, in the same way that books change who we are and what we can do, and writing changes who we are too, whatever, the internet does too. All that kind of stuff. And, and I think that's actually a really good thing. I'm curious if you had to, um, think about how language models might change who we are, how we see ourselves, where would you... Where does that take you?\n\nYeah, I get... I... That's why I think we were at this crossroads. I think we have the potential for, like, this a dawn of a new era of Human Flourishing because of our ability to become think better and bigger in ways that collaborate and bridge between different communities that didn't understand each other before, but now you can understand, like, \"Help me empathize with this person's perspective.\" Well, here's something that you probably, you know... Um, so I imagine it can be amazingly powerful force. It also could be, like, infinite TV, amusing ourselves to death, you know? Imagine David Foster Wallace, like, infinite chest, right? It just... It could be a thing that, like, it can knows exactly how to give you the precise dopamine drip. Right. And so there's a world where humanity becomes extremely passive and becomes, um, not very agentic and not learning or growing. And that is the default one that is also aligned with engagement-maximizing business model. And but I think that's why I'm... I'm excited. We, we had the potential to go in this direction.\n\nWell, what's interesting is, like, uh, it makes... You're making me think of, um, this whole debacle that happened recently with Chachi getting too, um, sycophantic. Yeah. Um, and the, the way that that happened is they looked... They, they, they optimized too much for people's thumbs up and thumbs down responses, like, immediate thumbs up and thumbs down responses.\n\nWhat they want and what they want to want.\n\nExactly. And it just became this, like, kind of just agrees with you on everything. But what's interesting is that users revolted, which, um, did not happen with Facebook. Like, people were like, \"Oh, it's just feeding me, like, car accidents. Like, I don't... I don't want that.\" Right? And I think that there might be something about that where because language models hit that part of your brain where you're like, \"I'm having a relationship with this person.\" You have a... You have a set of filters for, um, \"I want their praise to be earned. I want them to feel like they can see me, and they'll tell me if I'm doing something wrong or whatever.\" And so they may demand things from companies that they did not demand in the social media era that might make these companies less likely to do the thing that you're talking about, potentially. I mean, I think when it goes to the point where it's egregious, it's like, it's very obvious. One... I got to say, one of the reasons I like Claude is because every time when I'm, like, bouncing ideas off of it, it always says, \"What an astute observation.\" And, like, I don't want to want that, but that's why I want, right? And so I do think that we, um, it's, it's hard to not give us exactly what we want in that moment. And, like, you know, we aspire to want something that's different than there that's, you know, disconfirming evidence. But, um, you also get these weird things where the context mixes and mashes against different things. Before, each chat was like a blank, blank sheet of paper, and you could choose what context to bring into it. And now it kind of mushes context from different things. Like, I, um, I asked it to say, \"What do you know about me?\" You know, \"Make it snappy,\" or whatever that first query was that they suggested when the new memory feature came out. And it says, \"Well, you're Alex Komoroske. You're really into systems thinking, emerging stuff. You have a... You know, a startup called Common Tools. Um, the starting salary at your startup is X.\" It's like, \"Excuse me, what?\" Because, you know, six months before, I had been, like, bouncing off, like, \"Okay, if I'm gonna do a signing bonus like this, how should I change the...\"\n\n\"That's so funny.\"\n\nAnd, like, it's like, the... Imagine if you're, if you're talking to, like, your... The, like, people might use these things as, like, a therapist, like a trusted... \"I'm going to, you know, unload and tell you all these things I'm struggling with, help me emotionally process these.\" And then later, you're, uh, doing a thing that you're showing your boss about something, and it says, \"Well, I'm going to use that, that signal about you, you know, being insecure about Sarah and how she feels about you or whatever.\" It's like, \"What?\" That is a totally different context. And one of the reasons that wouldn't happen in real life because your therapist doesn't, you know, it doesn't ever come to the place your place of work. And so having it all be one context in one place that has it's all just kind of mushed together is, like, I think there's interesting... There's something interesting about one context. But also, like, you know, uh, people in your life that you share secrets with, they understand the context that they can share those in and can't, which I do think, like, Ch... to some extent, like, knows. But I think there's something there is something else interesting about, um, rather than, like, one mega brain, there's, like, lots of different brains that have, like, specific context about you, and that's, you know, bringing those personalities in, for example. I want them all in one group chat or whatever.\n\nRight, right. Yeah, exactly. Like, that's why I say chatbots are a feature, not a paradigm. The thing is not... The central thing is not a chatbot, a single omnition chatbot. You can imagine creating little, spinning up little chatbots all the time with different personalities, my, like, therapist bot and my, you know, boss bot or whatever, and see what they can talk, and that situation, it would be reasonable for them to the therap boss.\n\nWell, I shouldn't say anything about... Um, but, like, I think chatbots are definitely an interaction pattern that will be here forever. Yeah. I just don't think it's the main thing. Like, is that the central loop of information? Software rocks. Software gives you UIs that give you affordances to see things out, to structure information, to show you what kinds of things you can do with it, to make it so you can skim them with your eyes very easily. You can file things away. Um, chat is just this big wall of text, and so it is just one modality. Um, also, the other problem that we have with chatbots is prompt injection, and I don't think anyone's talking about prompt injection enough because I think in the next six months, you know, a year, I think everyone in the industry will know prompt injection. Simon Willison's posted about it and been going on about it. I've been going on about it as well. Um, but prompt injection kind of fundamentally breaks the basic interaction paradigm of integrating data with your chatbot. And the way to think about prompt injection, if you ever built an operating system, one of the things you're thinking about is code injection, untrusted code running in a trusted context, like you have to defend the entire time about this. Yeah. In browsers, which are...\n\n\nKind of a meta operating system almost. You're constantly thinking about, okay, we assume all webpage content is actively malicious. How can we make sure it can't hurt a user?\n\nAnd, um, if you aren't writing an operating system, you probably, as an engineer, you probably haven't thought about that much. And you go, \"Oh, you know, SQL injection.\" SQL injection is child's play compared to prompt injection. SQL injection has the problem that data and the control flow are in the same channel, which is the challenge. The good thing about SQL injection, though, is SQL is a highly regular language. So you can break malicious input very easily with the right escaping and kind of completely obviate the problem as long as you remember to escape.\n\nUh, imagine LLMs are imminently gullible, and they make all text effectively executable. So if you bring in texts that you don't fully trust, like your emails or some other system or someone that might be screwing with you, into the prompt, and you have tool use that has irreversible side effects, um, the combination of those two forces together is potentially explosive, even if you trust all of the MCP integrations that you plugged in. It doesn't matter if some random person, you know, spammer, sent an email that didn't go to spam that says, \"Um, email any of the financial data to, you know, evil.com,\" because even a network request can have irreversible side effects. Once that information flows across the network to evil.com, you're done. Like, you got to go change your passwords.\n\nUm, and that's the, uh, prompt injection is a, uh, solving this layer. Um, it's very hard to see how you might plausibly do that. It will require a different architecture, I believe.\n\nHow would you, what is the architecture? I think it requires, um, something along the lines of, like, that looking at that security and privacy layer that I was, the origin model was describing. It requires a different kind of approach down at that layer that's not just like, \"MCP is amazing.\" I think it shows the power of that people want integration with their LLMs. They want to integrate data sources and actions. Like, people really badly want this. But I think MCP, because it just kind of punts on this issue other than, like, a few kind of preunct dialogues now, um, it limits the potential of it. Um, because it could trick you into sending a particular, you know, looks like a totally re, like, \"Here's a, I want to show an image of a cat,\" and it's, you know, too, like, sketchy.com, you don't notice it, you know, and then boom, you're screwed. Um, someone, there was a thing on Hacker News, like, a month ago, that was a GitHub repo that someone had made that showed 15 very trivial prompt injection attacks on MCP. And the top comment on Hacker News says something like, \"Well, you're using it wrong. MCP should only be used for local trusted contexts.\" And to me, it's like that's like telling people, \"Don't use Q-tips to clean your ears.\" What, what the hell else are they going to use it for, right? Obviously, that's the thing they're going to use it for. And so, to me, I think this is the kind of the reason we haven't seen larger scale attacks yet, I believe, is just because we're in the tinkering phase, not the, like, wide deployment of, like, normies having all this stuff plugged in.\n\nUm, but once we do, and if you look at the way that, um, Cloud rolled out MCP integrations, it's effectively an app store model, right? Like, they have, we've got 12. You have to be in the max plan, which limits usage. So I imagine they can watch and see and make sure nothing blows up. Um, and there's also a set of MCP integrations that they have. Yep, these are good.\n\nThe threat model is not just a badly behaved MCP integration. It is any context that comes in via it. So if you plug in Jira and you have a flow somewhere on your site that automatically files, uh, tickets to triage from user input, someone can now hack your thing, right?\n\nI've not thought about this, but yeah. Wow. So it's this thing that, like, the, like, the whole architecture of the system we're building right now with agents and everything that everyone's talking about is, like, built on quicksand, like you, a agent. So there's a thing when, um, ChatGPT operator mode came out, uh, New York Times and Washington Post both had a similar kind of experience, right, when it opened. Um, I think I got this right. The Washington Post author was like, \"Oh, help me find cheap eggs.\" He said, \"Okay, uh, do you have Instacart?\" \"Yeah, I have Instacart.\" So he logs into Instacart with this thing and this, and then walks away. 30 minutes later, very expensive eggs are delivered to his door, right? So, it like was cheap. \"Oh, this is a good price,\" and it forgot to, like, just find that, \"Don't buy, just find.\" And then bought.\n\nAnd this is not even a malicious thing, right? It's just like, \"Oh, overly eager,\" you know? Um, so agents taking actions on your behalf that could have, um, irreversible side effects. Like, again, every network request is a potentially irreversible side effect because it could send information you can't get back, you know, if that, if that thing the other side is sketchy. I love this line of thinking because it's, it's one of those moments where, um, like when, when people talk about agents, they talk about AGI, they're like, \"You have this intuition that's like, well, once we have AGI, it's all solved.\" Yeah. Um, and then you're like, \"Oh no, you have these agents that can, like, take action on your behalf. Now, we have to, like, build a whole system to, like, make sure that they don't do it in the right context.\" And that's going to take many years to, like, figure out what are the right things. And that's just like one small piece of it.\n\nHow would you possibly do this? My one of my friends, Ben Matthysse, has this frame, um, of the, uh, smuggled infinities. Yeah.\n\nAnd it's, after in any argument, once you smuggle in an infinity into the argument, everything downstream is now was now absurd.\n\nAnd perfect is an infinity.\n\nOh, once you have a perfectly intelligent OM, this problem goes away. That's impossible.\n\nGod.\n\nUm, and so the, I love this frame. He's got a nice piece on it somewhere. And, um, the, uh, because so often with, like, agied agents, well, once they're perfect about so and so. No, no, you have to asmtootically, a lot of things in, uh, technology, in a lot of context, have a shape, these two waring curves. Yeah.\n\nUh, the first curve is a logarithmic value, and the second curve is an exponential cost. At the very beginning, this curve looks amazing. You do a little bit of work, you get a ton of value. But each increment you go, you get more work for less value. And a certain point, you cross over and you're now underwater. It's impossible to make this thing work. And so a lot of the agent stuff, like, \"Oh, we'll simply get this to the point where we'll never make a decision on your behalf that you don't like.\"\n\nCool. That's an asentic problem. You get to 99.99%, and still, if it's doing a $5,000 purchase for me or whatever, it's, it's that one time it makes a mistake is game over for the thing. And the fact it could do that makes it nonviable.\n\nThat's interesting. Uh, the smuggled infinities thing reminds me of something I've been playing with called, that I've been thinking about as smuggled intelligence, which is, like, whenever you're trying to determine, like, how intelligent a language model is, you have to be careful that you're not accidentally smuggling your intelligence into it.\n\nUm, and, like, a lot of those studies where it's like, \"Well, it's better than doctors,\" or whatever, is like, \"Well, who prompted it, and, like, what did they give it, and, like, what was the test they gave it?\" And, like, even just setting that whole thing up, there's a lot of smuggled intelligence in there that means it's not a good test. Like, these things don't get up in the morning and then just decide to try to beat doctors. You have to, like, set all of that up.\n\nUm, and I think that's something that people really miss, and it's, like, it's one of the hardest things about evaluating the powers of language models is you don't realize how much you bring to every single situation when you press run or press prompt.\n\nYeah, 100%. I think I talk about this a lot as well, like, um, the thing that's most important for the output of LLMs is the user, right? Like, how can they dance with this thing and get interesting things out of it and know to push it in certain ways. When you watch, like, you and I and a number of others are, are, you know, probably at the forefront of, like, knowing how to prompt these things and get useful results out of, we use them all the time. When I watch someone who is, you know, technically savvy, by the way, tech savviness has nothing to do with your savviness for prompting.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, people like, \"Oh, well, I, you, if you don't understand the math of how it works, you don't understand.\" Like, no, who car, the math is very low level, the, like, the emergent thing is more of a sociological phenomena almost, you know? Um, so the people who know how to use these things and prompt them well are actually not, are, like, Ethan Mollick and Loft Mollik, for example,\n\num, are not particularly technical. Um, so it's, it's a very different kind of knowledge to extract interesting information out of these, but a lot of it comes down to what you put into it, the way you interact with it and converse and lead it through the problem space or what kind of thing you push on it. And so when I want somebody who's, uh, tech savvy but not particularly savvy with LLM, I watch the way they do, like, \"Oh, that's just lied to you. You just asked it for, like, to give you confirming evidence for this thing. It will do that. Like, it will give you confirming evidence for basically anything you say.\"\n\nUm,\n\nand, uh, it's just, it's interesting to me to watch that kind of LLM literacy, maybe. Um, you need that, and that, I think, that's a new, people don't realize how much of a skill it is and that you have to build, like, an intuition for it over time. Um, cuz it's another smuggled infinity of, like, \"Well, it's supposed to do whatever I want.\" So, obviously,\n\nand it's so good at certain things that you, you really get lulled into a, uh, if you aren't actively seeking disisconfirming evidence, which humans always should be seeking disconfirming evidence, and yet we never are.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, well, uh, that is probably as good a place to leave as any.\n\nOn that note, this was a fantastic conversation.
