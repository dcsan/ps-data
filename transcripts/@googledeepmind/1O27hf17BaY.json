  "cleanText": "What can you see right now, Gemini?\n\nOkay, I see a woman with blonde hair sitting at a desk with a microphone in front of her. She has her arms crossed and is smiling. There's a computer keyboard and mouse on the desk and a lamp in the background. What else can you tell me?\n\nThat has been so useful in diagnosing my sick house plants. I can't tell you. And so like if I describe, you know, that I want to hear a song that reminds me of being in a rainy cafe in Japan at nighttime, like that's something that you would really want to have all of these different modalities coming together to understand as opposed to just, you know, guessing at what a brainy cafe might sound like.\n\nIt's like a two-dimensional version of a fully immersive experience.\n\nExactly. And this is the notoriously difficult challenge that people have used to see how good AI is. So instead of having one person eating spaghetti, we just had like 10 people eating spaghetti all at the same table.\n\nI mean there was a lot of Will Smith eating spaghetti for a number of years. I seem to remember and so Will Smith eating spaghetti. Uh like that is so last year. Let's try let's try multiple people eating spaghetti.\n\nWelcome to Google DeepMind the podcast. I'm Professor Hannah Fry. Now, one of the things that we've always done with this podcast is to bring you access to the people who are working on some of the biggest breakthroughs in AI. And a lot of the time the researchers, they're talking about techniques and technology that underpins big ideas. But now we are at a stage where more and more of the tools that we have seen the early iterations of here are now live. They are out there in the world for you to interact with. So what we wanted to do in this episode is just to pause to look at the array of tools that have been released, talk about how they have changed since we first encountered them and to explore the myriad ways that they can be used. And if that is our objective for today, well, there is no one better to show us this progress than Paige Bailey, AI developer, relations engineering lead at Google DeepMind.\n\nPaige, welcome to the podcast.\n\nThank you so much for having me. Um the thing is is that we get to see a lot of the early iterations of this stuff. Yes. Um and last year we had Doug Ek on the show and he was showing us I think the very first iteration of Veo.\n\nYes.\n\nUh which now with the launch of Veo 3 is I mean it's quite a different beast.\n\nExactly. Like the first implementation of the Veo model was still you know um just visual only um not including all of the the really enriching sound qualities that we see from the V3 model. Um, and you also had to give it pretty significant guidance in order to get the model to produce something that looked photorealistic or even like something that you might see in a cinematic film. Um, but we've come a long way. I would be really curious to see what that first video looked like.\n\nYeah. So, I think we have it actually.\n\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nWe have this car racing through the streets. You can see the neon lights reflected in the wet pavement below. There's other cars jostling for position around and it's almost like everything is blurred as you're because you're just going so fast. But it's really consistent now. It's gone through a tunnel. There are these big lights overhead and it's come out of the tunnel into an extremely realistic modern scene.\n\nIt's a wow moment.\n\nThat's incredible.\n\nThat's a wow moment.\n\nThat is incredible.\n\nI mean that is really good, isn't it?\n\nIt is so good. So, some things that I noticed now. It is quite blurry. And I guess that's sort of part of the vibe that it's going for, but you're not seeing this pristine detail on the car.\n\nNot at all. I think if we also looked really closely, we might also see that some of the the physics that's expressing the shots were uh is not quite right. And the way that's kind of the light gets reflected on things is also not necessarily quite consistent. Um, so let's see how well the the new V3 model does for this.\n\nYeah, I mean Doug was demonstrating the the real sort of limits of what Veo was able to do. And I suppose it's no coincidence that it was a car that was racing through a scene, right? If you sort of tried to test Veo on, I don't know, like a human face that was moving, conveying a particular emotion, it might struggle a bit more.\n\nDefinitely. there were uh you know it's very famous the the uh videos of people eating spaghetti or or some of these things that are very very clearly not human characters or not kind of real life characters. Um so it might be interesting also to just try with another prompt too that uh that is a little bit more humanentric. But let's try with this.\n\nLet's try this one. So you're using exactly the same prompt here.\n\nExactly the same prompt. And here we're in the Gemini app. So you can see the exact same prompt um generating this video. It can take up to 2 to 3 minutes in order to to get it uh to get it to have the right outputs.\n\nOne thing that was really noticeable was the way that Doug's prompt was very poetic.\n\nIt was lovely.\n\nIt was it was gorgeous. It was it was a little mini movie in its own right.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat What are your tips for generating these prompts? So, interestingly, we have a new feature with the V3 model called prompt rewriting, which gives you the ability to give your input sentence um to the the API, the way that we interact with model um and to get a response back that makes the the prompt a lot more detailed um a lot more aligned with perhaps what you're imagining. Um, so you don't necessarily have to go through all of the the mental work and all of the the terminology that would be appropriate to kind of describe this thing that you just uh that you just imagined. Um, and I often use Gemini for something quite similar is you can give Gemini uh the prompt that you're thinking in your objective and then ask it to craft a prompt for a large language model or a video generation model um in a way that would make the the prompt um much more likely to produce the optimal output that that you were expecting.\n\nThat's quite a good tip. Then actually if you are not that good at writing prompts,\n\nyes,\n\nget Gemini to write the prompt better.\n\nYeah. And uh so you can you can do that um kind of just invoke it naturally through the Gemini app which is which is probably easiest for people to try. Um but we also have the prompt rewriter um hyper specified for V3 available through the API if people are uh a little bit more comfortable with programming languages.\n\nSo how long are the Veo clips?\n\nThe Veo clips uh for the ones that we released publicly. So the ones that people can try they're all around 8 seconds in size. So very short. Why does it need to be 8 seconds long?\n\nSo, it's 8 seconds made available publicly. Um, internally we have models that are capable of producing much more long form content. Um, but we find that 8 seconds is really good to kind of give you full creative control over that first clip. Um, and for the 8 seconds, it's also um it's also useful in the sense that you can kind of get an idea of the style. You can start experimenting with language. And it's also wonderful in the sense that um you can start like putting to life things that you might have been imagining before. Um I know that the entire all of the internet is very enchanted with memes and now you can have memes that are that are much more long form that are actual videos um as opposed to just uh kind of the single the single snapshots.\n\nAbsolutely. Okay, it's ready.\n\nAmazing. Let's do it. Oh my gosh, this already\n\nall of a sudden.\n\nThis is so cool.\n\nOkay, now Oh wow. Goodness me.\n\nOkay. It's like suddenly someone has switched on HD.\n\nIt absolutely is.\n\nEspecially that first shot. So, what we're looking at here, there's um Let me watch it again. It It looks like you're in Bladeunner.\n\nIt does look like it's really evocative of that. So, the neon lights have changed from these sort of pink sort of horrifying neons to full-on billboards, which you can't totally see the detail of as you go past them, but you there's there's structure to them that you're uh that it's included. The car uh is now sort of a a painted painted with light almost um running through the scene, but also look at the lighting on that bonnet. Oh my gosh, it's extraordinary.\n\nIt is gorgeous. and the level of detail in all of the buildings actually like it's it's able to this really does look like a city in a futuristic Hong Kong.\n\nWhat I'm noticing here is there's a spotlight. A car comes out of the tunnel. There's a little a a a lamp post above it and the spotlight perfectly tracks where you would expect it to be along the bonnet of the car.\n\nThat's amazing. Do you hear the sound?\n\nThe screeching tires.\n\nYes.\n\nOh, sirens in the background.\n\nThis is so cool. Oh, it's very evocative, isn't it?\n\nIt is.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBut the sound perfectly matches the frames then.\n\nIt definitely does. And the the background tracks, the sounds for these videos, they get generated with V3. Um they're actually able to uh they're actually able to match not just uh not just things like the um the cars as they're as they're kind of coming into the coming into the scene, but also capable of giving you Audio. Um, so audio as outputs, um, background music, if you wanted to have kind of cinematic, um, music coupled with the audio or coupled with the background noises, um, all of this kind of stitched together into a single video.\n\nPretty magical.\n\nLet's try one of the hard ones, right? Like the spaghetti thing.\n\nOkay. So, let's uh let's try a new video output. Yeah.\n\nUm, what uh what kind of spaghetti eating would you like to see?\n\nI would like to see somebody at a spaghetti eating contest. I would like their face to be dirty with sauce.\n\nExcellent.\n\nAnd I'd like a whole honk of spaghetti to be essentially hanging from their mouth. Sauce everywhere.\n\nUh sauce everywhere. Uh and um and uh kind of camera pans in uh or camera pans out to see all of the uh to see all of the contestants eating spaghetti simultaneously. Nice.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd we'll see how well the model can do at this one. Um, you can also use uh, as I'm sure you can see here, you can ground the initial um, the initial model frame with a an image. So, if you wanted to use something like Imagine 4 to generate an image for uh, as the seed frame for the video itself, you would be able to do that as well.\n\nUm, so if you had, for example, a picture of a spaghetti eating contest and you wanted it to replicate where the tables were, where the scenery was, you could do that with this.\n\nAbsolutely. And then there are some other capabilities and characteristics of our latest Gemini models that allow you to do really nice editing of images as well. Um, so perhaps you have a spaghetti eating contest, but you only want to have like a certain number of people in the frame or you want to to kind of have a specific style of bench or a specific kind of lighting. You would also be able to give that uh image input to Gemini, ask for it to transform it and then use that as the seat frame for the V3 model.\n\nSo let me understand then what is new in V3 that we didn't have before? What makes it better?\n\nYeah, so V3 is better for a few reasons. One is that it has the ability to produce sounds which has been really enchanting a lot of people I think. Um not just uh not just background noises but also realistic music, dialogue, um all sorts of things. They can really construct videos that feel like they might have been taken in real life. Um another way that we've improved V3 is that the video outputs are grounded in more physics understanding. So, as we as we look at videos, um we can kind of spot ways in which the light or gravity um really does seem to align with the physical world. Um and then there's also been a lot of improvements around character consistency.\n\nHow are these these these additional features possible?\n\nYeah, I I think Google DeepMind is really really paying attention to how the data is curated to use to train the models. when you think about it, right? Like you can um see the word tree. Um you can like see a picture of a tree. You could have um kind of the the 3D representation um uh of trees or or um any of the other things that you would expect.\n\nA sound of of wind blowing through leaves.\n\nExactly. And like a video of somebody panning around. um like all of these things are still um like associated with that one entity, but it's all very different modalities describing the same thing.\n\nAnd so I I think there are um you know historically folks have been concentrating on just one modality, so text or code or something similar. Um when as humans we experience the entire world in uh very different ways, you know, everything from seeing to hearing to touching like all of these things. And so I I think that um the team has put a lot of time and energy and effort into being able to couple together not just the video footage um but also the sound um that composes the video footage, detailed descriptions even at the frame by frame level um and then also uh kind of stitching all of that together into um into a full representation of the training. So whereas a language only model might you know have the word tree and it's closely associated with the word branch or twig that the Multimodality version not only has all of those embedded within it but additionally has Audio images video all of these different layers.\n\nAbsolutely. I I think this is one of the the things that makes me most excited about the Gemini models, right? Is that we're really the only model family that also allows you to output text and code, but also images, to edit images, to have output audio, which we'll see in a second. Um, as well as steerable audio. So, being able to say like speak softer or speak more loud or speak in a different language. um all of these other model families kind of relied on stitching together different um different trained experiences as opposed to baking it all into one innate model. Um and I think that's uh really powerful about Gemini.\n\nUh oh. Oh my gosh. Let's see something different.\n\nI regret I regret.\n\nOh. Oh my gosh. Oh,\n\nso this these these do look like actual people though. Like\n\nthey do look like actual people.\n\nYeah,\n\nthe spaghetti is I mean I would say\n\nOkay, we're we're going to pause for a second. But like look at look at the faces. This does look um this does look a\n\n\nA little bit, uh, more photorealistic\num, than, than some of the, some of the\nexperiences that we've seen previously.\nThe hair, especially, like, if you just go\nto about there, two seconds in, maybe. Um,\nas it zooms out, this girl's hair, I\nmean, look, she's even got like a little\nbit of a\nYou see the little parting bit and\ntoughs of baby hair.\nYeah.\nUm, but yeah, as she moves, that is\nreally realistic.\nThis is so cool. Like the And then also\nthe noises are, are something that I\nwould imagine. Yes. Obviously\ndisgusting, but things that I would\nexpect to see, um, at a spaghetti eating\ncontest. And also the, um, kind of the, how\nthe sauce looks, how the noodles look.\nUm, the, uh, that as you're, as you're\ngulping, like some of the noodles are\nfalling back to the plate. Um, like this\nis incredible. Like\nand this is the notoriously difficult\nchallenge that people have used to see\nhow good\nSo instead of having one person eating\nspaghetti, we just had like 10 people\neating spaghetti all at the same table.\nI mean, there was a lot of Will Smith\neating spaghetti for a number of years,\nI seem to remember. And so Will Smith\neating spaghetti like that, that is\ncelestier. Let's try, let's try multiple\npeople eating spaghetti.\nThe thing that I really find impressive\nis how, uh, an individual object tracks\nthrough the frames. Yes.\nYou know, and keeps its consistency. Is\nthat something that you have to impart\nafterwards? I do think that the way that\nthe, the model is constructed, which is\num, you know, a diffusion model, is, is\nattempting to, to hold that consistency\nthroughout frames, but a lot of this\nlogic is baked into the model itself. So\nit's, um, and the before times, you know,\nyou would have to explicitly program\neach one of the behaviors. Um, for now, I\nI think that a lot of the magic behind\nthe scenes is just, you know, Veo and\nGemini kind of figuring out what they\nneed to do in order to make the, make the\nexperiences and make the outputs look\nphotorealistic\nbecause it has, it has read of the\ninternet, but it's also watched all of\nYouTube.\nWell, not all of YouTube. Um, and in\naddition to a lot of synthetic data. So,\num, as an example, we have, um, we're\nincredibly benefited by having so many\ngame designers and people from the game\nindustry, um, working at Google DeepMind. And\nDemis, you know, of course, has a, has a\ngame, a game background, but these, these\nenvironments are really great synthetic\ndata generators for all sorts of things,\nright? Like you can have, um, you know,\nfigures running through games,\naccomplishing tasks like doing all sorts\nof, um, behaviors and monitoring them\nalong the way, which can be used as an\nexcellent source of training data. It's\nalso nice in the sense that as you do\ngameplay, you can have the camera kind\nof, uh, orient itself in various ways\naround to the characters.\nSo, okay, I know a lot of the buzz\naround this, a lot of the new thing\nabout Veo 3 is is the audio. Just, um, I\nmean, how is it being generated in order\nto correspond? Is it that it's\ngenerating something that, that matches\nthe visuals, or is it like there's a\ncontext which produces both the visuals\nand the audio?\nI think it's because the training data\nhas all of the different modalities\nassociated with, um, kind of the thing\nthat it sees. So it's not just seeing a\nvideo. Um, it also has the transcript. It\nalso has the frame by frame level\ndescription of the video and what's\nhappening. It's also has the, the\ndescription of the audio if there's any\nbackground tracks. And so all of that\nkind of brought together simultaneously\num, is, is capable of generating these\nmuch more immersive and natural sounds\num, and natural responses. Um, because\nthere, there are certainly instances\nwhere, you know, if you listen to a song,\nyou could read the sheet music and you\ncould kind of hear the different tones\ndisplayed, but it could also make you\nfeel a certain way. And so, like if I, if\nI describe, you know, that I want to\nhear a song that reminds me of being in\na rainy cafe in Japan at nighttime, like\nthat's, that's something that you would\nreally want to have all of these\ndifferent modalities coming together to\nto understand as opposed to\num, just, you know, guessing at, at what a\nrainy cafe might, might sound like.\nIt's like a two-dimensional version of a\nfully immersive experience.\nExactly. M, that's nice.\nI love that. I love that description of\nit as well. It's, it's we're getting\ncloser and closer\ntowards something that feels very close\nto, like, that feels very close to reality,\nlike a simulated reality.\nYes.\nAnd, and I don't think that was possible\npreviously.\nOkay. So that, thus far, then, is the\nGemini app that we know and love. Yes.\nBut if you are a professional filmmaker\nor you want to take this a bit more\nseriously, there is another place you\ncan go to. Correct.\nYes. It is called Flow. It's built by\nour colleagues over in the Google Labs\nteam, and they've been partnering\ndirectly with filmmakers to really build\nan experience that aligns with their\nexpectations.\nSo go on, show me Flow.\nYeah.\nAnd so this is Flow, um, which is kind of\nthe, the first place that you would go if\nyou were a filmmaker. You can also see\nsome of the, some of the projects that\nhave been, uh, that have been happening\nrecently. Um, as well as this thing\ncalled FL TV. Um, which is a really,\nreally cool way to experience some of\nthe videos that have been generated by\num, by Flow recently. Um,\nso is the idea here then, you still have\nthe 8-second videos, but you can stitch\nthem together.\nYou can stitch them together. You can\nkind of style them. There are even\ncamera controls associated.\nOh, wow. Um, so it really does give you a\nlot more creative control as a filmmaker\num, without, uh, without necessarily\num, you know, having to, to, uh, sort of\nOh, that's so cool, too.\nThese are\nBut look at that. Like the, the physics\nunderstanding of that video of\nthe fluid dynamics, right, is, is, I mean,\nwow. Extraordinary.\nLook at that. Oh, lord.\nYeah. And then if you take a look at the\nprompt, you can also see, um, some of the\nthe sentences associated. So clean metal\nplastic injection opens releasing a\npinkish yellow jellyfish. Um, uh, and a\nlot of the others along the way.\nYeah. So detailed, like\nso detailed. Show me the ways in which\nthis differs from, from the Gemini app\nthen.\nAbsolutely. So this is a hypers\nspecialized, this is a hypers specialized\nexperience. So, if you click create with\nFlow, um, you're put into kind of this\ndevelopment environment that you can\nuse. You can start a new project, um,\nwhere you can use text to video, um, as\nwell as frames to video or ingredients\nto video.\nSo, hold on. Text to video. That's the\nthing that we were already doing.\nThat's the thing that we were just\ndoing. There's, there's also the frames\nto video.\nUm, so, the, uh, let's go ahead and do\nframes to video. Um, and you can stitch\ntogether multiple frames to create a\nfinal scene. You can also click this\ncamera control button. Um, and see these\ndifferent examples. So, like dollying\nin, dollying out, um, static or tilt\ndown, um, and all of those are kind of\nthings that, uh, things that can build\nthe, the sort of takeaways that you would\nlike to see in the video footage.\nSo, essentially, this is just a, like, I\nmean, it's kind of the same thing, but\njust a more specialized environment.\nDefinitely. And, and we find that, you\nknow, just as you would have specialized\nenvironments for, um, musicians to, to\ncreate their electronic tracks or, um,\nyou know, CAD designers, um, you would\nprobably want a really, really dedicated\nand focused UI for each one of these use\ncases. They can really hyper optimize\nfor the things that you would care about\nas a filmmaker. I\nthink the point about this is that you\nthen have this, this, this absolute open\ndoor for creativity. Yes. So, I've seen\npeople take videos as though, uh, the\nSpartans were Instagram influencers.\nYes. Absolutely. Reporting on, on, on\ntheir, on their siege.\nAbsolutely. And also character\nconsistency across, uh, across different\nexperiences, no matter what the lighting\nmight be. Like you might have, um, a\nlittle monster character that you want\nto have swimming through the ocean and\nthen you also want to have him climbing\na mountain and you want to have him\nsinging on a stage, and it's able to\nkeep that same character consistent, but\nto change all of the dynamics around it.\nUm, which is pretty magical.\nI do wonder though about putting these\ntools in the hands of people. There are\nalso concerns about it, too, right? I\nmean,\ndeep fakes, but also scams, you know,\ntricking people into thinking that news\nevents are happening that, that perhaps\naren't.\nWhere do you stand on that?\nYes. So, we do have safety filters\nintroduced within the, the Veo models\nthemselves. And relatedly, for all of\nthe Veo models that are generated through\nthe Gemini app, there's a specialized\nwatermark, um, that gives you the ability\nto, to kind of know that this was AI\nauthored, um, as opposed to being\nsomething that was just shot via raw\nfootage out in the world. Um, but we also\nhave special constraints in place around\num, you know, not being able to, to\ngenerate images of, um, things like, uh,\nlike children or, or special entities.\nThere's also, um, a constraint in place\nsuch that, uh, you know, government\nofficials are people who are\nsignificantly, like, present in the public\nsphere, um, for, for policy or for science\nor for any of the kind of, like, um,\nnotable figures in the world. Um, we\ncan't generate video content about them.\nUm, and even, uh, even the, uh, kind of\nmodels that we're, that we experiment, um,\nwith internally, um, they still have these\nconstraints. Well, if one of the key\nthings about Veo 3 is is the audio. Can we,\ncan we go into the audio a bit more?\nYes, we even just released a Gemini\ntexttospeech API that allows you to\ngenerate audio, including steerable audio\nin multiple languages.\nSo, without the images to go with it,\njust audio only,\njust audio only, but really, really\nexpressive audio. And you can also have\nmultiple speakers in, uh, in different\nlanguages. Um, so I, I believe you might\nhave seen the notebook, uh, before with\nYes. the podcasts that were generated.\nThis allows you to, to kind of create\ncustomizable and similar experiences\nusing multiple speakers or a single\nspeaker.\nWell, let me, let me just bring you back\nfor a second because, um, we did actually\nget to talk to the researchers who were\nworking on WaveNet. Oh, yes.\nThis is like now, I mean, only four years\nago. Yes. Um, and this is where they were\nat that point because what they did is\nthey, uh, trained a model. This was neural\nnetworks, right? Um, using my voice, and\nthis is where they got to. Hi there. I'm\na mathematician, author, and podcaster\nwho's fascinated by artificial\nintelligence.\nIt's very breathy, isn't it?\nIt is very breathy.\nHow have things changed since then?\nYes. So, things have changed\nsignificantly. When WaveNet, which was\npioneering at the time, was first\ncreated. Um, you know, you would need\ndedicated single task models for each\none of the things that you were trying\nto do. And so, I, I started doing machine\nlearning, I think, around 2009, 2010. And\nit was extraordinarily painful because\nyou had to, you had to acquire all of\nthese special purpose data sets. You had\nto get them cleaned up. You would have\nto monitor for things like data drift.\nLike if anything changed over time, you\nwould have to retrain the model from\nscratch. And so WaveNet, um, was a\ndedicated single task model for, for\ngenerating, you know, these really\nrealistic, at this time, sounding voices.\nUm, but it, it couldn't do other things.\nSo it couldn't, um, have kind of like\nsteerable audio, like you couldn't say, um,\nyou know, please, uh, you know, give me this,\nuh, give me this audio clip in this kind\nof style, um, and do it in German, whereas\nwith our, our recent models, um, they're a\nlot, uh, a lot more steerable by design.\nSo you can give instructions about\nstyle, about, uh, about kind of the\nlanguage that you're speaking, about, um,\nkind of pause instructions or speak\nquickly, speak slower, um, all sorts of\nthings.\nSo how much of the WaveNet, I mean, code\neven has actually ended up feeding into\nthis model, or is it sort of a, you kind\nof started again once large language\nmodels and transformers came on the\nscene? Yeah. So there, there, uh, a lot of\nthe code that was used to create the\nWaveNet model is, is not, um, the\narchitectures are a little bit different\nfor our Gemini family, but the data that\nwas used, um, is definitely repurposed.\nAnd so all of the examples created, or\nthis is the text input, this is the\naudio output. Um, you can also enrich\nthose kinds of data sets with the\ndescriptions of the style of the audio\nor the, the kind of, um, the tone or the\ntemper of the voice. Um, all of that is\nincredibly useful for Gemini, and that's\nbeen one of the, the really interesting\nthings to see over the years as well is\nthat, um, previously, like with the first\ngeneration of Gemini models, we had to do\nsignificant work to, to kind of fine-tune\nthem. So you had things like, um, metalm,\nyou had things like, uh, special purpose\nmodels for, for generating code, um, that\nwere a kind of variations of Gemini's.\nUm, and all of those training data have\nbeen now incorporated into kind of the\nbase model itself. So Gemini's just\ngotten better and better natively at all\nof the tasks that people had previously\nneeded to fine-tune to do.\nUm,\nso then show me how it works. Show, give\nme some examples.\nExactly. So, if we go over to AI Studio,\nI'll open up a new tab, um, and pull us\ninto the UI. You can see here this great\nplayground for experimenting with and\ntrying out the latest Gemini models as\nsoon as they're released.\nAnd so, to create audio is the one that\nlooks like an audio wave on the side.\nSo, interestingly, um, for the\ntexttospeech model, you would go to\ngenerate media, and then you would go to\nGemini speech generation, and you're\nlaunched into this texttospeech UI where\nyou can specify the different speakers,\num, the different voices, and then also\nthe style instructions for each one of\nthe speakers.\nLet's think of a prompt then, because I\nI'm particularly interested in this, this\ndifferent emotions. So, what about if\nyou get it to say something like, I was\nwaiting for you, and then we try a\ndifferent emotion.\nAll right. So, um, we're going to specify\nin the system instructions, um, speak in a\nfriendly tone, um,\nlike you're greeting, um, like you're\ngreeting a relative who just, uh, came\nhome. Nice.\nUm, yep. And then start typing a prompt.\nUm, I was waiting for you. And what\nwe're going to do is, uh, uh, speak in a\nfriendly tone, like only say what the,\num, the person prompts you to say.\nYeah. And then hit run.\nI was waiting for you.\nI made it. Friendly.\nYeah. Can\n\n\nWe try something different, though? Can you make it more romantic?\nYes. Um, so speak in a romantic, hushed tone. Um, very breathy. Uh, and uh, only say the words that the um, that the person puts into the prompt. Um, and so we'll see how we'll see how this goes.\nAnd it was, \"I was waiting for you.\"\nYeah.\nAnd hit run. And Zephr. Okay, good. Zephr is selected.\n\"I was waiting for you.\"\nSaucy.\nVery saucy. I also love that you can see in this UI the thoughts associated. Um, so Gemini's thinking process as it's as it's kind of going through the path of creating this audio response.\nWhat has it said?\nIt says, \"I've processed the input. I've pinpointed the exact phrase I need to use. The task core now centers on delivering the specific phrase. I've meticulously identified the romantic, hushed, and very breathy tone required. And the next step is generating the audio. So it really gives you like step-by-step instructions um of how to incorporate all of these results.\nCan I do some more? Can I, can we do angry?\nYes, you can definitely, uh, you can definitely do angry. So let's change the system instructions again. Um, and so let's say um, someone's late for the date.\nYes. So someone is late for the date. Um, I'm going to copy the system instructions again. Um, turn off the stream and start a new one. And we will do um, this. So, uh, spoken, uh, speak in an angry, um, in an annoyed, angry tone, um, like a person has just arrived late for a date, um, and only say the words that, uh, that you see here. And so let's try.\nThis is so much fun.\nYes, it is.\n\"I was waiting for you.\" Oh, that she's angry.\nShe is very angry.\nYeah.\nGo. Let's do um, can you do like grieving? Like a grieving? Yes.\nLike a lost loved one?\nYes. So, let's try another stream. Um, uh, and speak in a grieving tone. Um, grieving tone like you have just lost a loved relative. Um, only say the words the person puts into the prompt. And \"I was waiting for you.\"\nAnd hit run.\n\"I was waiting for you.\"\nOh, and so I, I feel like the, I feel like that was a little bit less grieving. So you could probably experiment a little bit with the, uh, experiment a little with the prompt.\nNow, um, now can you, can you make them French?\nSo we can modify the system instructions. So within this streaming real-time feature, we can say something to the effect of only respond. Um, so only respond to the user um in French. Um, make sure uh, to be uh, bubbly and excited.\nBubbly and excited. Um, and only say the text um, that the user um, adds in the prompt. Um, and so we can see, we can see what the um, what the output might be.\nAnd we're still going to go with \"I was waiting for you.\"\nAbsolutely.\nAll right. \"I was waiting for you.\" Um, and we've got Zephr selected. Um, we've got, uh, we've got the run button here.\nAnd let's try.\nI don't speak French.\nUm, yeah. I mean, sure. Yeah. Excellent.\nSo, this is all in AI Studio.\nThis is all in AI Studio, and which is available for people to play with.\nYes, it is available today for free for people to experiment, to try things out. And even cooler, if you're a developer, um, there's a little button here called get SDK code that whenever you click it, it gives you everything that you just did in the UI, but in code form. So, if you wanted it in Python, in TypeScript, um, in any of the languages that you're using in your personal project, all you have to do to replicate what you just did in AI Studio is click get SDK code and you're kind of off to the races.\nAbsolutely extraordinary. Are there other things that you can do in AI Studio that you can't do in the Gemini app?\nSo, Gemini Live, um, is kind of project Astra baked directly within the UI of AI Studio. And Project Astro, of course, this we did a whole episode on this with with Greg Wayne. This is the the the real-time visual understanding, the the sort of the first attempt at a universal AI assistant.\nAbsolutely. It can see anything that you see. It can talk to you in real time. It can talk to you in multiple languages. Um, and you can also uh, sort of add additional tool calls to this process. So, if you wanted Gemini to be able to pull out and extract up-to-date information, if you wanted it to be able to interact with any of the apps or any of the the kind of products that you use every day, something like calendar or docs or sheets or Gmail, um, you can give it access to be able to uh, sort of um, use all of those features within the context of the of the Gemini Live API.\nSo, okay, show me then, give me an example then of this working.\nYeah. So, let's turn on grounding with Google Search and then also share screen with Gemini. So, you can share your screen, you can share your webcam, um, and of course you can talk with the model. Um, but let's go ahead and share our screen. And I'm going to select one of these Chrome tabs um, that we currently have open. Um, and let's take a look at that video that we saw with Doug EC um, and see what it has to say.\nHey there, Gemini. Could you tell me what you see on the screen?\nI see a YouTube video playing. A woman with red hair is speaking and subtitles are displayed on the screen saying, \"Hannah Fry, welcome to Google DeepMind the podcast with me.\" The video appears to be about AI and creativity.\nAmazing. So, tell me a little bit about um, what you think the video might cover and also uh, what is Google DeepMind's latest models for creative teams?\nAnd so you can see here it's expanding out its thoughts um, and it's realizing that it based on the video title AI your new creative muse and the speaker's introduction of the Google DeepMind the podcast, it's likely the video explores the potential of AI in creative fields. It may feature discussions on how AI can inspire or assist creative professionals. Regarding Google DeepMind's latest models for creative teams, they've introduced various tools including Veo 3 for video generation, Image and 4 for image creation, and LIA 2 for music composition. They've also developed Flow, an AI film making tool and are working on world modeling AI models with applications in gaming and entertainment. These advancements aim to empower artists and creators.\nAmazing.\nAmazing.\nYeah. And so one of the things that you can see here is the thinking trace has been uh, has been exposed. So, it's kind of walking through all of um, Gemini's thought process on how to answer the question. It realizes that it needs to invoke one of the tools that it has access to, which is Google Search. So, it needs to look up some information. Once it gets the responses back from its search, it incorporates that back into its summary, and then it generates this wonderful audio clip um, with kind of insights that it's captured around uh, all of the products that Google has recently released. So, this stuff, this Gemini Live stuff, you also have it on Android phones, right? So, actually, I spotted this on my phone a little while ago. Um, and I've been using it extensively.\nUm, let's give it a go. Hang on.\nWhat can you see right now, Gemini?\nOkay. I see a woman with blonde hair sitting at a desk with a microphone in front of her. She has her arms crossed and is smiling. There's a computer keyboard and mouse on the desk and a lamp in the background. What else can you tell me about that has been so useful in diagnosing my sick house plants? I can't tell you.\nOh wow. Like it's and it's also just been so cool to have something that feel uh, feels like a a a real life commentator on, you know, as you go about your daily life. Like there's, there's been, there's been something really, really fascinating too about using it as kind of a a pair programmer.\nUm, one thing that I commonly use this for, um, is we have a, we have a tool at Google called Google Collab, which is a notebooks based environment with Python code. Um, you can kind of run, uh, you can run code, you can execute it. Um, but Gemini also understands uh, also understands Collab features. So, if we want to uh, if we want to share this tab instead, you could even say, \"Hey, Gemini, what do you see on the screen now?\" And if you see any code, please explain what it does. Oh, nice.\nI see a Google Collab notebook on the screen titled Making the Most of Your Collab Subscription. It seems to provide tips for optimizing Collab Usage, focusing on faster GPUs and more memory. There are a couple of code snippets visible. The first one appears to check if a GPU is connected and display GPU information. The second code uses the psutil library to determine the total amount of RAM available in the runtime and presents that in gigabytes.\nSo it's like having a helpful assistant that somehow understands every single thing that you could possibly be looking at.\nAbsolutely. And that also is uh, capable of, you know, answering in an empathetic way um, all of the questions that you might have um, or that a curious human might have about the things that they see every day.\nSo this is good. I mean, I already use Google Collab with my students. Uh, so thank you for that. That's going to be, that's going to be very helpful. Um, but for people who can't necessarily code themselves. Yes.\nUh, is there, I mean, there's another offering within AI Studio.\nAbsolutely. So in addition to being able to take the uh, to take the Gemini APIs and embed them within tools like Cursor or Windsurf or um, or Copilot or any of the other many like coding IDE that uh, that you might have access to if you're attempting to write code. We also have something called the new build feature um, that allows you to build apps directly with Gemini. And so the uh, the build apps with Gemini section is unique in that um, all of the code that gets generated within this UI is hyper optimized for the latest SDKs, the latest kind of code that we have um, for interfacing with the Gemini models. So just to put that another way. Yeah.\nEven if you have never written a line of code in your life. Yes.\nYou are going to have slick code if you just prompt Gemini here to build you an app.\nAbsolutely. And it will be using the latest models, the latest features from the models. Um, it will be generating really, really uh, robust TypeScript code and it will also be resolving any errors along the way. So if the model hits any problems, it's able to cycle back through, fix the error to get the model's kind of implementation of an app in a in a clear and coherent state.\nSelf-healing code, self-healing code. Um, and all with you just having to describe what you would like to see. Um, this is interesting too in the sense that a lot of the the vibe coding demos that you might have seen externally are really, really focused on just creating a simple app. So something that's not AI enriched. Um, this is hyper optimized for creating apps that are also using the Gemini APIs or imagine or the like. Um, so it's really, really cool to see what you can cook up um, using the build apps with Gemini.\nLike if we have an idea for an app um, around like creating a quick spaghetti competitions, spaghetti competitions, this is also correct. Um, so uh, so maybe we say like generate an application um, that uh, showcases a spaghetti uh, competition or spaghetti eating contest. Um, make sure to use imagine uh, to generate example uh, to generate example images um, for the website landing photo um, as well as other uh, photos about the competition. Um, also make sure to include a sign up form um, for people um, to indicate interest. So this is essentially going to make a website where all of the images are AI generated.\nAll of the images are AI generated. Um, it should have a form where people can kind of submit their information if they would like to see it. Um, and uh, it also has kind of immediately launched us into this new IDE um, with a code assistant kind of a directory structure here in the middle and then also a place for you to kind of visualize the app as it gets created here off to the right. And so this thinking trace box if we expand it out, you can see that Gemini is doing a lot of work behind the scenes um, to build the the kind of core features of the app um, to to map out the structure uh, to to kind of build the components and it's writing every single one um, of these code files into into being as we sit here watching um, including uh, including everything from design patterns to uh, to to things like uh, the latest React libraries um, to uh, even doing error handling for you. So you don't have to think through all of the things that you would have to consider if building out um, a native application.\nOkay. So I, I am someone who has built websites in the past, right? And honestly, even with the the tools that are supposed to make it quicker, weeks and weeks, weeks and weeks and weeks this would take. Absolutely.\nAnd my websites were rubbish.\nHere we go.\nOh my gosh. Oh, it's chosen comic sands.\nI love it. It absolutely is chosen comic sands and uh, so it has the contest. Um, it's uh, it's got some some images that it looks like are in the process of loading this.\nOh my gosh. And then like if I, if I give it a little bit more room. So let's hide this code assistant.\nTrophy.\nYep. It's got a fake trophy. It's got the contest including a background image that it generated of the contest and then also changed the um, changed the transparency of the image um, so that it matched uh, like this very interesting stylistic choice that it's um, that it's created and it also has some contest highlights um, for uh, for people who it looks like have previously won the um, uh, won the contest before. And all of these images, by the way, they're using imagine three. Um, so not Imagine 4.\nBut you could also at this point then, let's say that there was, I don't know, some video of a previous spaghetti eating competition and you wanted to have a page which was a story about that moment. Yes.\nYou could upload a YouTube video, have Gemini Live essentially watch it for you.\nYes.\nSummarize it. And then embed it into the website.\nAbsolutely. You could do all of that work. You could even use the Gemini search capabilities. So like finding um, finding examples of related information to spaghetti eating competitions and citing all of those sources for the video itself.\nAnd if you wanted to turn this into\n\n\nAn actual website, yes.\nHow do you, what do you do then?\nSo to turn it into an actual website, something that you could share with your friends and not just kind of share the file itself, um what you can do is there's this little rocket here off to the side, um that says deploy to Cloud Run.\nUm since this has been integrated so closely with the Google Cloud uh kind of development environment, um what you can do is say deploy to Cloud Run.\nUm and so after the app gets created, you can select a project.\nSo um just one of the projects that you have access to um via Cloud Run.\nUm it verifies the project that you could actually use and then says uh that you can deploy it and gives you a unique URL um that you can share with friends that's scalable and that even more importantly is hiding all of those API keys so that you can use them and your app can use them but nobody else would be able to capture them.\nWhat does this mean for developers though?\nI mean you've just done some really extraordinary things very, very quickly.\nYes.\nLike it's I do feel like for developers this means that they can focus more on building and ideation and kind of the product experience as opposed to, you know, the daily life of a developer right now um is a lot of things that aren't necessarily the most exciting in the world.\nSo you might be upgrading a codebase from one version to another.\nUm or you might be adding typing to a repository or you might need to periodically check for security vulnerabilities and make sure your codebase aren't susceptible to them.\nUm and all of these things are, you know, they aren't joyful.\nIt's kind of like tidying up an apartment um to uh to make sure that your app is kind of sustainable and maintained.\nUm and there's that saying that, you know, everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.\nI think one of the promises of these models and these kinds of capabilities is that there are so many more opportunities for software developers to build and to um to really build more ambitious systems.\nUm and even more importantly, it opens up the door for more people to kind of learn and get inspired by this whole process of creating and getting something out into the world.\nUm, do you think all of these tools together then, do you think that they will sort of fundamentally change the way we think about human creativity?\nAbsolutely.\nLike human creativity is about to have, you know, this explosion of progress and there's this promise of everyone being able to become a creator.\nUm, and not just a creator in one specific discipline, but to also be able to expand that out into many other disciplines.\nSo, I I think that there's real magic in having, you know, people who are scientists maybe in the physical sciences or chemistry or biology or um people who are historians or musicians being able to suddenly like get all of their ideas or their projects into a digital form that could be shared with others.\nPaige, absolutely fascinating.\nThank you so much for joining me.\nIt was awesome to be here.\nThank you so much.\nWith these new tools, it feels like suddenly everything has clicked together.\nNow, until now, we've spoken to researchers about every individual element of these new releases, audio, video, language, but there is something so different about having all of those elements integrated and working seamlessly together.\nAnd I have been coming here for years, right?\nI have spoken to the people all along the way.\nBut even still, seeing these tools come to life and imagining the possibilities, I still feel completely wowed.\nAnd um to be honest with you, I'm now itching to get on the train home and just try out all of the things that I've always wanted to build but never had time to.\nYou have been listening to Google DeepMind the podcast with me, Professor Hannah Fry.\nIf you enjoyed this episode, then do subscribe to our YouTube channel or leave a review on your favorite podcast platform.\nAnd of course, we have plenty more episodes on a whole range of topics to come.\nSo, do\n",
