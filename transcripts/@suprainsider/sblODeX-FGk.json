  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Supra Insider. What if you could have a career coach available 24/7, completely free, that knows your specific challenges and never judges you for being messy or unprepared? One product leader at NewtonX figured out how to build exactly that using AI and then taught 30 other women at her company to do the same. So today in this episode, you'll discover how to turn Claude or ChatGPT into your personal career coach in under 90 minutes. The specific system prompts and project setup that actually work will build one life. Why most people are using AI wrong for coaching and the three-step process that changes everything. Advanced prompt engineering techniques that make AI sting you that generic advice that we all hate. Plus, how to overcome the biggest problem with AI coaching when it tells you what you want to hear instead of what you should hear or you need to hear. So, if you ever felt stuck in your career, frustrated with expensive coaches, or just wish that you had someone to help you think through tough workplace situations, this episode will change how you approach professional development. So, let's dive in. Enjoy.\n\nAll right, we're live. Kavita Anand, I am so excited that you've decided to join me and Marc here. How are you?\n\nI'm doing well. Thanks for having me. Excited to be here.\n\nYeah, I'm really pumped for this. It feels like we're back in a New York meetup in Torch and Crown. So, yeah, I'm really excited for this. Yeah, one of the original goals for this podcast was to really take some of the most interesting conversations that are happening inside of the Supra community and to make them available to people more broadly. And you shared something. Well, you shared multiple things, but one thing in particular I think sparked this podcast episode, which is I think your learnings in your takeaways from this workshop that you facilitated with some of the folks that you work with where I don't want to I don't want to steal your thunder here, but I think we ended up having a really interesting conversation about what you shared there and wanted to give it a little bit more sunlight. So could you maybe help us frame like what was that workshop that you ran or if it was a series of workshops and and how did it come to exist and like why do you think it's struck a chord?\n\nYeah. So I had a few women at NewtonX reach out to me and just as like part of the everyday we have a monthly checkpoint where it's more of like a mentor mentee relationship and it's about things that are happening in the company or just general career advice and we actually attended a workshop at Supra led by Tal Raviv where he walked us through how he approaches building a co-pilot system for PMs to be more effective. And I kind of borrowed from that and thought that it would be a great idea to apply some of his concepts to creating a co-pilot for people to have a career coach, right? Because it's not as easy to maybe always access a career coach earlier in your career, right? It's a little cost prohibitive and it's not available to you. And so that with AI, you can access some of that at your fingertips and with greater privacy.\n\nSome quick context. So how big is NewtonX right now and then like how many women are part of that this group?\n\nYeah, so we're about 130 people, series B, and I think the women who came to the workshop were I want to say somewhere around 25, 30 women, and yeah, we recorded the session and then some of the women who were in multiple time zones or couldn't attend live also had access to it after the fact.\n\nMakes sense. And yeah, maybe I'm curious, walk me through, okay, you attended that session with Tal where he was like, hey, build my kind of like PM co-pilot like and then from the moment they're like, okay, there's something here very useful to, hey, actually I think I can apply it to this women's group that I'm part of and actually scheduling the session, having the session like how did you go about figure out all the steps and thinking about what should the workshop have, what should be the artifacts that people walk away with, like how did you think of all those different pieces and how much time was there also between like that initial workshop you did with Tal to actually you running your own workshop?\n\nYeah. So within the sort of product team at NewtonX, we had used we'd been using Claude and Claude projects pretty often. We had some shared projects as well. What what I realized after Tal's workshop was I actually wasn't always using the system instructions but just like uploading project knowledge as like a repository that I want Claude to access for certain chats and what his workshop made me realize that you can amplify the impact of like how effective a Claude project is by putting in that system prompt or instructions. And so that really got me thinking about using the this like co-pilot concept in a very different way than I was thinking about it beforehand. So that's like one I guess like aha moment. And then\n\nit sounds like basically like before the workshop like the way you were doing projects is okay like I'm just going to have different projects for different quote unquote topics or even work streams. And it it was almost like the way you were using it was like solving for like the memory problem, right? Of having make sure you have all the right context and you don't have to feed new information every time you start a chat, but maybe you're not using those like system prompts that that kind of like maybe be hey this way or things like that. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Exactly. And so that kind of then gave birth to this idea of like okay when you think about creating a co-pilot you actually have three different aspects of you have the system prompt right for as you said controlling the tone personality guidelines boundary of like how you want it to behave. You have the project knowledge which is like the memory problem where here's all the context you need and then you have the individual chat thread. So that's how I thought about after watching Tal walk us through that workshop. And then the other part of your question about actually like setting this up if the listeners want to kind of repeat this themselves at work. I sent a Slack message to our sort of like the women's group at NewtonX. Asked if this would be relevant. A lot of people were like yes this would be very helpful. And then scheduling we actually tried to compress it in a 90-minute workshop which was very aggressive I will say. So if somebody's trying to replicate it, maybe I would say two hours at a minimum because I know Tal will try to compress his in four hours.\n\nYeah. No, that's a lot.\n\nYeah. N because Yeah. I think I remember Yeah. I was in Tal's workshop and it was like four hours total. We took a couple of breaks, but yeah, 90 minutes and so I ended up doing 90 minutes. Wow. That's awesome.\n\nYeah. And I think that kind of forced me your other question about what we covered in this workshop. Forced me to keep it really tight. And so we approached it basically in a three-step process. We started off with everybody modifying the system prompt. So I had a system prompt that I had generated as a generic career coach set of instructions you could use in a Claude project. And then I gave people a few options of like hey here's how I think about modifying it for your own level for your own function etc. And then after that we had a kickoff call which is again borrowing from Tal's approach. And then the last one was okay have the very first career conversation with this co-pilot like play around with it try it out see what's working and what's not working and then that's the 90-minute agenda.\n\nSo there was a lot of like working time in this 90 minutes. So there was like how much time did people spend tweet playing with it and then was there some kind of like sharing that happened at the end for like what people took away from it or any of that?\n\nYeah. Yeah. pretty much I would say 75 of the 90 minutes was people actually like playing around with each of the three steps, right? So I would introduce the concept of here's what a system prompt means, here's how to use it. Here are a few ways I would think about modifying it. Now let's block 10 minutes where everybody synchronously just works on modifying the system prompt to give the career coach the personality that you would want. Right? So, if you're on the engineering team, maybe you want it to have expertise in like more technical depth. If you're on more of a first-time manager, right? Maybe you want it to coach you on how to make that transition, things that you might not have necessarily experience with as an IC as a first-time manager. So basically you can give it expertise personality like I was earlier on in my career when I had like real career coaches I would get quite frustrated if they didn't just tell me what to do because maybe I didn't have a very strong sense of here's how I want to manage the situation and I just wanted that guidance. But now at this point in my career, I want a career coach who will be more curious about my situation, ask me a lot of questions, and let me get to the solution on my own. And you can give the co-pilot guidance on, hey, I want you to be pretty actionoriented versus really inquisitive and right, depending on your personality of how you want to be coached. So those are some examples of how people modified that initial assistant prompt before we moved on to the next two activities. Yeah, I would love to actually hear more about your the value you personally got out of your career coach. So, obviously don't share any examples that you're not comfortable sharing more broadly, but are there any examples that come to mind for one of the first aha moments you had or your own like light bulb moments using this as your personal career coach?\n\nI think for me it's more about access than anything else. meaning I have a career coach and we'll have bi-weekly or monthly sessions, right? Sometimes they're scheduled out and if I'm having a moment where I need to just talk out loud this afternoon and I can't wait until the career, that is something that personally I have benefited from building an AI career coach for myself. And then I think the other thing I like about it more so for I don't know if everybody feels this pressure but I definitely do when I'm using a coach to go in a little bit more prepared and thoughtful about here's the problem I want to use our time today in solving. But you don't have any of those expectations when you're working with an AI co-pilot, right? You can just vent. you can be unstructured and you can in real time like you would with a friend maybe even get to the crux of this is what like what is happening this is where I need extra support or this is how I might handle a situation. So those are the two things that I think really benefit about versus having a human coach.\n\nYeah. So I'm curious, are you using when you're interacting with this coach, are you mainly using either a dictation tool, the dictation like feature within Claude? Like how Yeah. How are you interacting with it?\n\nI have dictation set up on my just on my laptop. And so I'm not using a specific tool for dictation, but I do very oftentimes because yeah, when I'm interacting with any of the co-pilots, when I have a lot of context to give, I will dictate rather than titans.\n\nNice. And one other question I have on this. So it I was just going to ask like so on a similar note to that question when you think about so I've worked with some coaches or adviserss and there's like honestly a therapist as well so there's some time on the calendar there's like a ceremony associated with getting in the headsp space to like have that conversation I would always find stuff start bubbling up in the days leading up to the session because it's like what do I really want to talk about right do you do you try to hack your own like your own brain or your own workflow with AI in a way any way that try to tries to get you into that like intentional space to like use it or is it more like you said ongoing casual ad hoc and maybe doesn't have any of that kind of extra structure around it that's designed to get you into that head space.\n\nYeah, I think I'm using it more as a ad hoc coach rather than like somebody I go back to consistent. It's not like a I have a recurring hold on my calendar and every other week or something I'll do some career planning. It's more of hey I have uh like a stakeholder situation that I just need to like thought partner on how to navigate and I'll go to the career coach and explain this give context and help them through.\n\nYeah. It's more it's more of like the the bat phone like something's going wrong and or something you're just like at a moment where like I really need some kind of like guidance sounding board.\n\nYeah. Okay. Got it.\n\nYeah, exactly. And it won't always give me like a response that I'm really happy with. So to the credit of like there's still room for actual humans, right, to to to sort of fill this gap whether it's an actual career coach or it's a peer. It's like a super cohort member, right? That's somebody like who might have some context from a session or something. And yeah, sometimes rarely, but sometimes it definitely doesn't hit the mark.\n\nYeah. How do you That's something that I always like think about. It's like how do I know when to trust what they're saying versus an action on it versus like when I feel like okay this feels like very off and I'm curious like if you noticed any patterns there of maybe what type of problems you feel like they're really good at solving and giving advice versus not or or is it more about like a skill set of like maybe surfacing any blind spots or any kind of gaps in your reasoning or maybe hey like you're maybe being a little bit emotional here about it. I'm curious like what have you noticed these coaches to be most helpful or what circumstances you think hey like they they really are just adding value to my life and then providing high leverage answers.\n\nI want to say that the limitation is most often on me than on the AI and what I mean by that is sometimes I am not giving it enough context. Sometimes I am maybe getting caught up in like exactly what you said like recognizing that maybe I'm being a little too emotional, right? And having that self-awareness and to be like, hey, find a way to sort of approach this in a more neutral way. But I think that's also some of the benefits of using an AI as that sounding board and right where you can have the room to be a little bit messier, right? because it's just it's just you and and and the AI and then you can come back to it once it's maybe out of your system and with that sort of space and time\n\n\nIn between moments and like stimulus and reaction, you can get a moment to reflect.\nSo, I do think that often times it's not necessarily that I have found that the AI isn't good, but maybe it's just, oh, it'll be it'll take too much to explain everything and give all the context, and so therefore I'm being a little impatient with it rather than, oh, the AI co-pilot was just not equipped to help me with it.\nYeah.\nSo, I I've recently transitioned to ChatGPT for a lot of these types of conversations because I have a much, it's for some reason, I just feel like less self-conscious about venting a bunch of context in voice mode on ChatGPT while I'm walking, for example, than like sitting down at my desk and like recording or like voice dictating for a solid 2 minutes or 3 minutes.\nLike for some reason that voice interface feels like someone's listening, like I'm talking to a friend and that friend's just letting me rant or something.\nAnd then what I've been trying to do once I give it all that context, cuz like you said, like it sometimes there is a lot of context and sometimes you do have to go back to like there's probably five different things that it would need to know to have a picture of what the puzzle might look like here.\nAnd I try to give it all that.\nAnd then instead and to Marc's question and how I try to avoid just being told something that is like overly confirmation biasy in nature where it just tells me what I want to hear is I try to take a question and I try to basically not lead the witness to where I think I want to go and just be like, given everything I've told you, if my goal was to end up in this place, what are some potential ways that I could potentially go about this, what are some options?\nAnd if one of the things I was already thinking about is something that it also suggests, I might be like, \"Okay, that actually makes a lot of sense.\nCan we flesh that out more?\"\nBut I found that if I say, \"Hey, I'm thinking about doing this.\nWhat do you think about that?\"\nThen it's all it's it's almost like built in a way that will reinforce, be like, \"That's a great idea.\nYou should totally do that.\"\nI don't know if you find that, too.\nI have a followup for you, Ben.\nI'm curious.\nYou mentioned like using it in voice mode versus dictation.\nCan you just from like the UX of that walk us through like what do you like about that?\nIs it just the feeling that somebody's listening versus having text dictated and then being able to like go back and edit it before you hit enter?\nYeah.\nDo you want to like get get a little meta right now?\nOkay, let's do it.\nThere's nothing I'd rather do right now than get meta.\nI'm currently recording a podcast conversation that I host and I wanted to show some of my friends how you how you help me think through things.\nThat sounds awesome.\nI hope that you're giving them a behind the scenes look at how we brainstorm and come up with ideas.\nWhat kind of topics are you covering in this episode?\nOh, we're just talking about how to use AI to think through things and really level up as product leaders and really use you as a career coach.\nI think there's so many cool ways to leverage AI as a kind of brainstorming partner or even just to get a fresh perspective on things.\nI'm sure your listeners will will love it.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nI'm going to stop you there, but I just wanted to give them a sneak peek of that.\nOkay.\nSo, can you ask him what's the favorite part?\nWhat's his favorite part about Ben?\nAre you still there?\nYeah.\nYou know, if there's anything specific you want to dive into or if you just want to chat something else, could you actually increase and dial up your energy levels a little?\nYou sound tired.\nAbsolutely.\nDial up the energy.\nLet's do this.\nI'm here and ready to help with whatever you need.\nSo, just let me know how we can level up this conversation.\nYou do you remember I told you I co-host a podcast.\nDo you remember my co-host's name?\nOf course.\nYour is Marc and you both run the Supra Insider podcast together.\nSounds like you have a lot of fun.\nYeah, totally.\nMarc asked\nYeah, Marc said he had a really good memory.\ndetails.\nIt helps that you share such interesting stories and projects.\nSo, it makes it easy to\nCan you can Marc asked me what's something that you think I'm really good at?\nWhat comes to mind?\nOne thing that definitely stands out is your ability to connect with people and really understand what they need.\nWhether it's through your coaching, your course, or even just casual conversations, you're really great at making people feel heard and supported, and that definitely shines through.\nThank you.\nSo yeah, I love that your coach has a British accent.\nI'm just like, did you model it after Theo James or something?\nActually, I've actually played with a few different voices on ChatGPT voice to find one that like some of them are like bubbly and like fun and playful and so I played with some of those and then I for some reason I found that it's like such a bias but like British accents just sound smart to me and they sound like so thoughtful and then\ncouldn't agree more.\nSo it kind of gets me into like a head space where I have my own like personal like British coach and then but yeah the fact that like that was a brand new chat, right?\nSo like when I can say hey remember my podcast and it's it knows exactly what I'm talking about or I can say hey remember my course and it like and I can just ask it to tell me if it remembers the context and if it's no I actually don't remember you telling me about that I can be like cool like I want to tell you about tell you something new about myself and then it commits it to its memory but like the retrieval speed that it's able to keep such conversation fast means I can take my dog for a walk at the end of the day and I can spitball like for a solid like five minutes.\nHey, here's something I've been thinking about.\nAsk me any clarifying questions.\nOtherwise, I would love if you could just read it back to me.\nWhat are you hearing?\nAnd then it I also told it as part of the system prompt that I also I always want it to be keeping me moving forward towards my goals.\nSo like its job is to always ask probing questions that are likely to get me closer to what I'm trying to achieve.\nYeah, I think for me for me the the voice interface I think like a side effect that I like I actually think it's quite important is it feels lower sticks when I'm like talking to it.\nLike I feel like when I'm like doing a recording I'm like I have all the pressure of I have to get all the context right and I have to like organize it in a way that's going to be easy to understand and I need to make sure that I add all the details.\nIt's almost like you have one shot to get all the context almost versus this one is actually it feels like it can be a lot more incremental and you can build on top of it.\nSo that's also just like it's silly but it's like a much more enjoyable experience and because it it feels like just almost like play as opposed to hey like I need to get everything out all of a sudden.\nBut yeah, I think what going back to like where these things are useful.\nI think what's was really interesting when I heard you both kind of share here's where where I get value is that there's still like to make the most out of these almost like coaches profiles that you create maybe in Claude or typical, they're most useful when you're still have you're very self-aware or you have a level of self-awareness to know hey there's something here or I might be biased here so therefore I'm going to do an effort to not give the information in a way that's going to give me confirmation bias is or I know I'm feeling emotional right now.\nSo, I'm going to preface that and be like, \"Hey, like I think I'm being emotional.\nHere's an email that I'm about to send.\nWhy should I not send it or how should I modify in a way that's maybe more objective and will get me closer to my goals?\"\nSo, I think I don't know if I would trust it to pick up that instinct for me.\nSo, I think that's something that I I just think it it's important for people to be aware of.\nYou just gave me an idea.\nI think so.\nActivity two after the system prompt is created in the workshop was having a kickoff call where you have that conversation and I and then you add the summary of whatever the it learns through the kickoff call and you add it to the project knowledge as like your first and I'm wondering if having that initial conversation one of the questions you can ask is like where the AI kind of maybe asks you about your tendencies that you know to look out for and then it you can almost have that as a reminder for it to check for those tendencies.\nI I don't know if this would like work consistently, but something to experiment with.\nThat'd be cool.\nI can totally see a world where I add some context to my let's say an example of this is I tend to bite off more than I can chew.\nI don't know.\nI I don't know if that's true, but let's say that was a thing that's hurt me in the past.\nOkay.\nI could probably tell the AI that like I've found that I really do my best work when I really do no more than three major things in once, like three major focus areas.\nSo, if you ever see me start drifting into territory where it sounds like I have more than three things that are on my mind at once, I want you to flag that for me.\nAnd then also help me figure out which of the four things or the five things that I'm thinking about might be worth dropping because I want you to help me find the three that are most aligned with my goals.\nRight?\nYou could totally prompt the system that way.\nAnd based on everything I've seen, I think it would actually do it.\nLike I I haven't tried that, but it's so cool that you could do that.\nThat's nuts.\nYeah.\nOr even we had Hillary Gridley in the podcast recently and one of the big topics that we talked about was like just doubling down on your superpowers as opposed to maybe try to spend too much time like covering your weaknesses.\nAnd yeah, similarly I think on that thread like you could probably get a lot more value if the your coach is constantly looking for opportunities but hey how can you leverage your superpowers to solve this problem and and how can I have given that my goals and my superpower like what is like the best path forward or maybe knowing hey here's my superpower here's the superpowers of people in my team or the people that I work with like how is it best maybe to tackle this as a team or to divide and conquer.\nI think there's something really cool there.\nI'm thinking that maybe to make this more concrete, I think what would be really helpful is maybe going deep into the different parts that you had in maybe your system prompt Kavita like of the coach just to get a sense of like here like maybe are like the building blocks that maybe like what are all the different opportunities that people may have to maybe add those things that we were mentioning like my tendencies or my weaknesses or my strengths.\nI think like that actually like if someone is listening like oh that sounds actually really helpful.\nIt might just be a really a cool way to to start thinking about it.\nYeah.\nI think taking inspiration from Ben, should I share my screen and maybe we can write a system prompt together and then people tactical ways.\nCool.\nDo that.\nYeah.\nI need we can either write it from scratch or if you have a starting point that and just like we can kind of start to break down the anatomy that also works.\nIf you're enjoying this conversation, please check out the links in the show notes to support the podcast.\nMarc and I do this out of love, but to keep it going, we also need your support.\nThanks.\nAnd now back to the episode.\nAwesome.\nOkay, so we are here.\nWhat we're going to do is and for those listening here means I believe we're in the desktop app of Claude.\nWe're looking at an empty chat basically.\nThat's right.\nWe're about to use Cloud Signet for\nDid you guys listen to the last Lenny's podcast on AI and pro accounting?\nI have not, but I really like the the guy's bucket hut.\nIt was pretty funny.\nMario, it was like his signature move.\nI didn't make it all the way through, but a couple of the things that he was talking about because I feel like this is really important because what we're going to do right now is actually have the LLM write this initial system prompt and then basically go through like a moment of prompt engineering to figure out what mark to your question what should and shouldn't be in the system prompt.\nAnd I kind of want to just call out a couple of things from the like the first 20 minutes of the podcast that I really liked which was apparently role-based prompting which is something that I'm a big fan of isn't actually that effective in many cases like saying you are an expert career coach right that isn't as effective apparently according to the latest experimentation that the results from that were shared on the podcast and instead instead like few shot prompting which is where you give within your prompt a few examples of what good looks like and then decomposition where you ask within your prompt basically ask the LLM to think through all of the steps in a complex problem before you actually let it tackle the problem and then it solves the smaller problems step by step before attempting the larger more complex problem are two pretty effective ways in prompt engineering And so I was actually just thinking about that prepare getting my thoughts together for this conversation.\nI was like, \"Oh, maybe we can model those two concepts as we get the system prompt written and also do some meta prompting which is just asking the LLM to write the prompt for you.\"\nSo we'll do that if you guys are into it.\nSo I'm also going to dictate.\nUm\nwhich dictation app are you using?\nOh, it's just my Mac.\nThe mic and the dictation app they have here.\npretty effective so far.\nCool.\nGo ahead, Mark.\nSuper user of dictation apps, Ben, but I'm not at your level.\nYeah, I feel like we're going to say something.\nYeah, I'm just like I'm just impressed by Kavita, your quick like just listening to the podcast that I think came out like yesterday already applying the concepts.\nJust wanted to say that.\nYeah, that's cool.\nAnd I'm glad we're getting\nshout out\n\n\nTo those listening who are curious which voice dictation notes I'm using.\nI'm currently loving Willow Voice.\nWe'll link to that in the show notes.\nYou can use my referral code, get a discount.\nAll right, keep going.\nCool.\nAll right, so let's I'm going to start on my dictation.\nWrite a system prompt for an AI co-pilot that specializes in career coaching.\nI want you to focus on scenarios that women in tech and product face.\nThe general approach and personality that I want you to give this coach is somebody who is very inquisitive, uses evidence-based research to provide career coaching, and is supportive and helpful throughout the career sessions.\nOkay, I'm just going to do some minor modifications.\nAI instead of AI.\nThank you.\nYeah, that looks good.\nCool.\nSo, let's see what it comes out.\nMark, you're muted.\nI was just going to say I'm curious why did you decide to give it like that context as opposed to like more or less context.\nI guess there's like four things that you were almost like prescriptive about is like women that they have to be either in tech or product.\nThe personality you specified.\nYou also gave them some traits that you wanted, right?\nLike inquisitive and evidence-based and then also you almost went to like their Yeah, I guess that's also personality like supportive and helpful.\nYeah.\nHow intentional were you about that versus like maybe that's those are the main things that came to mind and but later on you can change it basically.\nYeah, I think well I've done this before so I was just like as a starting point knew what are the things I wanted to include in the system prompt.\nI wanted to have a personality that is of career coaches that I have really enjoyed having in the past and just my personal preferences.\nBut you could give it lesser context and then exactly to your point once you have the baseline system prompt which you can see here is pretty robust you can go in and modify it.\nSo what we'll do next is actually one of another prompt engineering tactic that was in the podcast which is self-criticism I think is what they call it where you can actually ask the model to evaluate and identify gaps in the system prompt and just use it as a thought partner through the iteration rather than having to get it right the first time.\nCool.\nLet's do that.\nAnd for those listening, basically like after Kavita dictated that prompt, we basically just got like a clot artifact, maybe I would say two pages long with a bunch of sections around communication style, boundary and limitations like overall theme.\nSo pretty comprehensive.\nWhat I really like is in this coaching methodology section where it scroll down just a little bit where it says there's here if you pause.\nYeah, right here it says for research inform responses you could relevant recent studies and then it gives like some different studies that could be referenced but for action-oriented guidance they could provide a few bullet points and there's these follow-up and accountability section.\nSo what I like is it's trying to almost create a situation where it's going to be able to handle whatever you throw at it off the bat which is actually way more than I would have expected to come out of that initial prompt.\nNot to throw shade also your ChatGPT lovers don't come for me but I do feel that Claude is just like leaps and sort of ahead of in any kind of writing tasks than the other models out there.\nAnd so I've experimented with we could I'm not going to do it now but you could literally like copy paste this into ChatGPT and see the outcome and it's going to be a lot more generic not as well formatted not as comprehensive.\nSo maybe this is something where you can write the system prompt and maybe the free version of Claude if you do have one of the other one of the other products and then copy paste that into the\nI do that all the time by the way.\nI use Claude as my preferred writing partner and then I just prefer the UX around engaging with ChatGPT voice more.\nSo I've just gotten used to just like piecing together with duct tape like a whole workflow with all these different tools.\nYeah.\nActually the other thing that Oh, sorry.\nGo ahead.\nOne one thing I'll say here is actually Ben I took this from you but I have a text expander that basically just is very good at taking context from Claude into ChatGPT and vice versa almost like what is the like minimal viable context that I don't want to get lost here and then I just paste it into a new chat via hey just add this to your memory and that's been like a helpful tactic for moving from one to the other.\nThe what I was going to say for the UX that you help You realize Ben with your the demo earlier with your Theo James coach is Open AI also shares context across chat threads that Claude doesn't and so I don't think unless within the specific interaction like you ask it oh who is my co-host\nnot in the project yeah if you don't provide it explicitly in Claude or put it in a project knowledge it won't know it and just to expand on what you said yes and so I think the cross chat context is something you get in ChatGPT but also it has memory and memory is you could argue it's a form of cross chat context but it actually lives in its own place it like once you say anything somewhere that you're like I want you to remember this about me and nowadays you don't even have to be explicit about it it'll just be like you could be like teach a course called blah blah blah and it'll show you on the voice mode committed to memory and it's like wow okay now it just knows that about me so that's cool.\nYeah yeah it's really but I agree with you it does not write anywhere close to as good as Claude in my experience Yeah, but maybe what you're making me realize is that for this use case specifically where it is a lot more interpersonal that I it's sounding ChatGPT's experience is maybe even superior because it has voice note and this idea of understanding you more comprehensively without you having to give it explicit context within the chat thread.\nSo, but I think what you're doing here is really smart because what you can do is you could basically use Claude to figure out how you want ChatGPT to behave and then you could go to ChatGPT and bring that over and then just get the all the UX benefits of the interaction with that modal while still using chat cloud for what I think it's like objectively better at which is this kind of work that you just did.\nYeah, I fully agree.\nI agree.\nLike I think the world in which people have to pick one or the other is starting to fade into the background.\nLike I think it used to feel like Uber versus Lyft.\nI'm only going to use one.\nBut now it's it's actually feeling kind of like additive.\nLike I'm going to use I don't use Spotify or YouTube.\nI use both.\nThey just they're just different things.\nYeah.\nSame thing.\nYou go to like different friends for different things or you have like different people that you work with that do different things.\nLike I think almost all these different tools are building their own expertise and you're just going for for different expertise to different people.\nYeah.\nI think Claude for writing on coding is much better but judge might be better at analytical tasks or the image generation image generation.\nYeah, the image generation has been fantastic.\nLike I've been I've been basically I've been using Claude to like draft posts and then I actually take the posts that I draft in Claude and I use co-author.\nI think I don't know if you're still using co-author Mark but it's by that uh the team that does like the agent AI thing I think those guys hunch.\nSo they created this thing called co-author and it like for it studied my LinkedIn and basically I take what I get in cloud I put it in co-author it makes it great and then I pick a part of that and then I grab it and I bring it back into ChatGPT and I'm like make a make an image about like this or give me some ideas for images based on this post and it gives me like three ideas for images and I'm like generate this image and then I take that and I put it along with whatever co you know it's like you got to piece together like a workflow.\nAnyways,\nyeah, that's exactly what I started doing too, Ben, cuz I saw your images getting really good and I actually we didn't really talk about this, but I back engineered.\nI was like, I wonder what Ben is doing here.\nYeah, I landed the same way.\nI give it the post that be like, hey, give me like four or five ideas of visuals that are simple but do well.\nThen they give me the ideas.\nThen I'm like, be 100x more specific because I feel like the more specific you are, the better images you get.\nThen I have, hey, create a prompt for image generation model.\nthat will be really helpful and they'll have a good time digesting and then yeah I take it into forro and and creates an image and yeah that's been working really well for me but anyways let's keep going yeah actually I would love to maybe like trying a little bit more of these like prompt engineering tips that you shared like maybe we can do the like the self-awareness one or the one where identifies the gaps because I think that's like just something cool to model and see the delta because I do think they they make a huge difference and then we can move to the next step.\nYeah, let's do it.\nReview the system prompt that you generated.\nDon't make any changes yet, but identify some gaps that should belong in the system prompt.\nLet's just see what it does.\nOh, no.\nOkay.\nThis is the other thing with like dictation.\nYou like sometimes it's taking other things that you're don't intend to put in the prompt.\nOkay.\nsome pretty good ideas in here.\nAnd so now what you can do is either universally just tell it to apply and implement all of these improvements or if there's like a few that really resonate with you, you can just copy paste those and then tell it to implement those changes.\nDo you guys have a preference which one we try?\nWhat would be the next step in the workflow again?\nSo would the next step be to take whether we just for the speed of the demo, we could probably take what you have already if it's faster.\nLet's do that.\nBut the next step would be to create a project.\nYes, you can go to the project section.\nCool.\nSo I'm going to say just for folks listening, we're just like in the project creation page now.\nAnd Kavita's creating a new project called AI career coach.\nAnd now I believe you're giving just like a quick description, but you haven't added the the system prompt.\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nSo once you just give it a name and a short description, you go in here to the set project instructions.\nAnd here's where you can paste your system prompt.\nSo this is no modifications, just kind of just um markdown.\nI love how it naturally takes that artifact it created earlier and if you hit copy it just takes it with it gives it markdown formatting which see seems to be emerging as the the standard in which a lot of these tools like to make sense of of context.\nYeah.\nAnd if you're doing this and it's like too cumbersome to do markdown when you're doing it like in a chat prompt versus your system prompt.\nEven just like consistent formatting can sometimes be helpful especially if you're if there are like repeated sections to help it make sense of it.\nAnd this is true not just for the formatting of your prompt, but I've also found it to have better results when the documents you add to your project knowledge are much easier for um for it to parse um if you have good formatting.\nYeah.\nSo, what would an example be of?\nBy the way, would you enrich this with any other files before you start chatting or would you do you think it's got what it needs to\nYeah, I think you can get a lot more specific with what you put in the project knowledge.\nSo, in the workshop that we ran the very first chat that once you set the system prompt up is to have a kickoff call where here I'm going to show you the so this is a kickoff call.\nThis is a prompt library that we used for the workshop.\nAnd in this prompt, you basically give it just a little bit of a starting point and then have a back and forth with your career coach.\nAnd then after maybe a few turns of that, you basically put in a prompt to summarize everything that it has learned about you so far through that back and forth.\nAnd then that summary document is what you can add as your first project knowledge.\nBut then to build beyond that, if you have competencies for your skill level, if you're trying to get promoted, you can add that.\nIf you have regular career conversations with your manager and you have those in a document, you can give it that context.\nIt really depends on what you're trying to get out of your AI coach and relevant context that it could use.\nYeah.\nAnd for those listening, yeah, sorry, Ben, I was just going to like give a little more detail on the initial prompt just in case people are curious of the steps, but basically like the initial prompt is basically, hey, like just telling the coach, I would like you to have an initial call with you as the career coach, ask me a bunch of questions to understand like my current situation and challenges and goals.\nAnd then before you hit send, you also add a little bit more context.\nbe like, &quot;Hey, here's my role.\nHere's the company that I work at.&quot;\nLike the type could be B2B, B2C, the industry.\nAnd also, hey, I've been in this role.\nLet's say call it director of product for two and a half years maybe.\nAnd then in theory, that should then like you hit that with the chat.\nAnd and it will start asking you questions, provide context.\nAnd let's assume you have maybe five or six like back and forth questions.\nAnd then at the end, the last prompt that you do is, hey, I would like to summarize all the conversation we just had into a document.\nAnd then once you have that summary that I'm guessing what will happen it creates an a cloud artifact and then you can copy and paste that cloud artifact not in the special instructions but more in the project knowledge basically that's kind of like the summary that of this Ben you're going to say something.\nYeah I I saw the use of the term gem.\nI'm just curious, is that because you used Gemini when you were getting started here?\nAt work, everybody who came to the workshop, we have an enterprise plan to Gemini and so I just contextualized it, but the product team uses Claude.\nSo, it's just they're all the same.\nYeah, they all have the same features of creating projects and adding knowledge and then setting up system prompts within those projects.\nWe talked a little bit about the differences between Claude and and ChatGPT, but I\n\n\nI'm curious, did you find any noticeable differences and what you can get out of Gemini in this context and versus Claude?\nHonestly, I only used Gemini for that workshop to demo them, how to use the features.\nI am a through and through Claude loyalist, but after this conversation, watching that demo, Ben, I think you're convincing me to maybe expand my horizons a little bit.\nYeah.\nNo, that's I'd say tinkering is the way of life these days for me.\nLike I fall in and out of love of products as fast as I discover them.\nBut I was going to ask you once you have that first artifact from that kickoff chat, do you bring it into the project knowledge and then you're done with that original chat thread or do you like to what's your personal way of using chat threads?\nLike when do you continue in a chat thread versus start a new chat?\nYeah, more art than science.\nBut I have found that it I kind of anthropomorphizes, you know, AI a little bit here where I'm having a conversation like I would treat a coaching session where one chat thread is basically focused on one topic that I would go to a coaching session for.\nSo if I want to focus on tackling a specific stakeholder situation, I will give it context, have go back and forth and then that chat thread remains focused on that situation.\nI'll rarely but sometimes I will go back to a chat thread if it's a repeat situation like a few weeks down the road I want to revisit it and that way the context is sitting there.\nAnd this is also beneficial to overcome the issue we talked about earlier with Claude where it doesn't share the context across chat threads which I guess is less of a concern with ChatGPT.\nAnd maybe one last question before we move to the next step is that I'm curious about your choice of not adding more kind of project knowledge to the chat when you were running the workshop.\nRight?\nBecause you could have like maybe have everyone as you were mentioning bring in their career ladder or maybe what is that kind of source of truth that everyone in the company probably shares right like maybe it's the company objectives or OKRs or our mission or values or the ORC chart right so I'm curious why did you decide to like maybe ignore those for now was it more of a time relevance or was there something that kind of made you think this might not be a good idea or this might be too context or maybe we're going to get diminishing returns.\nI am so glad you brought that up.\nSo, we didn't do it in the workshop because of a time crunch, but I have a lot of hot takes on curating your project knowledge.\nOkay, so this is as of June 20th, 2025.\nMy experience with adding unstructured project knowledge has actually led to deteriorating the quality of the output.\nThere are two things you can do to improve it.\nBut this was this experience was coming from a time when I was using projects without system prompts, right?\nSo starting point pre-all was we I would just like upload content and then have a bunch of chat threads in that project.\nwith system prompts.\nI have done two things where to your point in my experience when you give it too widespread content in the project knowledge it sometimes pulls it into context when it shouldn't.\nAnd so in the system prompt you can just give it an instruction to say don't feel the urge to always pull project knowledge only use it as relevant.\nBut I do think that maybe Anthropic hasn't invested too much in into the embedding model or maybe has erred on the side of using project knowledge liberally than like very when the semantic proximity of what you're chatting about and what's in the project knowledge like really tight.\nSo that's when you pull it in.\nAnd so I think giving that instruction in the system prompt can maybe help it behave that way.\nAnd then the other thing you can do is index your project knowledge very briefly like doc name and then maybe a one sentence descriptor of what's in that doc and put that in your system knowledge so that you're basically doing that same thing right like trying to without having actual control on the embedding model like telling it here is the context and description of what is in the project knowledge and only when relevant pull from it.\nSo those are two tactics that I have attempted to help overcome that hurdle.\nYeah.\nNo, I that resonates with my experience like I feel like I think the proper term that people use is like context sculpting like making culture and I think that's like an very important it's almost as important as like the prompt engineering part of it and then yeah I've also had similar results of the indexing.\nI just feel like a lot of times part of the problem is yeah like maybe uses the wrong context but also part of it is like retrieval like not being able to retrieve the right context at the right time.\nSo that makes a lot of sense but anyway so maybe to just move the conversation forward.\nSo it sounds okay like now we're at a point where we've already set the system prompt.\nNow we have we've had the first kind of let's call it like discovery call with the coach where it got maybe all the like base knowledge context about who you are, your challenges, goals, etc.\nSo I guess now the next step is like having that initial like coaching call if you will.\nAnd how do you recommend having that?\nAnd then was that something that you did during the workshop or was that something that you did after like like you encourage people to do after the workshop?\nBasically we did it in the workshop and to give people a starting point.\nThere's two things you can do.\nOne is you can just preemptively let the workshop attendees know to be like, hey, reflect on one career challenge that you're experiencing right now that you would want to practice with once you build out the initial co-pilot or what you can do is as the host of the workshop, I actually brainstormed with within this project as the career coach of asking it what are career scenarios that you can help you with and it'll actually just give you a list of ideas to use as your initial career conversation and then you can just provide this list to the attendees and give them a starting point.\nSo yeah, two two ways to go about it.\nSo, I'm just curious if if I were to just manufacture a scenario and say I had a I had a big product review today and I felt like I kept getting interrupted by one of the executives and couldn't make my point.\nI'm just what what do you what would it do?\nShould let's find out.\nOkay.\nI had a big product review earlier today where I found myself getting interrupted repeatedly by one of the execs.\nDo you want to give me more context?\nNo, I would just say I would just like to see I want to see what it because it's supposed to ask good questions, right?\nAs a follow-up questions and stuff.\nSo, what if we just send that?\nOkay, let's see.\nSo, it's saying that sounds really frustrating.\nThis is very undermining.\nI can imagine how that impacted you negatively, etc.\nI'm curious to understand the full picture.\nCan you tell me more about what happened?\nAnd so then I asked I think four questions.\nWho was interrupting you?\nWhat was the nature of the interruptions?\nHow did you respond in the moment?\nWhat was the overall dynamic in the room?\nAnd then I want to get some broader context.\nIs it a pattern you've noticed with this particular person or unusual?\nHow are you feeling about it now that you've had some time to process?\nYeah, these are really good questions, I think.\nYeah, exactly.\nOkay, maybe let's go into the scenario.\nI agree these are really good questions, but I'm like annoyed with this experience because I'm like, you're asking me way too many questions at once and now you're putting way too much cognitive load on me and you should be a coach.\nYou ask me the most important question first.\nSo, let's say I would want to make that change of I don't like that you're asking me all these questions all at once.\nWould you go back and I guess yeah, how would you go about making that change because I don't like this design basically?\nYeah, I think exactly.\nI think where you were about to go which is you can go back into always ask me one question at a time.\nExactly.\nSo somewhere in here right methodology discovery process begin with by understanding in somewhere in here you can give it like more specific instructions on ask open-ended questions that encourage reflection.\nCan we add something in parenthesis right there and just say important with all capital letters.\nOnly ask me one question at a time and always make sure it's the most important question to ask.\nYeah, there you go.\nAnd then I would save that and then I like to go back to the chat and then basically regenerate the last Yeah.\nIf you hit retry, actually go scroll down.\nOh, so if you hit that, you see that retry button?\nIf you hit that with no changes.\nYeah, that's what I do whenever I want to test.\nYeah.\nSee?\nSo, wow.\nThis is literally how I built my co-pilot is like hundreds of those like changing the instructions and keep retrying stuff every time I make changes.\nI learned something new.\nMany things, new things.\nThis is very cool, Ben.\nUm, thanks for the tip.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, now it basically it got it it boiled it down to what was the question?\nI'm curious about the nature.\nWere they cutting you off mid-sentence ask questions, jumping in to redirect the conversation or something else?\nSo, that's interesting.\nOut of all the questions, it shows a clarifying question about the nature of the interruptions as the best place to start, which I think is interesting.\nI think I I actually really that because it's almost if I were in this situation, it's getting me to reflect to be like, oh, was I giving was I speaking too much and they just want they like extrapolated to the end and just were asking me questions or was it that like they took the conversation elsewhere in which the root cause would be like, oh, I just was off the mark in the my starting point.\nSo, it's almost like I can see why it picked this because once I answer it, it's going to ask more follow-up questions about broader context and pick your own adventure, right?\nIt's like forking.\nIt could be a variety of different reasons and like as with the nature of the interruptions and who it was, maybe you can fork it.\nYeah.\nI think what is really cool like going back to the design of your workshop and I think what's really cool about making the time to have that first session in the workshop is that I think one thing is designing a custom GPT or a project.\nThe other thing is actually using it and like getting to that that aha moment.\nAnd I think forcing people to get to that aha moment in that structured time that you already committed, it's super important because I think my assumption would be that the drop off would be a lot higher if you were not if you hadn't gotten value from that first interaction.\nLike you'll be like you just wouldn't have that intuition of oh let me I have this thing that's useful now that I want to kind of play with or ask the questions.\nI think that's a smart way to design these workshops.\nI couldn't agree more.\nI think I also realized this again and again.\nI think being part of maybe a community like Supra or just like the people we are I do feel like we are maybe early adopters and like more avid users of some of these tools.\nAnd so just by the nature of showing the rest of the workshop attendees that hey here's how you like this is what a system prompt is.\nThis is how it behaves and this is how to use AI in a broader way than just like a chat interaction is exactly to what you were saying is like giving people that exposure to a feature they otherwise might not have discovered that they can do that and leverage it in this way.\nSo, I think getting very hands-on experience in the time you have together and not leaving it as a theoretical workshop is very important.\nGetting adoption and getting people to that aha moment.\nSo, yeah, couldn't agree more.\nYeah, Ben, it kind of reminds me of that analogy that we talked about with Will Newton like maybe it's like a couple months ago of like, you know, we're all in this dark room and like, you know, if we can just be those people with a flashlight or a lamp that's like illuminating and showing the unknown unknowns, that's like a pretty pretty cool role to play and I think super valuable.\nYeah.\nAnd I think that first of all, I'm so happy you came on and shared all this with us, Kavita.\nI think the audience is going to find it really interesting and I hope a bunch of people out there choose to tinker similarly.\nAnd the second thing I want to say just to piggyback on what Mark said and then we'll wrap is Josh Rzik Marks, friend of the podcast, recently had a a LinkedIn post talking about kind of like what the most important skills are going to be in this era of AI.\nAnd I think I where I landed on that is I think tinkering is the skill like the just trying different things.\nAnd I think I heard a lot of people in the comments agree.\nYeah, if anyone's listening just play around and try it.\nThe stakes are super low.\nDon't do it live in front of 20 people for the first time.\nDo it a lot on your own.\nAnd then if at some point you think you've discovered something that's worth sharing, then you could socialize and I think people do find value in seeing like all it takes is one moment for someone's light bulb to go off.\nAnd if you could help people have that light bulb moment, I think it's pretty meaningful.\nSo hopefully this conversation did that for some people today.\nAll right.\nSo, as we wrap, Kavita, how can people learn more about what you're thinking about these days or where can they find you online and then is there anything they could do to be helpful to you?\nI can be reached on LinkedIn.\nAnd I think one thing people can do to be helpful is if you do play around and build your own career co-pilot, I would love to just hear from you and see what use you get out of it.\nSo, definitely reach out and share your wins.\nAmazing.\nAnd that's a wrap.\nThat's a wonderful conversation.\nThank you.\nYeah, you gonna say something else?\nNo, that's it.\nRub rub.\n",
