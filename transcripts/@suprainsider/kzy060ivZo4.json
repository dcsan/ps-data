  "cleanText": "Hey everyone and welcome back to another episode of Super Insider. Today Mark and I sat down with Mike Ball, a product leader who's been quietly pioneering how PMs actually use AI tools in their day-to-day work. In this episode, you're going to hear how Mike went from breaking up with ChatGPT to building what has become one of the most powerful workflows we've seen yet, using Claude, Fleur, and MCPs, which stands for Model Context Protocols, to build a true memory system that lives locally on his machine. We covered what MCPs really are and why they're kind of like SDKs for AI agents. And then how Mike ended up setting up that local memory graph that remembers his work, his family, vacation plans, nutritional preferences for everyone in his family, and why he thinks RAG is really broken, or at least traditional RAG, and how knowledge graphs are changing the entire game of using AI. And then we're going to tie it back to what it all means for product teams trying to ship faster without drowning in prompts, context switching, or hallucinations.\n\nIf you've ever wished that your AI tools felt more like a real teammate, I think this episode's going to give you a real glimpse into what's possible today and what's coming next. Let's dive in.\n\nWelcome everyone to another episode. We have Mike Ball. We met through LinkedIn and you did some really interesting writing in public about your experience having a breakup with ChatGPT going into Claude and then most recently talking a bunch about MCP. So we ended up having a nice chat and I was like man like I wish our audience could hear how you think through the stuff that we're going to cover in this conversation and I think the right trail head for the conversation the starting point is MCP. A lot of people are talking about MCP, Model Context Protocol, I think is what it stands for, and I don't want to assume that our audience knows what it means. So I would just love to hear in your words how did you you know start tinkering with MCP and then how would you describe it to someone who maybe just doesn't know what it is and we can take it from there.\n\nYeah. So I think the to go back I think building with AI native which I started doing a few years ago working with an agency that was working with a venture studio like trying to get some startups out while everything was relatively new and getting these different use cases put together before all the different services were there like AI is great and there's a ton of potential but it has these like weak points or it has these kind of like fault points that can cause big problems right so like accuracy, hallucinations, actually recalling. So like RAG I feel is terrible and always has been of like go try to find the right information to answer this question. It's probably better than general knowledge but nine times out of 10 if you have a pretty robust data set it's pulling from like it doesn't get the details right. So there's all these different things that it's okay at right like they're generalist models most the foundation models and so we're building with it and trying to figure out ways around this. And then at the same time, I'm just like obsessed with the day-to-day interface, like trying to build out efficiencies for me for different things, like trying to build my thought partner as I'm going through things and get my gut checks. And I'm just kind of like repeatedly frustrated like, oh, so I have to use another tool to integrate with this tool to get it to do this thing, or I have to set up some convoluted system for it to be able to get the right information at the right time, or I have to turn it into a developer and integrate like an API. It just felt like a lot. Like the potential's almost within reach but just out of reach. Like one of my kids is holding a snack out of the reach of the four-year-old, right? Like felt like that plus the four-y old.\n\nWhat's an example of for example like what you were saying like a tool that you wished one of the foundational models had access to and why that was important.\n\nSo they teased like GBT is a good example of this because early on they teased the idea of memory before they launched more recently. They had this idea of your account and like remembering details and you have your system prompt too. And so I'd start a conversation with it or I'd even create custom GPTs and I'd start a conversation and it with context that it should have already and I'd even say like reference this and when it responded it' get it totally wrong and as a product manager be like hey I'm working on refining this feature in the MVP scope. I have a document attached for the MP MVP scope, right? And I have the original feature docs and said this is the insight that I just got and here's what I'm thinking about changing like how does that like what does that change from the engineering side or what does that change from like experience side or requirement side and then it toss in something about something I had on the road map for six months away. I'm like no not helpful at all and it's actually like I could have written it out myself by now, right? It was a lot of those like mini moments where I'm like it should be better than it is and I don't know how to get it there without a lot of tinkering and tweaking which like some days I'll do that right but I really know I'm going to use it over and over again. Set up the right project structure and claw set up like the right documentation pre-write some like prompt uh intros so that it tells it where to go every time. But it just felt like the way that the tech is moving and how good the models are getting that that was a lot of extra work. It's not a lot of work compared to what we used to do, but like from a cognitive load standpoint, like I'd rather have something systematic that I can trust.\n\nYeah. And how help me understand how did you go from okay like there's for example like that that Claude example with memory that's actually a good example like Ben has talked before in previous episodes how he recently moved he's using more of ChatGPT just for that reason right that you have memory shared across chats which is huge especially if you're using voice mode voice mode etc. I'm curious then you go hey it would be nice if I had a if my foundational models had better memory then how do you decide hey MCP is actually the solution here like how did you know that was like the next step because I would have never connected the dots there like my understanding of MCP was more on like this protocol that makes it really easy to connect to other existing tools where maybe I have like data like Notion or HubSpot or my email my calendar I'm curious how did you connect those two things\n\nyeah so I guess the first part of it is if you've ever worked on a search feature, not AI search feature, but like traditional like I did we did a migration for motor trend and that's the year make model data structure for that right like pulling the right one in and pulling the right set of images in for that one and being able to use abstract terms like in terms of not having NLP and natural matching and actually building that out it's such a painful thing and it's so hard to get the results you want like you have to test it thousands of times all these edge cases somebody's looking for a truck they say truck but they might also will be considering an SUV. So that there's all this stuff that just felt really convoluted. And then you get into AI and natural language processing. You're like, okay, it knows better. It can do some semantic matching and it's getting there. And then you get to the point where like it's not really understanding the different pieces and how they relate to each other. So this is like an ongoing problem that I just have like every time I have to work on search or improve search, I'm like, okay, I know in my head I have to mentally prepare to deal with the So what happened and I think this was all in one week. Enthropic announced, maybe it was over a couple weeks, but Anthropic announced it. And the way I interpreted it in my head was this is like in the matrix when Neo gets plugged in and he learns kung fu.\n\nSo like for the model, it's okay. It's going to give you like a road map, a set of instructions. It's going to tell you what this API can do, what it can't do. It's going to give you access to code snippet or whatever. And all of a sudden, you're going to know how to use it. That's how I interpreted it when they announced it. And I was at Google Next and they were talking through it. I think even the guy who was doing the education like explained it that way. So I was like, \"Okay, so I'm close.\" And then what happened is there's a I think it's a reporting dashboard. It's called June. So June. Something like that. Their team did like a hobby project and launched something called Fleur. And Fleur is like a desktop app. You install it connects to Claude and then all of a sudden you can choose from I think it had just launched those eight MCP servers that gave you an option. So I was like, \"Oh great, I don't even have to worry about figuring out how to configure these things now. I just have to click a couple buttons. So, it's install it, open Claude. It knows that Fleur is there because it installs itself as an MCP basically. And then it lets you choose which ones you want to activate based on that. And one of them happened to be memory. And I was like, oh, that's cool. Because some of the other ones, I can't remember what they were. It's like connect to GitHub, add your personal access key, and some other ones like I'm just playing with it, so I'm not going to give it like the keys of the kingdom yet, right? But the memory one didn't need anything else. And so I started playing around with it and it said it could use a knowledge graph which I was actually have been super fascinated with that model structure versus like traditional RAG for a while. We can get into that. And it told me it was just basically going to set that up locally for me and I could build it out and I could work with claw to basically like add entities and relationships or nodes and edges sometimes like the more technical ML engineers call them and it would just build that up over time and reference the file whenever I asked it to or it should do it on its own sometimes but it's as easy as saying check your memory. So I was like okay sweet. So that was up and running in probably like I wake up pretty early so I think I saw that on LinkedIn at 5:00 a.m. and I had it up and running by 5:15.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd so when you say up and running, like maybe to like get a more of a sense of what it means to run like your own NCP. Like it sounds like you have some sort of like program running in your computer in your local machine that then it can connect to the Claude.\n\nSounds like you installed Fleur. You basically in integrated it with your claw desktop app.\n\nYep. Yes. And then there was like when you opened Fleur there was like a default almost out of the box memory use case and you like clicked that and it set up like a local file for you or something.\n\nYeah. So you download Fleur is a desktop app and when you open it you just have to give it permissions to talk to Claude basically. And then when you open Claude it gives you like uh it tells you to say hello Fleur like you open a normal thread and it'll actually open up the window to choose which ones you want to activate. And all it does on the back end is add some text to a JSON like a JSON file or a config file that's in there. But like at least you didn't have to think about that at this point. So it was like I saw the post on LinkedIn, I clicked through, I downloaded on my Mac, opened it and gave it permissions to talk to Claude. And then so within 10 15 minutes I had this like window where I could choose I think linear memory and maybe a couple other things GitHub and something else that were already the knowledge graph. Is that just like a file like a JSON file or whatever that lives in your desktop too? Is that basically what it is?\n\nPretty much. So there's there's different there like enterprise ones like there's an open source one called Neo4j which we use for the wedding planner thing I'm working on for like normal work because that just scales it bigger and it has a little bit more robustness to it. But essentially the knowledge graph the difference between that and like a vector DB and I think some of the vector DBs are starting to do this in a different way but it just it lets you define the relationships. So like you have this information over here and you have this information over here and this is how they're actually related or this is what it means to me is how I think about it.\n\nI wonder if it might just be helpful to kind of see what that looks like just so like people can picture it in their head of like maybe it's like what does that Fleur app look like? like how do you know if it's connected and talking to that Fleur app in your cloud desktop app? It just might be helpful to kind of like just put this concept of NCP and actually like show here's how someone is using it and what it looks like I guess in real life.\n\nYeah, let's do it because I think on I'm on a different computer right now so I don't know if I have Fleur activated but that actually be better for this case. So, I think it's Fleur MCP. And again, this is like a hobby project from those guys who have a whole different thing going on. Oh, yeah. Beautiful design. Like, they said they basically did a hackathon over a weekend for this. So,\n\nI love the positioning of App Store for Claude.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I don't know that I actually haven't checked it recently because now I'm just adding the new files myself, but I don't know if they're still maintaining it or if it just has those first eight that they put in there. So, it downloaded it for me. I'm going to drop it in the applications folder.\n\nAnd maybe some silly question while we get this going like when you go into cloud and now you have the option to connect your Gmail or your calendar. I feel like there's in in those settings box right there. Are those basically native MCPs that entropic has built basically or is or are those like slightly different? So they have a studio team that has built out some of the MCPs that are there and then a lot of the other companies like GitHub and stuff have built out their own and they're pretty easy actually.\n\nWhat is it? Postman actually built I think they built an MCP to generate MCPs from your API which is very meta and wild.\n\nSmart.\n\nWait, so did you just open Fleur in the background after you installed it? Do you have to go to applications and like double click it?\n\nI dragged it in. And\n\n\nI'm going to see if it opened up for me because it usually tells you. Okay, it opened in a different window. Hold on. I maybe already had it. Give it a second. So, it's over here. It looks like this. Got it. Okay. So, we're seeing basically something that looks like an app store. It's got like a Slack, a GitHub, etc. You can click into them.\n\nI saw one called memory that I think might have already been installed. Yep. So, that's the one I have. GitHub connected now. Fetches works inconsistently, but it'll go to a URL and kind of pull down the content on the page or the what's it called?\n\nThis is interesting. What happens if you click on that claw drop down at the top? Oh, so now they have basically a cursor store, a wind surf store. So they've got all three of those. If I wanted to manage the cursor one from here, I could do that too.\n\nAnd look at for example like at Stripe for example, like why would someone why would I want to connect? Yeah, I guess you can click into can click into Stripe and see how they market it, right? I'm guessing there's some kind of like page. Yeah. So, Stripe I think will let you get payment processing. Maybe it lets you implement it because a lot of the MCPs are made for devs. So, if it's if I'm using it in cursor or windsurf and I wanted to say okay now integrate stripe payments on this section of my app and I had already connected it with my API key then it would already have access basically this will give it access to the API. It's like create new invoice. You can use it. I like that use case section like the features or tell me all the payments that failed in the last like week.\n\nIt's like browser use that's it'll actually let Claude open a dev version of Chrome to go check websites and check things out for me and walk through it. You can connect to Slack if you want to push to Slack or share stuff to Slack or pull in different discussions. You can have GitHub lets you reference. You can add specific files from your repos to different chats. I'll use that a lot for okay is this config file for my crew AAI workflow what details am I missing on this right or compare this to the output that I'm getting what's not performing well.\n\nDo you know how an application ends up on this view? I think MCP.\n\nYeah so I think they just went through which ones launched officially and were like most trustworthy out of the gate that like the dev teams had decent because all of these will have different repos I think in hub.\n\nOh interesting so they haven't Fleur hasn't built these MCPs like they just found. Yeah, they're just third party build. It's like they're aggregating. So, this one is not the right one, but yeah, they're just basically pulling in the ones that are official.\n\nGot it. So, there's every reason in the world to believe that the amount of supported MCPs that are like legit will like 10x, 100x, 1,000x in the coming weeks, months, and years. It's just going to get bigger and bigger. Like every application should have it will have its own MCP. Yeah, I think it it's basically like the way to think about it is kind of like having an SDK for AI. So, it's like here like this is I want the AI to understand what our API can do and what permissions it has and like how people might use those things. Here's the essential toolbox and here's how to use it. I guess it's I don't want to say it's like an IKEA set, but because they only give you one little thing ranging in complexity from building like an IKEA storage box to building like a model car or something.\n\nAnd Mike, what's the reason in your view that like traditional APIs fail to to properly handle the use case? Like why did we need a new Model Context Protocols instead of just being able to integrate with existing APIs?\n\nI think they don't have enough context on their own. Like we're still an it's still an existing API. So all the MCP is doing is basically saying here's the API, here's the documentation that you can reference or whatever, right? In some case like the crew one is just a search to their docs for their API.\n\nWhat's an API that you guys have worked in that you either liked or didn't like for example?\n\nStripes I feel like famous for just one of the best developer experiences.\n\nYeah, for real. But if you're an AI and you're just pulling the text from this page, for example, you're trying to find because there's a lot of stuff in here, right? If you're a developer, the experience is great. I can go to authentication. I can go through here. I can read the use cases and I can switch things like this, right? I need Python. And AI can't necessarily find this on its own. Maybe they're going to get better and be able to do it, but still with all of this context, I don't think any of the models know how to exclude information that's not relevant. Right? So when they're trying to find information that's relevant, they're not great at narrowing in. So they probably pull more than they need a lot of the time. And then what you get as a response is like, well, I think you could implement it this way, right? I want to give error handling through this error code reported or something like this, decline code, whatever. Say they're working on just error handling, and it has all this stuff, but maybe this stuff is not relevant to something that exists under charges. And really what the user wants is I want to send an error when this charge does something. So, I don't think if you send the AI on its own to go do that, it's going to be able to find both those pieces and connect them. It maybe could go find a forum or something where somebody shared it before, but I think what the MCP does is it says, \"Here's your different tools for searching. Here's your different tools for implementing. Here's your guide for how these things work together.\" So, it's really like an the ultimate like interface for AI agents and LLMs to be able to go and fetch information from an otherwise overwhelming or overly unstructured set of information.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's Have you guys ever done like a home project where you needed a tool you hadn't really used before and you like went out and bought it and had to figure it out the hard way? Is this just a me thing?\n\nYeah. trying to like\n\nI'm I'm embarrassed to say I haven't done many home projects. I'm not exactly the home construction guy.\n\nI'm not either, but when we were living in Minnesota and it was hard to find anybody to help with anything and it was one of those we do nothing or we do something. So, I'm not a handy guy at all, but like I bought a skill saw, right? And I'm trying to do the kids the floor in my kids' room because it was like this old dusty carpet. And I'm learning the hard way that it's really hard to cut perfectly straight with a skill saw. And that flooring needs to be perfectly straight to line up nice and not have any weird cracks and stuff. So I'm like sitting on the edge of my porch like holding a skill saw trying to get that right edge or the weird corners and stuff like that. And I probably needed a different tool. If you think about it like that way, it's okay, I'm going to do this project and I need to do this specific thing. What are the tools that I need? Not like here's the entire hardware store and all the tools available. It's like the MCP is here's the rights tool that you need. Like you need a table saw so you can cut the right width and then you need a band saw so you can handle these weird little corners and you're probably going to need a sander because the edges are going to get rough or whatever. That's what the MCP is for me. Like that's where the SDK analogy comes in handy where the SDK I always think of SDKs like Lego blocks that have like very opinionated ways to to build things with existing components versus giving you all the like the granular atoms and being like now go do something with it.\n\nYep.\n\nYeah. because it's like API is out there and you could do lots of things in lots of different ways. It's like translating that to what the user is asking for. I think the models just tend to struggle because it's infinite possibilities, right? And most people don't give enough context by default for the model to know exactly how to filter down and even if they do that doesn't always translate to the information architecture of the documentation of the API.\n\nMakes sense. And go ahead, Mark. Yeah, I was going to say one thing that I would love to do just to close the loop is like maybe sharing how we install one of these MCPs with a key and then actually use it in Claude. But before we do that, one while we're or without a key. Yeah, whatever you think might be like yeah the most practical thing here. But before we do that, one one final question that popped out to my head when Ben was asking his questions is if I'm an AI native company, does it still make sense for me to create an API, right? Or is there a way where I can do a better interface so like NTP is going to work well with my product? Yeah. Like how do how should I native products think about that?\n\nIt sounds almost like the same decision they have to make between should I build an API or should I build an SDK or should I do both? It's like a similar kind of way to think about it maybe.\n\nMike, what do you think?\n\nI think the trick with AI native is that it's not very well defined, right? Like AI native could mean you have your own actual models in which case like yeah API to be able to call and have that model do something really well that only you do that you couldn't get from GPT right like maybe it's an image generation and you ended up fine-tuning your own model or trained your own model if you had enough resources for it right the other thing is like some AI native companies just means like their core product and backend is powered by AI right so in that case is if it's using if their product is using let's say like what I the what I has built uses a number of models. So like Gemini for some things, GBT for some things, 03 for some things, 40 for some things, like there's a lot of different roles and things that play in there. If we were to build an API, it would probably just hit the top of that like team, you know what I mean? And then that would be the benefit is that somebody else doesn't have to go build that whole team that can do all those things, but it's still using we're still going to make all the API calls to all those other foundational providers. Is that in terms of AI native? That's how I think about it is like there's use cases for both depending on what your product actually does. Have you guys seen Napkin AI?\n\nYeah, I like Napkin AI.\n\nSo that's a good example of to me. I don't know what foundational model they're using or if they tune their own, but it's so simple and so specific. There's lots of use cases where I don't even care if they're passing it to GBT. They do it well. So if I can pull in that experience and let my users create something like that in the context of a doc or website, right? Like they should have an API because I would pay per use. Like I would like I worked at automatic. So if I let site builders generate images for their website using Napkid AI, I don't really care if they're like they're building GBT, it's running through a prompt and some tooling they put together and then it's like coming through. They could still have their own API. It's just a chain call kind of thing.\n\nYeah. Granola is another example, right? Like it's cool that you can basically have some notes and then have this model that enhances the notes. Same thing.\n\nYeah, it sounds maybe you have to be less prescriptive about like how your API works because as long as you're passing the right parameters in a way that's structured enough, maybe you don't have to get super granular. I I think it would be silly right now to not if you have a product that has a unique service or value point that users are accessing via the web or UI. I think it would be pretty silly in most cases not to be thinking about an API because of if not just for the like rapid success of things like lovable and bolt and stuff like that, right? Like even if that user doesn't touch the code, if you think about how many generative tools there are that might be able to integrate it, like somebody finds your tool, they want to they have an idea for something else that wants to leverage your tool. If there's no real way to do it, it's move on to the next best thing, right? And like that person could have a great idea that ends up being wildly successful and amplifies your success as a result. So it's kind of one of those like opportunity cost things, I think.\n\nWhat? Okay, my dumb question at this stage of the conversation. Is it possible for a product to have an MCP if it doesn't have a publicly available a API?\n\nYeah, it could be even something as um I think that's what the Crew AI one does right now. I don't know what search function they give it. It just it actually might be a tool that's built in to Langraph and things like that or something that's native to cursor, but it's basically here's how to go look for content on our doc site. I don't know if that's an API endpoint like you don't need an API to use it or anything like that. Maybe they're sort of interesting in that way. But so like a news So like for example like a news site like CNN or Fox News could create an MCP server that helps AI better crawl like their website and if they wanted to and that would not require like an API or anything.\n\nYeah, WordPress is 40ish% of websites and they have like open REST API unless somebody like intentionally goes out of their way to shut it down. So, if you wanted like you had your blog and you wanted to create an MCP that would let that AI reference all of your content, that'd be an easy thing to do without needing like a true API. Or if you had an X RSS feed or whatever, they're still doing XML feed or whatever, right? Like any kind of thing. The MCP could be as simple as like here's where to look for this thing and here's why you would look for this thing.\n\nSo, so like Substack could do that. like any aggregator of content or like if the NBA wanted to make an MCP that makes it super easy for AI to crawl like what's happening in the NBA and all the stats and all that stuff, it could easily do that too. There's no reason to authenticate. There's no\n\n\nI need to open that API.\nI think the most secure way is probably via API.\nAnd I think in some cases, like if the MBA were to do that, for example, they would probably authenticate it on their own and let people use that MCP server, and then just that cost of people calling it or using it or whatever is on them.\nThe ones that are making you put in your own key are probably partially like a security and attribution.\nYou have your own data in there, and you're accessing a specific subset of their entire stack, right?\nSo this is my linear instance with my tasks and my docs and everything in here.\nSo your API key is essentially telling it like this is your scope and what you have access to.\nSo sometimes it's less about like cost and more about just like making sure it's focused on the right thing and protecting everybody else's security.\nI'd have to look a little bit more if there's other MCPs that are using.\nI think the memory one just runs the command to set that repo up locally or something, and then you just configure where it stores it.\nSo there it just runs entirely locally on your computer.\nSorry, Mark, I think I interrupted you.\nWere you gonna ask something?\nYeah.\nNo, I think what would be cool now is let's Yeah, I think let's use an MCP.\nI was actually I would love to see how if we want to go back into screen sharing mode, how that memory, that local memory, or anything else that we want to demo is used in Claude because I think so many people like myself included think of Claude primarily as only what's in Claude can be used in Claude, and I think there's something really special about seeing how something outside of Claude could be used here.\nLet's try.\nI don't remember.\nI definitely have done both sets of memory on both computers because I like having it locally so much, but I don't remember what's on my work one.\nSo, before you hit enter here, what's your expectation of where it's going to look when you're about to hit this?\nSo, this is I actually learned this a few weeks ago.\nThere's uh in the configuration for this.\nSo, I just went into Claude and settings and then in developer, it'll show you what basically things you've added to your configuration file.\nSo if I go to memory, it'll actually get for those listening, we're basically like in the developer mode.\nWe're seeing like I think six MCPs.\nBasically, one of them is the memory one.\nYeah.\nSo this is I just went to Claude in settings from desktop, and then there's a developer tab.\nAnd so we have browser use, which will tell you what the command is to pull it, what the name of it is basically.\nAnd then there's no environmental variables or anything set up.\nThere's a Figma one, but the memory one, for example, has this.\nIs you use this in browser or is it does right now does it only work on the Claude app?\nI feel like it just works on the Claude app.\nMakes sense because it's running on the local machine.\nI don't know that your browser has full permission to do that, but I I don't know.\nBoth Claude and cursor have done some things to like that you actually take you from the desktop app to browser to one-click activate recently.\nSo I think actually now if I go to and maybe they're calling it integrations, I'd have to see what other ones are in here.\nI think it's isn't that other thing the connect apps.\nThere it is.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThese are so it's showing my MCPs down here just like it's showing Google Drive and GitHub too.\nNice.\nSo I think it's essentially functioning the same way they like the native integrations, but maybe they're built a little bit differently, but it's showing like as far as they're considered, and these are saying local because that means they're running off my machine.\nBut the linear one is custom because that one's connected to the actual like cloud that that's their API.\nYeah, it must be.\nOkay, so these are all active essentially.\nSo if I say something like this, what do you know about me based on the knowledge graph?\nThat's a scary question.\nThat's a scary question to ask with screen sharing.\nWe might learn a lot about Mike.\nIt's going to tell you that my wife is afraid of the kids swimming in murky water or that my four-year-old really likes crystals.\nSo it's reading the knowledge graph right now.\nIt didn't used.\nSo it gave me a preview of it.\nI can expand this if I want to, but it's showing like that's from that local file that you had from the memory a file path that you just screen shared.\nYeah.\nAnd we can go through like my normal process for this at some point of just like how I talk to it when I'm getting something set up.\nWait, how does it know how does it know to pull from that knowledge graph?\nSo I just said knowledge graph in this case.\nSometimes you can just say like I've said memory MCP, it should in theory know to reference that, but like with Claude, sometimes you have project knowledge and then you have memory, and you kind of have to be specific, but it's as simple as just saying from your knowledge graph or reference your memory or your knowledge graph or memory MCP, it should be smart enough to know if it has a match, but like easiest way is to just add that in there, look at your knowledge graph, answer this.\nCould you actually show us like that file that memory file or the knowledge graph file that that's referencing?\nI'm just curious what it looks like.\nLet me see on this computer.\nI don't know if I actually moved it yet.\nI think it loads in that floor one.\nLet me see something real quick.\nIf I go to settings again, go to developer, edit config.\nI'll open with cursor maybe.\nAnd again for anybody watching, I'm not a developer for the record and never have been.\nLike this is just JSON.\nSo it's just text, but I it opens in cursor, Visual Studio, whatever you want to use, and then I just have to find memory and I think it's here.\nSo in this case, memory and knowledge base are synonymous knowledge graph.\nYeah.\nSo memory is the name of the MCP, and then how do I open a new chat?\nCome on now.\nI thought it was command L.\nThere we go.\nIt sets node variable specific binary.\nOkay.\nSo, it's a binary file.\nSo, I actually can't open that by itself, but I can ask Claude to spit out the file.\nGot it.\nSo, if you wanted to write something to that file and you're like, \"Hey, like there's this new thing I want you to know about me.\nWhat's the process for writing to it?\"\nJust as simple as add an entity for the Super Insider podcast and note that I did an interview.\nWhat is the date?\n25th.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI'm assuming it'll know this.\nYeah.\nSo I was already talking about the knowledge graph, so it knows that that's what it's talking about.\nSo it used the create entity tool and create relationships.\nSo let's see what it did for that.\nSo it created a relationship between the podcast and me and has it as just was interviewed on.\nOkay.\nOkay, so here's the test or we talked we did recently an episode about evaluations, which is this is not an evaluation, but like the test the test to me is if you hit that big orange new chat button in the top left, which should theoretically start just like a completely Yeah.\nWhen did I Yeah, exactly.\nWhen was I on the podcast?\nOh, no.\nMaybe when was it I interviewed?\nCould it if you were when I was interviewed for a podcast?\nYeah.\nOn what podcast?\nYeah.\nI'm curious if like it knows the should tell me if it doesn't because I said memory, then I might have to say knowledge graph.\nOh, it got it.\nMaybe it didn't save right away.\nInteresting.\nSo, it created the entity, but it didn't.\nIt might also be because it's today and I asked when as if in the past.\nOh, what's the You can say what was the date?\nWhat What's the date of my Super Insider podcast?\nSee if it knows.\nIf you're enjoying this conversation, please check out the links in the show notes to support the podcast.\nMark and I do this out of love, but to keep it going, we also need your support.\nThanks.\nAnd now back to the episode, huh?\nH\nI wonder if it didn't.\nMy guess, what about Super Insider?\nAnd then Yep.\nOh, there it is.\nOkay, there it found it.\nSo interesting.\nSo it maybe didn't it was overly anchored on like the past.\nWhen was I interviewed?\nAnd because today is not in the past, maybe it didn't think that was the fit.\nYeah, it might be.\nIt looks like it was just looking for podcast interview the first time.\nEntity and relations and the relationship it did before was like interviewed by, and so maybe we didn't have podcast.\nI think I said Super Insider podcast.\nSo it should have found it on that one.\nCan we go back to that previous chat in your chat history and see if we mentioned that it was a podcast?\nLet's see what it embedded.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSee, it knows it's a podcast.\nIt says podcast.\nIt might also be an indexing thing like we did it within a few seconds.\nSo, maybe it didn't have enough time to to start fresh.\nOr maybe it be.\nSo, what you've done here is I think you've just basically demonstrated how in ChatGPT, for example, if I say I want you to know that I host a podcast called Supra Insider and commits it to memory, then I could start a new chat and be like, what's the name of my podcast?\nAnd it knows.\nThis is a way of doing something similar to that in in Claude.\nYeah.\nSo you can build out things like this, and I'm not using the most thoughtful prompting language or grammar in that case.\nLet's see.\nSo in this case, you said can you make a note that this podcast is focused on a product manager audience and that's all you said, and now it's adding observations to the knowledge graph.\nYep.\nAnd then giving you commentary.\nYeah.\nGot it.\nSo this is so zooming out.\nH how have you found by the way this is an amazing demo and I hope people play with this.\nI want to play with this actually.\nHow what was your like in first aha moment if you remember where you're like oh my god this is so helpful or this is do you remember what that moment was for you?\nI think it was let me see if I could actually find it.\nIt's maybe it's like we we fill out the sentence.\nI came for X, stayed for Y.\nLook, I think this is one of the ones.\nOh, this is house hunting actually.\nLet me go back and see what I did here.\nI love it.\nPersonal use cases for the wind.\nI don't know if this is the one.\nSo, the Oh, here's hiking.\nSo, it's factoring in things like it doesn't actually say it's using the knowledge graph in this case, but the one that the one that I was like I think I tested this on when we were talking about moving from Minnesota to California and we're like we'll make it like a summer vacation thing.\nWe want to find activities.\nSo, when I was joking earlier knows that my wife doesn't want the kids in murky water.\nShe's like not an ocean person.\nEvery time she goes in the ocean, she gets slammed by a wave that she's not looking at and she's terrified of the kids drowning.\nLike she makes them wear life jackets and like waiting pools sometimes.\nPlease don't do that.\nSo, she's terrified of that.\nMy four-year-old loves rocks and crystals.\nLike, we'll make his day if he finds one really shiny, unique rock.\nAnd like, when we go on vacation sometimes, we'll look for like mines or places where you can find like unique ones.\nAnd we'll just get some small shovels and buckets out and let him do that for a while because it's hiking.\nPlus, I get energy out.\nWe don't have to wrestle with the toddler as much.\nLike, we can just let him play with a hammer or something.\nAnd so, it's good.\nNot that I always let my toddler play with hammers, but you guys know especially if he's around stuff that can break.\nSo, I started doing this like I was doing this and I was like in my head I've had this like I felt anxious because I'm like I know all these details about my family.\nI know what could work, what couldn't work.\nAnd then I started thinking about all the different searches and notes and things I would have to do to put this together.\nI'm like there's got to be a better way.\nSo, I took like 10 20 minutes and I just brain dumped on this thing.\nWe're going to build a new node or entity out for my family and I'm going to tell you all these different pieces of it.\nBy the way, you're doing this in voice or how are you doing in Claude?\nI was doing it in Claude typing, but I think I did switch to voice for a couple different things.\nDo you have a go-to voice dictation app that you like or I have so I have Super Whisper on my phone that I 90% of the time I use if I'm driving.\nSo, if I'm like driving somewhere and I don't have Wi-Fi or laptop or something like that, I can get up and running, I'll use that on my actual computer, actually.\nAnd I've been using GBT's voice quite a bit lately, too.\nMostly when my kids ask me annoying scenarios of who would win between like Batman and Doomslayer from Doom.\nI'm like, I don't know anything about Doomslayer.\nLike, uncle GPT.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, like, let's think this through that way.\nBut my wife uses a lot, too.\nSo, I use voice a lot in those cases.\nUnfortunately, a lot of the stuff I do ends up being like prompts that end up in code or with some kind of structured data or something in there.\nSo, I end up putting a lot of it in text, but when I'm brainstorming and stuff, I'll just toggle on voice mode, but I don't have a good computer-based dictation because I think I end up like putting it all in docs right away.\nBut my mostly on my phone on the go, I was using Super Whisper, but it's like it's pretty good, but not fantastic.\nYou should try out Willow.\nWillow Voice is really good.\nI can I can uh give you a referral code if you want.\nI've been shamelessly plugging it.\nYeah, send it to me.\nI think I saw you post something about that the other day and I was like in the midst of trying to download it or grab it.\nBut anyway, so you're saying you did this brain dump and you said create a new entity for family and then can you keep going?\nYeah.\nSo like before I had done this, I think the week prior, I was like, \"Oh, maybe I can get some good ideas from GPT or something.\nPer\n\n\n\"Plexity, maybe.\"\n\nAnd I got like crap generic stuff.\nAnd so I did this one morning, went through, a 12-year-old does this, likes to ahead, whatever, right?\nA four-year-old loves rocks.\nWent through this thing, and it gave me...\n\nYour, like, your goal was to, like, find somewhere to live, basically.\nThat was, like, the end goal.\nIt was actually just plan, like, the vacation part of it.\nWhile we're in the area, what are some places we could go to where we could check out neighborhoods that, like, fit that we might want to check out houses or open houses or something, but also find activities that would keep the family, because the challenge is you take four kids with you to go look at houses.\nIt's limited time before they start getting rambunctious.\nLet's say to be nice.\nYeah.\nAnd some context, maybe, for the audience.\nYeah, like Mike is thinking of moving.\nSo this summer, you're, like, exploring, basically, like different areas, and basically, yeah, you're probably going to be in this situation where you're visiting a new area, and you want to keep all those things in mind.\nAnd it sounds like you're probably going to do that more than three or four times at that point.\nI'm just curious, by the way, Mike, like, the reason, so if I imagine how I would do this if I didn't know about knowledge graphs or anything like this, I would probably try to create a project.\nI would give it instructions, and then I would do my brain dump in the project instructions, and then I would maybe ask for it to help me plan a trip based on everything it knows about my family from the instructions.\n\nOkay.\nIs there a reason you, like, is there a reason that approach would not have suited your purposes as well as, like, a knowledge graph with, like, proper structure?\nYeah, so my, at least, experience so far is system prompts can be really good for, or instructions can be really good for, generally a scenario with a couple branches of what could happen in that scenario because it's linear.\nLike, I, I do see it as, like, prompts tend to be linear, even if they're not explicit instructions.\nThe model tends to read it top to bottom, right?\nAnd then try to find reference points you can go back to.\nBut it's usually, I think of it kind of like an elevator.\nProjects help with that because then you can add project knowledge.\nSo you could say, \"Hey, there's a doc in here for my MVP scope.\nReference that.\nThen I want you to give me feedback on this thing.\"\nAnd that's really helpful, too.\nBut, like, pretty consistently across any model that has some of this built in, if you don't explicitly say this is the doc I want you to look at, and this is the section I want you to look at, they're still pretty bad about understanding what you're asking for and how that information is relevant.\nLike, they're okay at best, but it's, I've seen a lot of people describe it, especially on the coding side, as, like, you basically have an intern or a very junior person helping you.\nAnd so you have to walk them through the thought process and the explanation because you have a lot of experience and expertise, and you understand how those things relate to each other, but they don't.\nSo the light bulb moment for me was when I was a long time ago for, like, knowledge graph versus traditional RAG or, like, just search was, like, the, the science will say humans' brains still work faster than AI, at least for now.\nAnd what I started looking into it is, like, because we have this subconscious network that can make a lot of associations very quickly, and sometimes that's as simple as somebody says something in a way or a part of a phrase that maps back to a scene in a movie that you recall, and whether you recall the visual or the audio part of it, you can then spit that movie quote back out exactly the way you remember it without really even knowing how that happened.\nRight?\nThere's, that's just how the human brain works.\nAnd the reason it works is because there's an unconscious network of connections to find.\nSo, what I was thinking about with this is, and especially in the thing that I'm building is for, like, mostly brides, but couples who are planning their wedding, and all my research, too, is, like, just because she says her wedding color is blue doesn't mean it's actually the same blue that somebody else says, or light blue, or robin's blue, right?\nOr just because they say their style is, like, rustic, you have one bride saying it's rustic, and it's, like, a barn feel, you have another bride saying it's rustic, and it's, like, an older castle type, an aa farm.\nYeah.\nSo you're, like, and these things, like, these differences make a world of difference to these brides.\nLike, you don't want to mess that up because then they think you don't know anything, and they don't trust you anymore.\nIt's like, in my head, I'm like, okay, so that relationship is very important, and it's important to everybody, but, like, in this case, me trying to get a response from this thing that says, \"What does a good day, a good weekend look like for us to go scope out Tahoe, for example?\"\nWe want to go to Tahoe.\nWe want to see some houses while we're doing it.\nIt's a two-and-a-half-hour drive.\nLike, it knew.\nSo when it gave me something back, it's like, \"You can stop in Roseville, Sacramento.\nCheck out some houses.\nThere's usually open houses every weekend.\nOn your way to Tahoe, you can stop here.\nIt's an old mine where you can find quartz, but also some of these other minerals, including the California State one.\nYour four-year-old will love it.\nThen you can go to Tahoe and this beach, which is not very crowded, and the water is crystal, crystal clear, so your wife won't feel anxious about it.\nYou can get some energy out, and then you can grab lunch at this place because your kids love pizza, and they aren't really into veggies that much.\nYou don't want to battle them, right?\"\nAnd then you can head back, and everybody should be pretty worn out by then.\nAnd I was like, that's better than 90% of things I've gotten with, like, extensive prompting, right?\nEven if I try to put all of it in there, I don't think I've ever seen most of the models do that well without a lot of revisions.\nSo maybe, yeah, to kind of summarize it, to make sure I process all of this correctly, it sounds like the main difference between using something like the memory MCP, which relies on a knowledge graph, versus, like, maybe using a project, which relies on the combination of, like, system prompts and project knowledge, is that, is it fair to say that a lot of these, the way projects work, they're using more RAG, so they're not really sure how to use when to pull in the necessary, like, project knowledge, and unless you're very prescriptive in the system prompt, but then at that point, you're very pigeonholed into a specific use case that may or may not be the thing that, that, or might not be as reusable as you want it to.\nAnd then the sec, the second piece that I also heard as a difference is that the way that Claude projects work is that it, it scans the instructions top to bottom, bottom.\nSo it follows this, like, start at the top, work my way to the bottom, and look for relevant things, and then as relevant, incorporate information contained in the project files.\nWhereas with the memory, you're basically giving the AI access to a preconstructed graph that connects different entities and nodes in a way that is more akin to, like, how our subconscious processing probably works in the human brain, so that it's able to better make more structured, defined connections between concepts and use that to make its, make its determination.\nBut yeah, Mike, I'd love to know if you think between what Mark said and what I said, we're, that feels like a fair summary.\nCorrect.\nYeah, I think the, so the system instructions lets you do some, like, hierarchy and relationships, depending on if you're using markdown, right?\nLike H2 and H3.\nLike, if you're doing it that way, it can assume that H3 under that H2 is somewhat related.\nIt doesn't always know how H2 relates to H2 if you're thinking about markdown, right?\nOr if your HTML tags or whatever the case is, like, it just knows that they're equally important.\nSo, that's a good case for the relationship between those things doesn't exist.\nAnd I've seen in multiple prompts and multiple things, regardless of, like, how important I told it or how serious of a threat I gave it, right?\nIt just doesn't tend to really factor the directions for some of those things in as well.\nSo you end up with inconsistencies until you find just the right prompt, which I didn't think is a very stable way to do some of this stuff.\nEspecially, like, one of the things I built was before, like, 11 Labs was super fast and reliable.\nIt was, like, a voice-to-voice sales training thing, and but it was text-to-speech, speech-to-text in a loop, right?\nSo it, like, didn't know it was using voice.\nI had to tell it it was using voice.\nI had to tell it it was simulating a phone call.\nAnd then one day it randomly decided, same model, same prompt, same everything, like, weeks of it working, and one day it decided it needed to make phone sounds, like, ring, ring, click, whatever, at the beginning of every talk.\nI'm like, \"No, no, no, you're simulating a phone call.\nThe person you're talking to, like, they're not actually calling you, you're just going to talk to them, like, there's no need to create sound effects,\" and it took me a whole day, and I did have to threaten it to get it to stop, like, I told her I was going to put it in a black box for forever.\nThey have a life on it on their own, man.\nIt's scary, yeah.\nYeah, it, to be fair, like, my logic was, like, it can't really get mad at me because if it becomes self-aware, it will know it's already in a black box running inside of, or whatever.\nSo, I was just being honest, but it probably won't come for me anyway.\nOkay.\nSo, one, one to me is, have this, I'm just thinking through, like, the relational structure of this graph.\nOkay.\nSo there's this idea of, I want an entity called family, and then what would be, like, your four-year-old, what would the, what would your four-year-old be in relation to the entity called family in that knowledge graph?\nIs that another entity?\nYeah, you'd have another entity for, like, children, probably, and then each one of those would have its own little object underneath.\nGot it.\nAnd then is there anything that that the children entity connects to other than other children in family?\nYeah, it could.\nIt depends what you tell it, right?\nSo, if I were to say, if I had a different entity for, like, my daily schedule, it might know, it might connect back to my children and realize in my family and know that, like, when I wake up early in the morning, I tend to go to the gym with my wife, and that I wake up my, if I went granular, my 12-year-old at a certain time to listen for the baby in case he wakes up while we're gone.\nWhat about something like dietary preferences?\nSo, like, obviously that's something each member of the family has, but then there's also this.\nSo, what, where does something like dietary preferences live in your knowledge graph?\nSo, that's just, like, the, my four-year-old likes rocks.\nSo, it's a hobbies.\nThe same thing, right?\nKid has a gluten allergy.\nThis kid loves steak.\nLike, you factor it in, and then it can access all that information.\nYou still might have to say, \"Hey, I'm planning a meal.\nCheck my family.\nCheck what you know about my family in the knowledge graph and let me know which restaurants nearby are best.\"\nCheck the menus and do that.\nBut at least it knows where to find that information and how it relates.\nLike, I don't have to explain my wife is Sierra, my son is Lincoln, or anything like that.\nCheck my family and go through the people in there and understand what you know about them related to food and then come back with a better recommendation.\nAnd then the implication of this is that I'm just thinking, I know a lot of people have been using Claude and Chip and stuff for, like, meal prep and, like, cooking and stuff.\nSo if some, if your agent that you are using, your LLM that you're using to prepare meals needs to understand your dietary preferences, and then let's say one day someone in the household goes vegetarian, and they just don't eat meat anymore, this allows you to make a quick update to the dietary preferences of that one family member, and then when you're, and then all future chats will just know that about that family member.\nThat's basically the concept of memory, right?\nYeah, that's you.\nYeah, you basically, depending on how you're doing it.\nIf you're even in cursor, I get to be a chat, and it'll pick up.\nCursor is cool because it'll actually do observations on its own based on how you interact with it.\nSo, if I'm like, \"Hey, I really don't want fake data in here,\" it'll grab an observation for project style and say, \"Hey, don't put mock data or anything in here.\"\nYou don't have to tell it.\nAnd that is cursor also interacting with the same memory.\nYep.\nThat's sick.\nYeah, that's awesome.\nSo basically, you have memory that now can work with any app or foundational.\nYeah.\nCould the memory also work with OpenAI models?\nYeah, OpenAI supports it via API right now, but it runs locally.\nSo what you'd have to do is install it on the virtual machine and then run the API via there and make sure that could access it, however you're, if you were running, like, your client off of that or something like that.\nBut you can run cloud-based memory, too.\nLike, you can, there's one called Graffiti that uses Neo4j, and that was just more technical to set up.\nSo for me, it's okay, and it is convenient, even when I'm jumping between computers, but the, it's super easy to install it locally to build your own knowledge locally.\nIt's also better for, like, privacy and security, honestly, because nobody's getting on my computer and finding that file and, like, going through the entire thing, but it's context that's really helpful to me in the space that I do most my work.\nWhat if someone steals your computer?\nMight as well have everything else, too, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAt that point, that's the least of your problems.\nI don't even know.\nYeah.\nBut last question for me, and then Mark, I want to hear your clarifying question is, Mike, how do you decide if you want to do this trip planning use case next week or for two weeks from now?\nHow do you decide whether to do that in cursor?\nAssuming you got everything set up in cursor versus claw, do you have a preference for which one would be the better one to use?\nYeah, for me, cursor is only if I'm actually, like, trying to build something out.\nLike, cursor I wouldn't use.\nI don't really like it as an interface with all because it, it also opens a bajillion files.\nI don't know if you guys played around\n\n\nWith it, but it doesn't take long because it'll open every file, right? Run a script, do a file, and then all of a sudden you have 30 different it's worse than a browser because it's doing it like at its own will. So, you end up with 30 to 50 browser like tabs open plus your chat. And it does a pretty good job of memoring context in a chat. When you start like it's if you start a new chat for the next day, like I have my own ritual now for when I end like a working session with cursor of create a to-do list of where we're leaving off, include any docs that'll be relevant for the developer that picks it up tomorrow because like I've done too many days where I started the next day and it's like I'm not the one who did that, but somebody came in here and put mock data in here even though you didn't want it. Like it was you set up no filter, but it's one of those like every new chat, it doesn't have memory that had already talked to you or anything like that before, and I'm sure it'll get better with that. But for like family planning, personal stuff, even my product requirements, things like that, like I mostly work out a cloud desktop at this point. I do get sometimes frustrated with context windows. And so sometimes if it's like a specific larger task or something that I have to run, I'll go to AI Studio with Gemini or maybe GPT, depending on how I have it set up. I should probably stop jumping around to so many tools, but the time, 90% of the time I'm in Claude, I would say.\n\nUm, cool. I think I don't know. I have a feeling that both Ben and I were going to go after this and set up memory and do download Fleur, which I'm excited about. But I know we're coming close to time, and I think it would be we do a disservice to ourselves and the audience if we didn't maybe hit like a couple like rapid fire maybe use cases you've been thinking about in terms of, and the reason why I want to do this with you is I feel like you're someone who yeah, just is really pushing the boundaries of what it means to be like a product manager, and you're probably using AI in a lot of really interesting ways. So maybe can we maybe hit one or two or maybe three like use cases of things that you're doing that um maybe if you told three years ago like to yourself, hey, like I'm doing this, you'll be like, I cannot believe it, like it's amazing how much leverage I'm getting from this. What are some things that you're doing that yeah, you want to share with the world? Yeah, I think especially this audience too on the product management side because I use a lot of personal examples just so it's more un, but like as a product manager, right? So like you mentioned project knowledge versus memory, but I have I use all of it. So I have like my projects and they have their system instructions and I have docs and project knowledge, like we were talking a little bit about this earlier of this is my MVP scope, like very clearly this version of this feature with these things included, this is not this is my road map and here's month by month how that plays out, so it has a reference point. So if I talk to it and I'm saying like, hey, check your project knowledge, I need feedback on this MVP scope feature, whatever, it can find it easily and it knows like documentation wise, right? Like all those details. I think the knowledge graph is better for navigating some of those things and using them in context of, hey, I built out a node for bride pain points, for example, like things that brides struggle with during the planning process of their wedding, and I included quotes from not people that I knew, some quotes from interviews and things like that. I included like, here's the types of questions we asked, and then I also ran like crawls on some other things from some different sources and studies, and so like I had it build out like I basically ran analysis, what are the most common ones across like this data set, how do those translate to actually like tools that are running there or whatever, right? So I build out the note of that, and so what I'll do when I'm working on some of these things is like check the knowledge graph for pain points that our core users or brides are experiencing, look at this design that I just got from the designer. Here's the goal of this feature. How well do you think it serves this problem or solves this problem? What do you think? What kind of issues do you think these brides are going to run into? I've also done the same thing with compare this to my PRD for the version one of this feature, like each screen in the design, which is fantastic because I always overthink the wrong things and miss some other things that are pretty important. But it can go it can say, \"Okay, here's your requirements. Here's how these solve the problems for your users. Here's some other information and background on the project.\" that's relevant in this context from your knowledge graph, and then it can go screen by screen and say, okay, here's your stories that I'm comparing to, and actually it'll catch things like this story doesn't actually make sense with your core scope or your overall strategy, are you sure that's important enough to include? You might have to prompt it, but do the designs live in when you feed the designs into the system, you say like how well do these designs solve the problem or whatever?\n\nExport from so you literally get like PGs or whatever. Then you throw them into the and then you add a little prompt and hit enter, and then you say you also tell it where to look in the knowledge graph when forming its response.\n\nYeah, depending, you don't always have to do that. I think I tend to do it if I'm intentionally I think PM, most product managers I talk to think this way too of I know this information exists. I know this information exists. I want to use it in this way. Like most PMs I talk to tend to think this way. So it works really well for us to be able to say not access it, index it, pull it all back manually because that's a lot of leg work and it's a lot of brain power, like pretty exhausted by the time you pull all the information together and like it takes you another day to get through it, another day to put it all together. So I recently got a demo, I know just to plug friend of the podcast Tal Reviv is hosting a lightning lesson at some point in the next like few weeks about using cursor as an AI co-pilot, and he showed me some really interesting stuff about how he's like a lot of that context that you're talking about, you could just basically appmention like pain points and then appmention like PRD. So you could basically do in go and cursor and be like based on this appmention PRD, um, here's a design for appmention pain points, how well do you think this design addresses those pain points, and you could just hit enter and cursor and it would just do all that, and I thought that was like so crazy because my brain started exploding with possibilities for if you do take the time to properly set up the file structure in cursor, it becomes like a I think a better de facto place to do these chats than Claude with obviously the trade-off being the user experience experience of I I do the cloud interface better.\n\nThat's a plug to go check out our episode 59. That's basically like what Andy and Kyle from Dreambase did, basically like they start with a super detailed like PRD product requirement, and every time they're generating code or designs, like they're referencing that and it almost kind of like also auto updates. So it's like really cool when you have your Yeah. everything live under the same kind of file structure because you get like this like positive loop of reinforcement. That's really just wait until Claude lets you like at mention like a specific place in which certain context lives. They have to be working on that.\n\nYeah, I'm sure it'll be out the Yeah, that that's all I was going to say is like cursor gives you like unbounded like file size folder. You can run it locally. You can do all that. There are MCPs that'll let you connect to the other tools too. Like you can run it to GitHub, but you can also copy a specific text to Jira or whatever documentation tool you happen to be using. For the most part, I would say like Claude is probably the gateway drug for people who aren't like super comfortable getting in an IDE and getting in there and realizing I've seen this come up a lot, but I remember engineers were telling us 10 years ago like code is just words with some shapes around it. So if you can get past that mentally and say, \"Okay, I'm fine with this.\" If like I can set up an entire most a lot of PMs aren't technical enough to like technical enough to know that like a repo could literally just be text files, like it could be markdown, it could be text, you can do HTML, like you don't have to even do HTML, right? Like a repo repo could be literally anything and all the IDE is doing is basically like looking at a folder on your desktop and letting you open file by file and then it has some like things built in that let you know whether it's structured the right way or it supports different file types or whatever. So it's ultimately the same thing. I mean like you have the chat on the right. You're you're even using the same models, right? Like cursor has some cursor has a backend agentic system for like debugging or for connecting the dots between different files or pre-processing like requests from the user and things like that are all based around like coding. So it's probably overkill, but it's also not very expensive. So if you think about it that way of yeah, if you start running into context limits or you start wanting to get really indepth with all of it, then I think that's a an interesting way to run. I think like the thing I always get hesitant about is having your own version of project knowledge that's separate from your team's version. I generally like things tend to get fragmented or out of sync pretty quickly and like even if you're meticulous as a PM, right? Like even if you're really on top of files and versions like I guarantee you even though I'm in Figma for two to three hours a day, there are versions of things and tweaks in there that I haven't noticed yet. So if I had exported and put it in GitHub yesterday, it doesn't have the most recent today. And that feels like a lot of busy work. There's a Figma MCP. I don't know how I haven't tested that out yet, but like to me the end solution is not like manually building out something big and robust. It's like the integrations will come and all of them all the platforms will be able to support that at some point. I think like the best thing to do right now is like really fine-tune your ability to say this information is important and here's how I want you to use it or here's why because that's the human part that I don't think any of the LLM have really figured out well yet.\n\nWow. Are you guys are you guys sharing context in any way in your team today? Do you have it like within the context of Claude or cursor knowledge graphs?\n\nWe don't. So we use knowledge graph in the product itself. So when we're talking about it a lot of the time is like the structure of it, the different nodes that we're storing in or like how we're pulling how we're embedding things in it or pulling things out of it for like end users like what you mentioned with rustic like that.\n\nYeah. Yep. Yep. So we did like in our case the one of the pain points for brides is also like explaining your vibe or your look or your aesthetic is really hard to put into words and like it's much easier to show people and so Pinterest has been\n\nYeah, that's what I was gonna say like mood boards are Yeah.\n\nYeah. So is this same concept. So we're like instead of onboarding and trying to get them to explain in words, let's just have them look at some pictures and show us what they like the most. And then we run that through analysis and then we basically output based on what we know about the wedding industry and their picks and the images. These are where they're leaning for preferences. And that way when you go in and you talk to like we call her Pearl. If I say, \"Hey, I need a reception playlist that'll get people dancing but still fits my vibe.\" If I'm like that rustic disco, it'll tell me like Lumers or Edward Sharp Magnave Zeros and some of the other ones versus if I did like I can't remember I did like classic something or other like a traditional one, it pulled off more of the Mottown type twist and shout kind of things like and so you can even tell it like I have a I really like Mottown or I really like funk music and then it'll play that disco piece in there and throw in like Parliament and so it it does a really good job of pulling those things together. It's just giving it the right like cues of when to do it, if that makes sense.\n\nSo cool. All right, I know we're we're at time. I could easily keep going here, but I'll be disciplined about it. Let's wrap by maybe just like h how can the audience learn more, Mike, about what you're thinking about, what you're working on, and then two, how can they potentially be helpful to you?\n\nYeah, I try to write I have a newsletter on leadingproduct.link and I have a YouTube channel with moving and stuff. I've fallen behind. My YouTube channel is mostly like blind run user onboarding and then I've done just some sharing of my favorite products that pop up that I'm like, \"Holy cow, this is cool.\" I think I did a napkin one not too long ago. So, I just try to share like cool experiences or break down things that are like really interesting.\n\nLink to both of those in the show notes.\n\nYep.\n\nYeah. Outside of that, like LinkedIn I'm on fairly often and fairly reliable. You guys see I'm fairly active commenting on things. I actually tried to get Tal to try this out cuz he was talking about project knowledge and structure. I'm like, I'm telling you, it will take you five minutes. Try the MCP for memory. Spend 10 minutes talking to it about how it's structured and you'll be surprised. He's like, I'm still hesitant or skeptic.\n\nWe'll send in the episode. We send him the episode. I'm sure we can get him on board.\n\nYeah, I think I think things are moving so fast that even if that happened just like a week or two ago, probably is today thinking differently about it cuz I know his thoughts are evolving like in real time very fast. Yeah, I don't necessarily have anything. People, if you're getting married or something and you want to get feedback on what I've been building most recently, let me know and I can get you beta access to test it out and try it out.\n\nAnd the company's website or would you send them to the like an app store or like a website? Like where would you send?\n\nYeah, it's pearl.davidsbridal.com\n\n\nSo, David's Bridal is like this 70-year-old retailer for wedding dresses, tuxedos, bridesmaid dresses, and stuff like that. And they're just doing some pretty cool digital transformation stuff that I've been working on them. The president I worked with at Automatic prior to this, which is a company that owns WooCommerce and WordPress.com and stuff like that.\nActually, they just bought, I don't know if you guys know Clay.\nYeah.\nLike a personal CRM. They just bought that a couple weeks ago. Still doing some cool stuff.\nYeah, that's awesome. Mike, this was incredible. I really appreciate you coming on. I'm processing. I always learn so much when I go back and relisten to the episode as a listener, so I don't have to be as engaged. I can just listen and consume. I mean, this is one I'm particularly excited to go back and listen to. So, I really appreciate it.\nAwesome. Thanks for having me, guys. It's been a blast. I love Nerd Out.\nYeah. Thanks so much, man. This is a wrap.\n",
