  "cleanText": "It will be the biggest issue of 2026, I think, in B2B AI, is just the inability to recruit talent.\nNo one ever said to Winston Churchill, \"Did you bring World War II in on budget?\"\nThey just said, \"Did you win World War II?\"\nThe truth is this: when it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.\nThe running in the early AI markets has been very much attention gets more attention gets more attention.\nSo if you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it's very hard to catch up.\nReady to go.\nGuys, I am so glad to be doing this at a normal time.\nWhat everyone didn't see was me at 6:00 a.m. being slightly slow to start in the last show.\nDoing this at normal time.\nGreat success, guys.\nIt's so good to have you back.\nGreat success.\nIt's a big week.\nThings just keep accelerating, Harry.\nDude, things keep accelerating.\nAnd I'm going to start with one that you tweeted brilliantly well, Jason, by the way.\nYou said about Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman joining Meta.\nAnd you said, \"The wild story of NFDG.\nTwo Silicon Valley legends built a $1.1 billion fund, 4xed it in two years, and then abandoned it all for Meta this week,\" which is bluntly what we saw with them moving.\nWhy don't we start with you, Jason?\nHow did you analyze this because it's pretty big and shocking news?\nWell, listen, I want to, I want to have Rory help me with the math here because they're also, they have, they're 4x on a $1.1 billion fund.\nThe Wall Street Journal said it's about 50% deployed and they're already closing another fund, right?\nTwo partners and a few other guys for 99% of the venture world.\nThis is beyond a dream outcome, right?\nBeyond a dream outcome.\nAnd it's not that I don't like, it's, it's a, that there's a lot to the story.\nObviously, it's a moment in time, right?\nThat in including the exit of GitHub, right?\nNot founder, right?\nWho's had a run to want to go work for a dude.\nSee, here's the problem.\nLike, one, I get it, right?\nThe excitement when I, I just flew back into Palo Alto today, the Bay Area.\nI was in SoCal for a week.\nI already feel the vibe.\nLike, I want to do the same.\nBut I also worry this is going to be like the Trump administration, like everyone's going to quit, too.\nLike, they're not going to last.\nLike the Elons and the Davids and all the techies aren't going to be there for four years.\nAm I, do I really want to go work for Meta for four years?\nIt's, it's, that's the only weird part in it.\nBut I get it of the moment, right?\nI don't want to be freaking meeting founders and writing checks, right?\nI want to, I want to be, this is a moment in time and there's only, you know, this is a, this is a once in every 20-year moment in time, right?\nThis is like this isn't like this is like 1999 except it's not going to implode on us in, in 12 months.\nAnd it was a lot riskier then because there wasn't a whole bunch of large incumbents willing to, you know, take your quitting and monetize it for a hundred million bucks.\nSo in many respects, it's more zany by far than what's going on, what went on in '95 to '99 when I actually was around in the business.\nThis is something we've never seen before because there's never been incumbents just willing to plop down this kind of cash to hire people for God's sake, right?\nJust to go do something.\nAnd it gets back to what we've discussed a couple of times, which is those that small number of high priests of AI who are deemed to have the answer just have huge market value.\nAnd this is the market working true.\nAnd, and help us.\nSorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, Harry, but let's just do the math for a moment for folks that might read or watch.\nSo, I have a $1.1 billion fund.\nIt's 4xed.\nOkay.\nUm, let's be generous on the math, but, but true, right?\nHalf of it's deployed.\nSo, 500 million times 4x.\nThat's to 2 billion.\nThat's 1.5 billion profit on paper, which we can talk through.\nThat's 300 million in gains already.\nWe're ignoring some subtleties, right?\nWe're, we're already 300 up, the three of us.\nCorrect.\nThe two of them plus a few guys that probably have 2% carry.\nThey're already up 300 million in two years.\nThey're up 300 million in two years.\nAnd, and this is why the offer is so good, cuz you know what you're getting is you, you, you had a billion dollar fund.\nYou put out a half a billion.\nYour 4x up, one and a half billion gain.\nYou're, you know, you're not, remember, it's worth pointing out, you're not getting that money now, right?\nAs, at least to my knowledge, as a GP.\nIt's the LPs.\nThey're basically, and I'll give them huge credit.\nThey're taking care of their LPs.\nThey're saying you can take half your money off the table, which is effectively means even if the whole thing goes to [ __ ], you got a 2x, right?\nSo, the LPs are getting the money off the table.\nWhat they're giving up, and there is a real give up here, they're giving up as investors the right to use the other 500 million and the other billion that they were clearly going to raise in two weeks flat because they're those guys.\nSo basically what this does is it, it says to the offer, you should think about the offer as being kind of in three components.\nMr., Mr., Mr. Nat and Daniel, we will take care of your existing LPs in a way that will make you feel good cuz you're a reputable person.\nSecondly, you're walking away from $1.5 billion of investable capital, right?\nAnd the worth of that depends on what you think you could turn it into.\nLet's just say you could do another 4x, which means 3x of gains, which means 4.5 billion, 20% profit.\nThere's a credible argument that's 800 million of value to you, Mr. Nat, and Mr. Daniel.\nAnd obviously, whatever other offer they got for that had to be better than that, right?\nEffectively, they gave up 800 plus they had premium carry in the fund.\nSo, let's call it an even billion.\nThey gave up 800 million to a billion in theory to join Meta.\nI personally think, you know, forget the, and I agree, there's all sorts of, you, what do you want to do with your life questions, but I think cashing, I mean, not having to put that money out in today's frenzied market and instead getting kind of, if they got anything like a comparable equivalent in terms of capital return, that's a pretty damn good deal, right?\nIt's also an excellent deal for the LPs who, you know, are effectively getting, I mean, you know, they are losing the stewardship of those two guys on their investments, which is why there's no new investments.\nBut on their existing money in the ground, you know, if they put in four bucks, they're getting, so if they put in $1, they're getting $2 back and they still own their other $2.\nSo if SSI goes great, hooray.\nIf it doesn't go great, they at least got a 2x.\nSo, you know, for the LPs, it's an, it's an interesting one.\nAnd, you know, subtle nuance.\nI believe the terms are that overall, and this is net, will buy 49% of the fund, but each individual LP can put in to sell as much as little as they like and then it just aggregates.\nSo, you know, there's a lot of LPs going, \"Hm, do I take my 49?\nDo I hold tough and sell nothing?\nOr do I ask, 'Hey, I take it all if it's available, right?'\"\nYeah.\nThis is a chance for liquidity in a stellar fund early.\nIt's an interesting question we could talk about.\nGreat.\nI remember, I remember a couple months ago, I was having lunch with one of my LPs that I share with Harry and, uh, after lunch, the, the, the LP was going to meet with them for the, for this fund for fun to, to put it all.\nAnd I'm like, \"You're, you're doing what?\"\nHe's like, he's like, \"Jason, it's not even like the same game you're playing.\"\nHe's like, \"Don't worry about those guys.\"\nThey're like, \"We're, we're not, you're not in the same box.\nYou're not in the same bucket.\"\nI do not think LPs are happy about this outcome.\nBy the way, I think many LPs, don't get me wrong, they're happy to get cash back and good, good economics back, but I think there was such excitement and fervor around them as a partnership and what they were building that they will be sad to lose the stewardship and the future funds personally is how I read the LP sentiment from, and I think at, at that level, that's probably true, but there's a lot of people look, getting jilted is one thing, but getting jilted with a 2x is a lot less painful, right?\nYeah, sure.\nYou want it all, like, you know, you know when funds end, most of the time it ends in weirdness, it ends at, you know, pain in the butt for the LPs.\nI'm giving Daniel and that very great credit.\nThis is a very clean ending.\nThey're like, they can look everything in the eye and say, yes, I mean, simply put, you, Mr. LP, would like us to do venture capital for the next four or five years.\nIt would appear in a market system that we all live in, our highest and best use is building AI for Meta.\nSo the market has spoken and that's what we're going to do.\nAnd I'm not, I genuinely not surprised and I can say that with some credibility because I mean, what I should, I, I competed for a deal with those guys back and, you know, we lost to them, right?\nAnd it all worked out in the end.\nUm, because look, they're wide, Rory, Rory, they beat every single person in market and I, and you know, I ended up getting to work with them and I think wonderfully talented guys, but I remember saying to the CEO, they won't be doing this in four years because it was obvious to me why.\nThat's interesting.\nWhy would you do venture?\nIt's, it look, it's a perfectly good gig, but it's not like they have so much more talent.\nIf I was someone when you meet two people, one of whom's been the C, talented entrepreneur early on, we looked at that round at Zamarind, the CEO of GitHub built the most first, most compelling product and then his colleague has built that, you know, been involved in that kind of early AI stuff, capable of being a founder of SSI, your highest and best use is not being the 50 venture guy, even if you're the best venture guy.\nThere's other things you can do.\nNo, I'm totally not the, I've never felt so unspecial.\nYou should, I felt, I felt this way going into venture myself.\nI felt like I was walking into quicksand of a world with fungible sources of capital where clearly some GPs are better than others, like in terms of adding value.\nNo question.\nSome funds are modestly better than others.\nBut, but are you really like the only value I think you can add in venture in the world really is if you discover talent that would otherwise not get funded?\nLike that's the mitzvah in it, isn't it?\nLike you find, you find the young Rory.\nNo one would fund him and he builds Cursor.\nYou've done a good thing for the, for the world.\nNo one else is really adding significant value to the world adventure.\nDude, that's why I did Project Europe.\nWe just funded this, we funded this kid in, we funded this kid in Athens with Project Europe who's doing humanoid robotics from his grandmother's garage.\nNever, ever would he have been found.\nYeah, there is a good, there's a good, that's a unique value you could add, right?\nJust, just one question for you.\nIf I'm an investor in SSI and I've just put in a big check and Daniel led that fundra, I am a bit pissed off now.\nIt's interesting because that was, well, why, why it's going to sound zany, but why are you pissed off this week rather than a couple of weeks back when he stepped away from SSI?\nNo, I'm saying it because, because he led the round as an operator and he was in charge of the fundraising, committed to it as an operator and I think that has a responsibility there that you don't piss off a couple of weeks later.\nI think it's an interesting, Harry, when I remember, um, I, when I wrote it up, the other thing I said it was an interesting parallel to Gary Tan because Gary Tan left Initialize to run YC two years ago.\nI instantly got it, right?\nI don't know Gary very well, but I have a chance to sort of watch him a little bit over the years and people, we have a lot of LPs in common and people thought it was crazy.\nBut he, their fund too is going to be a 10x fund, I think, with, uh, Flock Safety, uh, Rippling and others.\nSo he left them with a 10X fund, right?\nA great position.\nA lot of them are involved in YC today as LPS and otherwise.\nBut there was some people were upset.\nThey're like, \"We love Gary and we wanted to go another couple rounds.\"\nThey weren't, they were the, the LPS we had in common.\nThey were, don't get me wrong, they're all happy for him, but they were, they were upset briefly because they thought he was going to do this for another 20 years, right?\nAnd, uh, you know, I'm like, \"This is, this is guy's a builder, right?\"\nTotally.\nI, I, I don't think, I, I agree.\nThe same thing exactly applies here.\nYou know, people with those talents are going to be drawn to the thing that can most allow them to instantiate those talents.\nYou shouldn't make decisions based on someone else quote unquote doing the right thing.\nAll you can do is evaluate their incentives and motivations.\nAre they aligned with you?\nAnd if they are, most of the time it'll be fine.\nBut even then, I mean, kind of back to what you said last week, Jason, you know, we're seeing a lot of founders tap out.\nWe're seeing more people say either, you know, walking away from something or in this case, walking towards something.\nIt's just going to happen in this market.\nAnd yeah, you can be pissed for a day, but I go back to what I said.\nIf getting screwed over is getting 2x in cash and a ticket to ride on the other half in two years, we should all be so lucky.\nI'll just end it with two, two.\nOne, I really don't think this is about money.\nBoth of them worth half a billion.\nAnother half billion.\nI don't think they give a [ __ ] about that.\nThe, the, the final thing I'll leave it on is like, do we think this talent accumulation machine that\n\n\nAzak is building. Is it going to work?\n\nI think it will work. I think it already worked at X. I think they're running a little bit of the Elon X playbook of just being insane, cracked, creating this mega mecca for talent. And uh, I think it, I think, I think you almost have to do this playbook. You have to create a mega mecca for talent somehow, right? And uh, I think it will probably work. The best want to work for the best. It's always been true our whole careers. The best and the very best only want to work for the very best. They won't tolerate anything else. They won't tolerate. That's why so many struggling unicorns are in an existential death spiral because they can't attract anyone great. Not a single great person is going to join uh an ex, you know, unless the founders are great. Some folks don't care that the growth has fallen to 10%. But the best only want to work for the best and they want to, and the, the tough thing is this, you know, they want to work for the prominent best in many cases.\n\nAnd so this is in the two by two, the best and super prominent. I'm going to go 80% of people want to go there. The best people want to go there, and you need soldiers, not, not just, not just captains and generals, right? So you got to attract them.\n\nI broadly agree with that, and I think one of the things, it's funny, I'm just reading one of the many open, you know, books about OpenAI. I think it's called Empires or something, and they talk a little bit about how they deliberately and ostentatiously wanted to raise their profile for exactly that reason, Jason, to be able to hire the very best people. So this dynamic has been there, you know, I mean, literally one of the first emails, I think it was IA sent to Elon was basically some version of, if you would lend your name to this project, it would be cool, cuz we would hire more engineers quicker, cuz you're cool, end of email, right? Back in 2015 or 16. So I totally agree with that. So at that level, I think, Harry, the answer to the question is yes, it will work. These wildly smart people, we, they, they are members of, as I say, the mythic in the inner circle of people who know the magic spell. They will make the product, right? I think the interesting question as a business decision: Will being the fourth or fifth, you know, broadly capable LLM be a compelling business for Facebook, for Meta? Will that show out? To me, that's a much more interesting and difficult, let we go, unclear question. But I don't think they're agonizing about that now. They just feel the existential need to play.\n\nI was with a founder this morning of a multi-billion dollar company. It's a very good company. And they said, \"My single biggest challenge today is Cursor.\" Cursor is just paying insane amounts of money for everyone. And no, no, no, no disrespect to Cursor, but the question for me was just like, wow, if this is a tidal wave, then of just incredibly well-funded AI companies just paying through the nose, and it's not just Meta, but suddenly 10 others have to compete, where does this end?\n\nWith people losing money, I mean, obviously, um, I mean, the, the, the talent war, it's under discussed. It's under, how the hell, if you're not at a top vibe coding company, or how are you going to compete for talent? You better find somewhere where being very good is enough because you cannot take these teams head on. There is just no way. And you, and you also can't pay them $800,000 a year plus RSUs plus guarantees. You just can't do it, right? It will be the, the biggest issue of 2026, I think, in B2B AI, is just the inability to recruit talent. I don't think build firing up lovable or replet is is going to solve this problem. I love both tools, don't get me wrong, and I see too many startups saying, I'm going to hire an AI guy, or I'm going to hire my worst one. Like, if a startup says, I want to hire a VP of AI, I'd like to sell all my shares on any secondary market that exists. If you think your answer is to go hire a VP of AI that wears a tie and is studying things, like, just shut the startup down. Sell it for anything. Sell it. Go sell it to uh, Grammarly if you can while there's time.\n\nGod, you're just piling on. I mean, look, and I, I, I think that's true. I mean, obviously at the application level, I won't say the caliber, but the kind, you know, if you're a user of the models, you don't need to have the same caliber people as it takes to build the models, provided you have people who can deploy them, who can use. So I, I see Jason making his I disagree face, right? I don't think the problem is, it's true, but the problem is a lot of these categories, sure, you have exposure to the same models, but your ability to do more with them requires an S-tier team. Otherwise, you're just, you're just, you're just lost in a sea of the sameness.\n\nYeah. And that's the point I was trying to make, Jason. You're exactly right. Is that, look, yeah, they're not doing it by paying $800,000, a million dollars in cold hard cash to the, you know, 50 people in Silicon Valley can do that. You build a center of excellence somewhere else. You have to be very, very good, but you don't have to be quite as on it as if you're build building Cursor, right?\n\nI was with, I was actually talking this last week with the CEO of a slight, it's, it's adjacent, but it's a really good B2B company at coming up on 200 million in ARR, doing well. Okay. And um, and he's like, yeah, I basically have to give half a percent or percent of my company to each AI engineer now.\n\nWow.\n\nTo get who I need. Like, you can't do that for 50 engineers, can you? What is, how does that math work out at like the series D delilution stage?\n\nPretty badly. Pretty rough on everybody. He's, forget about the cash. He's like, I got to do like half a percent or more to get the people I need today. And he's like, I got no choice. Right. Coming up on 200 million. That's the time when engineers start to get like 0.001% of the company.\n\nBut that, that, that's partly why this wave, I think, will be highly damaging to venture returns because the employee stock-based comp dilution is going to be so significant and so much more significant than in prior generations of venture.\n\nIf you're, if you're Anthropic or OpenAI, you're just continuously having to top people up every year.\n\nWell, information said OpenAI has more SBC this year than revenue. They came out with a piece this year, more SBC than revenue.\n\nAnd intellectually, you're correct. And you know, I'm not going to lead the SBC doesn't matter comment because it's more than revenue. It might matter, but it's more than revenue only. Can I make a comment and say no revenue only because there's this speurious way of accounting for it that's your cash based, which is quite misleading because it's obviously not, it's a del, the way when you're private, the way you got to, it's more clear to think about it at least part as a as a dilution percentage versus cash, and I understand there's an element of both it when you when you're sitting there allocating the money, the more it's freely tradable stock, the more you should think of it as cash and a direct replacement for, you know, cold hard cash. In which case, if it was a 100% replacement for cold hard cash, you could argue the loss is approximately double what it's stated to be. But, you know, my, but my mind is this. If you end up building a big ass company and you look back and you go, this is horrific. You had 20, 30% more dilution than you'd expected. You still got a pretty good big company, right? So if it works, I'm not advocating mass delusion, but the truth is, and it's not going to be the fatal error. Not getting there is the fatal error. It's like a line I often use. No one ever said to Winston Churchill, \"Did you bring World War II in on budget?\" They just said, \"Did you win World War II?\" Right? When it really matters, the truth is this, when it becomes existential, like you're talking, you know, you do what you have to do to win. And this is where, you know, again, we said it before, you give your face, Meta, a huge credit. I don't know if they're right in making the assumption that this is existential, but once you've decided it's existential, you just do what you have to do, right? But hold on, listen to this. Listen to this statistic. It's pretty funny. Last year, according to the information, um, OpenAI had 4.4 billion in stock compensation. That was 119% of its gap revenue. Okay. Yeah. Now, that's a lot, but it projected it would, it would fall to 45% this year. It's not going to happen. Now, it's going to still be in the triple digits. That's to Harry's point, right? There, there's the directional, I, I would, I would assume if your SPC exceeds your revenue at scale, it's pretty dilutive, right? But the fact that it's 119 instead of 45, that's a lot of dilution, isn't it?\n\nOddly, it might be. I'm not trying to really get down in the weeds here. I'd like to know the percentage dilution because one of the weird things on SBC comp is it's, it's priced and when you issue, and it's basically based on the difference between, you know, it, it, it's, it's an accounting entry based on the 49A valuation of the stock, which has been motoring up enormously. So they may well be recording a large, very large quote unquote gap SBC number. But the delution, while still big, may not be nearly as catastrophic as\n\nFor sure. I, I'm being too simplistic. If they're worth 300 billion, right, and they're issuing 10 billion of stock, it's 3%. Right.\n\nThat's exactly right. And they have to run it through. That's exactly right. Because I couldn't articulate it because I'm a bit jet-lagged, but that's exactly it. The bigger. You see this a lot where you have a company that has an enormously high mark from the VCs or from the public market. They issue stock, and then you see this a lot in the public market. Two years later, the stock has returned to a much lower level, but the SBC still rolls through the books as if it was all priced against the 300 billion value. And you have those absurd, you know, public company where, oh my god, the SBC is 3x the revenue, right? And you, it's all about this nominal accounting charge which is meaningless. Now in this case, it is interesting because to the extent that the 300 billion is a money good valuation, then if you deliver, if you give someone 3% of the company, they are in fact getting, you know, nine or 10 billion in cash in value, and if they can realize it via a series of tenders, then good on them.\n\nI mean, if the stock, if the market cap of that company stays at 300 billion or greater for the next four years, the people who got $10 billion today will have $10 billion of cash cap. Good for them. Speaking of kind of capitalizing on appreciation of stock price and using it strategically there, I'm jumping around the schedules that we have, but there was one that I thought was really interesting was CoreWeave who bought Core Scientific for $9 billion. This is after they bought Weights and Biases for a billion dollars. I'm intrigued. Is this just incredibly strategic use of an appreciating stock price? How did you think about this?\n\nI thought it was a great deal. Quick and simple. I think cuz I remember, you know, the early on the hosting business in '98, 999, and I looked at Exodus way back in the dawn and couldn't get my, couldn't get people there like a tiny number. It goes public. It's basically offering the first ever hosting facilities. Goes public, has a huge valuation, and then in the dot-com bust, it went bust, absolutely bankrupt because it had leases and debt, and it killed it, right? These guys have a mark, have a currency, they bought, is it Co-Scientific? Apparently, they lease a lot of data center from them. It effectively deleverages them somewhat. It uses equity to take out rent expense, and it means that over the next five or six years, if the demand for, I mean, shop car for this next sentence: If the demand for data centers doesn't continue to grow to the sky, and they have to have a more robust balance sheet, they will look back on this and say, \"Great move. We took a bunch of fixed costs out of our P&L in return for, you know, a small amount of dilution.\"\n\nI'm sorry. Who would take the bet that the demand for data centers would go down? I, I might consider it, Harry. And I know I can see it in your face. I can see it. Everything considered, I would put that bet at least on the table as being plausible at some point in time in the next three or four years that people find they're ahead of their investment schedules and just want to slow down. And I can see the pain look in your face, but if I was the CFO of a company like CoreWeave, where effectively what they did was they took themselves from 100% leveraged on the upside of infinite data center demand to 80% leveraged on the upside of infinite data center demand. That's a smart slight de-risking.\n\nWow.\n\nIt's not like they're shorting Nvidia stock here, dude. Which is the bet you're taking if you really believe. I mean, there's a whole series of bets you can take depending on how much you think the hyperscalers are going to spend to build these models in the next four or five years, right? It can all the way from I'm so leveraged to the upside that I'm going to buy Nvidia out of the money calls. That's if you really believe. And you can just go in a descending order of risk reduction from there. These guys are very leaning in on data center demand. They're not walking away from that. But what they're doing is replacing, I mean, cuz it's effectively a financing company. They're replacing fixed charges of, you know, debt and leases with equity. It's a good move.\n\nYeah. It would help us all if there were like 10 CoreWeaves. There's like, if you have a public company trading at a crazy high high multiple, right? 20x revenues, um, that has existential losses, you got to use your stock as your currency ASAP. You got to buy everything you can that can address the bottom line or other challenges you have, right? And these are these are like fun times. If you're a target, you can get bought in an hour because they're going to, the CoreWeave corp dev team is going to be looking for 20 assets that they can buy that can fix some of the structural challenges in their models. And we haven't had an IPO\n\n\nLike this in a while.\nLike, we haven't had someone searching with a high-priced equity.\nUm, and it's it's a great deal for everyone to turn high-priced equity into cash.\nAnd I don't know if they even say the challenges in the model as much.\nI mean, you it's not the negative in the model.\nIt's just the nature of the model.\nI mean, the nature of the business is you, you know, you buy things, fix that.\nThey have long-term contracts against them, so they're a lot less exposed than some of these guys that are doing short-term contracts.\nBut it's just a fixed cost business.\nYou own this great big freaking data center, all these machines, and as long as there's money coming in the top, it's fine.\nBut if not, it's brutal.\nSo, it makes sense.\nAll I was thinking was, well, Jesus, look at the other meme stock being Circle.\nWhy are they not leveraging their stock appreciation to do the same?\nProbably because they're still not out of the first um the first 90-day period where it's a pain in the ass to do it.\nAnd believe me, I am willing to bet that you know cuz CoreWeave member has been out there a good I can't remember a couple months longer at least.\nI should know, right?\nYou know, generally there's a period of time where you want to put your first I remember asking this actually when I was in the public board.\nYeah.\nYou probably want to put one or two at least one earnings release on the board as the asset that you would sold to your investors before you start doing crazy deals.\nI am sure that stock is burning a hole in their pockets too.\nYeah, they'll do something.\nBut one, you know, Circle uh had net income of 156 million last year.\nSo, CoreWeave, they both have inflated stocks.\nThey both should use it to buy to to to enhance their business models and they will.\nBut it is different if you're pro if you have net positive when you're profitable.\nYou think about these deals differently, right?\nIf you're burning cash that you no one sweats the delilution from an existential deal, you just do it.\nIt's like, let's get going, guys.\nRight.\nWhen you're profitable, it just it it confuses a lot of things, right?\nIt impacts your earnings.\nIt it impacts you care more about dilution.\nThere's a lot of things going on when you're profitable.\nYeah.\nI I think if Circle does something, it will be about buying distribution because obviously their biggest cost is the money they have Coinbase.\nSo finding other ways to get their coin in the hands of users will be their thing.\nWhereas obviously for CoreWeave, it's just addressing their cost structure over time.\nIt's a weird thing.\nIt's like SBC.\nIf you're losing money as a public company for real, you don't care so much about dilution.\nIt's just more delusion to achieve your goals.\nYou only really start to care when you cross the curve to profitability.\nRight.\nYou you're exactly right.\nAnd I would just one I It's not that you don't care.\nIt's the Maslov hierarchy of caring.\nRight.\nIf you don't make profits, then it doesn't matter because you're screwed, right?\nSo you and that's why VC and that's why kind that's why early on VCs are right to keep an eye on delution but not get all antsy about the economics of it.\nJust keep an eye on delution because the way I think of it is we're all in this together.\nIf we create something of value, everyone gets a share.\nOnce you're exactly right, Jason, once you've created something of value, then a decision to allocate some of that is a much more meaningful economic term.\nI I could not agree more.\nIt's why the treatment of the way to think about SBC as a venture firm or a pre-profit company and way to think about any kind of delution is just very different than when you have a cash flow positive asset.\nYou know, it's a different thing.\nSpeaking of kind of different things, a different kind of asset, but one that I found very encouraging was actually to Bravo going shopping with Olo.\n320 million of AR uh gap profitable business looks looks decent and it's bought for $2 billion by Tom Bravo.\nIs this PE coming in to save the day as we've heard time and time again?\nRemember it was public as well.\nSo they're taking it private.\nI listen Rory may have more thoughts.\nI we have I have talked about how personally I I've been concerned I haven't seen the PE deals I'd hoped right with these funds raised.\nIt's a good sign, right?\nIt's a vertical SaaS player.\nUm, if you want to compare it to Toast, I know a tough comp, but it's 2 billion versus 25 billion, but you could see the upside.\nLike, there's positives and negatives in that, right?\nDefensible.\nIt is defensible, right?\nSticky.\nIf you squint, maybe there'll be more of these vertical SaaS deals.\n6x ARR though, for us as investors, like this doesn't this doesn't buy the the the biggest house in Atherton.\nLike, there's only this is not going to buy a fourth house, right?\nThis is like at Yellowstone Club, we're we're just going to get a condo.\nWe're not even get we're not even we don't even get something on the hill at the you know at at 6xR.\nYou're right.\nIt's a it's a meat and potatoes deal.\nThat was my aha.\nIt's a 20% grower profitable 6 1/2x all's right with the world sensible kind of deal, right?\nIt's exactly the kind of deal.\nAnd I think it went for 10 bucks a share.\nI think the damn thing went public for 25.\nSo just as a reminder what's happened here went public in 21.\nHopefully the VCs made money.\nI can't remember who did the deal.\nYou know, trades back way down and obviously it gets to a point where after three years, four years, people are willing to transact and the buyer's willing to pay six and a half times.\nSo, total solid meat and potatoes deal.\nAnd you know, if you've got any more 21% growers that are profitable, I'm sure to that have, as Jason said, good defendable vertical niches,\nu I'm sure they'll be glad to give you six and a half times for that, too.\nIt's not going, you know, it's a start, but it's not going to save 500 to 700 unicorns single-handedly, right?\nYeah, it is.\nI think that 20% number, we talk about it a lot in venture at Scale, right?\nBut it's an example of how important it is, right?\nYou got to be above that number to be of interest, right?\nProbably, right?\nAnd profitable\nand profitable, right?\nYeah.\nIt's still probably rule of 25.\nI we should look it up, right?\nBut you got to be above 20 and profitable.\nAnd um there's too many unicorns that are profitable, but not above 20 or 25, right?\nUm, but yeah, that that's your 6x outcome.\nWhat are they underwriting this to?\nIs this like a 3x?\nProbably only because\nyeah, I think that business is inherently a two to 5x kind of business most of the time.\nSo I'm sure that Tomab they're looking at this going you know there's five other pieces of technology you can bolt on here sell to the same customers do the kind of thing that frankly PE does well to some extent I would say better than us which is just you know figure out what your top customers want go buy the other little things bundle it all through get more share of wallet from you know the top 500 restaurant chains and just build a business here\nJason, does this make you more or less excited to be an Owner seeing this happen?\nUm, neutral.\nUm, I mean Owner O Owner is even smaller than Toast, right?\nSo it it's core customer today there's a lot of overlap right but it's smaller so it just reinforces the non-obvious thing that when you're selling to end consumers the long tail is sometimes where the biggest dollars are not I've been on too many boards and with SaaS VCs who are always like go more enterprise why aren't you going more enterprise when they don't understand certain end vertical markets right and sometimes like service like like ServiceTitan it is very enterprise right it's not obvious like ServiceTitan is not a bunch of plumbers paying 20 bucks a month out of their own pocket but more of this B2B to see that hits consumers the longtail is where the money is right it took Shopify even today Shopify is very enterprise only 25% of their revenue is is an enterprise so going to Rory's point I don't know I'm sure the game is one way or another to combine those two with two or three players right and build something that's three times the size so I assume that's the playbook\nGuys, when I listen to this, and I'm a founder, okay?\nI hear crazy payments being made for venture funds.\nI hear PE coming in.\nI hear massive meme stock price rises.\nAnd then I look at Carter's data.\nVC deals at 8-year low.\nAnd it's hard to raise money for a lot of founders.\nWhat world are we living in?\nAnd how do you think about these two kind of paradoxical statements of everything we've discussed combined with VC deals at 8year low?\nI think they go together and it's tough.\nI think what's happened is there's a whole bunch of things all pushing I think to was it to use a really nice phrase a flight to consensus or a flight to quality.\nThe truth is there's a small number of things that are working really well and everything else looks dull in comparison right and it's struggling to get attention, you know, we it's become a very consensus bet and there's a whole bunch of reasons for that.\nYou know, we've talked about this before.\nThe whole staying private for longer means a much smaller number of companies are going to get all the way and they tend to get all the attention.\nSecond, entirely separate comment.\nI think the early AI market, the running in the early a markets has been very much attention gets more attention gets more attention.\nSo, if you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it's very hard to catch up.\nI mean you there there's this I mean you know take you know coding for example you know I mean just Cursor and pull the head it is better but there was 20 people trying to do it you get that early lead and it builds on itself right and then the other people are just left in the dust and it doesn't matter that they're nearly as good because the sad truth is no one wants nearly as good right so it's a very steep fall away from the small number of things that everyone wants to a much wider number of things that might just be okay, but they're not amazing.\nAnd that's a very hard time, frankly, it's a very hard time as an investor.\nIf you're not in one of the amazings, you kind of have your sad face on.\nYou're working hard, you're doing your job, but some nothing's exploding, right?\nAnd that's when you got to keep your head, keep the companies moving forward, converging on, you know, acceptable growth, acceptable profitability.\nBut it's it's it's a weird time if you're cuz you're reading about all this amazing stuff and then you're going back to your day-to-day job which most of the time is a grind.\nIs it really a sad face though?\nCuz before I've said it's the end of triple triple double double and you I remember said to me, \"Oh, I'd take triple triple double double all day long.\"\nBut triple triple double double bluntly is boring today.\nThat's not zero to 100 million in a year.\nThat's not lovable.\nBolt replet macor any of them.\nBut you know what it is?\nIt was funny this weekend.\nI was I was talking with an entrepreneur that was on the triple triple double double path in a in a space I know well part of GTM that I know well and nothing to criticize right and frankly with the little date I had the deal size was right the the the constru like if this was even early 2023 I would have done this deal probably right but today it's just there's so much competition the differentiation's less clear founder but is generational I hate this term I mean I put hat in quotes Harry use it a It's a fair criticism, but are they really a generational founder?\nRight.\nIt's just I would\nWhat was What was the criticism?\nI just I just passed I hate this term.\nI just I I said to the founder there's I got nothing to criticize.\nYou have the numbers.\nYou have a great approach.\nYou have it's interesting.\nIt's just I just in 2025 my brain I just this isn't I only have so many shots on goal.\nI don't want to take this shot today.\nRight.\nAnd it that's I think it ties to the Carter data.\nRight.\nPeople want to swing more for the fences.\nEither it's there like it's left to the it's off to the races, right?\nOr they got to believe it and it's just it's just people have just got to swing harder.\nNothing negative to say about this triple triple double double dude.\nNothing nothing.\nRory.\nYeah.\nNo, I I agree.\nI mean, I think\nYeah.\nNobody stays down on the farm when you can go when you can play in the gold rush.\nI mean, that the the attraction of that kind of upside, the truth is it draws everyone's head.\nIf there's two games, maybe put it this way.\nIf there's two games and one of them has that embedded 10% chance of amazing, like 20 billion, a Cursor outcome, and one of them just doesn't.\nIt's actually a very interesting math question to say how much less\nhow much cheaper does that other noncursor embedded upside deal have to be to cover for the fact that it doesn't have that kind of outsized tail outcome on it.\nAnd I fear the answer is either it has to be a lot cheaper or even worse there's no price at which you'll do it.\nBut like the triple triple double double less AIcentric are not realizing that they will have a discounted price because they are not this new wave of company and it's hard and I'm sorry for them but it's just the truth.\nAgreed.\nAnd I think that\nthere's a price at which you can make your target return.\nI actually look I remember looking at a deal that was strong founder, good economics, good growth, midsize market, no amazing.\nThere's a price at which you'd say that has you know you want your base case return to work there, right?\nBut it's such it's it's quite a big disconnect.\nIt's interesting though, Roy, if me and you were partners at Scale, and I hope I'm not overstepping here, but I would be like 1,000% let's stick with triple triple double double because we have a much higher certainty of winning there versus going for the AI halo moonshots competing against Thrive\n\n\nand Founders.\nAnd Andre, where the scale enterprise brand doesn't carry the same weight that their glossy brands do, and you have tiny chance of winning versus massive chance of winning in the triple triple double double, where most people have left.\nProvide, but you're assuming they, I mean, and I will absolutely look at deals where you have that profile, but it has to have that profile, that valuation, it has to have that upside and that and that kind of pricing such that you can pencil out the return, right?\nAnd you know, it, it's there.\nAnd more than anything, I would say, actually, and this is, I've been thinking, processing on this, one of the problems with the private for longer dynamic is you can do those deals at when they're already at scale.\nIf they're at 50 or 60 million and they're on that trajectory, right?\nThe problem is when you go super early and you're predicated on follow-on rounds, some of your destiny is outside your control, and if people aren't willing to fund it, right?\nYet you're taking that risk there.\nSo you either have to have, you have to have existing small scale, or you have to have sufficient traction that does, you know, or you have to have confidence on profitability, right?\n'Cause it's not just enough that you have to like it.\nEnough people have to like it along the way to be able to raise the money and get there.\nI'm more intimidated by the deceleration at scale of folks I did not expect to decelerate.\nSo I want to know earlier that you are clearly differentiated in a way that can win, right?\nWhich we gave up on in 2020, 2021, 2022.\nWe didn't, we didn't care what the difference was between a lot of B2B players.\nI'll do the triple triple double double, but it's got to be durable for real.\nYou got to dominate some segment of your market for real for a real reason that is enduring.\nEveryone who's been in the business five or seven years did a whole bunch of deals that were growing like crazy, man, in 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\nThey've all decelerated at scale, and they now have a bunch of deals at 100 to $200 million with 10 to 20 to 30% growth rate, and most of their waking hours is spent figuring out what the freak should they do with those deals.\nIt's human nature that the one thing you don't say to yourself is, \"This is so much fun.\nLet me add to that collection.\"\nThe other comment I'll make is this.\nThe industry as a whole is probably making the same mistake with AI deals that it made in 2021 with a range of other SaaS fields, which is the extrapolation of the current growth rate to the sky, and you have to have some theory of the case and how it all shapes out.\nNow, you know, across the lovables, across the, and that's why, you know, I deliberately mentioned data center spend slowing down, you at least have to contemplate that and say to yourself in the 20% chance where that happens, is the, yeah, you, am I done?\nThe scar tissue from those 2021 deals may be a small part of this car to slow down.\nSpeaking of riding momentum, we saw Vanguard adding PE exposure to, to a Jason point here is this the top.\nI think it's a terrible.\nFine.\nTerrible.\nI mean, it always, look, we discussed this before.\nThe industry keeps looking for new sources of capital, in part because some of their standard sources of capital have issues to deal with, most obviously endowments.\nSo, that's probably not as true for PE.\nThey're just bigger.\nBut pension funds.\nSo yeah, people continue looking for stuff on, uh, you know, it's high fee bearing, which, you know, breaks your heart as a, you know, Vanguard, uh, ETF and mutual fund investor, but.\nSo what does it actually mean for venture, for me sitting in my venture seat, Vanguard adding PE exposure, how much more money is going to come into the industry?\nA bunch of the, all the PE shops have been doing some version of this.\nWe talked about CoreWeave doing it in that crossover, all the, you know, the, the, um, the Blackstones and all those guys have been doing.\nThis is a category.\nThis is a trend that's going to happen.\nYou know, I don't, I don't think it's going to be the same wall of money as, you know, sovereigns or pension funds.\nIt's just another source of capital, another pick a number, 20% more.\nWhat the heck?\nAnd you know, I think structuring it for venture will be harder because, you know, you have to make all these kind of partial liquidity assumptions, which will get tricky for venture, right?\nI don't know if you saw it, but the, I can never pronounce the name, Elsie Stephan, who continues her, you know, crusade to make Harvard's life misery, is indirectly going to make PE's life a misery, 'cause she's been saying, \"Hey, Harvard, your accounting is incorrect because half your, um, assets, assets are PE and other private assets, and they're not marked correctly.\"\nSo that's kind of process is ongoing.\nSo, the whole process of private marks is challenging, and the less sophisticated the investor are, the less able that investor is to take the long view, the more challenging it becomes, and my guess is the retail investor is least in a position to do that.\nSo listen, here's a bad sign.\nThey're partnering with Blackstone on this, right?\nAnd they want to offer PE access into target date funds.\nI mean, listen, we can talk about the pros and cons of target date funds.\nThey, they have their place in a non-taxable account.\nWhat's a target date fund?\nTarget is, is Harry, you don't even need to know anything about investing.\nWhen do you want to retire, Harry?\nI mean, I know, I know you're started.\nWhat, what year would you like to retire?\n80 years old.\nSo, 74.\nWell, we have a 2075 fund for you, and it will start off today at 95% equity, 5% bonds, and each year it evolves.\nAnd so, and when you're, when you hit 78, you'll be, I mean, Rory, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but you'll be 95% bonds and liquid and 5% equity, right?\nClearly seen that you're not spending any time thinking about retirement, Harry, which is entirely sensible at your age.\nBut yes, Jason's exactly right.\nThese are these structured products for the mainstream market.\nIf it wasn't for the fees, they're a broadly good idea, which is you don't know, Mr. or Mrs. whatever, how to think about equity versus things.\nSo, we'll just make one big decision and we'll land the plane for you.\nThe returns sometimes, part of the issue is the fees are high relative to what you get.\nBut it totally makes sense.\nBut Jason, to your point, you're putting these in there, and you know, one thing we know about venture is you can't target your return date, right?\nIf you could, it would be easier.\nIt's a hard asset to fit into a liquid individual portfolio.\nAnd I think they'll try.\nI think it'll be hard.\nTo Terry's point, if Vanguard has 10 trillion, putting 10% of that into venture would move the needle.\nBut I, I just don't think ordinary investors should be doing this stuff.\nI don't know.\nThere's just this just, uh, I just, I, I, it's just, it's just part of greed.\nToo much greed.\nI mean, it's chasing return, and that's always the nature of it.\nSo, but yeah, the hunt for alpha continues.\nThe hunt for alpha always continues because, you know, that's what we're all paid to do.\nI think we should, the three of us should create a target date fund that actually does better than average.\nA target date fund is a hunt for folks that don't even know how to spell alpha.\nThey don't care.\nThey don't, they don't know.\nThey don't want to even learn what, what a stock or a bond is like this, and you're gonna put private equity in it.\nBut, but we can maybe make a better version of this product.\nYou, you mentioned Harvard there and life being hard for them.\nThere was the billion dollar funding gap, and Stanford are doing layoffs.\nIt wasn't huge layoffs, but layoffs still the same.\nHow do we feel about the health of where they're at?\nHow concerned one should be for them and how we should think about it?\nThere's three levels of question here.\nIf you're asking the impact on venture investing as a venture as a source of capital, that's an easy question to answer.\nThey're obviously going to be a lot less active, you know, next level D.\nAre you asking, you know, the impact on the institution, the kind of the wider societal things, but it looks tough.\nI mean, you know, you know, it's, it's a terribly unfortunate way of making policy, 'cause a whole bunch of humanities kids yelled in the in the close about political issues.\nYou're firing the poor guy who's been in his lab for 10 years trying to cure cancer.\nIt's a very awkward way to make public policy and punish the wrong people to punish the institution.\nBut, you know, I don't envy anyone running one of those institutions.\nAnd I hope they can figure it out, 'cause they're a lot of what they do is really good.\nNot all and not some of the most visible things.\nIt's quite annoying.\nBut when you look at the things that have been cut as distinct from the things where you kind of go, \"Oh, that's a waste of money.\"\nThe administrators ain't getting whacked at scale.\nThese programs are getting whacked that are cutting science, that are cutting small grants to graduate students to do amazing freaking things just when they're most productive and useful.\nSo, I think it kind of sucks as an outcome.\nI just thought it was interesting.\nI mean, not in a good way, but you know, um, Stanford blamed its 140 million budget cuts on federal research funding, right, which is the issue that you're talking about, but they also said a potential increase in endowment taxes.\nThere is a cost to these endowment taxes, right?\nTaxing venture in a sense by taxing endowment.\nIt isn't free.\nIt will lead to decline in investment and a decline in humans.\nWe did get a QSBS break in the new tax bill.\nI do like that.\nWe did.\nAnd I do like that.\nI do like that.\nI, I do want to ask that everyone got a little, the deficits may ruin us as Elon said.\nWe might all have to move to Mars, but I got my piece.\nI got my QSBS to 15 million and I'm excited for it.\nI got my piece.\nI got bribed in the tax deal.\nAnd and what I'd really love to know, and I just don't, is I have this vision of this crazy sausage making machine, and you know, there's a whole bunch of agendas, you know, to pound it to the solar guys, to pound it to the universities, you know, I mean, this is an administration that has its hate list and works down through it pretty methodically, and then somewhere someone crops up in a meeting, I can see it, but despite all this, guys, let's cut a deal for the QPS guys, and whoever that person is.\nKnew that was.\nWhoever that person is, next time he's running through San Francisco, all he has to do is email me and I got him dinner, right?\nWhoever was in the room and said, you know, 'cause you know, you're sitting there and the way it works is they have a target to make in terms of money, and every time they stick it to someone and charge them money, you know, endowments, another 20 bill, getting rid of the EV subsidy, another 20 bill, and then someone had to say, let's go backwards 15 bill to give it to these guys on QPS.\nSo, whoever was had the juice to push that through, maybe it's, you know, Peter Theal and the Bilderberg, you know, whatever conspiracy, I love it.\nI'm in.\nHow much, listen, we can explain it to it for folks, but Rory, I'm curious at your fun stage when you write checks, if you had to spitball or ballpark, how much QPS benefit do you get in the end at the GP and LP level?\nLike, 'cause some of it isn't going to qualify, right?\nSome of it's going to be some, some doesn't.\nIt's not a as big a thing%.\nIf that less than that.\nYeah.\nRight.\nFor folks that don't know, and Harry, you might not even know.\nIn the U, in the US, I mean, my taxes in California are 50%.\nI know all you Brits are complaining about taxes.\nI think Rory and I pay more than you.\nBut we get one weird quirky tax break, which is if you invest in startups or small companies below, it was 50 million in assets.\nNow I think it's 75.\nYou don't pay any federal taxes on the first 10 million in gains.\nNow it's 15.\nAnd every LP to the extent they're individ, extent they're taxable, every LP gets 15 million on their distribution too.\nNo federal taxes.\nAnd California taxes it, which is pretty annoying, but most state, a lot of states don't tax it at all.\nSo you could have no taxes at all on startup gains.\nAnd, um, for whatever goofy reason, it, it got increased 50% in this tax bill.\nSo we all, we all got our little taste.\nThat was mega.\nSo basically you have no cap gains on angel investing if you agree.\nNo on angel investing.\nYeah.\nUp to 10 million, now 15, and and frankly, you can stack it with trusts, like for me, it's probably 40 to 50 million per, because I have five trusts on this, so that means for each exit, I get 50 million has, has no taxes, um, you, it's possible to do it to 500 million, but it's really comp, now 750 million, but it's complicated, but Rory, he has a big condo in Yellowstone just to.\nHe clearly has a big condo in Yellowstone.\nWith, with his trust, yeah, I have five, that's the only tax break if, I mean, Rory makes the point is you'll take the nickels and you might as well pay 50% tax in California because it's the best place.\nBut for me, this is my quiet motivator to do early stage investing.\nAt least I, at least I can avoid, you know, 15 million of taxes per deal.\nOkay, we're going to do a final one, which is Microsoft.\nMicrosoft laid off 9,000.\nI know in the grand scheme of their workforce, it's not huge.\nIt's still 9,000 people replacing general salespeople with solutions engineers.\nI was walking with a Clay founder the other day.\nThey don't have sales people either.\nThey have pretty much the same.\nIs this the future for everyone?\nHow did you see this?\nThis bothers a lot of generalist sales folks.\nBut, um, we could have a longer discussion about thoughts on how much of sales will be replaced with AI.\nMy rough sense is it's 30 to 40% of like one to two call sales reps are going to be replaced by AI.\nIt won't, it won't be the same as with support, but it'll approach it.\nIt'll be relatively small in the enterprise.\nOkay.\nEveryone's like, \"Oh, well, you can't go, you know, you can't go to Pepsi, uh, and AI is not going to show up.\"\nBut you know what's going to happen?\nIt's what Clay.\n\n\nTalked or forward-deployed engineers, or what's Microsoft doing? We're not going to have a guy that doesn't know our product in the age of AI show up to big deals. I would rather have a solution engineer that knows this cold that partners with somebody or is less good in sales. And so I think you better be worried if you're a generalist sales guy that thinks being a relationship guy wins today. It that's Microsoft's point. We don't need relationship people. We need folks that like AI has raised the bar for customer expectations. Here's the important point. It has raised the bar. Microsoft's doing what everybody wants to do: replace folks that don't know my product with folks that do.\n\nWhat's interesting is it wasn't couched as a replace with AI story. It was couched as a replace with better people story, and it's hard to argue with that. I mean, it's always impressive. That's a random comment. It's always impressive to me that these companies with 40% operating margins are still willing to grind another point out of it, you know? It's just so capitalistic. It's just great to see.\n\nJust related to it, I thought this I could tie it back, but I thought it was super interesting. I didn't see many folks talk about it, but Canva is doing an AI discovery week this week. Yeah, where they're all 5,000 folks are released from their normal jobs to learn about AI because a lot of employees were saying they're too busy to learn AI. They're too busy. They're too busy at their daily work at Canva to learn AI. So there's teachings and and the CPO was very clear, Cameron, you've had free chat GPT for a year. You've had free cloud. You've had access. You can pick from a bevy of tools for a year, but you're still uh too busy to learn AI. So here's your week, guys. We're going to have classes, teachings, sit-ins. We're going to have a hackathon, and it sounded great. And this is the enst I hear from folks that have been around Rory for a while in B2B. The enst, and you see it on LinkedIn in person, is I, I, Rory, I need to be reskilled. I'm frustrated. I need to be reskilled. I think no one's going to, I think reskilling doesn't work. And I think Canva basically saying [ __ ] or get off the can, guys. Here's your week.\n\nI'm really sorry, they're twofold. I think one, if you need a discovery week for AI, you have people who aren't curious enough to want to progress in learning their job. And I mean, it's a kind way. It's a kind way to say a lot of things.\n\nI'm I'm really sorry. I'm on the board of a public company, and I got asked the other day, Harry, what do we do with employees who are not embracing it because they are fearful of it and don't want it? I said, you fire them. Yeah. I'm sorry. It's it's super unfortunate. I do not say that happily, but if you don't want to embrace it, you are going to make this ship sink. If you need a week for rediscovery week, I promise you, you're not going to work, and you're going to go and take the kids to the playground and go eat chocolate in the cinema. And you know what? You've got to be curious yourself. This is not the way to do it. Well, it might be in that it is, I think a lot of leaders are trying to do gentle, gentle messaging, right, and stage it. And I think this this may this may work for Canva, or it may just be their warmer way of doing it, right? Here's your week. It's not it's not, it's also notice, right? It's notice to those folks too, isn't it?\n\nYeah, I agree. I mean, in many respects, you're both correct. To me, this was the performative. We're letting you all know expectations that way, you know, two months from now to Harry's point, when you know if you're deciding as managers that you some people are surplus to void, you know, we're all humans. You can sit down with them in HR and say, \"Look, you had your opportunity. You didn't take advantage of it.\" You know, we're going in a, as I say, we're moving in a different direction, and here's your package, right? Big picture zoom. It doesn't matter like there's lots of different ways to do it. You can, you know, if you're managing, let's just say we're not talking about the new curse of startups where it's all you people who are AI native, but all these large tech companies who have, you know, 10, 20 years of employees, and, you know, you got to get on the AI journey. One of my big aas is it doesn't matter how you do it. Don't over agonize it. Some people might just fire the people out of the gate. Some people might do a training week. Some people might do a training month.\n\nWe know the direction of travel, right? 2, 3, 4 years from now, you know, you're not going to have people who say, \"I'm too busy to use AI.\" They're going to be long since gone, right? You're going to have people been automated away, and then you're going to have people who be who are using the products and are doing the automation, right? How you do it? Maybe Harry's just meaner than the nice people who on Canva, who seem to have done very well, by the way, by being nice. So, let's not have any complaints about that. But, by the way, yeah, and and Cliff is amazing. He's the co-founder of CEO. He's super nice. Lovely dude. Um, always been great to me. So, that wasn't a [ __ ] on him. It was uh a [ __ ] I wanted to say. How much time do we all get to get with the program? Right.\n\nTotally. Well, one, one thing that one thing that we did here at 20VC is every Friday, everyone has an hour from 4:00 to 5:00 where they get to try new tools every Friday. It's much more nice to do it in a continuous way where it becomes a habit, and it kind of becomes fun that you also do in the office together, and then we do a show and tell from 5 to 6 on what we've learned and what's cool. Really cool way to do it.\n\nAgreed. That's nice. It doesn't matter how as long as you just keep moving forward.\n\nOkay, so we're going to do a couch quickfire. As you know, this is like a speculative marketplace. Um, there's bets. You always want me to say the exact odds, Rory, quite rightly, so I will exactly for you this time. Um, and number one, this one's a good one. I love Shaun, and so I'm going to get in the firing line here. Shaun Maguire tweeted some controversial things recently again about your New York mayor thing. Uh, sorry about that. Um, and everyone's really quite upset about it. The question is, will Shaun Maguire leave Sequoia this year? Yes. $344. $348. No. $115. In other words, highly. And the market is saying highly unlikely not. Exactly. Highly unlikely not that he's not going to leave. Right. Yeah. I'll take the bet then that he will, and I'll take this actual bet with you. Whatever the money is, I'll do the bet for real. I'll a thousand% do that. Am I understanding this? That there's almost no chance he's going to leave based on this bet, right? Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll I'll I can tell you why. I'll take the bet that he leaves this year. I don't know him. I I don't know him, right? I'll take the bet. Do you know I see you know his investments because if you knew his investments, you would never take that back. I know. I know that. And it there's different ways to leave. You could trans. I just don't think Listen, we're in the age one great thing about X is we we we see the grouchy billionaires. We see just how unhappy so many billionaires and midcentmillionaires are. The happy ones go off and leave their venture a multi-billion dollar venture fund and join Meta, right? The unhappy ones just just use this as an endless megaphone, right? And and listen, I get his points and um uh they're just so amplified, right? They're just so amplified. But you could leave as an investing partner, you could become a venture partner, you could transition. I'm giving myself credit for all of this bet, Harry, that it's that the answer's nuance. most favorable to me that I'm not saying he's he like is is like expuned from from the website. I'm just saying if this keeps going week after week after week. I just think it's a sign his head is not into the investing. I I think all his a lot of his returns have come from working with Elon, and Elon loves this [ __ ]. So, he's actually giving he's giving his client what he wants, right? He might get promoted for this, right? Congratulations. You were, you know, you pissed off 2 million people and the owner of X, SpaceX, and Tesla loves you, you in. So, I actually think so. I I mean, on the on the merits, quote unquote, of whether or not what he said or did is going to result in anything, I I don't see it. I'm on the no side. I mean, the only argument for taking the yes, Jason, is is more look, statistically x percentage of people seem to leave every year. So, at some point, the bet's not priced in. That's what I'm saying. I think this is a tell. There's a higher than otherwise chance he leaves this year. That's all I'm I'm not saying anything more clever than that, right? I'm just looking for the tells. And as we've learned, we know a lot of folks in B2B that have quietly retired over the last year or two that it's not clear on Twitter they have. We know folks that have, right?\n\nA state of the economy at the end of 2025. Soft landing 76%. High unemployment 16%. There's no actual like dollars tied to this one for some reason. This is easy, right? Roughly one year and seven the economy is in recession. So you should say if someone asks you is it going to be recession and the default probability is about 16 to 20%. What this is saying is the the economy is no more likely than not like is it a normal probability of being in recession? And I'd say that's about priced right. I don't know what would cause it. Um things in you know in the short term well. So my perspective on that it's a roughly correctly priced bet. You should wake up every day and say with no new information the Bayesian prior is there's a 1 in six one in seven chance that 12 months from now things will go to [ __ ]. And when things when you start seeing the VIX climb that and that's why you saw it when the tariffs come in when the VIX starts to climb that one in seven chance goes to one in four or one in three. And then when things come down, it goes back to normal. What this bet is saying is we think things are quote roughly normal now. And that's probably a fair description.\n\nDo you think end of 2025 are you saying soft landing or high unemployment then? I think it's probably about right. I'm actually indifferent on the bet. I think it's priced right. So I take it or not. It's No. So I wouldn't I would if I I would pass on putting money in that bet because I think it's priced. There's I don't have differential information other than like if it maybe a better way to say it if it had forget forget the bet just tell me which one you think it's going to be wise one. I'm not going to tell you because the whole point actually that's why it's a dumb that's why you're asking a dumb question, Harry. All you can two billion there are no dumb question no dumb questions on Kalshi. There's no evidence anyone can call it actually. I think Kalshi, by the way, this is the real insight here, Kalshi is calling it correctly, and I agree with Kalshi. Kalshi is saying there's that the probability of ris there's no more information about the probability of a recession at the end of next year then it's just a normal year, and I'm with them on that. But how do you I know I know, Harry, you got to wrap it up, but like if it is one in seven, right? But but but you you're the odds have to increase as you haven't been in a recession for multiple years. So how does that pack into the bet?\n\nIt's it's a very interesting question. I'm going to answer that because like what the [ __ ] He gets an interesting question and I get a stupid question. No, no, no, no. What? Okay, you Well, well, you said it, Harry. It's like flipping coins. Like it doesn't This is the opposite of a flipping coin. It doesn't make it higher the heads are here, but this is the opposite. There's an expression recession. Sorry. Boobs don't die of old age. In other words, what you're saying is just because it's been great for six or seven years doesn't mean that it has has to die in the eight. Australia had this run of 17 years without a recession, right? Logically, my mind says it should mean that, and I think unless what really happens is you booms can go on quite a long time unless people do dumb [ __ ]. Now, because we're humans, we invariably do dumb [ __ ], but if that didn't happen, it you know, it it could go on for a while. Yeah, that was a smart question, Jason. Thanks for that one, dude. That was that was smart, dude. You're Oh, you're Oh, there's no chance we have a recession at the end of the year. There's just no chance. So, no chance. The one in six chance. The one in seven chance. It's I'll take that. I'll take that. I'll take that. I'll put a grand in on that bet. He's putting bets down all day long. I'll tell you why I would do actually I would probably do like 50 grand instead of a grand if you want to do it, Rory. Because the technical definition of a recession is pretty tough to meet. True. That's right. So, I'll put 50 grand on this one if you want to do it because I think even if we are, I don't think there's any chance we'll be at a recession in the year, but I think even if we are, it's not going to be called a recession yet.\n\n\nRight. It's already July, so I, I'm, I'm thinking maybe 75 grand. I'm going in on this bet.\n\nNo, I'll pass. Thanks. But that's a good point. You're right. Besides, yeah, even if it's not ripping, we won't know. You know, it, it's always the highlight of my day. I have the most fun on these calls. Like, honestly, I love doing this with you both. Uh, even if it's incredibly humbling being uh informed that after 10 years of asking questions, I still ask [ __ ] questions.\n\nI think you're pretty good.\n\nI wouldn't say\n\nThanks, Jason. I love you, too, dude. I miss you.\n\nOkay, what else? Come on.\n\nOkay, final one. Linda Yakarino, does she leave X this year?\n\nLook, this is a, this is a tough one, right? As an outsider, I don't see any merits in her, right? I, I just not from day one, right? It's hard to see. Um, but no, I just, I just, I just don't see it, right? There's so many public cos and the fact that on a social media platform she's chosen not to be insightful in public, I think is a bad tell, right? Having said that, there's just no way he wants to run this thing, right? Especially the core, the coreex, she's not working on AI and Grock, right? She's managing advertisers and the P&L. So, I think if it's not broken, he's not going to make a change, right? So, this is a, this is a murky one. Um, but I say she, she's, she's here through the end of 2026.\n\nWow. Through the end of 2026. Even higher.\n\nHe just fired his head of Eur. Now he's head of European sales for Tesla, too. I mean, you can't. It sounds fun to fire everybody on the team, and there are moments in time when you need to, but man, you got to keep a few pieces going on the board. It's just even if you're on aderall or whatever he's on, there's only 24 hours in the day. Like I, I think he's going to keep this soldier in place.\n\nYeah. I think the interesting one obviously this week was the market response to the new party and correctly the Tesla response to the new party which was shareholder barf and I was just reading is it Daniel Gross?\n\nI, I, I Harry and the definition of a good kind of forecaster and we've talked about super forecasting I think before in Philip Tetlock is you update your priors with new information. The fact that he went on to form just go down that route.\n\nI think I was still right.\n\nYeah. Would update your priors on the, you know, should, would he still be CEO at the end of next year? You kind of say to yourself increasingly, are you the right person to be running that company?\n\nI don't think he formed a real political party the way the bet was. That's why not to spend too much time. I, I don't think he, he's not going to run candidates in all 50 states. He's not, this is a tactical move that is at, if it happens, is at the edge of what a political party is. So, as much as I love Cal, you got to give me a little credit for definitions here like recession or political party, right? Uh, but uh,\n\nCali was a lawyer, can't you? Jesus.\n\nYeah.\n\nCome on. No, what he's apparently doing is clever than I thought. You're just going to contest a few elections where money matters, right? And that's it. If that's what he does, it's very different. But it's not\n\nI want to put down. I think it's, it's not clever at all.\n\nJason, you've, you've said very clearly, yes, you think she will. Rory, are you quite as blunt as saying she serves no purpose?\n\nI, I, I don't know enough to comment, so I'll pass on that. As I say, I'm more willing to be opinionated on the, the wider CEO issue, but I'm not opinionated on that. I don't have a clue. I, I mean, she has a tough job. If you run a social media platform, how can you not be out there?\n\nIt's just weird, isn't it?\n\nI agree. Is she coming on 20VC anytime soon? Let's get her on. Terry, I want to see you, you and her just be, tell her it's a friendly environment. I want this question answered.\n\nYeah. I'm going to final, final, final one. It's not a b and stupid quick thoughts. Does CoreWeave and Circle sustain the super high stock prices? Does the memeification of their stock deflate?\n\nIn the Yeah, I mean if it is a meme, yeah, then it does of course deflate. Uh, the real question is did the investors at the time of the IPO significantly underpriced the asset and have now people realized that in fact the correct price is the much higher one. That's you know, I, I can't speak to that. I mean, I, you know, when we looked at the circle numbers at the price they're trading at, it felt very lofty relative and traditionally most of these com, most of these post IPO or pre-lockup stocks drift down significantly if the valuations are way above any kind of near-end fundamentals. So you've got to believe the downward pressure is there.\n\nRight boys, time to wrap. This has been so much fun. Um, I love doing this and uh, again, Rory, thank you for coaching me on questions. I'm getting better. One day, one day rude.\n\nI know. I'm going to pause. It wasn't that your question. I actually thought Jason's is a really interesting one. Seriously, it's the do recessions, does the probability of recession increase every year that goes by without one? Cuz it's, it's, it's the classic in statistics. Are they independent on correlated events or is there some kind of buildup? And there's no reason that there should be a buildup. But in fact there is cuz humans, the reason there is a buildup. The reason is Jason is more right than me actually upon reflection is because when times are good people pile up the dumb aggressive [ __ ] to make money and the minute something goes wrong it blows up in their face. So at the margin I would actually revise my opinion and say Jason is what the longer it goes on the more likely it is eventually to blow because of actually ties to your core we've comment stocks get high things get expensive people take on debt they do aggressive things and then it's the you know you wake up one day the Charlie Kindleberger thing manas panics and crashes and you're done and just to w Harry to one thing I will say I don't know in all seriousness I don't know anyone in in tech media that can cross as many domains as successfully as you can. So, a lot of a lot of respect to the, I mean you can get really good at a narrow thing, right? But I don't, I mean your ability especially over the last two years to jump every, I mean the type of guest, the, the, the domains, right? Uh, I, I, I can't think of anyone else that can go that deep and thoughtful. So kudos, kudos to you for that one. It's uh, you know, it's, it's, it's easy to go deep on one or just be a student, but pretty much S tier.\n\nWell, I super appreciate that. I leverage wise friends like you both. So I appreciate you both.\n\nStill a pastor.\n",
