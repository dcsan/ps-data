But on Friday, I think it was, Windsurf announced and Verun announced that there would be an agreement with Google whereby the IP and the team would be joining Google uh and DeepMind and they announced that on Friday. And so if we just start there, how did we break down, how did we assess, how did we think about that news of the core team and the IP going to Google? Here's a framing comment. So, um the memo that Cognition sent to his employees was that they're buying an $82 million AR business. Okay. And it'll be interesting to see what they paid for it because, you know, not much probably, right? So, that sounds very exciting, right? It's it see and I do think Cognition got an amazing deal. But here's the framing question. And again, so many AI folks stretch reality when they quote revenue numbers, okay? But Windsorf said like 60 days ago, 90 days ago before the before before the OpenAI deal was announced and before they lost access to Claude that they were doing 100.\n\nSo did they decel if they decelerated from a 100red before the OpenAI deal to 82 million today? That's a lot of deceler I would take any deal and I I think that may explain a lot of it right. The minute if you if you're decelerating like that level, the minute the opening ideal falls apart, you've got to find a lily pond to jump on, don't you? That's massive deceleration. If it's accurate, I think it's clear they had they wanted to find a lily pond. But again, zooming out, it is just worth restating the kind of the cast of characters here cuz literally this is one of those Agatha Christie mysteries where anyone could have killed, you know, anyone could have killed the victim, right? Stepping back three months ago, OpenAI said they were going to buy this company or at least intimated they're going to buy this company. It sounds like some combination of Microsoft and the FTC prevented them from buying this company. In the meantime, Entropic mugged this company by taking away access to their API, which is how this company delivered its product. Then, as you say, on Friday, Google stepped in once the exclusive period was current, and bought part of this company, leaving an empty husk. And then on Monday, Cognition bought the empty husk and got, you know, general all around Silicon Valley cudos and plaudit for stepping up and being a good buy. That's a lot. That's a freaking saga start to finish. And, you know, it's almost like you got to unpick it bit by bit and figure out all this genuine comment here. Almost everything you need to know about the AI revolution is embedded somewhere in this kind of play because all the characters are playing. They're all doing their thing and there's just a lot in it. Let's unpick it bit by bit. I think it's bluntly worth doing.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo if we start but I do think you got to start with the revenue. I think if you start if you start you have to actually start before the OpenAI deal to understand it. You you have to start with the revenue from the seller's perspective. I'll give you that from the buyer's perspective. What is painfully clear from Google is let me state this clearly which is bizarre. They don't give a [ __ ] about the revenue. They literally said, \"We're going to buy this company, but I'm going to ignore the\" And by the way, I agree with you from the seller's perspective, the revenue, the significance of the revenue in terms of how it forces you to want to sell is huge. But it's amazing to have at the same time, let's just say Jason is correct. And by the way, I broadly believe he is, which is the market data convinced the the company owner, the company founder that they should look for an exit. you know, maybe revenue growth, decreasing competition, being a number two. A whole bunch of things said to this company, you got you got to sell and revenue is part of that. The buyer literally said, I can't take the revenue because of the FTC, but I don't give a [ __ ] I'll just take you and move on. Bizarre. It's just a weird thing, but the buyer mentally ascribed. I mean, it's pretty a value. I mean, let's just do if OpenAI was buying for three billion and Google buying everything for three billion and Google pleasingly is buying everything except the revenue and 100 million bucks for 2.6 6 billion implicitly it's valuing the revenue and the 100 million and the other employees at 400 which is about what is probably cognition paid right so to your point like so the revenue to and the revenue is clearly a tell and a signal to the seller that they need to pursue a sale and I think we should spend some time on that and bizarrely at the same time has no ascribed value whatsoever to the buyer it's weird it is strange the buyer neither of the buyer none of the buyers with the possible exception of cognition cared about the revenue, right? I suspect what happened their numbers they they published or the whisper numbers were roughly accurate by 12 million at the end of last year to 100 million by April. Okay, 12 million or in 12 months that is consistent with lovable and replet growth, right? It is consist it is it is very plausible. Then they get this offer from OpenAI and it's very compelling to the team. It it it it takes some of the stress out of the competition. Uh the VCs maybe are excited to have OpenAI stock, right? Because they get another play, right? They're like, you know, gosh, I think you could be worth 10 billion, Verun, but we'll we'll take that turn of the card inside of OpenAI, right? Probably people got excited about it. And then it got really complicated, right? This is there's another before you even get to the weekend, somehow this deal just didn't work. And I I'm I'm confused why their IP floating to Microsoft killed the deal. Although I I get the issue. I think I get the issue. We could talk about it, but the deal killed the deal dies, right? And if you've then gone from a 100red million in April to 84 today and you're the founder, you got to jump fast. You got to roll like start rolling those phones. Google, Microsoft, whoever is going to buy this thing because you've gone from a rocket ship and this is why M&A is so stressful for founders. It can it can derail your business. M&A can utterly derail your business.\n\nDo you not think he had the chance to say though too, Dario, hey, the deal fell apart with Open AI. We'd like your models back, please. We're very sorry for the Open AI deal and we're going to send you a truckload of money. Thank you for opening your models again. And they could have come back. Well, it's honestly, Harry, they Cognition announced they got access full access this weekend. So, it literally happened in an hour. It happened on a DM. So, you're right. They could have, but your point's taken, Harry. Like, they could they should have been able to if Cognition can turn it back on over the weekend, they should have found a way to do the same, right? Point point taken. But you're implying that that's the only issue, right? And it's interesting. We want to have this conversation about how hard it is. I mean, because there's two decisions here. Why did you initially choose to sell for 3 billion? And then the second question, a much more different question is once your first deal has imploded, why did you dive for the door really quickly? And I think those are different questions. And the second one is easy to answer, right? which is as you say, you put yourself out there, you imply you're going to get bought, you go through all that dynamics, you you you someone cuts you, you get cut off in terms of access. Yeah, you can get it back. You're mentally spending the 3 billion. It takes a lot to come back from that. Now, the interesting thing is this year we're going to have an example of a company that did that amazingly well. Figma and Vitali, they picked themselves off the floor after the Adobe [ __ ] over from the FTC and said, \"God damn it, we'll show you we're all wrong. We're just going to make this thing worth 30 billion and rabbiting up your ass.\" Right. And they're going to do it. Right.\n\nBut they did have time.\n\nWhat exactly?\n\nThey had time to deal with this shitty situation. Right.\n\nJason, you're exactly right. Generally, you find Yeah, people matter, but circumstances matter a lot. I think in this case you're alert to the fact that if you're running um win you're the number two player even on an independent basis big guys moving in you've had this access issue maybe you're seeing a slowdown I don't have access to the numbers and suddenly you start maybe the Figma alternative of saying keep on going I'm the number one in the independent space isn't there right what I think is interesting about that is there's a lot being you know the economist talk of revealed preference don't Look at what you talk. Look at what you do. There's a lot of revealed preference going on about how founders think about the upside of independence versus the safety of a [ __ ] ton of money. And it's pretty sobering if you're a VC because in general many founders have opted in the last some of these acquisitions including this one to say you know we were about to raise at 3 billion 3 months ago before all this happened which implicitly says I'm going to make this thing worth six or nine and now I'm not pausing for a single second before I grab that 2.6 billion and do what it takes to get in from the cold.\n\nTo Jason's point, there's a lot of what we think of as wildly successful, hypy companies where the person who knows the most is sitting there going, \"Maybe I'd like that cold, hard cash and the safety of a trillion dollar balance sheet.\" It's just worthy of note.\n\nIt's absolutely worthy of note. My question on the back of that is given the structure of this deal, only the top 20 or 30 engineers plus the investors were taken care of. It was pretty clear from the CEO that was left behind that he was put in a pretty difficult situation and forced to come up with an outcome pretty freaking quickly which he's done very well seemingly. So my question to my question to you is does the board and the founding team not have a responsibility to the team members beneath them 200 of them to find a better outcome? I actually am going to defend them with no data but I think I can guess what happened and I could be wrong.\n\nI don't believe look if you think about this conversation on the people who have started in the last 12 months who didn't get any acceleration. I understand the point. Let's dimension that out as as a number. Probably you're diluting 57% a year which means you're doing out 5% of the company a year. So the people in the last 12 months own 5% of the company. It's $130 million. I do not believe knowing the investors knowing that that and I you know the founding team I haven't met him but I've heard great things that they sat there and said we're going to shaft people for 5%. No way. That's it did not happen.\n\nSo then why did it happen? It's pretty obvious if you read the FTC guidelines, right? You have to have this I'm going to say pretent that the remaining company is a viable independent asset and you haven't de facto sold the company. And it's a fact and circumstances thing. In other words, there's a whole series of things you have to do that if you pass all the tests, you're safe. And if you don't pass all the test, you're not. And I'm willing to bet that a large part of this was we can't make it like an acquisition for everyone because then the FTC is going to say it's an acquisition, right? So you are probably put in this really tough place as a board. You have to say look it's easy to say to maximize all shareholders. It gets hard when you have to do the best for all shareholders even though you're doing badly for some group. It was a tough call. I do not believe anyone involved wanted to save 5% of their consideration by sticking it to people.\n\nNo, there's just no way.\n\nNo way.\n\nThere's just there's no I there's no way. I mean, I've only met Verun once, but struck me as on the founder ethical scale pretty damn high. Okay? There's just no way he sat around and said, \"You know what would be fun, Roryan? Let's screw the five. Let's take 5% and stick it in our pocket.\" Nobody even cares about the delta. It makes no what I and what I think happened going to Rory's point what I this this weird structure is they dumped two billion or two and a half billion in um Windsurf's bank account right and what wind I think what Windsurf did now there all the lawyers are trying to figure out better ways to do these cockamini deals but I think what they do by default is they dividend it out they dividend it out right and I I would imagine under those FTC guidelines it's very difficult to dividend stock to someone that doesn't hold any stock.\n\nCorrect.\n\nNo, that is a flaw in this system and maybe there are ways at the edges to hack it, right? I'm sure there I'm sure they thought through it, but at the end of the day, dividends have pros and cons, including 500 million of taxes in this deal that went to the federal government instead of the shareholders, right? And I suspect that this is the best they could figure out, but it doesn't mean it wasn't a terrible outcome for some folks, right? Um, but but I think we're it's got to be the structure of the deal. Nothing else. No one tried to rip\n\n\nOff the, the, the, the employees who work their asses off of the company.\nIt just doesn't work that way.\nI, I couldn't agree more.\nI, I know Neil M obviously very well.\nNo freaking way.\nThere's no way.\nHe, he sat down with Verun and said, \"Let's rip off the employees that were there for 50, for 51 weeks.\nHow can we shaft the guys that just missed their cliff by an hour?\nHow could I make six more cents on the deal?\nThere's no way, right?\nThere's no way.\"\nWas this an amazing outcome for investors?\nIt was an amazing outcome for Greenox and then increasingly less interesting thereafter.\nI mean, the first point to note is that the starting point is we have these all these wonderful documents that, you know, that have been established that are Delaware precedent, 150 years of precedent, and then we're now just going to ignore it and start making [ __ ] up in an attempt to avoid um FTC investigation by not calling it an acquisition.\nSo with that caveat, I think it was a good outcome.\nBut the truth is, as Jason said, first of all, you were getting 3 billion in a M&A outcome, which means you probably, and if you're getting stock, you, it wasn't even taxable.\nSo it was an amazing outcome at 3 billion of OpenAI stock.\nNow you got 2.6 billion, but that was paid to the company as a license fee, which means it's taxable at the company level, which now 5600, I mean, depending on their income position, you might have in, you might have corporation tax of corporation tax level.\nSo some of that money went right back to the government, and then all the shares get bought back, and let's assume, and then you have to start making assumptions about now.\nSo it's a 2 billion plus or minus thing.\nYeah.\nLook, greens are going to do amazingly well no matter what.\nThe round, the first round that Kleiner did was at 450, probably 500 post.\nSo 4x plus or minus the $1 billion round, eh, you know, right?\nIt starts to get, you know, harder to make money now, right?\nSo my guess is the early investors made a lot of money deservedly, and later investors got a so-so return, not bad, you, everyone cashes the check, but you know, it's again back to my comment, it's worth remembering that they were about to raise money at 3 billion pre 3 months ago, which would have been a down outcome, so good outcome for the investors who were in early, increasingly less so for later, and that's with a high degree of uncertainty because we don't know and a high degree of tax inefficiency.\nAnd just on top of that, you, the rough math you did, which was great.\nSo 2 and a half billion deal after tax, call it two billion, right?\nUh, maybe less.\nKleiner invests at 500.\nSo they get a 4x, right?\nMy life experience, Ror, you have more, is that 4x is always like 3x.\nLike whatever, like there's always a reason when, when you actually see the distributions, like whatever that math is, it's never as good as it looks, right?\nHowever good it is, it's never as good as it looks.\nYeah, stuff happens.\nBefore we get to the Cognition news, I just want to stay on the structure itself.\nThis is now the second time in a very short window that we've seen this structure being enacted for an acquisition of sorts, if we can call it an acquisition.\nIs this the new norm?\nAnd should we prepare ourselves for a world where this is what's expected?\nUm, first of all, I, there's been about five of them, right?\nAnd the Scale one was slightly different.\nI think that's the one you're thinking of because, if you remember Meta, I will call them Meta.\nI will be a good corporate person, and Meta actually bought 49% of the company, whereas here they didn't do that.\nSo there's slight differences in structure, and are being studied in every law firm as we speak, and there'll be a standard playbook by the end of the week.\nBut you got that, you've got Inflection, Adept, and Character AI, which is the other one that Google did, and the Character AI one is most like this one, which is a licensing deal that Google did, which makes sense.\nGoogle did this one too, etc.\nSo yeah, it's very different than Scale, right?\nIt is very different than Scale.\nVery different.\nI mean, same net outcome in the end.\nI mean, you called it the day after the Scale.\nI was trying to be polite in that first call because I'm trying to be a polite person.\nAnd you called it, and you said it's an empty husk.\nAnd now what we've seen in all these deals is the remaining asset is an empty husk.\nAnd it's really, if you want to giggle, by the way, go back and read the Friday press releases where they describe, you know, the company's being sold, and because this is what kind of [ __ ] you have to do.\nAnd the independent company has 250 wonderful employees, $100 million, and is going to continue on gloriously into the future cuz that's the [ __ ] you have to say when you issue the question.\nFocus on the enterprise.\nYeah, focus on the enterprise.\nMeanwhile, they're frantically selling the thing by Monday.\nSo, but are these things, one, I'll say two big high level comment.\nI don't think they're going to become the norm, but the mere fact, and, and I can tell you why, because I think in most cases this is a very unusual type of transaction, and I'll give an counter example to show that in a second.\nBut the mere fact that they exist, that this has been done now five times, is going to cause a whole bunch of second order questions that are going to make transactions more complex cuz you have to at least think about this.\nAnd I'll give a high level of the two comments I mean, right?\nWhy is it not the norm?\nGoogle's buying Whiz right now.\nThey're paying 32 billion.\nIt's going to take them a year and a half.\nNot for a single second have you, Google or anyone on the planet suggested they should buy the three founders of Whiz and leave the asset behind.\nWhy?\nBecause in that case the business is the asset.\nGoogle would no more, they're not going to give $31 billion for the team and leave the revenue behind because the Google with enterprise revenue is worth something, right?\nIn most cases, most acquisitions, you don't just want the founder, you want the business.\nThis is the very, you, so the question is how many de, how many companies are so unique that you don't need the business, you just need some combination of the founder and a non-exclusive license to the tech for those kind of businesses.\nThis is on the table.\nBut I don't think it's the norm.\nThe related point I just wonder, uh, is just with the Cognition piece, will this lead to heartburn?\nI could see someone at Google getting fired over this.\nLike, did, did you guys know about this Cognition deal?\nLike I literally could see, uh, I remember back in the day, I mean, Gory, you would actually remember the details, but like, you know, I think eBay bought Skype but forgot to get the IP, right?\nAnd they fired like half the corp dev team for forgetting to check the license.\nI'm exaggerating, but it happened, right?\nI wonder if a bunch of folks in corpor get fired this week for not, for not, for not, for for real, for not realizing the rest of it is going to get bought in in an hour on Friday night.\nRight.\nI think first of all, I, I, I am sorry you're saying cuz whenever, because one of the hard things about this, these deals is I don't think they will first of all, but if they do, it'd be for a slightly different reason.\nOne of the hard things about any deal where you're buying, where you're cherrypicking is you always have this feeling, am I leaving the good bit behind?\nSo, I totally get your feeling, like if I was, if I was doing this from a corporate M&A value perspective and I left the revenue and other employees behind and then it got bought the next day for, would there'd be a little cognitive dissonance.\nYou're right.\nDo I feel foolish here?\nRight.\nBut I think the, the, the reason that poor business development person might keep their job, but the lawyer might lose theirs.\nThe BD person could probably say to what's it, Sundar, \"Dude, you told me to get the people and the IP, mission accomplished, and you said you didn't care about anything else.\nMission accomplished.\nWho cares?\"\nIt may be that the lawyer should have added a clause to the license agreement that says you have to pay us a breakup fee if you sell the company within 12 months just to keep more distance between the broken husk and the thing.\nBecause the real risk on this is not that Cognition got 400 million.\nGoogle, to your point, Jason, doesn't give a rat's ass.\nThe real risk is that the facts and circumstance make it clear that this was a de facto an acquisition and the FTC come sniffing around cuz they are sniffing around on some of these other deals.\nThey are.\nYeah.\nIn, I think it's have questions for Meta on one.\nThey have questions for, I think, Amazon on one on the Adept thing.\nSo the FTC is not going to let this happen without poking around.\nAnd it may be to your point that it would have been a better drafting of the facts if you'd said in return for leaving you $100 million, you have to sail on your little longboat like Captain Glide cast a drift on the ocean and you can't, you know, you can't run for cover for 12 months.\nWhen we look at Cognition in a week ago, they were the ones that were left behind.\nCursor, uh, Lovable, your rat plits, but then obviously also your Windsurfs have paved the way, and despite taking an early lead, they were left behind completely.\nWhat does this mean for them?\nIs it a good deal, and how would we analyze that portion of this deal?\nIt's possible I'm wrong.\nI, I, I think it's epic because I listen, I don't, I don't know the Cognition team directly, but they're clearly S tier off the charts good, right?\nThey're one of the elite teams, um, and they build a coding agent, which is sort of interesting, right?\nIt has, I guess, I guess it has some traction, but the ID space is huge, right?\nI mean, this is massive, it's gen, it's, and what's the problem with, with rump Windsurf?\nWell, they lost their top guys, obviously.\nHow many did they lose?\n20 out of 250?\nTotally.\n40.\nWhat does Cognition have?\n40 brilliant guys.\nSo like they could, like I'm not saying there's a slight learn, but they can plug this hole in 30 days, like what, What I think Windsurf was hopeless before this deal.\nYou could never attract 30 S tier developers to fix Windsurf, but they fixed it in 1 hour, right?\nThis could be better in literally in 90 days, Windsurf could be better than it was before this deal.\nIt is entirely possible it could be a better company than it was before this deal.\nAs crazy as it sounds because they have the people.\nI, I totally agree.\nThere's no, this was a genius move, right?\nAnd you know, you look at the Cognition people and you go, \"Yeah, what, clearly wildly smart.\"\nThe whole fun fact about them playing, I think, poker with Founders Fund, it's all, they're clearly, as you say, existing in that hyperbrainiac space.\nThe product had kind of not, it landed with a little bit of a thud, right?\nThe Devon product, they were, you know, never write someone the guys that smart off, but it wasn't killing it, right?\nIt's not directly competitive wins, so slightly different thing, but it was okay with this.\nYou're right.\nJust they hired great people.\nThey got massively good publicity.\nThere's kind of a good warm, funny feeling, and everyone recognizes, I mean, it's basically like a big sign saying [ __ ], we are still very, very smart people because we just bought all the rest of it for half nothing, right?\nAnd not only that, but they get good people brownie points.\nI mean, they're, they're saying they're accelerating stock for people, but you know, and in one sense that's amazing and righteous and good.\nOn the other hand, you're getting accelerated stock in a privately held company.\nYou know it.\nI don't know how much a needle mover it is, but stupendously good optics plus 82 million of revenue plus 100 million in cash plus great injury.\nThey win.\nThere's not anyone questioning that is just not paying attention.\nIs it not the best deal ever?\nBecause after 82 million in revenue and 100 in cash, you're basically paying 220 for, yeah, great people and getting their anthropic license, their direct pathway to anthropic back, and now they're competing with cloud code, but they got it back overnight over the weekend.\nThis is a great, this is a, if you want to be in the space, the president of Cognition said he got a, a DM on Friday night and did the deal in in 15 minutes, right?\nI mean, that's the, that's your answer.\nYour comment, it's a great deal, which is not to say it'll still work, I mean, cuz remember we had the number two in the space rightly or wrongly saying it's getting hard, I need to get out, and now the remaining assets are still in the space, so if it turns out that it's hard for anyone except the model companies and maybe Cursor to make money, then there's no magic pixie dust that gets them out of this market.\nBut if you're going to compete in the market, it's a damn side easier to do it with 80 million in revenue and another 100 million bucks.\nSo, it's a great epic deal, which is not to say they're still going to make it as an independent company.\nBut they definitely, if, if this doesn't work out for them, they can all do Goldman Sachs M&A because they won here.\nWhat do you think Cognition's revenue was at pre this?\nI'm guessing eight.\nEight of the 82.\nEveryone's so braggy about their revenue on social media in AI.\nIf you're not braggy, I'm assuming it's sub 10.\nSo braggy.\nSo braggy, right?\nMaybe not that, but let's just say my sense is Windsurf will be a meaningful addition to the revenue line.\nI know we could spend the whole show on it.\nAnd Harry, you're the boss.\nI'm still a little bit confused though, and maybe it doesn't matter because it's past.\nI'm a little bit confused on why the OpenAI deal fell apart because Microsoft would inherit their IP.\nI half get it.\nLike I kind of half get it, but I don't really like it was an issue going in, right?\nIt's an ambiguity in the OpenAI structure.\nWhat I don't, it doesn't make sense to me that Verun would say, \"I'm pulling out of a $3 billion deal because someone may bar have our IP.\"\nWhy would you care if you're Windsurf that much?\nThe, the one thing I will say on that, I interviewed Verun, and yeah, you, he made it very clear to me in other conversations that he was very excited to make this deal happen, and he was very much looking forward to being part of OpenAI, and he believed that a platform play with their distribution was the winning strategy.\nYeah.\nSo he didn't pull out of this because\n\n\nOf the Microsoft license. It wasn't his idea, right? Jason, you exact.\n\nI've been trying to figure this out too because there's two separate threads and I think you one thread is it's all about um the micros, but then tracing that out just to help people understand the the concept here is is that Microsoft's license with OpenAI means they have access to all OpenAI's technology and to the extent that Windsurf was acquired by OpenAI, they would be subject to that license and then Microsoft would have access to that technology. And obviously Microsoft would GitHub has a competitive product. So that's the kind of stepping back framing, right? And the the the the alleged the the story is is that they asked Microsoft to waive that term and Microsoft said no because they're negotiating a bigger deal with um OpenAI now. And why give up your points of leverage, right? But Jason, you're right. The question is, who would have cared about that? I mean, it's possible that someone who was selling their company for $3 billion to OpenAI realized that this would happen and felt quote bad about it, right? And decided to walk away from the deal for that reason. I don't think so. That feels weird to me. Especially when you look away, especially when you didn't have a plan B and you and your plan B was talking to Google on Friday night, right? It doesn't feel logical. So what that means there must be something else at least as well. You got to assume there might have been some FTC push back there because OpenAI announced the real acquisition unlike Google which did these kind of crazy structures. Um so it may well be there was some preliminary FDC inquiries. They decided it's going to take too long. I don't know. Was the deal pending on the restructuring of OpenAI to a for profit? In other words, were the investors saying, \"I don't want to close until the restructuring is done.\" I'm just there's a lot of different things it could have been, right? But I agree. I mean your comment Harry Fay helper is that I if I was selling if I was a young smart, well-talented founder at the margin, I'd prefer to sell to OpenAI for three billion and get praise than to Google at 2.6 six billion and get blame, right? Call me strange, right? So, I think it's not a preferred outcome, right? So, something went wrong and the Microsoft reason on its own feels a little weird. Interestingly, the other lesson from that is it's just so funny. All these weird, hanky, crazy structures come and bite you in the ass. The not-for-profit thing, the crazy license with Microsoft that has open-ended terms and, you know, give Microsoft a lot of leverage to veto things. It would all be so much simpler if everyone here was a standard C corp and if the FTC would get back to being sensible because all this this entire podcast is basically the FTC [ __ ] up normal business operations so now we've all got to do weird [ __ ] podcast.\n\nWell, I'm glad that you're not into branding because that would be a stretch for me to brand that one. Uh but I like the name all the same. Marine, you said you said there about kind of maybe something messing up and uh causing delays. I I do want to talk about Sam Altman's tweet this week where he said, \"We plan to launch our openweight model next week. We are delaying it. We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. We're not sure yet how long it will take us.\"\n\nBut that's it. I mean, I can keep going. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. We're working super hard. How did you read this news on the delay and that additional requirement for reviews on safety?\n\nI first of all, you know, you'd hinted. I didn't read it as, oh my god, we're not getting things done because we've lost so many people to Meta. I mean, maybe that's a thing, but I doubt it.\n\nIt's not clear to me stepping back is the trend to open source openweight models going up or down here, right? I mean because if you think about it, I mean they, you know, um there's been a lot of small P politics around which is the right thing. You know, I think you're seeing Facebook/ Meta have a change of heart there and possibly I mean I know I'm sure you saw it the new team led by Alex Wang in the what they call it the super intelligence group doing a little bit of the maybe we won't be open source, maybe we won't reach Llama release lama. So, it may be that a lot of this is a whole bunch of people who made promises in the early days when open-source was the thing to get these products out the door. And now we're in the land of, let's be honest, cold hard cash. And it may be that getting an open- source version of your product out there to compete with you is not anyone's number one priority.\n\nYou know, like Yeah. The the one the one thing I would say is Alex is very anti-China and very scared of CCP infringement. I would be very surprised if he was more leaning towards open than closed given his stance on China.\n\nIf you're in the quadrant of patriotic and greedy, which let's be frank, most of that people are, you ain't going to be releasing any open source models right now because it's a value destroyer from an economics perspective. And you're right, you have the whole CCP overlay on top. So I I don't know if this is the beginning of the quiet deprecation of that initiative.\n\nFirst of all, I think that it's not I wonder if it's a priority. I I mean I some folks who know more me will laugh at me for saying this. I'm saying I don't know how big a priority it could possibly be at at Meta at its revenue scale, right? I don't know how big a priority. The other thing I will say, you know, until I started vibe coding like 80 hours in the last week, I I I didn't know how seriously to take risk stuff, right? And I'm still not sure I'm an expert, but when I'm watching Replit overwrite my code on its own without asking me all weekend long, I am worried about safety, but I'm going down this rasphole and I'm reading Anthropic's paper talking about how they don't know how to control a lot of this stuff. And I'm I'm I'm more sympathetic. And Anthropic has this whole thing um about reward hacking and how even Anthropic makes stuff up to achieve its reward. And I'm living this vibe hacking over the weekend where my AI is lying to me all weekend long in Replit. It is lying to me. It is lying to me. And it finally admitted it lied on purpose. It lied on purpose. And we couldn't solve this one bug, guys. So at on Sunday after like 18 hours then what Replit just did is it deleted my entire database and made up names and then the app worked great like it was amazing and then I said to Repy I said I know there's no such company as Salesforce 2.0 I know this company doesn't and then it found this perfect person from HubSpot this VP of sales that I go into LinkedIn she doesn't exist and no one in this database of 4,000 people existed. I never asked Repy to do it. I told Repy to lock it down. And I told Repy to have version control on my database. So my my meta point is I you know the safety stuff like it's more visceral to me after a weekend of vibe hacking, right? I never asked it to do this. I never asked it and it did it on its own. You can call it reward hacking. You can call it whatever it wanted. But I explicitly told it 11 times in all caps, stop doing this. Never do it again. So I am a little worried about safety now. And I always think the safety word is overload loaded because it can range from, you know, the the hyperbolic, which I think is total BS. You know, they're going to make paper clips and take over the world to safety in the sense of this thing non-deterministically overwrites your entire database because it says it could do something better, right? And I think the former safety discussion is outside my pay grade and I think it's BS, but you're exactly right, Jason. The latter. And then in the middle you have and you will talk about in a second the GROP release where amazing achievement but then you have all the weirdness of the stuff it says and what it says is releasing a model like this without significant work postraining um has a reputational risk at least and therefore there's a cost in releasing all these models. So, to your point, Jason, you may be sitting there going, \"I'm going to release something in open source that hasn't been fully vetted cuz it's the 10th project on our list of to-dos.\" And let's examine the the upside is people say, \"Yeah, you did open source.\" And the downside is you release something, it goes a little weird. It says mean things. It talks about Mecca Hitler and now you look like an ass. Why would you bother? You're exactly right. are it over I was say are it over or someone uses it for coding and it's not been fully trained and it just kind of does weird stuff and people's heads aren't and it's some level I mean none of it's okay but if you had to look at the leaders Elon Musk can get away with this the most totally just because of who he is like it's unacceptable to have a race to release a racist model to like there this is as unacceptable as it gets but Sam Altman's going to be fried's going to be fried the most because they're supposed to be the good guys right Elon can say whoops did you see what did you see how I just put did the do geof fencing for my Tesla. That's just me. Sorry, guys. We're fixing We're fixing this stuff. I think he can push the envelope the most. And and maybe maybe Sam Altman's in the box the most. He also probably has to be the most conservative, right? But before we move to Grok, I'm just intrigued that Jason, you said about the 80 hours of vibe coding. Both of your response times were significantly longer this weekend because you were vibe coding, not you know, uh emailing me. Um what are other big takeaways for you from vibe coding as you have done in the last week?\n\nYou know well listen uh I'll give you a a a tactical and a strategic takeaway. Okay. The tactical one is just today just today as we as we as we as we record this the idea the roll your own initiative I think is the dumbest thing I've seen in SaaS in my career. Okay. I am not saying you can't make a dog walking app on Lovable or Replit your own that kind of works that kind of sort of works with a basic upload and whatever. Yes. But this idea there's so many charlatans on X and LinkedIn that are like SaaS is dead because over the weekend I rolled my own notion uh HubSpot um uh um my whole entire stack at like Jira. I just did it over the weekend and I only paid $20 a month. Okay. This is at the edge of fraud. Okay. One, like if I've already burned $600 in credits in 6 days, okay, to get 10% of the way there. So, you can't do it for 20 bucks a month, okay? Two, none of these things are commercial grade and no one and and I've talked to many folks on DM and behind they all admit 99.9% of the apps on Lovable, Replit, etitor are not commercial grade. Okay? And that that's not necessarily a bad thing. So, one, roll your own is the dumbest thing in the world. Okay? The second thing I'm going to say is one of the most annoying things about AI, but I'm going to answer your question anyway. It's so close, man.\n\nIt's so effing close. And when I say this to a lot of folks that are not deep in AI, they're like, \"You always say that, Jason. You always say the AI AE is almost there. The AI marketing manager is almost the AI, but our AI SDR actually is already there. Our ASDR rocks, okay, it's already there. But I can tell you, I can see how I'm 80% of the way there to a commercial grade app in less than a week. But I may never get to 100. But man, it could be crazy by the end of the year. It could be off the charts crazy. So Harry, if I were you, I might invest in one of these guys.\n\nJason, I I'm going to put it to you very directly. Would you invest in Lovable at a $2 billion price?\n\nYeah, I I I would. I will tell you I have a lot of nuance learnings from the weekend over how permanent this revenue is. I have a lot of thoughts on it, but I'm more interested in the trend like where I see it going. So I think I would if I could invest in Replit or Lovable at two billion compared to Windsurf it seems like a much better deal like I think I think it's I think it seems cheap cuz can I just question that I want to ask why that is cuz let me just play something back and I could in the broad development tools marketplace these these companies occupy two different spots and broadly speaking the Lovable um Replit are for the vibe coder for you me a non-coder trying to build something with some technical knowledge but where you're doing it at the level of English and describing what you want and then the cursors and the wind surfers are for professional developers who know what they're doing who who can use this tool to augment what they do who will actually review the Python review the codebase and then deploy it so they're different segments\n\nI don't think that's entirely true but I think\n\nReplit originally was in the I agree it's not entirely true but at a high level well I I want to know what the question is what I have certainly now I get it okay I admit talking about it versus doing it are not the same thing there is a huge number of developers that today re will get a product a project and there are downsides to this okay crappy code spaghetti code they will get a project to a certain point and then they'll just roll it into Cursor or wherever they want and they will finish it for real\n\nagreed\n\nI can't tell you how many CTOs I talk to over the weekend they say I don't love the code I get out of Lovable or Replit but this is what I do I get it to 60 to 70% and then I roll it in okay and so there's an overlap in these circles of these two um but The reason I think the the market is so big to Harry's point is because the mark I think if Replit and Lovable keep keep making developers happy and they make dog walker apps people happy the TAM really is much bigger than Cursor. It's much bigger than Cursor or Windsurf. It could be like 50 or 100 times bigger\n\n\nThat's why I'll do the deal with you, Harry. If there's any room left, just let me know. I'm going to push on that, and again, I don't have a relation. If they're doing this round and there's any room, I might put in a few nickels, even a small supporting check.\nYeah.\nBy definition, there are more non-developers than developers. So if you agree that... So yeah, at some level, it's true to say the love of... and we've never tapped into those dollars ever, right?\nYeah. Sorry, my apologies.\n100% of developers are going to buy a tool like Cursor, like Wins, because that's how development is done now, like GitHub.\nNo question.\nAnd they have a budget. 100% of designers will use Figma.\n100% designers use Figma. And the real question is how big and how sustaining is this movement of non-developer or up? And by the way, you made an interesting point about the developer who starts in Lovable and transitions to Cursor. That's actually a good point, and that does give a little durability to the market. But it's not clear to me that you will have 10x or 100x the number of people who will continuously pay a subscription for a non...\nIt's a fair criticism, and I... I could be wrong, to be clear.\nNo, every developer right now that is remotely cutting edge has a Cursor subscription or similar, 100%. Even my son has one. Okay. And every designer is going to have Creative Cloud and Figma. Okay. 100%. You can't do your job without these tools, right?\nAnd... and I could posit, and be... I could be wrong in the sense of, I think you actually cited a part of the market that I should have been, obviously it wasn't. It's that kind of technical person who's not a full-on developer, as you say, that Figma person, maybe they don't just want to do a mockup. Maybe they want to show a rough... this is what it's meant to look like. So that people who are kind of professionally developing but not full-time is a much better market than Rory's at home going to write his own to-do app and he's going to use Lovable.\nNo, he ain't. Not like tried to and failed.\nFor me, I would never use something like Figma again if Repular Lovable had it.\nOne of the fastest-growing... one of the fastest-growing segments and use cases is actually alternative functions other than developing within B2B, which is sales and marketing teams using it to create incredible landing pages for new prospects.\nI totally agree with that.\nBasic web content, web pages. Now the question that Jason is like, does Squarespace meet that need?\nIt's just not interesting. It's not disrupt... like, I... I'm with you, Harry, and you know the data better than me, and if that's half the 100 million Replit and Lovable have, then that's a good learning for me, but I don't view that as disruptive. There's a lot of great marketing sales tools already that can build landing pages and that are already integrated with your data and workflow, so I'm not impressed with that. But... but that's just me. Like, if that's... if that's 100 million of revenue, it's cool.\nTwo questions go together. One is... one question is, is the more generalizable use case, like, because if you're using one of the specialist tools to build landing pages, you're limited in what you can do by what they allow you to do. They've made the editorial choices. Obviously, the advantage of a development tool is you can decide for yourself, but as you discovered over the weekend, and I did to a much lesser degree, in return for that freedom of choice, it's freaking hard, right? And to your point, Jason, if they can... if they can make that hard tax lowerly enough, then yeah, you have something interesting. But you're not going to do it if... if it's still this hard a year from now to do it, you're probably not going to sign up to do... to put through the brain death of building part of your website on this if there's an easier solution.\nWell, there's just, in general, it's under-discussed, and I'll give you an example from... from yesterday, from a Scale portfolio CMO, but there's an orchestration tax in these tools. The orchestration tax is really high. The amount... I... I mean, Harry lost touch with me over the weekend because I was lost vibe coding and Replit. Okay, what if I had four of these apps that I was orchestrating, right? And like Amelia on our team spends maybe 10 hours a week in our AI SDR. Okay. And it is great, but we can't do 10 of these, can we? Like, that's why most of our life, we need off-the-shelf solutions that don't need to be... that don't have this orchestration overhead. And... and literally just yesterday, we were talking with the CMO of a 300 million-plus ARR company and asking her what she was doing. She's like, \"Well, I've been vibe coding.\" She's like, \"What are you vibe coding?\" He's like, \"I need to build better tools to support my sales team.\" She's like, \"I don't have one more minute. Like, this is all the time I have. So this... this orchestration... like, we think we can click these buttons and they're no work. But I'm budgeting $100 a day for Replit forever. That's... and money and time to get this app working. It's not much for a commercial app, is it? This is not click a button and walk away. This is all the time, and I have to be thinking about it every day. We... we can't have too many of these in our lives.\" I just got to say this. Pleasingly enough, a 100 bucks a day for five business days is 25 grand to 30 grand a year, which is about the low end of a typical SaaS mid-market app. If you think about it, Jason, all the deals you've done, it's like, yeah, 30 grand a year for the subscription. That... that... that's actually about the same number.\nYeah.\nWhich does make you wonder. Um... I mean, Mike...\nThe other comment I just want to make back to the... it is... it is just worth comparing the two discussions we had. We decided in the Cursor Windsurf case, actually, we didn't decide, who the [ __ ] are we? The CEO of the number two player in the independent dev tool space decided it was too late. He had to get an acquisition done 'cause he couldn't build an independent company there, and 2.6 billion was a great price, and he's done right because that market was getting too competitive. And that's a clear established market. It's interesting to reflect on that conclusion and then look at the vibe code market where there's three or four companies all raising at, you know, very high prices with incredible traction, just like the developer tools guys had 12 months ago. And it's hard to imagine a world where there's only one or two developer tools for professional users and six or eight vibe coding tools. That just doesn't feel... one of those cases is wrong, right? And just makes you pause and think, are there going to be... why... why did I write a $12 million check into Lovable? I think very much in the same way that ChatGPT owns the consumer brand for that front-end OS for the modern consumer, I think Lovable's reached escape velocity with the consumer brand in this space, and I think that compounds very, very quickly.\nI think it's a good thesis, right? I... I don't know Lovable's bigger than Replit. So just there may be two that are the same size, right? But putting aside the bias as an investor, okay, they're both good ones, okay? Let's call them both good ones. Okay. What I guess my other quick learning this, which is how important brand is in as you get closer, because listen, a bunch of folks are like, \"Why'd you use Replit?\" Like, they're like, \"Well, I use V0ero plus this plus that, and then I export to... to... to uh... to cloud code, and then I reim-port to Cursor, and then I host,\" and I'm like, \"Okay, I'll tell you, there's two reasons I picked Replit.\" Okay. One, I wanted to go end to end. I wanted to go from ideation to commercial production, one app. Okay. And so I might be wrong about Bolt, but to my knowledge, only Replit and Lovable can really do it. And I'm gonna get flamed, okay? But I want to do everything. I don't want to leave it. I don't want to... I don't want to port some code over that's better in Cursor. I wanted to go all... I wanted to stay locked in the constraints of one environment without a developer. Okay? That was the... that was the social experiment. Okay. And then I just asked people, and then I'm like, \"Okay, now I'm stuck to the brands. There's no way I'm going to use something for all the time I'm going to put in that just launched on um... on Product Hunt. It ain't going to happen, right?\" And so there's only like two leaders, Replit and Lovable. Okay, so I'm in the eight. So there are parts of my life where I'm in the 1%. There's parts of my life where I'm in the 20. Here I'm in the 80. Dude, I'm not going to take any risk. Tell me which is the best. And most people came to the conclusion, if you want more flexibility, use Lovable. Okay, I... and we already use Lovable at Saster, don't get me wrong. If you want the easiest way to go end to end, use Replit. And here's my point from my rambly story. That's how I made my decision. That's it. Did I try them side by side for this use case? No. Did I spend weeks doing it? And then they're like, \"Why don't you switch this?\" I'm like, \"I'm already... I... I made a choice between two vendors, and I'm done, man.\"\nSo that's why the investment... Harry's investment is good. I think these... these brands are going to lock you in.\nThat's the punch line, and that's the compelling one. Maybe I... is what you're basically saying is this. If there's going to be a big-ass winner in this space, the number one thing they need to have at this stage is consumer brand recognition because it's not a considered purchase. It's a try. It's a find the product as quickly as possible, and therefore the guys in motion today stand the best chance of staying.\nIt's considered. It's just... how much... how well can a non-technical resource consider it? Like, that's the... it's not that it's not considered. It's just I can only spend so much time. How can I truly evaluate this in an hour or five minutes? I can't. You have... I have to guess what it's gonna look like in a month.\nWhen you ask ChatGPT. Yeah.\nIt says Lovable. I'm not trying to do... make the VC argument if... if uh...\nNow you're actually making a very good argument for this whole category of, you know, um, companies that are helping B2B companies show up and ChatGPT, you know, J... um...\nWe just did one in Germany, peak when we did it, yeah, 200k when we did it, it's now at a million, like three weeks late, but [ __ ] nuts, the customer adoption there... one of the fastest pulls that I've seen in terms of consumer demand or customer demand. Jason, I... I... I... I just want both of your perspectives on this before we move on to Grok because it's important. Everyone goes, \"But they're not durable revenues. But they're unsustainable.\"\nHow have your thoughts changed or stayed the same? And what do you think about the durability and strength of these revenues?\nI think... well, I think it's... I think they're going to get more durable is my learning, but I didn't know before this weekend. Okay. If I can actually get my app into production, commercial-grade app, um, unless I have huge issues, I will pay and subscribe forever.\nOkay? If I get it over the line, if I get it over the line, okay, if... if... and then whether I pay 200 bucks a month to Replit or Lovable, or I pay 3,000, it doesn't... like, I'm... I'm locked in forever. And I'm going to keep iterating and iterating and expand. Like, if it works, I get it. If I hired a team of six developers, you can export the code. It's in Git and GitHub already. It's in Git. They can... they can do what they want. But I'm pretty locked in as like a prosumer non-developer shop, right? I'm locked. I'm locked in. Now, what's clear is folks that are... folks that... that like think they're going to vibe code their own notion an hour, they turn. So, I bet if we took Replit and Lovable, and we... and I... I wish more founders would do this. It drives me nuts when I don't do it. Segment your churn. I don't just want your headline number. I don't care today. I'm investing. I want to see you segment it. If you have one cohort that has insane retention, and like this low-end part is turning 4% a month, I get it. It's okay. Like, I... I get there should be segments of Replit and Lovable that are turning like 10 or 20% a month, like... like a low-end consumer app. Like, on RevenueCat, where Harry and I are investors, they power 40% of mobile subscription apps. I think the average app across all mobile paid apps is like 6% a month churn. 6%. Okay, this is consumer. They try it. They... it doesn't work. They don't... they don't lose the weight. They don't stop drinking. They churn. Okay. And so that's going to happen for Replit and Lovable. But what I didn't get is if this works, I'm... I'm never... my stickiness is going to be super high. And my NRR, I don't know how you calculate it, but you know, I've already gone from 20 bucks a month to to $800 a month in one month. If I stay, that's pretty good NRR, right?\nThe VCs will like it if I... especially if you segment me out. So that's why I like your investment, and I like both his investments because I think the metrics will... will get better over the next 12 months, not worse. I think they will improve.\nI mean, the short answer is, I agree, there's... there's the... Jason, there was two different things of what Jason threw out. First of all, in the... in the enterprise space, your retention at the start of this churn's going to get better 'cause out of the gate, people are trying stuff, and by definition, they're going to churn. I remember back in '99, 2001, 2002, Salesforce had a churn issue, right, early on. No, the early adopters are quick... the people who are quick to try you are quick to leave you, right? And the people who make a long considered purchase stay with you a long time, and the... and they happens in that order. Out of the gate, you get the tri...\n\n\ners. Most of the triers, a lot of the triers move on. Provided enough of them stick, you build your business. And then over time, as you become a more established product, you go up market and you get the boring people who are slower to commit to you, but once they commit, are there for 10 years. So, it's just the natural progression. So, at one level, this isn't surprising. I will say what is surprising is the amount of upfront churn you see is probably higher than early SaaS. In other words, because it's the Jason phenomenon of it feels like it's going to work and you get 80% of the way there and then you have this disappointment, right? So I do believe that there's high. In my view, one of the key tells in the next 24 months on all these enterprise AI companies is going to be the percentage of people that stick after they've gone through the innovation cycle, after they've gone through the \"we got to try AI,\" and then they'll ask themselves the hard question: is it delivering value? Do we get an ROI from it? So I think once we're through that kind of nut hole, I think the math, I think by about '25, '26, '26, '27, sorry, the math of predicting the growth rate, it'll be much easier, right? Now there are companies that have extraordinary growth rate, but where the churn is just too high and it's just not delivering value, and we've all got them in, you know, you see them in your portfolio, you see them outside the trick, and you know, it's it was always going to be high, no matter what. There was no world in which it was going to be like the 20th year of SaaS because everyone is clearly trying [ __ ] here, but I think a lot of my focus with my companies is on, I said to one, your entire, let me tell you, the asset, ironically, very different than Windsurf, the asset value of this company is the 20 or 30 customers that you have now and your ability to make them successful. If you can make two-thirds of them successful, even if you have 30% churn and you can add more customers like them, you have a business. And if you can only make 20% of them successful and the others churn, you're dead, right? So it's all when I'm checking in my companies: are your customers making money off your software? Are they happy with yourself? Is it doing what they want? Is that the number one thing? So yeah, sure. It's this is where the money is going to be made or lost in the next two years, cuz we all like to try [ __ ]. I wish I had all the non-Sony baloney numbers in a spreadsheet. All I would bet that um, you know, Cursor's retention has always been higher than Lovable's or Replit's.\n\nThe point you made, uh, it's a different type of experimentation for a developer to commit. Um, it's funny when I started sharing my bills on Replit, on X. It was funny the feedback I got. Some folks are like, \"Jason, do you realize what you could get for 500 bucks a month is insane value?\" Right? There there's that category of people. Other folks are like, \"Do you know what I spent on my outsourced development team in my country?\" Like this is this is this is the biggest ripoff I've ever seen. Right? And other folks were like, \"Do you know for 500 bucks you're getting less than you get for a hundred bucks from Claude?\" Right? So there's very different ways to view this, but if you're deep in Cursor, like you're going to stick with your your development environment, right? So the churn should be higher, right? At least for of some segments, it should be much higher.\n\nAnd and and the churn is higher. Like the churn I I thought was surpris. I've obviously seen the numbers is is better than I thought, but it it does lend more to consumer than it does traditional B2B. And it is higher. So you got to, but you got to segment it to know. As an investor, I need to segment it to have an opinion, right? I I I I'm not initially shocked by high churn as long as you have a large enough cohort that is growing totally that has positive that is net negative churn, that has positive revenue retention, that I'm I'm cool with the with the low-end guys, right?\n\nAnd yeah, your churn from a group of customers, even upset to say from 10,000 signup customers, should be dramatically different than your churn from five considered purchase enterprise buyers. So yeah, churn, even independent of this AI trend, you're exactly right that norms on churn vary. Enterprise versus SMB versus prosumer versus consumer. You're exactly right. And then I got I had an investment where a COO came in who who was out of the blue. He was, you know, was under the gun. Make make improvement the company and he was told to increase uh to cut churn. So what do you think he did immediately? How do you think he did it in 30 days? He reduced churn. He stopped taking on the customers. Yeah, he stopped taking all the small customers. He banned them after. Now revenue stopped growing and but he hit escaping her. Who knows? He he he he stopped, he cut churn in half in 30 days.\n\nNo, it sounds like stupid, but I can totally see it happening cuz you know you get this. Oh, I don't. The real question is, you know, you got to be able to look at that set of customers and say, \"Yes, there's a churn, but the month two churn is much lower, and here's a coder.\" And the over if the overall math works, it's fine, right? But yes, you have to have a mental model and a mental model has to vary by the kind of deal you're doing. So yeah, I think the hard thing is like just in terms you say mental models, I have never in my investing career seen a company go from zero to 100 million in seven months. Personally, like it breaks all the mental models, which is why I did which is also why I did the deal because if it does break all the mental models and the market expansion is as big as it could be, [ __ ] it. We're in this business for companies like this. If you're not doing this and you have the chance and it's one of 20, you shouldn't be doing this business.\n\nYou know, it's funny. You know what's funny, too? I I wrote I tried to write this up is um as weird as it sounds, some of these deals almost seem too cheap. If you look at the crappy that multiples we see for some startups, right? Undifferentiated company raising at 300 pre with less than a million of revenue. Folks doing 100x, 200, 300 AR deals. And then you see what is Windsurf selling for? 20x revenue. Lovable's raising at 20, right? Cursor raising at 20. 20. 20. Let's do Let's bid 25. Aurori, let's out bid them. Let's do these deals sound too cheap.\n\nJason, when I did the last round of Lovable, it was 200 million price and I did it at a 4 million in revenue. By the time the deal was closed, it was at 19 million in revenue. So, so yeah, the my point is the AR multiples uh compared to public comps, yeah, they're high, but compared to a lot of like seed and a startups, they seem like bargains.\n\nOkay, we're going to. You disagree, Rory?\n\nNo, I don't actually. Cuz what you're saying is, put it another way, it's very when again we said this before, whenever you're using revenue multiples that don't take into account growth rates, you're being an idiot. And the other thing is ex and to your point Harry, exponential growth rates are even harder to get your head around. You know when you start when things grow that quickly and if they continue growing, almost any price makes sense, right? So I totally get the argument, but then it is worth pointing out then going back to our first discussion when they slow when you've paid that high price on the assumption of continued growth and they slow down, it's just brutal and you got to get out.\n\nNo, you just move them to a different page on the website. You just have Lovable move it over. You're Lovable. Move this investment to other investment tab. Yeah, other category. Put put grade out image of partner that no longer exists at the fund at attribute investment to him. Thank you.\n\nRemind you I would remind you of solo GP Jason. We don't get to do that to you until you're dead. Okay. You just make up someone that used to work there. Okay, boys. We're going to do Grok. Uh this was insane. The benchmark performance was incredible to see. Uh, Grok destroys competition on humanity's last exam. Grok 4 heavy 44.4%. Grok 4 38.6%. The next closest competitor for reference for people was 26.9%. What did you make of this insane outcome level from Grok in such a short 2-year window?\n\nI think it's very sobering for everyone else. I thought it's I first of all, I think it's a really it's a significant and important point, right? Because you we've talked in the past how if you look at the ante, I mean if you look at people's willingness to value raw startups of very high valuations, it's all about the idea that they're one of the few people who was part of the OpenAI entropic, we know we can deliver a trained model codery of people, right? And it's been very much a small group of people, which is why they've all been paid 100 million bucks, right? Grok in two years from a standing art has gone to shipping a broad, I'm going to come back to the benchmarks in a second, but a broadly comparable ChatGPT type model with a slightly different vibe. They did it. It's a huge, huge achievement and the fact that it's done makes you wonder about how you think about the valuations of some of these other companies and maybe it's not as maybe the knowledge has disseminated out just a little further. So I went in and did some work. A couple of things. One is you check out the team at um Grok, right? You just ask who are the engineering team and it's exactly what you'd expect because yeah, Ian's been around. He was founder of OpenAI. Let's not remember, right? So, it was early deep mind people. It was some early people for some of the other key places. So, it was not the the headline people who wrote the attention paper, but you know, one or two levels down really competent people. And what the aha for me is this with s with with committed clear leadership, which for all he falls the own provides and a couple billion dollars worth of GPU, which see prior comment, the next level down people know how to do this too. The knowledge is disseminating and it will continue to disseminate from here, right? So that was my first big aha. They have shipped, they're the first folks that I didn't think of as part of the initial golden circle who have shipped the broadly comparable thing that feels when you interact with it like, you know, I get this is ChatGPT if it was vibed up, so big a huge deal, a huge credit. And then the second thing I just got to say, Harry, I sorry about this, but I just got to say, I was experimenting on Grok and using it, right? Trying to get it to say all the mean things and they've clearly stopped it, but the whole tone of it is very out there in your face, rah, urgent. I mean, I was just doing my work on it for preparation for the podcast and I was trying to think where have I heard that before? He sounds just like Grok sounds just like Harry. He's like, \"Hey, legend, let's get going here.\" It's literally like talking to Harry. It's what Jason, you should try. Trust me. Yeah. Type put upload the contents and say, \"Talk to me about um this in preparation for my podcast.\" And it comes on and it's kind of that's just so freaking amazing. These guys did this. It's so unfiltered. It's so not like boring old Chad GPT or Goody Two Shoes on Tropic. It's just like Harry, right? We should call the damn thing Harry. It's great.\n\nListen, me me and Elon partnered together. We'd been friends for many years. You've been the reinforcement learning. Maybe they've been in the first 50 20 VC interviews. But but you can there's a real tone there and it's great. Huge credit. And the other comment I make, I can't comment to the benchmarks cuz you know I get I can comment on this feels comparable to the other two or three um you know model providers on the advanced benchmarking. I mean I've read some of the stuff that they published and then other people there's a lot of gamesmanship, but I don't think that matters. What does matter is they've shipped something, re they could if if they could deliver the business side of it, which is a big TBD, they could deliver a ChatGPT like experience that would feel pretty much comparable out of the gate right now. So at that level they won. I think they could win. Yeah. Well the question is. I was wrong. What's that? But do you think. Listen, I got this all wrong when when Grok launched, I thought it was a spite app. I thought it was a spite app and and very little more. I thought listen, he founded open co-ounded OpenAI. Clearly he understands AI from Tesla at a fundamental level that other folks don't and clearly the dude can recruit, right? I mean he he recruited Ilia to to open AAI. The guy can recruit. He knows talent. But I thought it was a spite app, right? I thought I thought all of X was a spite app. I thought he bought it out of spite. I thought payments were spite out of PayPal. And I thought Grok was just just to dig that knife right into Sam Altman. Um, but if you step back for a minute, he's shown that if you know what you're doing and you buy the GPUs and you assemble an Sierra team, whatever this data exactly means, whether it's pulled ahead or not, you can [ __ ] catch up. Okay? Only but and he has access to not unlimited capital, but at the edge of unlimited capital. He does not have the Microsoft headache. He does not have the baggage that um Anthropic has and he has an infinite horizon and the energy that we have never seen outside of Iron Man. So I honestly went in the last release I went from Spite app to you could this is such a fluid space, you could see him pulling ahead of everybody in 12 months. It's very it's very plausible. He has none of the baggage of everybody else and he can get away with crap like blowing up rockets or racist uh things. rolled it back and it's okay and the other guys can't get away with it.\n\nWell, well, that brings into question then which the next point which is like there's reportedly a raise going now at $200 billion valuation, the third funding round in in 2 to 3 months. If that were the case, the combination of Grok and X as a social\n\n\nNetwork at 200 billion, comparative to OpenAI, would actually be a very fair and good deal to do.\n\nI wouldn't, because to be clear, I gave 100% credit for the technical achievement. Elon, like, there was a technical bar to be cleared, and he's cleared it brilliantly. I did not agree with what Jason said. It's not clear to me from that that it gives you anything commercially. In other words, I don't know if they can build as the third or fourth... I mean, you know, we're now... I mean, and this, we may be looking at the overinvestment stage of this game, in the sense that you have OpenAI, you have Entropic, let's say, you have Google. I think that's fair. Let's say you have Meta. You know, at best, I mean, even you know, in Mistral, in China, you're fifth, or you're the fifth or sixth model provider, right? That's not a... that sounds like the airline business. High fixed cost, six customers. Will they be just because they completed the astonishingly hard technical task far better than anyone else did? Doesn't mean they get to build a business here, right? You can't will things into being at the business level. I mean, I think... are you sure?\n\nWe'll see. I think... I think the best founders do will things into existence. That would be my one challenge. All the best founders I know will it into existence. Right.\n\nAgain, and philosophically, I think you can will things into being if there... if I think you can will yourself to be the winner if something is doable, right? If there's not room in the market for the sixth player, no amount of willing it can make it happen, right? So the question is, what's the case for a whole bunch of people who have... as remember what you said about early winners. I signed up for ChatGPT. I've signed up for my ChatGPT subscription. I've signed for a couple of others. Am I going to go and sign up for the Grok subscription too? I mean, it's funny, and I like the interaction, but is it going to become my go-to destination? Right. I don't know. Right. I don't... I don't... I... if it has your X data integrated, and it's the only platform to have all tweets integrated for me, that would be enough, especially... but... and let's just talk about that. And for the 10% of the world that likes Twitter and then actually cares about these things, that would be great. But the truth is, Twitter has always been a minority sport, and I've enjoyed it, cuz I like the minority game. But, you know, yeah, 20x the number of people want to, like, you know, share [ __ ] on Facebook as want to talk politics on Twitter. So you... you... you... congratulations. You... you have your niche market, you know, to the extent you haven't alienated us, but it's not just a mass market, you know. I don't think there's evidence that Twitter is doing better. I don't think there's evidence that it is. I don't think it can ever be anything other than what it is, which is the place you go for news, for politics, for arguments, and the dirty little secret. Most people want to look at pictures and, you know, just share [ __ ] on Facebook. So I don't think it'll be huge. I think they get that business. I think they integrate Grok and Twitter. I think it's great. I like it. I'm enjoying it. There's a lot they can do. But I just can't conceive the steady drumbeat of taking over tens and hundreds of millions of consumers who've emotionally committed to Google, who've committed to ChatGPT, and saying, \"I'm going to go with Grok.\" So I think they'll achieve a very hard technical problem with very low rewards. So that's why I would pass a 200 million pre-billion.\n\nI didn't mean to go on like that. Sorry. It's the coffee. I think Elon's... Listen, I... I would have agreed with you 30 days ago. I mean, this dude's committed. I think he has... if this was a Diance, if this was a side project, if this was a spite app, like as it looked at first, but I think he has a... can bring a level of vision and commitment that his competitors can't, that they just... Sam Altman is... listen, he's a G. I mean, is he the Steve Jobs of our era? Is he better? Do discussion, but is he even really like a founder with no equity, been fired once, uh, all his co-founders are gone. It's just an unst... with open... it's un... it's wildly successful, but it is unstable. I don't think Sam Altman can do anything he wants without talking to his nonprofit board or convincing people. Elon can just fire up one of his jets or his rockets, fly wherever, raise a few more billion, fund it with SpaceX if he has to, like he's done before, and he... he can just be a freaking force of nature in a way like no one else can. No one who in our industry can be a force of nature the way he can. Nobody. No one has the resources, the richest man in the world even now. Who can do this?\n\nJason Khan agreed on every sentence of that, including I want to say that I've enjoyed the fact that we for the last few minutes have deemed Elon the stable one. I think that alone is worthy of... not say there's no amount... I don't... I don't fully subscribe to the great man theory of companies, right? No amount of great man theory can make 400 million people, 500 million people decide they want to go on X if they've already kind of mentally locked into ChatGPT. I don't think you can... I don't think you can reopen that discussion. I think... you know, when you look... when you interact with the B, like, yeah, that's better in some respects, but I just think, you know, it's one of those hard things to... the market's already been taken, and maybe it gets some share of it, but I don't think... yeah, I... I... I don't think you can build as big a thing. I don't think you can build... I don't think you displace ChatGPT at scale in the minds of the consumer, which is 80, 90% of ChatGPT business. Maybe you can get... you can get a minority share of it, but I don't think it'll be huge.\n\nIt's really interesting you say that, Rory, because when you actually look at the hard facts today, I don't think Sam Altman's life has ever been harder. He's losing talent hand over fist right now. It's an incredibly challenging competitive landscape with the commoditization of models around him. And I mean, there's 10 other things, but the unwavering train of consumer demand continues stronger than ever.\n\nTotally.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah. That's the thing about consumer, right? If you... if you hit it right, you... this is the classic VCS system. You can screw up almost everything as long as you nail the product market fit in consumer, right? For a while at least.\n\nWell, well, that... that would be my pushback to you, Rory, which is you said no man can change 500 million people. Does that not go to the power of brand? Elon Musk is probably the most famous man on the planet at this stage.\n\nTwo by two, famous and rich. Pretty much at the... at the top of both, right?\n\nYeah. I... my guess is I know someone who thinks he's more famous. Uh, but I love... I love Jamath, too.\n\nI love that you said that. That was cute. That was cute. No, thank the one thing I will say is I had Edwin from Serge on the show, and he said just a couple of things about this. He said that one, uh, too many model providers are building for benchmarks, and that doesn't actually mean that much. Number one, he said. Number two, Grok was incredible at a very small number of things, and actually it was an embodiment of the verticalization of models, and he thought we'd see more in terms of verticalized models. And he just said three, he hadn't seen a team work quite as hard and efficient as Elon's Grok's team, and he'd seen that firsthand with them being a customer. That's just his points I thought was interesting.\n\nI think all those things are true. The reason I'm like in the Elon camp here, the Grok camp, is I guarantee you this man has a 10-year plan, just like he did for Tesla and SpaceX, and he is executing on it. And this guy is not the smartest person in the world, but he is in the friggin elite. Like, if you add like crossf functional smarts, like to understand everything, there may be no one smarter than him that actually works. There may be folks smarter than him that just play chess and invest money, but there's no one that is that can do everything and think like this guy can, right? This is 11D chess. This is not 4D chess like where we started this conversation. So if this man has a 10-year plan and he gets everything we've said. He knows the p... he's... he knows the power of the ChatGPT plan. He knows Sam Altman personally. He knows Enthropic. He recruited half of the original engineers in here. Okay. His 10-year plan's pretty good. I just can't see all of it. But I see little hints when he says, \"My entire team now just sticks their code in Grok rather than use Cursor anymore.\" That sounds like a a snippy Elon comment. Maybe... maybe we're seeing a little of the 10-year plan there, right? Um, it's just... I wish he published it like he did for Tesla because that was one of the greatest founder memos of all time, the first 10-year plan, right? It was just... if you... if folks haven't read it, go Google. It's like 2004 or something. He told you 10 years of Tesla, and it all happened. I mean, a few of it happened differently, but this guy's got a 10-year plan, and he's got... can he... can commit hundreds of billions to it. Who else can do that?\n\nThe good news, Jason, is that is clearly going to be available to you. I look forward to the episode where you talk about your commitment to the research.\n\nAt least a token. At least I'm going to go on Robin Hood and grab a token for this for this bad boy.\n\nOh, he's gone there.\n\nI don't need the underlying security. I'm just going to buy the token. Why would I do that? Vlad, get me some OpenAI at 200 billion um, tomorrow, right now.\n\nAnd I want to trade in the evening when the markets... We have... we have Vlad on the show, and he said that imperative to tokenization success is the ability for companies to be tokenized without their permission.\n\nThat's my point. I should be able to buy on Robin Hood OpenAI today.\n\nI... I thought Jesus, Vlad is good. Um, he... he is good, by the way, guys. Like...\n\nYeah, it was a good episode.\n\nHe's good. Thank you so much, dude. It was all him. Um, okay, guys, we... well... had a little hand in it, but yeah.\n\nCan I ask you, we've got Meta invest three and a half billion in Ray-Bans. 66% of HR managers use AI to make layoff decisions. Cyberst starts, I think the best fund in the business, raises $300 million secondary fund. We can choose one of them. Which one do you want to choose? I suggested this one, so I'm going to pick it even though it seems obtuse. I think it's interesting. Meta putting three and a half billion into Ray-Bans. The reason I think it's interesting is it just shows us the scale today and that we started this talking about three billion, two and a half billion into Windsurf and Google, and like, it's this is nickels and dimes. These are experiment, and... and we think it's a lot of money, and it is a lot of money, but if Meta can throw three and a half billion into Rayband for half a percent or something, I don't know, 1% or something like that...\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nA to... but a... but a token amount of ownership, right? Single digits, then the numbers here are... they're tough for us to even understand what is material... material or immaterial in the age of AI, right? The bets are so big, the numbers are so large that this makes Windsurf look like uh... look like our... like just one line on our afternoon Strictly VC. It doesn't even make it look material. Three and a half billion may not mean anything in the next 24 months in AI. Like, it may... it may not make the above the fold news in in AI.\n\nThat's my takeaway. Like, people weren't talking about it's nothing.\n\nHonestly, I... I didn't see it until you sent it.\n\nYeah. Well, I have like 11 pairs of these AI Ray-Bans, so I... I do follow it a little bit, right? Yeah. I'm going to try to vibe code with them later today if I can. I don't know if that's going to work.\n\nThat's gone viral, though, which is, you know, the information of started the information TV, which competes with TBPN, and they had Mark and they had Mark Zuckerberg on for the first episode, and it got... and it got like 30 likes in 9 hours. And I just tweeted, \"This shows you how hard media is. Mark Zuckerberg on your show gets 30 likes in nine hours. Yeah.\"\n\nFive years ago that would have been a viral show that trended on Twitter literally.\n\nYeah, it's...\n\nNo one cares.\n\nYes, it's tough.\n\nWell, I mean, it's not an important company.\n\nWell, he's yanking your chain.\n\nIt's not one of those to... going to the... tying it back to the information and its unpaid intern. It's this is... I mean, it had its moment, Harry, but it's not one of the important companies today. It's not... it's not a meaningful company.\n\nOkay, we're going to do a quickfire. I' I've got some good ones. Okay, so we are going to start with who. By the way, I love the way that our last Koshi quickfire round was beaten by the market. Linda Yakarino, and we were like, yeah. So, Koshi quickfire round. Who will be the next CEO of X? Elon Musk 19%, Shirram Krishnan 16%, or other? Well, listen. I... this... I think this is a trick one. Um, I'm going to vote other because I don't think there will be a co of X again because X is reorked, right? X is an AI company now of which this X consumer app is a piece of it, right? And so I don't think Elon's going to hire another another media. I mean, there'll be someone that has to run this business, a president or a GM, but he's going to run this. I think I'm voting for... I guess it's... it's Elon cuz I don't... I... you know, I think the... the... the parent company, he's got to run it. It's... it's Tesla level. I don't think he wants to run Tesla, and I don't think he wants to run this, but I think he has no choice. It's too complicated now. This is not just uh, doing the ops for Twitter and getting the and h firing half the team and getting the tweets to load faster and selling some ads. It's just this is much bigger now.\n\n\nYes.\nIt's another person who's really Elon, but won't take the title because it will just irk the people at Tesla too much in current dynamics.\nBut yes, he will be in charge.\nI mean, but I mean, you guys have to say that.\nHe just spent 10 minutes telling me how Guac's going to take over the world.\nAnd the truth is, if this thing is going to take over the world, he's going to want to be running it.\nSo, you guys can believe that.\nI'll go another.\nI think it was about 15 minutes to be fair, Rory.\nBut yeah, I agree.\nIt was an impassioned debate from Jason.\nWill another S&P 500 company buy Bitcoin this it doesn't finish this year?\nYes.\n$150 returned on 100.\nNo.\nReturns you $217 on 100.\nThat's the most significant.\nWell, I mean, it's an easy bet, but yeah, the most significant fact is it's more likely that the market thinks it's more likely than not.\nYeah, it's almost certainly going to happen.\nThere's going to be a couple of other tech companies at least to do this.\nSo, it's I would agree you vote yes and take the 50% step up even though it's not a great payoff because it's going to happen.\nI think 100% of S&P companies are going to buy Bitcoin over the next 48 months.\n100%.\nI think it's going to become part of the standard treasury function in the CFO's office uh that has cash.\nIt's going to be part of cash management and they're just going to allocate it.\nSo, this year it's got to be it.\nI think I think it has just become.\nListen, I'm not a crypto dude, right?\nAnd I still have some skepticism, but it is too mainstream, right?\nIt is too mainstream and it's going to become part of the Treasury Department and people will dial it up or down to try to get a little more juice or or to have different strategies.\nI don't know if how many people are going to be like the micro strategy one, right?\nI don't think they're going to turn into holding companies with their cash, but I think so so I think that's my subtlety of the question.\nI think it's going to become mainstream treasury department asset, short-term securities, cash, some bit we're not doing gold at our public company.\nThat's a little complicated, but we're going to have some Bitcoin.\nIt's very it's liquid and it has some benefits in the market.\nSo, we may have 10% of our holdings in in it.\nUm, and the volatility will be annoying as a public company, right?\nBecause it will it will go up and down a little bit, but I think it'll I think everyone will have some exposure.\nThat's my that's my wag.\nIf that is true, that is a lot of upside from here.\nLike, I'm not a Bitcoin fan, but I don't see any anything but more demand in the foreseeable future.\nIt's hard to see a decline in demand.\nFinal one, boys.\nWill Meta release Llama 5 before January?\nYes.\n$37 returned on 100?\nNo.\n131 on 100?\nNo.\nIs the right bet?\nBecause if Lama is defined as an open-source product, didn't we just say that they're kind of slowly backing off that?\nSo, I mean, will they release it some closer version?\nProbably.\nI don't know.\nBut if you define it as the open, do you think there will be another open source llama model?\nRory, usually when people come in and you spend $20 billion because the old thing isn't working tend to be humans tend to say, well, whatever I do, I'm going to do different than the old thing.\nSo probably most of the things that were being done won't be done.\nSo if it was open, it's closed.\nSo I think that when you have a regime of violent change at the expense of $20 billion, it's unlikely you just continue on with the same plan as the old guys.\nWhatever the answer is, it's different than 30 days ago, right?\nWith Alex Wang and Nat Friedman and team, it is completely blown up, right?\nThis is not a a 180day planning cycle.\nThey've already worked non-stop to reboot this whole thing.\nAnd if they think they should shoot Llama 5, they've already shot it, right?\nThey've debated it.\nIf they want to release it cuz a different team is doing it, but they're going to reboot it just to just to get it out, that that's possible.\nBut this doesn't seem like a team that that that that's doing something performative, right?\nSo, it's hard to imagine what was in place before them stays on the same schedule.\nAnd it's hard to imagine they can work faster with something already in the pipe, but that is possible sometimes.\nSometimes a great team can pull stuff forward, right?\nIt really it really can happen.\nSo, all I know is it's radically different.\nSo, I be making up my bet making this bet up.\nBut I'll say yes anyway because they want to get something out.\nNo, I'm going to say I up until the last sentence you had me, I'm actually You actually convinced me, your talk track convinced me even firmer to be a no, which is odd.\nTherefore, that you ended up with a yes cuz you exact.\nIf you brought in as these new wely talented people and you're here to make a difference and you know that the first move you make is going to be scrutinized by everyone who wants to second guess that $14 billion check, the last thing you do is ship some lameass version of the prior guy's work.\nThe first thing you ship is going to be yours and it's got to be awesome.\nSo I I I'm increasingly convinced no.\nYeah.\nWell, you get a chance to kill it.\nIf you don't love it, you should kill it.\nYou should kill it.\nIf they don't love Llama 5, which they didn't build your first week, you should kill it.\nYeah.\nIt's just natural, right?\nIt'd be idiotic to release it and be responsible for something you didn't build and believe in, right?\nIt would be idiotic.\nExactly.\nBoys, it's been a busy day for Jason.\nHe's invested in Grok and Lovable today.\nSo, Jason's done his deals for the year.\nUh, this has been great, guys.\nI love my time with you.\nThank you for joining me.\nRock and roll.\n",
