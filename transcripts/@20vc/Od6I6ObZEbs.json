  "cleanText": "I'm a free marketeer. I think tariffs are not the answer. We need to work on the underlying issues in our western democracies. To try to raise money through tariffs is not the right approach. In Turkey, I think we lost around 500 million. What we didn't see was rule of law was a bit of a flexible concept there. And quite frankly, we have so much going on in Western Europe. We just don't take the risk. We stay close to what we can control. Do you believe the US dollar will be the reserve currency of the world in 10 years? Ready to go.\n\n[Music]\n\nPhillip, I'm so excited for this, dude. Listen, I've wanted to make this one happen for a while. I've heard many good things from Henry and from Johannes at GetYourGuide. So, thank you for joining me, Harry. It's great to be here. Thank you for having me. Now, when I was chatting to Yhannis, he was like, \"You got to start with the Venturepark days.\" Uh, I was about probably four or five years old. Uh, not to age you. That's a really unfair start. But um it was before the Sam was and so I had to start here. What are your biggest takeaways from the Venturepark days in that really early web 1.0?\n\nYeah, just for your listeners to put this in context, you're absolutely right, Harry. This was 1999. So this was rock and roll days, the wild west of venture investing in Europe really. And I had been a young kid at McKinsey in New York and had encountered Philipp Freise who was that very visionary CEO at that time at Axel Springer SE who loved idea lab, you remember, which is still Bill Gross is still going strong today, and really wanted somebody to back to bring that to Europe. There hadn't been anything like this in Europe and there wasn't anything, and so we went there in '99, 2000, we raised a pretty big round. Goldman was our lead investors. There was a lot of people involved, and if you ask me today what's the lesson, I think I'm sure Johannes will have spoken to you about this because he embodies it perfectly: in bull markets, you just got to keep perspective and humility and not take yourself for a genius. So many of aspect back then, once we had raised whatever it was, 100 million, thought that was the end of it. I learned very quickly a few months later when the dot bubble crashed and the new market in Germany crashed that the most important thing really was the investors I had on my board because there were two camps. One did this to have a quick turnaround, to have a quick IPO, and the other ones wanted to do it literally for eternity. The big corporates, Telefonica, Bertlesman, they just wanted this to be their window into venture and innovation. And I spent as a young founder, I think I was 26 at that time, all my time intermediating between these two camps. So my lesson learned is this, and I'm applying it manically in everything I do, and I know Johannes does. As a founder, the investors you choose are so important. So, of course, it makes a huge difference, you know, if you're the founder of Helsing and you choose Daniel E because Daniel E understands long-term business building means, you know, and you don't want those kind of fast buck financial orientated early stage VCs that, you know, when the hits the fan that drop you very quickly, and I learned that lesson very quickly.\n\nMany things for me to unpack that. You said about kind of the humility in the in the good times. The thing that I struggle with is Bill Gurley's statement of, you know, you got to play the game on the field. And I look at the very exuberant times that we have today largely fueled by AI and a huge amount of capital coming into our business. And I'm I'm stuck between playing the game on the field and retaining discipline on price on cadence of investing. How do you think about those seemingly opposing statements?\n\nSo that's a very important point. In fact, having invested through all these crisis, it wasn't only the dotcom crash, it was the great financial crisis, the euro crisis, the pandemic, teaches us that we all just boil with water, if you will. So to have discipline even in those times, yes, you want to deploy when there's incredible opportunity, but you need to set yourself limits, right? There's just limits of how much you invest in a year, how many different uh types of in the theme things you back because unfortunately even if you're right and these are fantastic teams, these are great ideas, these are scalable ventures, you don't know when the next missile hits or the next virus comes around, things can just be out of your control and therefore as an investor, you just need to, you know, keep the humility of what else could go wrong. I think another really you'll learn one that I don't stick to schedule and two that I literally just use this as a way to get better as an investor myself. But one thing also I find really challenging is you have a failure or a mistake and you let a past failure impact a future decision. So you invest in healthcare, lose money and you go gh, all healthcare is. How do you think about retaining purity of mind despite success or failure impacting your mindset? Uh, rigorous analysis and you want to reflect your rigorous analysis with as many great minds as you can because on Venturepark the mistake certainly wasn't to go into that space of combining capital with hands-on scaling support. You see that with the Zumbers, you mentioned Ollie and and his brothers, they came a couple years later and made a fantastic success out of it. So the space itself in our case wasn't the problem. The space was we were too early, had the wrong investors and the execution wasn't what it should have been. So to answer your question, got to retain your enthusiasm that you originally had for a certain idea and just go through that rigorous analysis what went wrong and then build on that. There's nothing as helpful as a good failure. Without that good failure, you cannot become a world-class founder and investor.\n\nMy biggest failure, you you might laugh at this, was I lost in Pakistan. Um, in the good times I thought I knew more than most people did about emerging markets. Alas, I did not. Um, and I got taught a hard lesson. Learned many things. What would you say is your most painful lesson and what did you learn? I'm right with you. Um, we lost a whole bunch more in Turkey. I think we lost around 500 million. We backed a company called UN Rorow which we thought was this incredible kind of logistics shipping player in Turkey. Remember the days um where everybody thought that's the next frontier, great demographic, 100% incredible innovation, great people, increing middle class, and you know what we didn't see was rule of law was a bit of a flexible concept there. So what we thought was a protected player, suddenly there was some other entrant um that came in even though that wasn't really possible and we lost our shirts.\n\nDoes that mean then that you don't go into emerging markets in the future? I just take a pretty blunt view that I'm like, hey, it's hard enough to build a business. Add in political risk, currency risk. I don't need to take that risk.\n\nAt KKR, we made exactly the same decision. We tried also Africa, Ethiopia, where we were the largest uh growers of of uh of of tulips and roses. That didn't work out for similar reasons. And quite frankly, we have so much going on in in Europe, in Western Europe, and we can talk hours about it that we just don't take the risk. We stay close to what you know we can control.\n\nYou said there about taking the risk. Another risk that you can take is market timing risk. I'm probably expected to take market timing risk more than you given being much earlier. Do you are you willing to take market timing risk and suspend disbelief or do you need to see now is the time for this? Many people thought at KKR Europe we were crazy when we leaned in and invested I think a third if not 40% of our current fund during co. So in 2020 we um made some pretty um you know I would say bold decisions because we don't know what that virus would yield, but I've learned a long time that you have to focus on what you can control. So I give you an example. Uh, we invested in Vela uh which is the the other hair brand with L'Oreal, and there were seriously people who questioned, well, once this pandemic is over, will people still go and get their hair colored? Having you know three daughters and three sisters, I I absolutely was convinced this is not going to be a problem, and so we invested, and there's many more examples like this. So yes, those types of uncomfortable decisions we took, and I tell you why. After the great financial crisis, we were pretty much like the rabbit in the headlight. We didn't invest anything. The only investment in 2009 we made was BMG when I took the decision to invest uh you know with Bertlesman into music at a time quite frankly when music was in freef fall. That was a great investment in the end, was a courageous, but probably I could only do it at KKR because we we didn't make any any other investments. There was no large investments. But then the crocodiles crocodile tears came later when we we we we saw that yes, there was a great financial crisis. But those types of disruption are exactly when you should go in, and we didn't. And during co, there was no discussion with our founders and our leaders around should we invest now. There was the opposite discussion. So this is very important. There was a very reflected top-down encouragement. Don't be afraid. Talk to us about what you can control. Let's deploy.\n\nWhat do you think was the boldest bet you made in that period? 40% is a lot. What do you think was the boldest?\n\nI thought that um well, as you know that what we what we do is we we partner a lot with companies, right? We don't just buy outright. So the decision at that time, Cody uh was the holding company that owned Valor, and we had seen, again I give my oldest daughter the credit for this, that one of the one of the Jenners had her had her cosmetics brand just sold to Cody, which was an unbelievable Instagram success, and Cody got a little bit in trouble. They were overlevered, and we took a 10% stake in the company and then bought out the majority of Vela at the same time. So it was kind of a combined transaction, and that leap of faith to do that in the midst of the pandemic uh because they had in their mix also a travel retail business for instance which you know for cosmetics etc. you could ask okay when are these airports going to open again, that was a bold decision because in conjunction these two investments were very sizable in the fund.\n\nYou said they're about 40% of the fund in co. I was always taught, and again I really am a student of investing. I've loved it since I was 13, which is why I had no friends in school. But temporal diversification is everything. And actually really discipline in terms of deployment cycles is crucial. How do you feel about sticking true to temporal diversification and a threeyear fixed cycle in venture? I don't know what it is for you versus actually just moving faster and putting 40% out.\n\nIt's an excellent question. What I told you is just a variety. It's a variance on the on the theme of linear pacing because we typically have five to seven year cycles. Now on average it's probably more like four or five, but we very much believe in you got to have the discipline of linear pay, a linear deployment because it avoids that issue. So even though COVID hit in 20, you know, if you have a four year cycle, you have to deploy 25%, right? Most people didn't deploy anything. We took the decision to go 10, 15% above, but then we got lucky because in '21 we didn't invest almost anything, and as you know, my market went very exuberant when co gave way to that incredible wave of liquidity, but the answer to your question is it's incredibly important that discipline to deploy linearly over three year in your world and five, four, five years in ours. This is such a fun show for me to do because I have to say like venture in itself is a little bit uniform, especially after you've done as many great interviews as I guess as I've done, and yours is a different world, and it's a world that I don't know as well. So, it's like a real learning curve for me. So, when we look at I heard your other shows and you said you spent a lot of time on portfolio construction and I was like great, that's a super place to start to understand where we're at. How large is the fund then as a starting point?\n\nSo, Europe for KKR is an $8 billion fund. It's the largest standalone investment fund in Europe. As you know, I'm a massive um voice for Europe. Uh, it's been not always easy. It's tough sometimes to, you know, make the case that we should invest in Europe. But it helps us to have that vehicle because it actually very much helps you in that discipline to say as a global investment firm, Europe is on the map. We got to deploy relative to a global fund which can just make the decision to deploy in other geographies. In terms of your question on portfolio construction, it is so important because traditionally people didn't really think about themes, you know, they didn't think about growth versus cash flow. They didn't think about the underlying industries, um, the geographies. So, we really very much focus on that. And also what's many people in my industry and I know you you're going to reflect on that in our conversation sometimes lack is the discipline to say hey you know of the in a fund of 8 billion you typically you have around 15 investments. Okay. So, of these 15 investments, you know, when you start selling some of them, when you start insisting that they should be better, and when do you just um keep them for the long term because they're they're your winners. Often, if you make that a work of love for the individual investors in the fund, you start losing perspective. You have to top down as the as the kind of lead of the fund make those calls to say hey you know my space company in Bremen which is OB, we just did that investment, that's going to be a big winner given everything is going on, and then there's five others which are which are great, but honestly they do not compound in value by you know consistently by more than 20% or so, and at some point if somebody calls you and says hey we would like to buy that company, you just have to force yourself to sell it.\n\nDo you believe then that PE in your business very much aligns to the power law nature that my business does or is it much more in the consistent 3 to 5x get your money back and and always and 3 to 5x everything? I do believe there we overlap in quite a few things. What is different is our business\n\n\nThe model is not to have two massive winners and then have most of the others be failures. You have to be pretty consistent. Nonetheless, you need to have some real winners, um, because you always will have one or two which are not great. So, it's a common, um, misunderstanding that my industry is sleepy, boring, and just, you know, aiming for those doubles over five years. If we do that, we don't do our job, really. Totally agree with that. If we think about 15 companies in the portfolio, as you mentioned, there's an $8 billion fund. What's the average check then?\n\nYeah, so, on average, it's like 400 to 600 million. 400 to 600 million, and we're getting like...\n\nHow does this structure work in terms of ownership? Are we taking majority? Are we buying?\n\nIn the last 10, 15 years, three-quarters of all investments we have made are partnerships. So, I didn't just buy something outright, but I went into, for instance, in Brema OB, we were, we are 30% shareholder, or, you know, um, Vile in Germany, which was the synthetic flavor business, 35%.\n\nReserves. Do you have a similar... Most venture firms say, especially early stage, we have a one-to-one initial reserves. Do you have a reserves?\n\nAlways do, but it's more like 10, 15% of the fund. So, you would of 8 billion, you would retain, let's say, a billion or so as a reserve, because we do not need as much capital for follow-on rounds, because this is, you know, in terms of the maturity of these companies, these are the Spotify, right? These are very big companies that do not necessarily need any more rounds. It's more for the follow-ons. It's typically for acquisitions, so if they want to buy something...\n\nTotally get it. So, that's when... What about capital intensity? How much does that factor into your decision-making about getting involved? You said that they probably won't need to raise more.\n\nI never have met a company that needs, doesn't need to raise more.\n\nHow do you think about the future cash burn of a business when investing?\n\nYeah, it's extremely important. Uh, if you think about everything we discussed about the crisis, you have to sustain the discipline of capital allocation for the founders and the CEOs of these businesses. It's very interesting because you spoke to Henry. So, Henry Kravis always tells the story about the team that, you know, was told, \"Hey, you own 10% of the company now, and by the way, we want to now invest 150 million of capex in buying these things, and by the way, if you really want to do this, you know, uh, 15 million is your, your, is your own money.\" And the reaction was, \"No, no, you don't understand, uh, if that's the case, we don't need to make that capex.\" So, the idea, we come from the other side than you, right? You come from the side where the founders are the owners, and you back them. We're making those entrepreneurs that are in there, or these, these CEOs, or these families, we make them owners again, right? Because many of them weren't originally the founders of these companies. And once, so where you and I meet is the owner mindset, where it's truly your baby, and you truly care about the scarcity of capital, and you say, \"Okay, do I open France? Do I open Japan? Or do I rather open, do I rather launch another product?\" It's these are real tradeoffs. And so, you are right, capitalist is always wanted, and we always invest it, but the discipline of deciding where you invest it is critical.\n\nDoes the model work in an AI world? And what I mean by that is when you look at, especially on the model side, these companies are just cash incineration machines. Uh, regardless, when you look at anything like Harvey and legal, which has raised a huge amount of money very quickly, they just require so much cash and so much more. Does the model still apply? It's fantastically, um, intellectually inspiring and interesting because we are the largest owner of fertility clinics in Europe. Okay. So, there we are expanding very, very quickly and very broadly in different geographies, in different areas. I mean, I, I know Elon likes talking about this, right? The demographic trends are not great. People do not have children anymore, and we're extending lifespans. But to answer your question, those are businesses that will not be replaced by the AI models. These are, these are just real businesses that still very much need the cash to open more clinics. Yeah. So, it's a long-winded answer to tell you, and I'm sure you'll ask me about some other things that are happening right now. I happen to be lucky. Quite frankly, I'm super lucky because by pure luck, I've seen so many different cycles of this. And I'm, I know I sound like a younger version of Warren Buffett now, which is crazy, but he's right. Things are looking different often every five years, but the underlying, if you separate the noise from the reality, the underlying principles of capital allocation has to be very thought through and rational, it hasn't changed. You will have some AI models where you need lots of capital. It makes a lot of sense to invest in there, and you have some others which don't. So, do you think the principles are the same? Like I, you know, I've been again a student of venture for 15 years, and I was always taught that 0 to 10 million or was like gold standard in 18 months. We have three companies that have gone from zero to 100 million or in a year.\n\nYeah, that's the magic. It's incredible. And, and so do the principles actually apply if the revenue and company scaling is, is like never ever seen before in history? So, I'm making the bold prediction that you have just seen three of the incredible winners in the space, but they will be not the norm for whatever comes afterwards. When you see those winners, you better invest and double down or triple down. But this doesn't mean that software, you know, SAS models and investment that is the bread and butter of many in, in our industry still will not be good investments anymore, and you just have different cycles there. Do you ever sit around the table at KKR and think, \"God, it'd be an easier job if we just stuck money into OpenAI, Anthropic, and Helsing, and we didn't have to be so operationally involved? We could sell in secondary markets in two to three years for 3x, and we could ride the wave very efficiently.\" No, I have incredible respect for the benchmarks and the Harry's and the Daniel X who found those types of opportunities. But, you know, you asked me my lessons learned from Ben Park. I tried Harry. That's what I set out to do. And I learned the hard way that some brilliant minds can do that, and some others that are not so much in that space. My, my experience is the truly outstanding investors in venture are ones with deep, um, you know, vertical experience and real knowledge. I'm an, I'm a generalist. I've seen so many things in patterns. I'm better in the later stage, uh, industry. You look with great admiration at the Excels benchmarks and indexes and clin of the world. Um, but that's not our business. Obviously,\n\nwhen we look at 2021, we saw a lot of your D1s, your co-2s, a lot of crossover firms move earlier and earlier...\n\nI mean, we see kind of insight to this day just cover the full spectrum. Um,\n\nto what extent do you feel pressured to move earlier and earlier to ensure more and more access?\n\nGrowth is a separate team. So, I always, I cannot understate the importance of this. It's not like the same bunch of people does different things. Um, I don't think that the DNA of KKR and of other later stage firms, it extends to what Insight does or what growth funds do. It will never extend to venture because it's a different skill set. It's a very different skill set.\n\nI totally agree with you. Uh, I think Thrive is the one who's able to cross growth and early stage incredibly well. But I totally agree with you. You said there about a different team.\n\nYes.\n\nIn terms of decision-making, I think the quality of your decision is the quality of your product in our business. How do you think about decision-making today in KKR? And what's been your big lessons on how to do it right?\n\nThere's not one brain which decides. We truly are a partnership. And if you have two or three brains around the table thinking through a tough decision, you always get a better decision than if you just have one. And in terms of the decision...\n\nYou think so? Does that not lead to consensus thinking?\n\nNo, because the culture is that you have to be willing to challenge each other and to be open about concerns you have. Coming back to your AI point, a lot of this is pattern recognition. Isn't that fascinating? The best investor today in the world, full stop, is Warren Buffett, who is what, 93 years old. So, how do you replicate that brain? Right. So, I do want to chat about the the big L in our business, which is obviously liquidity.\n\nIt's, it's been a interesting few years. I think there's like structural illiquidity, which is a real problem and a concern that I have, and it seems to be kind of getting worse in some respects. How are you thinking about access and liquidity, particularly for the largest of the positions?\n\nSo, Harry, I'm going to make an old fart type of comment. I've seen at least three, if not four cycles where liquidity goes from unbelievable exuberance, like we've seen in, you know, 2021, to the drought that we see now, only for people to say at the peak, \"Liquidity is, is limitless, and we, the party is, is never ending, so I don't actually need to sell anything. I just write all my winners to give way to the hangover and the realization that that was a mirage. There's no more liquidity.\" And then at the bottom, people predict there will never be liquidity again, and it's structural, and the world is coming to an end. I literally can walk you through the same sentiment in the great financial crisis, after the com bust, into certain elements, probably also during the euro crisis.\n\nBut we have three trillion in in locked LP money into private.\n\nI hear you, and you're absolutely right. The party that was celebrated in 21, 22 in terms of the velocity of fundraising and investing was absolutely artificial, inflated, and not sustainable. And the hangover had to be tough. The hangover is now, I don't think it's structural. It just has to clear the excesses. But remember, I remember very well in 2001 how the venture industry had to digest the exuberance. So, you had many funds which had to half, right? People gave money back on a grand scale. We haven't seen that yet. And the havinging, if you will, of the universe of public companies is also structural.\n\nAnd I'm going to make the point which has led to so many of our partners choosing to be rather with us than to be public. I mean, the space company OB was a public company. GFK, the market research firm, was a public company, both of them owned by, you know, a family foundation, and the family who both said the public markets are not helping us because they just can't cope with all that volatility and all that change. So, we rather have KKR take it private and be with them for the long term, and they help us deal with all of that change. That's a structural factor that's different from 2001.\n\nSo... And so that structural factor is that founders are aware that actually they'd be better off in private markets and they want to privatize. That is a structural factor. Uh, if you think about my industry, I give you one set for KKR over the last 15 years, only 15% of our exits were actually IPOs. So, 85% of our exits were either strategic exits. So, some large company came along. I give you an example. I just mentioned GFK. Neielson IQ said, \"We merged with GFK, and we built a global champion.\" Or it was another play in our industry. I mentioned Fotolia, right? Which, uh, G associates had basically built up to certain scale, and then they sold 50% to us. That is much more of what we have done historically. So, the structural crisis of the IPO market right now are not, is not resulting in a structural crisis for, for our firm and for our industry. It's slightly different for venture. Totally get you in terms of you said about kind of, uh, fund sizes havinging and the impact you saw from 2001. I think that AI is kind of the oxycontton that actually venture needed. It's like we were just coming into the day. Absolutely. And then it's like, \"But wait a minute, it's the best time ever,\" and if you're an LP, there's enough material there to be like, \"Actually, they could be right,\" and so I have to keep going. Do you agree with that? I agree, and that is why we don't see fund sizes havinging, because exactly of what you said, a lot of these opportunities are so capital intensive, because you suddenly have some interesting places to deploy. Now, it doesn't mean that the fundamental underpinning of what we all do, it doesn't matter whether it's venture or private equity, we are the answer to the demographic crisis that Elon Musk is putting his finger on. We have an aging society everywhere. People are retiring ever later, but they have to retire. They have ever fewer babies. So, if we don't have a capital stock compounding and accumulating for the benefits of retirees, people cannot pay for their old age. Therefore, what is happening right now is a pretty narrow investor base. University endowments, you know, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds that underpinned our industry and yours are being complemented by ever growing elements that were completely excluding alternatives so far, which is the 401k pensions, the individual investors. If you think about it, we have a, I think it's a, it's $192 trillion of savings that are completely excluding alternatives that are in a high net worth and kind of individual investor base.\n\nThe innovation, you know, that was underpinning...\n\nBank, right? This, the Norwegian so wealth fund to allow them to participate in all of this long-term investing that we do and investing in these growth companies and creating huge values is now extending itself to individual investors. I think it's 1% of the 192 trillion are invested in alternatives. That only goes to 5%... uh, you suddenly have $10 trillion. You think about the magnitude relative to the entire institutional investing base. Meaning, to answer your question, while that whole universe on the left is in dire need of liquidity, there's others who are dying to provide liquidity. So, there's a market, right? So, what's happening is secondaries as an asset class is going through the roof. They are going and buying fund stakes, uh, providing liquidity to some LPs who need it, and also there's innovations in the industry, um, which I hadn't seen in my lifetime before, where you have evergreen products, because if you think about the treadmill system that we have in our industry, which is you have to go every 3 to 5 years and present your case again to the LPs, then you have a new fund, then you have another new fund that is being replaced... I mean, I call it very much the Warren Buffett... I remember...\n\nUm, at that time, again, I was a young Turk at KKR, and our brilliant mind, Scott Nutell, who's norm... he came up with this idea...\n\n\nUh, to go public for KKR by merging with a public LP vehicle, actually, which hadn't worked because the public markets were assuming that we would lose 80% of every one of our investments. So he said to the public, \"If you value more stability, why don't you become a 30% order of KKR's general partnership?\" So of our partner economics in exchange for that pool. And that's how we ourselves became owners of a 5 billion pool that had been valued at one, and that became 10, and that's now 30. So we actually are the largest investor in our own things. But to cut a long story short, what he saw at that time was that Warren Buffett had innovated in an incredible way where he got Geico and other insurance companies to provide the liquidity for all the investments he made, right? Because he owns these insurance companies. So all the people who write, um, you know, who have insurance policy, they pay up front, the cash comes in, and normally it sits in interest-bearing accounts earning nothing. And now he uses at the source to buy whatever companies he buys, American Express. That is now the innovation that we see in our industry on top of this retail money. So basically, we, Apollo and others, have now taken under our wings insurance companies that provide all this liquidity. So you see the innovation goes beyond what some people talk about continuation vehicles, etc., that it extends to completely new areas of the market, which make a lot of sense because will KKR's Europe fund be $20 billion in 10 years? I think that the answer is not the fund. If you ask me, will KKR Europe's asset under management, uh, double and triple over the next 10 years? The answer is yes, because the universe for what we do is radically expanding. You know, when I did the BMG Rights Management deal, that was a one, one and a half billion deal for a 50% stake in that music company. You fast forward 10 years, and we had a 10 billion deal to buy half of Axel Springer SE, which again was a 50/50 deal with a family. You can very easily see how that could scale further. The capital itself will be doubled and triple, but the source of it won't be necessarily a fund. It could be those retail funds that I mentioned, or it could be some part of the insurance capital, if you see what I, what I mean. Yeah. So the funnel becomes much bigger. We are responsible for a much broader scope of capital to invest, and the demand for what we do in Europe is also growing much faster because more segments of the market want private equity investment. To what extent can you share what percent of your LPs are European? Like you, I'm very happy to say, but I, I think I probably have 10% that are European, 90% of my...\n\nSo I'm going to disclose one thing to you: the large majority is America. You have some pockets in Europe, like Holland and Norway, uh, that are very strong. The Middle East is incredibly innovative and takes a large chunk.\n\nDo you find it ironic, though, that when we make a huge amount of money from European companies that we just ship it back to a load of people in the US? So, first of all, I'm grateful for any capital that comes into Europe, regardless of the destination, because we need more capital in Europe. Mario Draghi is right. We need to invest 750, 800 billion a year alone to catch up with on innovation, AI, but also to complete in other industries, defense, uh, you know, uh, high-tech, etc. Nonetheless, for the future, you're absolutely 100% spot on. We got to wake up in Europe as, for instance, Germany has now decided to invest 25% of its GDP and make sure when we make these investments, we build equity value. So, in other words, we need to, you know, it's being done here in the UK with the mansion house complex. We need to professionalize together our pension systems and allow more investments and alternatives to build capital accumulation.\n\nAbsolutely. And that means in 10, 20, 30 years, hopefully, we retain a larger percentage of the value creation we make with alternatives investment.\n\nAre you fundamentally investing in a different type of company today? And what I mean by that is, you know, in past generations, there might have been a Fotolia, there might have been a GetYourGuide, kind of similar to me in that respect. And now, you know, we have the most terrible challenges with energy, with defense, with infrastructure. You mentioned, obviously, your space company. I mean, we are woefully under-equipped when it comes to space. Um, are you investing in a fundamentally different class of company, given this need for capital in all of these very hard but new industries?\n\nMaya is right. We are behind in defense, for instance. But look, in scarcity and hours of need, innovation kicks in. And look at what happened because of the hour of need and that and that innovation that we have in Europe have seen the US has done by saying 10% of the spend of the Department of Defense needs to go actually in the innovative ecosystem and space the same, right? Uh, you know, SpaceX was just the result of opening it up to the private, to the private sphere. That is coming here now. So let's not forget we have had a terrible tragedy in Ukraine for years now, and they're still standing, and it's because of the innovative companies like Helsing that have supported them. So short answer to your question is yes, um, innovation, what you know, what you know best, is the answer to these to these problems, but I wouldn't be so negative. They are coming now much faster than some people realize.\n\nDo you feel we're taking more risks than ever, given the volatility that now exists in the world on a daily basis? We were, we were talking before about some tweets and events that happen that just kind of change everything with a tweet.\n\nMy point being, the world seemed relatively stagnant or plateaued at certain points, and now it seems like it is more volatile than ever. Do you think we're taking more risks than ever?\n\nWell, you started this conversation with AI. You're right. I mean, AI is a fundamental transformation of all the assumptions that we had made around productivity, around the innovation cycles you need in certain industries like healthcare, uh, defense, etc. So that alone was already massive, right? And then at the same time, you have this incredible, um, pivot from the post-war consensus of how everything works. Right after the Second World War, there was an institutional ecosystem built with the IMF and the World Bank and the United Nations, and there was a clear understanding of how everything works, and people had forgotten about the 1900 to 1930 period when it was much more bilateral, and it was much more nation states, and it was much more, you know, everyone for itself. People also, thirdly, had taken for granted the unique role of the US dollar as a reserve currency. Also, that is being questioned now. Uh, radaral fourthly points out that when you have large amounts of debts accumulated, we are just one step away from a major crisis because that bubbles at some point get resolved by internal strife, war, or, um, massive transformations in the monetary system. So what my point is, we have four disruptions at the same time: technology, geopolitics, monetary sphere, and at the same time, we have a huge demographic crisis we talked about, right? There's a feeling of unparalleled inequality between certain segments of the population and others and certain regions of the world and others. So yes, we are investing against an unbelievable backdrop of risk and volatility and uncertainty, but especially in times like this, I remind myself of what Warren Buffett says, you got to focus on what you can control. If I have a spectacular founder like Muat at Hamatan, I have a large market that will be transformed by technology. And if I see that there's unparalleled openness to actually institute change for the better, which I think is the case in Europe right now, then I invest. I just have to be able institutionally to be patient and to hold for longer because you're not able to predict what's going to happen in three years. It's impossible. So if something goes wrong, you just have to be able to hold longer.\n\nDo you believe the US dollar will be the reserve currency of the world in 10 years? Yes, I think that it's impossible to replace reserve currencies that quickly. Will the US dollar be the reserve currency in 50 years? I couldn't tell you. I do think in 10 years time, the percentage of reserves the US represents will probably have reduced slightly. The problem that the monetary system has is if you want to replace one thing, you need to decide what you replace it with. Right now, the only credible alternative is the euro. And we in Europe, we need to get our act together. It's a fantastic opportunity for us to take a larger share.\n\nYou don't think it's Bitcoin?\n\nUm, I think Bitcoin is a very interesting innovation and will take a larger share, but it's too early now for us to to call that that will be the reserve currency of the world. And you know, Harry, why nobody talks about quantum computers anymore? Think about what that means, right? If we have quantum in terms of all the impact of that, and people will just not replace 80% US dollars with Bitcoin overnight. I think Bitcoin will take a larger share, as will the euro, but it's going to be more of a mix.\n\nWe mentioned the kind of four disruptions. The hard thing with disruptions is they change the world in such unprecedented ways that they make a lot of prior assumptions really invalid. And it...\n\nWe mentioned kind of thematic thinking earlier. I don't like thematic thinking because I think the world is so unpredictable that co can happen and industries are changed overnight in ways that we can't comprehend. To what extent do you think thematic thinking and a prepared mind is actually valid in a world that changes so much so quickly?\n\nCan I put a Buffetist spin on the idea of thematic thinking?\n\n100%.\n\nI think it's very relevant. If you think about Buffett, he will tell you, whatever noise there is in the world, I'm going to look at a few essential elements. I'm going to look at the founder or his team or the CEO of the team. I'm going to look at essentially the business itself. Is it in a, you know, is it in a large market? Has it an unassailable, um, position in that market? Is it innovative enough to have product cycle innovation? And is it having a good return on capital, and then I'm putting incentives in for these people to just keep running fast at it. I love his thinking. That is a very different thing as saying I invest in energy and I invest, you know, in certain industry verticals. He has a human spin on thematics.\n\nNow that said, I do think thematic investing is valid. If you now think that in Europe, Draghi is right, and there are certain elements where we just have to invest, and that, for instance, is space and defense. If that is part of your investing theme, then that makes sense because you can't just overnight say, \"Hey, I was a healthcare investor, now I'm a space investor.\" You need to build, going back to our original conversation about what makes a good venture investor. You need to have a deep thematic...\n\nBut do you, I, sorry, I don't mean to be difficult, but I met so many space, not space, defense companies, every defense company's trying to be in this, obviously, housing in Europe. I met so many defense companies, none of the founders, I don't know how much to be fair, but none of the founders that I've met touch to... I mean, it's even if I knew nothing about defense, which I don't, to be very clear, nothing...\n\nI love nothing more than having such a massive consensus with you to... is a rockstar.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo debate. And so if I get met all of them, even though I know nothing, I know he's the best.\n\nHe is the best for sure. But it doesn't, that's the good news about markets and innovation cycles. Um, Henry Kravis was the best by far in his industry, and he, he set up a whole industry. People are fast to copy. People are fast to innovate. They're fast to follow. There will be Tossen is the best. But in five years time, we look back and say, \"Of course, Tossson couldn't have done it all by himself.\" There will be, there will be Muad at Hamatan. There will be others...\n\nTo what extent, I always say, if you want to invest in the next, uh, Helsing, don't just invest in Helsing. I, I spend my life with investors who like, \"Oh, I'm trying to find the next Open AI, the next Andrew.\" Don't just put your money in the winner. Well, you always want to back your winners. I completely agree with that. And like winners compound...\n\nWinners totally compound, but it doesn't mean that you can put your entire fund into one winner, right? This is what we discussed before.\n\nHow much money would you put into a company? A concentration of funds.\n\nSo we are absolutely rock solid, um, you know, disciplined on this. You wouldn't normally, you don't do more than 10% of one fund. You know, I think in terms of underwriting, the absolute maximum is 15%, but it's in that range.\n\nI love Brian Singerman at Founders Fund who says the enemy of great venture returns is capital concentration limits, and that's why we did 33% into Airbnb. And I just always remember thinking, my God, that's conviction. 33% into one single company.\n\nYeah, that's absolutely in my industry, not, not, not the right approach.\n\nCan I ask, we, we're talking about Europe. Europe has an incredibly fragmented public markets.\n\nYes.\n\nHow much of a problem is the complete lack of functional public markets for Europe today?\n\nIt's a beautiful question. We come back to Mario Draghi. Uh, the second thing he said after you got to invest 750 billion a year to catch up is we need a capital market union. We need to come together and do away with artificial limits between 27 nation states and the UK when it comes to concepts like securitization or going public laws. Yes, of course, we need a European SEC. Yes, of course, we need a bit more of one pen European place where people can go public. That's extremely important.\n\nCompletely agree with you. I think a unified European liquidity mechanism would be great. To what extent do you worry also about an EU AI act? You know, bluntly, it's incredibly prohibitive.\n\nWell, we are experimenting today, and blunt speaking, which I'm happy to experiment in. We absolutely overregulated that space. We need to unleash the power of that technology, technological innovation, and not stifle it by too much innovation. For sure, Germany has a challenge in the auto industry.\n\nMhm.\n\nDo you worry as much as I do about the rise of BYD, Xiaomi, and China in bluntly destroying much of the European car market? So I'm going to answer that question, um, indirectly by saying what I'm observing, because we own fantastic investments in related industries, is the the dir of good engineers, and what we see is when the automotive industry is shrinking because of some of the factors you, you mentioned, those people immediately find jobs in other industries which are growing, whether that is sensors, whether that is, uh, defense...\n\nSo of course, we need to have a fair... we need to have a fair playing field.\n\n\nRight.\nBetween different economic regions in the world, and I always worry when certain industries, um, do not find fair conditions to compete on.\nShould we tariff the out of Chinese cars then if they're subsidized by the Chinese government in terms of their creation, and they're able to flood our markets if we're playing fair?\nDo you not just tariff them?\nI just think, generally, I'm a free marketeer.\nI think tariffs are not the answer.\nUm, I know that's a controversial statement in today's world, but, you know, we need to work on the underlying issues in our Western democracies.\nFor instance, we have too high deficits.\nThose deficits lead to exceedingly high indebtedness.\nWe are therefore not crisis prone.\nTo try to raise money through tariffs is not the right approach.\nWhat do you think is the best way to deal with the current situation we have in terms of deficits?\nWell, uh, critically important is what we discussed before.\nIf you think about 20, 25, 30% of all of our budgets going to two sources, one to just serve, service the interest of the existing debt stock, it's huge.\nI mean, in many countries, these are higher expenditures than our health care or defense budgets.\nThen it is becomes very clear that the only way to do to restrain that is on the expenditure side, where on the, you know, on the, for instance, on the pension systems and the benefit systems, we do not benefit from the capital accumulation and the wealth creation.\nYou know, if I had, it is mind-boggling if you know, if you and I were Norwegian, we wouldn't worry a bit about this because the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, right, through everything they have done, has created such a capital stock that every single person doesn't need to worry about their pension.\nI had Nikolai on the show and he said, \"Every single Norwegian is a millionaire.\"\nHe's a genius.\nUm, and he's doing a great job, by the way, running.\nI asked him if he'd invest in my fund, and he said, \"Of course, our minimum check is $10 billion.\"\nBut you know, imagine if we had the, you know, the, the German, the, the British, the French, NGUS bank, right?\nWhat what that that would have meant.\nAnd that's the conversation I had with Angala America 10 years ago.\nIt was absolutely possible.\nWe slept through it, but doesn't mean because we missed it, we couldn't do it in the future.\nWe must do it.\nI think one interesting one for me is again, I'm a student of economics and history as well, and it's like, you know, if you look at Japan in 1980s, their deficit was huge.\nYes.\nUm, and the question is like everyone's like, well, we've got to got to worry about the deficit.\nWe've got to control it.\nWhy?\nWhy can't we just let it go higher?\nI know it sounds terrible, but they kind of kicked the can down the road in the 80s.\nTo what extent can we not just do it now?\nI mean, you, you and I are going to have a hobby economist conversation because it's a fascinating conversation.\nYou know, the chickens will always come home to roost.\nThat's what I've learned in economic theory because here's here's what we miss sometimes.\nA lot of this is very much virtual.\nWhat's the biggest coin of the realm?\nWhat's the biggest currency in of our business and of our economy?\nIt's trust.\nSo those numbers don't mean anything.\nBut if people convince themselves that, um, spending 20, 25% of an ongoing budget in any country on interest for your debt is too high, and you can't pay for innovation, for, for, you know, for, for health care, for defense, etc.\nAt some point, there will be calls for one of two things: either increased taxation, which typically means that a lot of your value creators leave your country, or radical cuts in spending.\nWe have seen both in Japan and the United States of America that is extremely hard for a political system that is elected every four years to actually have the discipline of reducing these expenditures.\nI mean, Japan still has a structural deficit the way they have.\nSo, if you don't, if you, if you can't really raise taxation, and if you can't really reduce expenditure, the only other way to do it to get rid of your of your, you know, interest income, of your interest load, is to inflate away your debt, right?\nSo you do financial repression, which means you force your interest rates to be below the rate of inflation, which means in real terms, everybody who has, who has assets, uh, you know, loses, and that is a very, you know, inflammatory way of dealing with it.\nWe know what that meant in the 30s, right?\nAnd quite frankly, we're having a philosophical debate now.\nOur generation, so the people that are not retired yet, will ask the questions.\nYou know, if the statistics I give you in Italy as an example, are that in a few years time, every fourth person is a, is a person in pension age, so over the age of 65.\nHow can you sustain any balance between toiling every day and feeling that in your own retirement you actually will have anything to live from?\nAnd then at some point, societies get an imbalance, right?\nI mean, look at our political systems all over the Western world in the election results, right?\nPopulism rises.\nThis goes much beyond now what we do as a job, but there's a direct correlation between all of this, so I come back to what you and I do every day.\nThere's a much of a purpose in it.\nIt's not about just making returns, or it's actually making pension affordable for millions and millions of people.\nAnd we need to have a political system where what we do benefits as broad a population as possible.\nDo you think AI will have the productivity gains that people suggest it might do?\nIt's too early to tell.\nI totally, I, well, I think it will.\nHowever, productivity gains, which will be extremely beneficiary to the world, don't mean that the challenges I just mentioned will be solved because there will be this disruption phase where many, many people who are, won't they be worsened because you'll have more and more people who are removed from the labor force actually, and so even people of like working age will not be working?\nIt only works if no bank, let's assume no bank, which is the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, would suddenly be the British bank, and everybody of us has a stake in those companies.\nSo if, if, if you know, we had a fund that is actually catering to the pensions of everyone which owns 20% of Open AI, you, you would be celebrating that development, right?\nBecause we find a new balance between work and leisure, and there will be different jobs, but you people don't have to, you know, trepidate the outcome of this.\nThe problem is right now, there's no such mechanism because we don't participate in the value creation.\nYou don't think we're going to have like massive structural unemployment because of AI in the next 10 years?\nSo the point I'm making, if we in Norway had structural massive unemployment, would be fine.\nWe would be fine because NUS Bank has led to that structure unemployment because they're the largest investor in the AI company, and therefore they could redistribute the spoils of it.\nI do think there will be a transition now where white collar jobs will be impacted, and we need to answer the question on a societal level.\nHow do we cope with that in terms of the earnings and the results from the investing to make sure they are broadly based, um, for everyone impacted by this?\nYou said about owning 20% of Open AI.\nThe challenge with the extension of private markets is the wealth creation is shared between a very few number of people compared to public markets where it's obviously available to many more, your nor bank and countries of the world.\nTo what extent are you worried that we're seeing the concentration of wealth to few people with the extension of private market?\nIt's a brilliant question, and it's the most important question.\nUm, and that's exactly why our industry, the investing industry, needs to open for the many.\nThat's why what I said earlier, the fact that we were only allowing 1% of all the private individuals to participate in the, in the, you know, in the, in our industry, in the, you know, alternative investing industry, that is not sustainable.\nIf this becomes, if, if your dad and my dad and others have the ability to save for their own retirement, and they can select 5%, 10% of their, you know, capital pot that we have now said everybody can have for their future retirement, and they allocate it to us, and we invested in Open AI, it becomes suddenly available to the many, right, rather than the few.\nSo that's the answer.\nThe answer is, uh, broad-based, uh, participation in the alternatives industry, and that is why this is so important.\nDo you think we will see that broad-based participation?\nHow does that actually look?\nThat looks like retail-backed funds.\nSo I think what we, I think yes, we will see it.\nI think if, I mean, I remember I was in McKinsey some time ago, but I still have a 401k plan from that.\nI mean, I wasn't there that long, but I still have whatever the number is there.\nYou don't check it.\nI do, and I allocate it every year.\nUm, I'm just an long-term investor, so there's no point in checking it every quarter.\nBut if I check it every 5 years and I reallocate it to the same allocation, by the way, I allocate, I think 30% to my industry, and the rest is S&P 500 and a bit of bonds.\nYeah.\nBut if you, if you do that, imagine everybody was able to do that.\nYou, I sleep well at night, and I look again in 10 years, and I see the compounding that has resulted.\nThere's no reason why what America allows, um, or Norway allows, shouldn't be available for all of us in Europe.\nIt's just a regulatory question and the question of courage for the political systems to say, I go from a pay-as-you-go pension system to one that has a private capital accumulated, um, you know, column.\nI do also think it massively increases education standards actually on company level.\nI got one brilliant advice, which is that if you want your children to give a about companies, buy them one single stock, because the minute you have any form of ownership, your interest level will go through the roof.\nAbsolutely.\nCan a personal one on on money?\nHow do you think about your relationship to money?\nMine's a weird one.\nI used to think it was everything, and then I got it, and I realized it's relatively nothing.\nI mean, it's nice to have as a foundational layer, but it wasn't the jar of happiness that I thought it would be.\nCan I disclose, can I disclose a secret to you?\nYeah.\nUm, got to go and see the new Brad Pitt movie, F1, the movie, uh, which I think is spectacular.\nUm, if I had had a say in how we call it, one of our production companies, it produced it.\nIt wouldn't be called F1 the movie.\nIt would be called It Is Not About the Money.\nAnd you'll see when you see the movie why that's the message that I would give to people when they ask me what my relationship with money is.\nWas it never about the money, or was it like me where you think it is, but then it's not?\nI just stumbled into.\nSo when I made the decision to leave a high-paying job at McKini, people thought I'm absolutely crazy because I gave up the the safety net for for no certainty at all.\nAnd you know how it is to be a founder.\nYou are one day, you think on paper a gazillionaire, and the other day you are broke.\nIt's the most incredible experience that because you learn very quickly from that that it's not the money that matters, it's the learning.\nWhen I went to KKR, it was a startup.\nLet's make no mistake, right?\nIt was when I joined, whatever, 39 people, and I had no idea what it means to build a career track record in investing in funds.\nYou know, it is the important yacht.\nMy job is to create, uh, results for all these pensioners and for what we do.\nBut it's only an output.\nOkay?\nIt's not, it's not the main reason we do that.\nFor me, at least, it's not.\nI mean, I enjoy every day speaking with people in completely different ways of life.\nYou may know that I'm a crazy m music fan.\nYou love the opera, huh?\nI'm crazy about trying to innovate the Bat Festival, which is the Vishad Bnner Festival in Germany.\nI'm also a trustee of the Royal Opera House.\nI do, I do love the opera, yes, but I love all kinds of music.\nBut it's, you know, I, I love it because I learn so much from these artists, right?\nWhen you see the shining eyes of the opera singer or the ballet dancer.\nI mean, it was so incredible to experience during co when they couldn't perform what it meant to them once the curtain could rise again.\nIt's so in many ways, whether you are a Formula 1 driver, or you are an artist, or you're an investor, if you don't love what you do, then you will, you, you ain't be good at it.\nAnd if you're really good at what you do and you love it, there will be money that follows.\nListen, I could speak to you all day.\nCan we do a quick fire round?\nSo, how can I say a short statement?\nOkay, so let's roll with, which investor you most admire and why then?\nWarren Buffett.\nIncredible ability to just separate the noise from what really matters.\nWhat's the most painful investing lesson and what did you learn?\nVenture Park.\nI set it up.\nIt failed.\nAnd I learned to keep going, to remain humble, and to really, really, really think about your investors.\nWhat do you know now that you wish you had known when you started at KKR?\nThat is a marathon and not a sprint.\nI think as an investor, you just have to go for the long term.\nAnd sometimes, what does that mean?\nIt means when you're in the eye of the storm like CO or like now, make do not make the mistake to think that it's structural.\nYou got to stay through it.\nYou got to look for the long term.\nAnd when you look back now, it's also obvious, but it's never obvious.\nYou just got to endurance is what matters in in our industry.\nYou never give up.\nI so agree on endurance.\nWhat matters.\nI always say when you're in the eye of the storm, like now, I'm seeing so many people sacrifice trust.\nYes.\nFor short-term financial gain.\nNever do it.\nSo dangerous.\nYes.\nTotally agree with you there.\nUm, biggest lesson from working with Henry Kravis.\nArrogant skills is what he taught me.\nI will never forget when I was the new kid on the block in KKR, and I entered for the first time the office, and I didn't know what to do, quite frankly.\nI was just shy, and he and his cousin came over and just said, hi, you know, we are Henry and George, and, uh, this is the firm we built, and tell us about you.\nI was so mortified, but so inspired by it.\nI love.\n\n\nThat. Uh, if KKR were a band, what genre would it be and who's the front man?\nListen, I love the opera. I love classical music. I love many things. But it's an orchestra, quite frankly, where the tuba player, the violinist, the busist, all of them are world class. But my job is to be the conductor and try to motivate everybody and bring them together as a team.\nWhat's one European startup you wish KKR had invested in?\nSpotify. I was the first institutional investor through the door. I just didn't have the fund to invest.\nOh, I know. But this is again, every failure you have in life is an opportunity. Um, you know, I learned from it. Uh, because of that, we did GetYourGuide, which is a fantastic success.\nNow, is there one that you said no to? Like you did have the chance.\nOh my god. Um, I have to hide now under the table. We literally at KKR, I had the chance to invest in Alibaba a long time ago, and that came on my desk, and I said no, big mistake.\nAh, that wasn't your desk, Philipp. That was someone else's desk. It was literally at that time kind of early angel kind of family KKR stuff, and I was the I was the maverick in terms of having done venture investing.\nWhat do you make of all venture firms coming into your field? Now you have Andreessen, your Lightspeed, your General Catalyst just eating the financial stack. Do you worry they're coming into your field?\nI think the industry is big. Everybody has its place. I have done venture myself to know that it's an entirely different uh, you know, skill set. So I'm not worried about it.\nFinal one, KKR 10 years from now and you in it. Where do you want to be? We said about kind of AUM, where do you want it to be in 10 years?\nVery important question. We have 670 billion under management now. This number will go up massively. But what I want to see, I think historically the kind of individual um retail type broad-based investor base is roughly 20%, maybe 30%, I want to see that to go to 50%. Just to have that spread of what we discussed before.\nUh, listen, Philipp, thank you so much for joining me. As I said, I've been looking forward to this one. So many good things from you, Hannah. So, thank you so much.\nYou're very welcome. It's great to be here.\n",
