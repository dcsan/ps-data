  "cleanText": "For the first time in our nation's history, a 30-year-old isn't doing as well as his or her parents were at 30. If a man hasn't cohabitated or been married by the time he's 30, there's a one in three chance he ends up a substance abuser. When a young man doesn't have the guardrails of a romantic relationship, he often times channels that energies into video games, porn, and conspiracy theory. If you want to score above your weight class economically and romantically, get out a big spoon. Get ready to eat [ __ ] Endure rejection.\nReady to go.\nListen,\n[Music]\nScott, I've wanted to do this one for a long time. So, thank you so much for joining me today.\nOh, you're so welcome.\nIt's good to be here.\nWhen we look at the biggest companies in the world, often considered the mag seven.\nWhat we're seeing is this kind of concentration of value in public markets. I really wanted this to be a free flowing discussion just cuz I bluntly respect your brain so much. But you see this concentration of value like we've almost never seen before. Does that worry you? And what does that mean for the future value dispersion in public markets in your mind? Oh, I think it's I think it's hugely worrying because you have essentially 34% of the S&amp;P is represented by seven companies and 50% of the equity value of the world and 70% of the enterprise value if include the debt is wrapped up in the US economy which has seven companies and any if any of those seven companies sneeze the whole economy and potentially the whole global economy catches a cold. In addition, it's very hard for small and medium-sized businesses to attract the kind of human and financial capital to be competitors. So, when you have the most valuable parts of our economy, e-commerce, one company does between 50 and 70% of all e-commerce, depending on how you categorize e-commerce. When you have social media as being kind of the most powerful thing to happen in traditional or, you know, what we refer to as media and one company is 75% share of social. when you have search 90% 89% and then you have AI the biggest revolution of the last you know several decades 90% of the processing has run through one company's GPUs and 85% of the queries have gone through one company I think a concentration of power and shareholder value makes a company or an economy less robust less diverse I think it's it's I think it's a I think it's yeah I think it's bad.\nCan I how does this pan out? Do we have $10 trillion companies with mag 7 or do we see the traditional bluntly cycle of companies of growth of sustenance and then decline and this is just another cycle?\nIt's an interesting question because some people would pay say that ultimately the market figures out and look look what's happening with Alphabet. Google is starting to lose share to open AI, right? And that eventually a competitor comes along, whether it's BYD and Tesla. But I would argue what happens between now and then. And that is um I think it is very difficult for companies like a lot of you know the retail landscape in the US has largely been decimated except for especially retail cuz Amazon could put for forward cheap capital and sell a dollar worth of products for 90 cents and starve out other e-commerce players. uh and I was one of those companies. So winning in our economy has become a function of establishing a great product, establishing the perception that you're the market leader such that you can attract cheaper capital and essentially overwhelm the competition with capital. At the end of World War II, the German army had better soldiers, better kill ratio, better tanks, better planes, better officers, but we because we cut off their supply routes, we had 38 gallons of gasoline for every one they did. So, we were able to overwhelm their superior Tiger tanks with our shitty Bradley tanks cuz we would just never get within firing distance and chase them around until they ran out of gasoline. Uh, and now the kind of the business strategy that has built a lot of the most valable companies in the world is just to overwhelm them with gasoline. Netflix can spend 18 billion. Netflix establishes itself as the streaming leader, accesses the public markets, has a fantastic story, accesses the cheapest capital in media. Time Warner, HBO can't compete with these guys. Disney can't compete because their shareholders have wrapped their lips around the crackpipe of profits and demand a certain level of operating margin which Netflix shareholders don't demand and they can spend $18 billion on content and no traditional media player can even come close. Amazon can make these staggering investments in supply chain that no other retailer can even come close. And so this has become sort of a you when you talk about brand building I think the most the greatest ROI in what you would call I don't know if it's brand building is communications and that is if you establish a reputation as the market leader and constantly put out press releases about your innovation and your leadership and you get that sort of that Pepsi generation Amazonian like feel and your stock gets bit up and then you use that cheap capital to start reinvesting or making acquisitions and you can literally pull away from the pack. So everything everywhere ends. There is no company that will be around. All of the the biggest companies in 1900 in the Dow. None of them are around. All of these companies will go away. But the question is that's not the right question. The question is between now and then would we have a more robust economy if we broke up Alphabet and YouTube was its own company? Would there be more jobs, more competition, more shareholder value, um less uh more choice such that parents wouldn't have to more advertisers wouldn't have to advertise through Meta and maybe go to a platform that offered more stringent child safety or age gating. So, I think competition is a good thing. And if you look at these companies when they're broken up, breakups are one of those few things in economic history that almost always work for almost everybody. The only person that loses is the CEO who wants to sit on the iron throne of all seven realms, not just Westeros.\nSo yeah, eventually all these companies will go away. But between now and then, I think we need to be more robust about antitrust.\nIf you start a cycle of breakups, why does it end?\nWell, you have thoughtful economists and people who said, for example, IPG and Omnicom, their merger was held up by the FTC. I think that's ridiculous overreach. And that's Elon Musk trying to get in the way of these companies through some [ __ ] notion that somehow they've formed a cartel to not advertise on X and is getting in the way of their merger when these are companies merging to survive. These companies are not a threat. They're not a compet they're not charging brands too much money or or have a monopsiny or suppliers. This is that was ridiculous. So there there are eras of overreach, but the number of FTC investigations has dramatically declined since the 70s and the 80s and very few mergers or acquisitions are blocked now. And I would argue so I I don't you have to have thoughtful, you know, well-compensated smart economists and um lawyers who look at this stuff and say, would we be better off if you know Amazon didn't have Instagram? Um, if it was an independent company, if these two weren't cooperating and coordinating, the largest search engine in the world is Google, the second largest is YouTube. Should they be cooperating and coordinating, or would the ecosystem be healthier, more profitable, more jobs, more tax revenue if these two were separate companies with their own uh objectives?\nDo you believe in government intervention?\nYeah, it's why we're not speaking German.\nThe government government intervenes all the time.\nBut but in like free market economies where we see situations like that. Do you believe in active government intervention?\nYeah, but it's a balance, right? I I don't I think one of the strengths of America is we have a tendency to have more of a wild west attitude and I think that is probably to heir on the side of too little regulation is probably better than too much regulation. that could loosely be defined or if you were to try and come up with three or four reductive reasons why the US has created so much more economic value than Europe. I think if you're intellectually honest you would say that in the US companies are allowed to ask for forgiveness not permission.\nAnd there's there's some value to that. There's also a downside and that is we have a 60% uptick in teen suicide in the US and I don't put it all at the hands of social or the feet of social media but it's definitely played a role and Europe is more thoughtful about you know what privacy regulations are right and I do think there is economic advantage to airing on the a lighter touch of regulation but it also comes with some externalities but again that's why we have a government and thoughtful people who can hopefully balance economic growth and innovation and risk and being aggressive and breaking some [ __ ] with also recognizing that okay Mark Zuckerberg and Shell Samber are lying to us to us that probably it doesn't make sense for a 12year-old to be spending 14 hours you know a day uh in the high school cafeteria known as Instagram. So I think it's a balance and I'm not sure I wonder if the EU is too regulated and America is not regulated enough and I feel like in your qu your question is pregnant with a comment.\nWhat do you think?\nI believe in minimal government intervention. I believe in Adam Smith's invisible hand. I think wherever I think I just see European regulation get in the way of so much innovation every single day as a venture investor and create labor challenges, innovation challenges, research and development ch it. So I think I'm stifled by innovation or by regulation on a daily basis which makes me negatively inclined.\nBut do you think at some point do you think thoughtful regul for example I think that we needed more regulation in crypto in the last administration to create just a level playing field. I feel like a lot of the more innovative companies in the crypto space just wanted a set of rules they know would hold that they could plan against. I completely agree and I think clarity is everything and I think it's where most governments fail to provide clear guidance as to what will happen in the future and that's all people want. I think I just don't have trust in the institutions that make these regulations which means that I don't want them.\nBut you are those institutions. You live in a democracy. You get to vote on who and what runs those institutions.\nI I do, but I don't get to vote in any way in terms of like who should be running. I think we both agree that the quality of politicians is very low.\nYeah. No, look, that's a fair point. But I I agree. I just wish there were better quality politicians.\nWhat I think needs upgrading is I think our our and no one likes to say this. I think it's our public that are [ __ ] idiots that don't think critically and don't look at the issues and don't vote for good candidates and don't cut through the noise in their social media are much more inclined to believe something bad about somebody as opposed to doing the hard work of really understanding the issues and voting for good candidates and being supportive and showing people a little bit more grace.\nUm, do you blame the public for that?\nLike when I I agree with you totally, but when you look at the knowledge inequality both in the US and the UK, I think the majority do not spend the time to do the work and then also fed massive misinformation which kind of feeds it in a challenging way.\nBut does one blame the public for the knowledge inequality?\nWell, you know, the world is what we make of it. I find that we always have this idolatry of the voter that oh, it's never the public's fault. And my sense is the public uh I I think in the US a lot of our problems stem from uh what is a lack of investment or underinvestment in K through 12 and that we aren't producing critical thinkers who understand not only the government don't understand how fortunate they are to live in a democracy. Don't appreciate America. Don't appreciate the rights and the freedoms and our victories that we should celebrate together. Don't um understand basic financial literacy. aren't encouraged to vote. I I I I get that government is bad and but you but the question is why aren't better people running? And the answer is whenever I talk to really good people that would like to run, they're like, &quot;Are you [ __ ] crazy? I would never put myself through that.&quot; And so why is that? Why have we made it so ugly and awful for good people to run? And because of the processes of getting impact, it is so difficult to make a change that you want to make. It's not the money. People like, I'll pay them more. It's never the money. That's It's always It is impossible to do what you want to do when in a position of power. I literally just interviewed a prime minister the other day and I said, &quot;What do you know now that you wish you'd known?&quot; And she said, &quot;Even when you're in the top seat, there's very little you can actually do.&quot;\nYeah. Look, that's fair. The the what we have in the US, though, I mean, it's it's interesting, right? I think that's largely true. But I think a lot of people would argue that a democracy is about having these these gears that never move too fast such that you have to be more thoughtful even at the cost of bureaucratic.\nI thought it was interesting you said that young people had a right to be angry or deserve to be angry.\nMhm.\nDo you stand by that when you think about that today or in your words there like you know it's the world that you make it?\nWell yeah but young people to a certain extent kind of inher inherit a world that is sort of set up for them by people before them. But in the US, and I'm not as familiar with this data, in the UK, maybe you are, for the first time in our nation's history, a 30-year-old isn't doing as well as his or her parents were at 30. And every year in the US, we spend $12 on seniors for every $1 we spend on kids. Um, the average 70-year-old in the US is 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. The average person under the age of 40 is 24% less wealthy. What seniors in the US have figured out is a way to vote themselves more money. And you could argue, well, if young people don't vote, that's going to continue. But children aren't allowed to vote. And every year, uh, young people transfer $1.3 trillion in the form of social security payments to the wealthiest generation in the history of\n\n\nThe planet, seniors.\nSo when you see the cost of education, the cost of housing skyrocketing, when you see massive prosperity, and then it's rubbed in your face every day, 210 times a day, you're kind of reminded that you're not on a Gulfstream or partying in St. arts, and it makes you feel bad about yourself.\nMeanwhile, you just see the unbelievable economic growth and prosperity, but it doesn't appear that young people are sharing in it to the same extent.\nUm, and 40 years ago, 60% of 30-year-olds had one child at least.\nNow it's 27%.\nIt's because they've decided they don't want kids, or maybe they just can't afford them.\nSo when, and I'll just when institutions like mine at NYU take pleasure in creating artificial scarcity, so we don't let in as many kids as we could, such that we can drive up the cost of tuition faster than inflation and pay ourselves more for less accountability, and then we let people who own homes implement zoning and NIMBY policies that make it very difficult for young people to afford a home, I think young people have a genuine, legitimate claim that the economy is not working for them, and the incumbents, specifically people my age, have weaponized government to transfer money from them to us.\nWhat do you think is the core way that they have weaponized government to work for you?\nAnd what would you say is the best way to reverse that?\nWell, the tax code, it's the boring [ __ ] that moves the needle.\nSo, I make most of my money buying and selling stocks and companies.\nAnd we've decided that people who can do that should pay a lower tax rate.\nAnd the people that can do that are old and rich.\nOld people make, old wealthy people make their money from buying and selling assets.\nYoung people make their money from salary and working.\nWhy am I paying 22% and the top income earner on current income is paying 37%?\nThe second biggest tax deduction is mortgage interest rate.\nOld people own homes, young people rent.\nWhy is, why is the primary cost, the biggest cost for old people tax-deductible, but the biggest cost for young people is not?\nSo even the two biggest tax deductions are just a transfer of wealth from the young to the old.\nSo I think it starts with tax policy.\nUm, essentially, um, social security tax.\nI pay, I make a lot of money.\nI pay every year $9,000 in social security because it taps out at 6% up until 160 grand.\nAn analyst working for me that makes 160 also pays 9 grand.\nSo if you look at the tax code in the US, and I apologize for deferring to the US, but I just know more about it, the tax code's gone from 400 pages to 4,000.\nAnd those incremental 3,600 pages are basically full of loopholes for corporations and the wealthy to get wealthier and wealthier.\nSo some solutions, I think you should eliminate the capital gain.\nI think we should have one tax code, and it's AMT, it's non-negotiable, and call it 30%.\n30%, you make over 100 grand a year, you pay 30%, you make over a million bucks a year, you pay 50%, which sounds like a lot, but Daniel Kahneman's research has shown above a million dollars, you don't get any incremental happiness.\nWhereas if you have universal childcare or Medicare, it, and you can take a household's average income from 30,000 to 40,000, it's a huge leap in happiness.\nSo an alternative minimum tax for corporations and the wealthy, a tax holiday for people under the age of 30, more vocational programming that helps create more on-ramps for young men that have been sequestered from them in an information age, um, national service, mandatory national service so young people can find friends, mentors, and mates, more third tax credits for third places so people can find places to meet each other instead of swiping.\nI think there's a lot of things we could do to um, reverse this really awful trend of obesity, anxiety, and depression among uh, young adults.\nWe, we said there's so many elements with every statement you say that I want to unpack.\nYou said about children uh, and people kind of delaying the decision to have children and then kind of merging that with the angry.\nI have so many female friends who are 35 to 40 who are partners at law firms, partners at venture firms, great high, well-paid jobs.\nThey've crushed it, and they're angry, Scott.\nThey're told, \"Hey, I've been told for a decade that work is the most important thing.\nCareer, career, career, and actually I'm sitting here now where my eggs are not what they used to be.\nMy fertility is not what it used to be.\nAnd I feel like I was misadvised by the system.\"\nWhat would you say to them?\nI think economic security is really important, and I mean, so I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died as a secretary, and the biggest source of stress in our life, quite frankly, Harry, was we just didn't have enough money, and it was very, in a capitalist society in America, when you don't have a lot of money, even as a kid, I remember registering these little things, it's like a ghost is following you around telling you you're not worthy, like I literally felt like there was this ghost following me and my mom around saying you're not worthy.\nAnd, and I think poor people get those messages every day.\nAnd I think if you're a poor woman or a woman who doesn't have a lot of economic prospects, I think that's an ugly place to be.\nSo I don't fault those women for wanting to excel academically and engage in the fruits of a capitalist society and develop economic security.\nI, I'm not sure I would advise them to have done anything different.\nThe hard part is if you're going to have an honest conversation about mating, you have to have an honest conversation.\nAnd it's the following.\nThe guy that takes that route and becomes a baller at a law firm becomes sexy, right?\nYou make more money, you're more attractive as a man.\nYou make more money as a woman, you're just a woman making more money.\nAnd so the, the, the sort of increase in mating opportunities for men who get more successful is exponential.\nThe increase in mating opportunities for women as they become more financially viable is just flat.\n75% of women say economic viability is hugely important in a mate.\nIt's only 25% of men.\nSo, we have this kind of weird externality where as women become more successful, it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean they become more attractive to the opposite sex.\nBut what we also have is that as women become more economically successful, their pool of viable mates goes down because women mate socioeconomically horizontally and up, men horizontally and down, and women, if you will, the metaphor, uh, I'm a fan of this podcast called Modern Wisdom from Chris Williamson.\nHe calls it the high heels effect, and that is the majority of women will not date a man shorter than them.\nDistinctive what they say that dating apps show that majority of women will not date a guy shorter than them.\nEconomically women are getting taller every year and men are getting shorter.\nSo when we say, when you hear people all the time say, I know all these wonderful, attractive, high-character women, and they can't find a man.\nThey can find a man.\nThey just can't find a man they want to mate with because men aren't doing well.\nAnd as a result, there's a mismatch in attraction.\nAnd that is the pool of viable mates of horizontal and up for women who are doing well is shrinking.\nBecause a woman who's a partner in a law firm isn't interested in dating a guy who's a high school dropout and is a mechanic and maybe making 60,000 a year, and she's making 600,000 a year.\nWhereas, if a guy's making $600,000 a year and a woman in PR is making $60,000 a year and she's attractive, th, those are considered viable mates.\nI saw that you spoke recently about the kind of radicalizational antagonism within young men when it comes to the amount of swipes correlated to the amount of coffees on Tinder and dating apps.\nCan you talk to me about how you think about kind of male rejection through dating apps and how that leads to antagonism tension against more things than just dating?\nA common thread through history is that the greatest innovation in history is not the iPhone or the semiconductor or vaccines.\nIt's the American middle class.\nAnd you had this huge body of educated, progressive, um, populace who was productive and created so much tax revenue and so many rights, and it became just this, this anomaly because typically the way societies work is that a small number of men get all the mating opportunities.\nThat has, how that's been the natural order of things is that a very successful man has multiple, can be basically engage in polygamy.\nAnd at the end of World War II, we brought home 7 million men from overseas.\nThey were in uniform.\nThey had demonstrated heroism.\nWe put a ton of money in their pockets who VH loans, national construction, highway construction act.\nOur manufacturing base was unbelievable.\nAnd there were a ton of middle class, and basically we created a ton of very attractive men that women were attracted to, and we had the kind of middle class, two-car, you know, home, and the homes were so productive and so successful, they thought, let's bring women and non-whites into this prosperity, and they created a huge tax base, educated populace.\nAnd what we have now is, I think we're reverting to the way mo, the majority of history is, and that is a small number of men who can demonstrate wealth or signal wealth online, whether it's through a Rolex or through slipstreaming into the information age economy, can have a date every night.\nIf there's 50 men on Tinder and 50 women on Tinder, 46 of the women will show all of their attention exclusively to just four men, leaving 46 men to fight over four women.\nAnd the scariest stat I saw, I think you referenced, is that in order to get one coffee, a man of average attractiveness on a dating app has to swipe right or try and connect with 200 women to get one coffee.\nAnd then if he's fortunate enough to get five coffees, which took a thousand swipes, four of those five coffees will reconsider and ghost him and either not show up or cancel.\nAnd what this creates is a lot of resentment among men of average attractiveness.\nAnd then they become much more prone to misogynistic content, much more prone to nationalistic content.\nAnd this is a story as old of time.\nIf you talk about kid, young men who've been radicalized throughout history, generally they have a lack of romantic and economic opportunities.\nAnd so what I see is a group of men who women find undatable, not economically or emotionally viable.\nAnd when a woman doesn't have a romantic relationship, she tends to channel that additional energy into much more productive things, her friend network, and her professional life.\nWhen a young man doesn't have the guardrails of a romantic relationship, he often times channels that energies into video games, porn, and conspiracy theory.\nAnd back to your point about women feeling like they screwed up.\nWhat the data shows is distinct of the kind of the trope of the woman who's lonely and ends up with cats, who's a partner at a law firm and is miserable, the majority of the data shows that actually men benefit more from relationships than women.\nThat widows are happier after their husband dies and widowers are less happy.\nThat men actually get more from a relationship than women.\nAnd so the absence of relationships, the absence of young people hooking up and mating and committing to each other actually has more downside impact on men.\nIf a man hasn't cohabitated or been married by the time he's 30, there's a one in three chance he ends up a substance abuser.\nAnd men really need guard rails.\nWhat I, I, I think young men, I think there's a lot of data that shows that while they're physically stronger, they're actually emotionally and mentally weaker than women.\nAnd without the guardrails of a romantic relationship or strong male involvement or or a strong culture and a good job, they're much more prone to substance abuse.\nThey're much more prone to um, risk aggressive activities, including gambling.\nThey're much more prone to lower their risk aggression and find their friends through Reddit or Discord, jobs, or trying to make money through crypto or stock trading.\nAnd, and instead of going through the pain of trying to, like, you're a good-looking guy, you care about the way you look, you care about your career.\nYou signal a lot of very positive things that take a lot of work and energy.\nAnd I worry a lot of men are not making those efforts because they think, why make those efforts?\nWhy go through that when I just have porn?\nSo, I worry a lot about um, young men and the lack of opportunities for creating a middle class through what I would hope is economically and emotionally viable men.\nI think remote work is a disaster for young people.\nI think they need to meet each other, learn how to read the room.\nI think a close second is the anti-alcohol movement.\nAnd I think the risks to a 25-year-old liver of alcohol are dwarfed by social isolation.\nAnd when I was your age, I was drinking a lot.\nAnd it helped me find friends.\nAnd it helped me find potential romantic partners.\nAnd as I got older and I got more serious about my career, I wound down my substances because like you, I said, \"All right, [ __ ] just got real.\"\nFor me, it was my, my mom got sick.\nI didn't have enough money.\nIt was very humiliating for me.\nSo I thought I need to get really, really serious about my career, and that involved a lot of things in my control, including dramatically reducing my consumption of alcohol and THC.\n6% of kids are teenagers are clinically addicted to alcohol or drugs.\n24% are addicted to social media.\nSo I jokingly say, put down your phone, go out, drink more, and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off.\nAnd when I, if you ask people to reverse engineer their closest friendships and their learnings around dating and romantic opportunities, did alcohol play a role in that?\nAlmost everyone says yes.\nAnd then you say, was it a positive or a negative?\nThey're thoughtful, and they slow down.\nMost of them say it was a positive.\nAnd I worry that that this anti-alcohol movement is, and people at home with Netflix, people at home, uh, because it's gotten so expensive to go out, that people aren't bumping off one another.\nAnd if someone had said to me, here on a dating app is a list of the attributes in a picture of who ultimately I ended up mating with, I would have never chosen them.\nBut it was being in the presence of them, getting to know them at work, hanging out with them in a friend group or a sports league, having an opportunity for me to demonstrate excellence.\nIf you talk to people who've been married longer than 30 years, 80% of them say one was much more interested in the other at the beginning.\nAnd it was always the man was more interested in the woman.\nWomen have a much finer filter for mating because there's so much more downside.\n\n\nTo sex\nthan there is for a man. But where\ndo young men have an opportunity to\ndemonstrate excellence? So, they're all\non the dating apps and all of a sudden\nit's about height and perceived resources.\nAnd so, you've seen this trend on\nTikTok where they say, \"All right,\ndescribe your minimum height and your\nminimum income. 6 feet, six figures.\"\nThat's 2.6% of the population of people\nwho aren't married, aren't obese, or\nunder the age of 50. Whereas, when you\ntalk to married couples, they're like,\n\"Yeah, I wasn't interested, but he was\nso good at what he did at work that I\nfell in love with him. I was at temple\nwith him and I saw how kind he was to\nhis parents and I fell in love with him.\nWe were in guitar class together and I\nliked his hands.\" Where does a young man\ndemonstrate excellence these days?\nSocial media\nand then it comes down to hiding money\nand basically trying to create or trying\nto be someone that you're not.\nExactly. Most of my feed is Scorpios or\nsome [ __ ] MKOS club where the Rolex\nis on and it's like\nwith my filter that\ngives me a six-pack and here I am on my\njet. By the way, anyone who takes a\npicture of a jet does not own that jet,\nyou know? So, I worry that and we're\ncreating unreasonable expectations for\nyoung people around what it means to be\nsuccessful. And also,\ndid you always\nknow who you were? I know this sounds\nlike a weird one, but I've done what\nI've been doing since I was 17. So, I've\nnever really had adulthood without\nbluntly running my business. So, I don't\nreally know who I am. It's why I never\ngo on holiday because you're forced to\nreflect on life. And I don't really want\nto reflect on life without work because\nI don't know who I am. Did you know\nwho you were? Did you learn who you were\nfrom tough times, good times?\nIt's an\ninteresting question. I think you're\nbeing hard on yourself. I think you've\ndecided that you're First off, it sounds\nlike you're very blessed and that you\nknew what you wanted to do at a young\nage. At 17, I thought, you know, when I\nwas very young, I thought I was going to\nbe an athlete. At 17, I thought I was\ngoing to be a pediatrician.\nAt 22, I thought I was going to be an\ninvestment banker. And then by 24, I was\nliving with my mother and had no idea\nwhat I was going to do. So, you're sort\nof blessed that you had that kind of\nfocus and drive at such an early age.\nThat's a gift. And I don't think there's\nanything wrong with kind of similar to\nyou once I got going and got some\nprofessional traction. I, my entire\nself-worth and identification was\nthrough my professional success or lack\nthereof. That's how I identify who I am.\nThat's where I get my confidence. And\nthen when I finally got to economic\nsecurity, I thought,\n\"All right, I need\nWhat was economic security for you?\"\nYeah. I had a number two and I just I\nwrote a book on financial security. For\nme, it was like I wanted to assume that\n4% of my number would give me passive\nincome that would be way more than I\nneeded to live well. My number was\n150 million because I thought it\nwould be hard for me to spend half a\nmillion dollars a month although I\nfigured out how and 4% of 150 million is\n6 million half a million dollars a\nmonth. I got there about 10 years ago\nand I started thinking about and I'm\nvery open about money because I think\nwhen rich people don't talk about money\nit's an accidental or purposeful\nmeans of keeping lower middle-income\npeople down. If you want to be great at\ntennis you should talk a lot about\ntennis. Young people need to speak\nto each other about money, their fears,\ntheir anxieties. It's helpful. I was\nvery stressed out about money when I was\nyour age. I didn't have a lot of it. So,\nI think it's really productive,\neducational, and cathartic to talk about\nmoney. But when I got to my number, I\nwas still very ambitious. I got all of\nmy self-worth through money. My friends,\nmy mating opportunities, and\nall the incredible experiences, and my\npower came through money. So, I just\nnaturally assumed that the more money I\nhave, the more of those things I'm going\nto have. And then I had a couple fairly\nclose friends pass away unexpectedly.\nThat happens you're young. When you hit\n50, you'll lose a couple friends\nrandomly. Like strange genetic time\nbombs just go off and you'll have a\nfriend die of six months leukemia or\nsome rare nerve disease. And it does\ninspire some pause or it did in me. And\nI thought to myself, I was in the midst\nof raising a private equity fund because\nI thought, you know what, just deep down\nI want to be a billionaire. Scott\nGalloway billionaire had a really nice\nring to it. And I thought I need to get\nto a billion. And I raised some money or\nI got some money commitment. And then I\nhad some losses in my personal life. And\nI thought, why on earth do I need to be\na billionaire? I can do anything I want.\nAnd so a huge unlock for me was\nfinancially deciding, okay, and I do\nthis every year. I look at my number. I\nknow kind of pretty much how much I'm\nnot worth. Goldman. They give me a\nnumber every year. And anything above my\nnumber, I either spend it or I give it\naway. I love to spend money. I'm really\ngood at it. And I'm an indulgent person.\nI do crazy fun things. And then anything\nthat's left, I give away because I think\nhoarding wealth is a virus. And I think\nit can train you to do the wrong things\nand focus on the wrong things. And then\nI thought, okay, I need a new purpose.\nMy purpose used to be to establish\neconomic security so I could take care\nof my mom, have fun, be interesting, be\nimportant, find a mate, take care of my\nkids. And I thought, I need a new\npurpose in my life. And I really spent a\nlot of time thinking, what is my\npurpose? And tried to establish a new\npurpose other than just being really rich\nand a baller, which had been my purpose\nup until the age of like, you know, call\n45, 48. But what you're going through,\nit sounds to me like you've been very\nsuccessful. You professionally identify\nyourself and when you get to your\nnumber, what I think is really helpful\nis to say, \"Okay, money is the ink in my\npen. It can write new chapters. It can\nmake certain chapters burn brighter, but\nit's not my story.\" And so to really\nthink about what is my story? What is my\npurpose? No one's going to remember you\nin three generations, but in one, what\nwould you like them to say about you,\nright? What would you like other than he\nwas really successful, which it sounds\nlike you are, what are the second and\nthird things you would like them to say\nabout you? I think it's a very healthy\nprocess to go through. I went through it\nand it's given me.\nWhat would you like\nthe next generation to say about you if\nI were to turn that on you?\nWell, I want\nto be known I think about what are the\nthree things you want your tombstone. I\nwant to be known as generous patriot and\ndad. My purpose now is I want to raise\npatriotic loving men. You know, I have\ntwo kids, two boys. Do you have kids?\nNo, I don't.\nSo once you have kids,\neverything kind of changes. And that for\nme has given me purpose. It's given me a\nsense of, okay, that's why I'm here. I'm\nhere to produce two men who are\ngenerous, loving, kind, patriotic young\nmen. That has given me a sense of\npurpose and it's it's a nice grounding\nfor me. And I'm good at it. I don't\nthink I'm great at it, but I know I'm\ngood at it. And it gives me a sense of\ncomfort and being such that I'm just not\nconstantly thinking about how I get more\nAUM and go buy a company or something\nlike that. What would you say to me\nwho's scared about having kids whilst\nmaintaining being like top performance\nin work? Like kids are t My brother has\na child. It's knackering. They cry at\nnight. You have to give them time,\nemotion, love. I can just be ruthlessly\nselfish right now. To what extent do\nkids impact performance?\nHow old are\nyou?\n29.\nI see your kid. So, look at the\nage of 29 with a little bit of money\nliving in a city or a good-looking guy,\nyou're going to have a series of empty,\nmeaningless experiences. But as far as\nempty, meaningless experiences go,\nthey're going to be pretty good. So, I'm\nnot sure you need to be in a hurry to\nget married. What I would say to you\nthough is that for most men, kids are\nmotivating professionally because you\nrealize it's no longer just about you\nand you need to think longer term. You\nneed to be thoughtful. You need to maybe\npull in your horns a little bit. If you\nhit it big, diversify a little bit. You\nstart finding reward in different\nthings. Reward in raising kids with a\ncompetent partner is really rewarding.\nLike watch I would didn't I was not in\nlove with my kid when it came rotating\nout of my girlfriend. I thought the\nwhole thing was gross and weird and\nall I felt was fear that I wasn't making\nenough money. So it wasn't like angel\nsinging and bright lights everywhere.\nBut you fall in love with your kids and\nthen it gives you a sense of purpose.\nGet it was very motivating for me. I was\nmaking just enough money to go to St.\nparts and date and give the perception\nof wealth and success. And I wasn't\nmotivated to do more than that because I\ndidn't have kids. Once I had kids, I'm\nlike, \"Okay, it's no longer about me. I\ngot to make a lot more money.\" I found\nit very motivating. And also, there's\nsomething comforting. I don't know if\nyou're going through this, but when I\nwas single and making good money,\nbasically Thursday and Friday was about\nlining up fabulous experiences with\nfabulous people on Saturday and Sunday.\nAnd it was like I was like a a monster\nor a dragon that could never be sad. I\nwanted more money, more experiences,\nmore incredible\nuh events, hotter women, more sex, more\nevents, hotter women, more interesting\nevents, more money was never enough. It\nwas like, I want more. I want [ __ ]\nmore. And having kids for me, and I\ndidn't want kids. I was forced to have\nkids because my partner basically said,\nI'm out of here unless we're having\nkids. But now I do have moments where my\nboys bomb into the room and we're\nwatching some show or football and they\nthrow their legs over mine naturally\njust sort of instinctively and the dogs\nroll in and that's like the only time in\nmy life I've ever thought okay this is\nit. This is enough. I don't I can't\nimagine\nnicer kids. I can't I just can't imag.\nBut what I would tell you, and I think\nthere's research here, is that if you\nhave economic security and you can find\na competent partner, having kids is just\nan incredibly\nit's the most rewarding thing I've ever\ndone by a long shot. And I didn't want\nkids. And also professionally, I found\nit very motivating. So the notion that\nsomehow it's going to slow you down, no,\nI think my guess is, and I don't know\nyou, but my guess is that's [ __ ] uh\nto excuse the fact that you're still in\na arrested adolescent stage having a lot\nof fun and have at it.\nBut what's\nchallenging there is how do you know\nwhen you found the right person? And\nwhat I mean by that is like no one is\never going to tick all of the boxes.\nHow\ndo you know when to settle with\ncompromise versus look for perfection?\nOh, I don't know. I I I think everyone's\ndifferent, but for me it was but for me\nit was willing to throw up the deck of\ncards that was my life and let them land\nanywhere because I didn't want to lose\nthis person. I had no desire to have\nkids and this person made it clear to me\nthat okay if you don't want kids I get\nit but we're I need to move on because I\nwant to have kids and so I was willing\nto reconfigure my life because the idea\nof not having that person in my life was\nreally upsetting to me. So that you know\nthat either happens or it doesn't. The\nhard part is as you get older you become\nmore set in your ways. But I I would\nimagine what happens to the majority of\nus will happen to you and that is you'll\nmeet someone and you'll decide that the\nsacrifices\nuh are worth maintaining that person in\nyour life. I think that's gen I don't\nthink any guy ever decides I mean this\nis terrible. I think most men who are\nsuccessful like the optionality of not\nbeing committed or married or having\nkids and then I think what happens a lot\nis your partner's not up for that and\nand and basically says okay it's\ndecision time and you make that decision\nand then hopefully you you look back and\nthink that was a good idea that was the\nright decision.\nHow many of your\nextremely successful billionaire friends\nhave great family lives?\nI asked my\nmother on a walk the other day. She said\nto me, \"What gets worse with money?\" And\nI said, \"The only thing I can think of\nis family.\"\nI don't know. Actually, the\nmajority of really wealthy people I\nknow, I think there's a bit of a cartoon\nthat wealthy people are crawled over the\nsort of Bernie Sanders. I don't know how\nmuch you know about American politics.\nSure.\nThis Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth\nWarren, that all billionaires crawled\nover people to get there. I have\ngenerally found the wealthiest people I\nknow, I probably know maybe, I don't\nknow, a dozen billionaires. Generally,\nwhat I found is that they're really good\npeople. And the key to being a\nbillionaire is establishing allies along\nthe way. And that is people put them in\na room of opportunity even when they're\nnot in that room because they're really\nhigh character good people. So I think\nthe cartoon of Monty Burns starting the\nnuclear power plant and being a weirdo\nand mean. I don't find that's true. I\nfind that the majority of really wealthy\npeople I know are generally speaking,\nespecially ones who are self-made,\ngenerally speaking, are high character\npeople. Now they're aggressive and can\nbe brash or whatever, but generally I\ngenerally find they're high character\npeople and also\nuh pretty good family men. Um you know\nthere's the you know sometimes married\nmore than once but generally speaking um\ngood family people. And so I don't I\ndon't know if it's\n\n\nProximity bias. I got lucky with some of the people I know, but I have found that the unhappy billionaire who has a shitty relationship with his kids and has been married five times, that I find that's mostly a cartoon. There's so much anxiety injected into relationships when you don't have enough money that those are the people that have really dysfunctional families. So my experience has been that actually wealthy people are both of high character, generally speaking, and generally speaking, have pretty good partnerships and pretty healthy families.\n\nHave you ever felt as a father like you didn't meet the grade?\n\nThere was a period where you didn't meet the grade, you weren't performing like you should have been, and you let them down as a father.\n\nOh, I feel that almost every day. I hugely... the two people that make me more insecure than anyone in my life are my boys. Like, someday, every day I wonder, do my boys like me? And then what you recognize in a moment of clarity as a dad is like, they're not necessarily supposed to like you. You're not supposed to be their friend. You're supposed to be their dad.\n\nAnd I handle situations incorrectly. I overparent. I underparent. I know I'm a good dad, but I aspire to be a great dad. And I still don't think I'm there yet. It is something I have not figured out. I'm hugely insecure around my fathering. Uh, it's something I struggle with. I have a kid who's applying to college. He's taking the ACT. I don't know how to thread the needle between telling him it's go time. Success is about knowing when to turn on the jets. This is that time. And at the same time, not putting too much pressure on a 17-year-old who is already like studying all these subjects, trying to make the football team, get his IB scores up, you know, get home on time. I mean, so I struggle. The position I find most rewarding, but also the people I'm most insecure around in a weird way are my sons. So, I think I just decided that's part of it. I maybe dads... there maybe there are some dads who just like think, \"Oh yeah, I'm a great dad.\" No doubt about it. But yeah, I, I, I struggle with what it means to be a good dad and how to manage it.\n\nDid you have a good relationship with your father?\n\nUh, this is very interesting cheap therapy. Um, the... No, I mean, my dad was fairly absent. My dad left us. My dad's been married. My dad was handsome, strong jawline and a Scottish accent, which meant in 70s Southern California, could not only think with his dick, he could listen to it. He's been married and divorced four times.\n\nAnd as far as we know, and he's on his fifth wife, which is a woman I basically pay to be his kind of home health aid. Um, and he let you know, he... he basically started his third marriage while I was still married to my mom, left, moved to Ohio. It was a different age. It was the 70s. Kids were sort of like, uh, furniture. They... we didn't revolve our lives around kids back then. So, I saw him, uh, uh, holidays and summers. So, we weren't... he wasn't very involved in my life. Um, but where I have forgiven my dad, and I'll put the question back to you about your relationship with your father, was a big unlock for me was I think we have an evolutionary obligation to just be a better dad than our dad was to us. And my dad was... my dad was physically abused by his alcoholic father. And when I recognize how his father treated him, he was actually very good to me. And that means he checked a box. And then the biggest unlock... I used to resent my father and have trouble, you know, sometimes being nice to him, was I... one of my biggest unlocks was recognizing like, try and imagine what kind of son you want to be. Imagine what kind of friend you want to be. Imagine what kind of boss you want to be. Imagine what kind of partner, romantic partner you want to be, boyfriend, and live up to that standard as opposed to doing what I did all the time. And I managed my relationships like transactions where if I wasn't getting as much back for my emotional dollar, I no longer continue to patronize that establishment. And there's a problem with that because you'll always inflate your contribution to the relationship and minimize theirs. So I found it just much easier to say, \"What kind of son do I want to be? I want to be a generous, loving son that's really good to my dad.\" And the moment I just said, \"That's my benchmark.\" Not trying to measure, well, am I a better son than he was a dad to me? Could he have been better? And I'm angry. I just found that such an incredible unlock.\n\nSo, you're willing to still be giving even if it's not maybe deserved or aren't.\n\nYeah. Because that I feel like that's the whole [ __ ] point. That's the shooting match. You want to die. Like, ideally, like I was a better son than my dad was to me. I was a wonderful husband. I was so wonderful to my kids. I got a lot of joy back from them. But on a balanced scorecard, I'm still in the net positive. I think that's the whole point is to leave.\n\nYou don't agree with cut out people from your life who are negative energies, who are negative forces.\n\nOh, sure. You don't... don't be... I mean, I shed friends all the time. I shed relationships.\n\nYou know, what I used to be focused on business. You're... you're... it sounds like you're in, uh, you're in finance. It gets pretty brutal sometimes. And I've been, in my opinion, sort of not abused, but treated poorly by business partners, venture capitalists, and I... I get... I struggle with anger. I thought I'm going to serve this guy a cold lunch someday, and it rent lives rent free in my head. And one of my mentors, Hamid Mogadam, said to me, um, he said, the best... he's like, you really want to get at this guy was a VC, the most powerful VCs in the world washed me out of my stake in my company, kicked me off the board. He's like, you really want to get back at him? I'm like, yeah, what are we going to do? And he's like, \"Lead a [ __ ] amazing life. That is the best revenge.\"\n\nAnd so, if I don't... if I have a bad business partnership, something I'm proud of, I have never sued or been sued by anybody. If I have a bad relationship with someone or I feel like I've been wronged, I just don't work with them again. There are some friends in my life that slowly but surely I just do a slow fade from. I don't... I've never been tolerate an abusive relationship romantically. But generally with your important relationships, I think a healthy way to approach it is just say, I'm going to put away the scorecard and I'm going to focus on this aspiration of the kind of person I want to be in this relationship and hold yourself to that.\n\nCan I ask, how did your relationship with your father change how you are as a father?\n\nYour parents still together?\n\nNo.\n\nUm, do you have a good relationship with your mother?\n\nAmazing.\n\nAnd do you feel that some of that is that when your mom and dad broke up that you've held your... what I did was I held... I sanctified my mom. My mom took care of me. She was in my mind and died early. So in my mind, she was this saint and my dad was that guy off banging a stewardess from Continental Airlines who didn't spend... didn't show up for my soccer games and abandoned me. That's how I saw it. And the reality is it wasn't that black and white. And my mom to a certain extent, unwittingly maybe, kind of turned me against my father a little bit unfairly. And so as I've gotten older, I realized that nothing is black and white, that people aren't perfect. But you... you are in a situation now where you just have to decide where would you get the most reward in terms of your relationship with your father. An amazing relationship with your mother goes a long way. I had an amazing relationship with my mother. And when someone... I'm convinced that when someone tells you, and I... I trust and hope your mom did this for you, when someone tells you you're wonderful and loves you every day, you begin to believe it. And that's what my mom gave me. But in terms of the takeaway from my dad in terms of what I've decided to do, I just try to spend a lot of time with my kids. I don't believe in quality time. I think that's a concept invented by wealthy people with no time who don't want to spend that much time with their kids and pretend they're good dads. I find the most important time with your kids, and you... you have some time to figure this out, is what I call garbage time. And that is the really amazing moments with your kids happen unpredictably. You're on your way to... you're driving them to school and they're not looking at you and they're like, \"Dad, I like this girl.\" And you're like, \"Okay.\" And you don't say anything cuz those moments don't come very often. And you just let them talk and you don't look at them for fear you're going to intimidate them. And you have like one of those nice moments with your son. And the only way you get to those moments is by spending a lot of time with them because they just happen totally randomly. But the way I have tried to overcompensate, the thing that really was rough for me with my father is my dad just wasn't around a lot. So I just want to be every day at 9:00 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time, no matter where my kids are, one of my kids is at tennis camp in Florida, one is at boarding school. At at 9:00 p.m. I call my oldest. At 9:15 I call my youngest. And a lot of times they block my call or they're unavailable. But I know when they're older, they're going to go be like, \"Yeah, dad was self-absorbed and into his own thing and flew off the handle sometimes, but called me every day. Called me every day, no matter what.\" So, you'll... I what I would say is just take from your father the things that upset you and try and correct those for the next generation, right? Try and try and compensate and and and make sure that you don't fall into that same trap.\n\nDid you find that money changed the relationships around you?\n\nMy father's 95 and not doing well. So, I can say this because he... he's like a baby now. He has no... he's... he's basically just, you know, like a baby, has no cognitive. He's not there any longer. My dad loves me more than my sister because I have more money than her. My dad was raised in depression era Scotland and was so obsessed with money because if you lived in Glasgow in the 30s and 40s, you could starve if you didn't have money. And he had some very weird things happen to him. He was in the Navy for two years. Sent his money home because he got his money stolen his first two weeks on a ship. Sent all of his money home to his mother. Came home and his mom had spent it on whiskey and cigarettes. So my dad just had a very unhealthy relationship with money and it scarred him. And it scarred me cuz my dad was that guy who I would... he'd be in town for the weekend and he'd take me and my friend to go see a movie and then he'd lined up... he'd ask my friend for two bucks at the end of the movie to pay him back for the ticket. You know, the closest my father ever came to physical violence was when we went to a hotel and I'd never seen anything called a mini bar before, and I decided that I should eat and drink everything in the mini bar. So, he had a very unhealthy relationship with money. And the reason he came to be really impressed with me was cuz I made a lot of money. And that that's fine. I just recognize it for what it is. But for the most part, it's been a real nice thing in my relationships. It helped me take care of my mom, which was one of my objectives. And probably the most rewarding thing about making some money was I was able to take care of my mom towards the end. It takes an absence. It removes stress from your life in terms of your kids and your partner. So on the whole, it's been a really... it's been a really wonderful thing for me. I... I enjoy it and feel like I'm good at it.\n\nUm, you don't feel that way.\n\nI do, but I do feel that people treat me differently now than they used to. People don't argue with me as much. People stop talking when I talk. Uh, when it comes to kind of family decisions, my voice matters much more than anyone else's. Why? Because I'll pay for it.\n\nYeah.\n\nThere's... And but even the fact that you're self-aware enough to know that, you know, I'm on constant editorial calls and the majority of my team is 24, 25, and someone will disagree with me or say something rude and I'm like, I'm going to self fire that [ __ ]. I get angry because I have such a big ego. And then what I realized with just a few minutes of reflection is it's really important you keep those people around you because you can start to believe your own press and start to believe that. And that's also one of the wonderful things about kids. Your kids are not impressed by your professional success at all, at all. As a matter of fact, they're not... they're totally unimpressed with you. Like, dad is lame. I'm literally the uncoolest person in the world in their eyes. Uh, but I definitely agree with you. Once you have money, people laugh at your jokes, people find you interesting, people want to know you, and it can lead to bad places. I have found as I got... as I've gotten older, I don't make as much of an effort with people. I went to this thing at the Tate last night, one of these fancy galas, and I'm so used to everyone wanting to know me and starting conversations with me. And I was sitting with these artists, and I thought, I need to be less arrogant. I need to be more friendly and not expect everyone just to be like asking me questions and wanting to know more about me just because I have money. And so maintaining... finding people in a practice that keeps you somewhat humble and grounded is really important. But even the fact you even recognize that means you're well ahead of where I was at your age.\n\nCan I ask, do you feel like the public snippets, the media...\n\n\nTikToks and reels that go around of you are a representation of who you, Scott, are?\n\nLike, just being transparent, I loved your content coming into this, why I wanted to do this show, but the person that I'm interviewing now is completely different in an incredible way to the image I had of you.\nDo you feel like the image is not aligned to who you are?\n\nNo, it's an aspect of me.\nSo, I'm an introvert.\nI'm happiest after an edible at night alone with my dogs, knowing my kids are safe, uh, riding and and just being alone.\nAnd when people meet me, they're generally disappointed.\nThey think I'm going to be some fascinating guy full of interesting, you know, data interspersed with dick jokes.\nI'm an introvert.\nI'm fairly intense.\nAnd so that side of me is a a reflection or a personality or a side of my personality, but it's not it's not me.\nAnd also, um, social is the algorithms just love moments where you're making a puncturing statement or someone's calling you out.\nUm, but no, it's not I don't feel like I don't think anybody who knows me, I don't know if you feel this way, would say, \"Oh, yeah, that's that's who that person is.\"\nI try to be authentic.\nI try not to put on an act, but there's no doubt about it when the cameras go on and, you know, it's showtime.\nIt's not I I my favorite thing is to be around my kids and not say a word and just listen to them and just be in the company of people.\nMy partner consistently has to ask, encourage me.\nIt's like, make conversation for God's sakes, you're so [ __ ] boring.\nI enjoy, you know, I'm I'm paid to be an extrovert.\nI don't know if you feel this way.\nI'm paid to be an extrovert.\nSo, how I relax is I just like to listen to other people and and be, you know, an observer as opposed to participant.\nI'm paid to be an extrovert, too.\nCan you help me out, Scott?\nI've so enjoyed this.\nMy my all my relationships say I've had enough of brand Harry.\nThe show's not on now.\nThe lights are off.\nLike, you can turn off the facade.\nAnd I've actually in many ways lost who I am because I'm always on show.\nThat I've just become the on show version.\nEven when I'm at home on the sofa, there'll be a show.\n\nYeah.\nI I never found that hard.\n\nYeah.\nI don't I don't um I mean, you're at a stage in your life, you're so young and you strike me as so self-aware that you're just well ahead of where other people are.\nJust the fact you're asking these questions of yourself.\nI also think you're being a little bit hard on yourself.\nYou've you've you've been very successful.\nYou're in good shape, you're smart enough and self-aware enough to know about these, you know, ask yourself these questions.\nYou know, the the the unlock, the only advice I would give to a guy your age that I was I did not engage.\nI wasn't very kind.\nAll of my energy, all of my focus was how I become more awesome and rich and not thinking about, well, I'm in a unique opportunity to accelerate people's careers.\nI'm in a unique opportunity to pay people a lot of money to overcompensate them.\nI'm in a unique opportunity to young people admire me because I'm the head of this company.\nI'm in a I have a unique opportunity that when they do a good job to water them and make them feel great about themselves and make just make their day.\nYou know, you're an impressive guy.\nYou have people who work for you.\nIt's just so such an incredible opportunity to just make people feel great all the time and instead of paying someone £100,000, pay them 140.\nAnd that makes such a difference in the world.\nYou know, the I I wish I'd taken more advantage of the human capital I was possessing to improve people's lives.\nYou know, I just everything was about [ __ ] me.\nAnd it's I feel as if I like I I I just wasted so much opportunity.\n\nWhat would you have done differently?\nJust given more.\n\nI just would have been kinder.\nI just when someone did a good piece of work, I should have called them out publicly.\nI wasn't bad.\nI was never mean.\nBut just the you you don't know how much power you have to improve people's lives when you have some success, right?\nTip them a hundred bucks.\nGive some money away.\nTell people you love them.\nCall your friends when they do something cool and just tell them how impressive they are.\nYou know, men have a tough time doing that with other men.\nIf you're in a good relationship, telling someone how much they mean to you.\n\nCan I ask one final thing before we do a quick fire?\nWe haven't talked about marriage.\nWhen you think about sustaining a marriage through wealth creation, through kids, through kids going to boarding school, what have been your biggest lessons on what it takes is to sustain a truly loving marriage through very different cycles of life?\n\nUh, it goes back to that first thing.\nFirst thing is put away the scorecard.\nSay like, what kind of husband do I want to be?\nRight?\nAnd like write it out.\nWhat kind of husband do I want to be?\nAnd then live to that standard instead of saying, \"Well, your parents were in town and you weren't very nice to my parents, so I'm not going to be nice to yours.\"\nOr or you know, just decide what kind of husband.\nDon't keep score.\nJust decide, I want to be a wonderful husband.\nWhat does that mean?\nAnd live to that standard.\nUm, notice their lives.\nYou're you're such a you're so successful that you're going to get so used to just everyone applauding for you.\nYou need to take time to figure out a way such that your partner has stages that strangers and other people are applauding for her.\nLike, really go out of your way to try and give her venues and arenas and environments where strangers can applaud for her.\nSo, it's just not always about your success and you all the time.\nAlways express physical affection and sexual desire.\nIt says, \"I choose you.\"\nI think women want to be wanted.\nI think that's so important in a relationship.\nLike, whenever you're feeling affectionate, whenever you want to hold their hand, whenever you want to more than you can, whenever you want to have sex, express that hunger, express that love, express that affection.\nI think it's really important in a relationship.\nAnd then try to take time to just appreciate and articulate, you know, what you've built together and really appreciate one another.\nAnd you know, and I like I think the reason we get together is not to make more economic security or make children.\nI think it's such that we have someone to witness our lives, to notice our lives.\nAnd I've been married before and I think one of the reasons that I wasn't a great husband the first go around, I didn't witness her life.\nI didn't notice her life.\nI didn't whenever she was upset about something, I just wanted to manage my way out of it because I didn't want to deal with it as opposed to really listening and witnessing and noticing what was going on in her life and celebrating her victories and just taking notes because I was just I was in a hall of mirrors.\nI looked outside the window and I saw myself.\nSo, you know, not keeping score, expressing physical desire, recognizing what you built together and witnessing their life.\nThis is so personal.\nPlease forgive me.\nHave you found a stage of marriage harder than others?\nBe it kids going to boarding school, be it changing countries, be it refinding a chapter of yourself, you know, becoming parents.\n\nOh, there's a lot.\nI mean, um, the first time I I I realized I wasn't going to be able to have sex with other women, that was a real bummer.\nUm, I missed that a lot.\nUm, do you tell her that?\nOh, yeah.\nI mean, I think she feels the same way.\nUm, uh, young kids is hard.\nLittle kids are hard.\nUm, very stressful, especially if you're both working.\nReally stressful.\nI I don't barely even remember those two or three years, but I remember it being really stressful.\nUm, because she was working, my partner was working at Goldman.\nI was starting a business.\nIt was a lot.\nShe was up at 5:30 in the morning with two babies.\nI was trying to build a business.\nThat was really hard.\nDo you agree?\nNever go to bed angry.\n\nUh, yeah.\nI I what I have a practice with my partner is that I get in bed no matter what time it is.\nI stay up late and I you know um you know I it sounds very Hallmark.\nI spoon her.\nSo yeah, we don't go to bed angry.\nWe and my partner is so vocal and willing to tell me everything that's that that's not ideal that we don't it's almost impossible.\nThings things very rarely go unsaid.\nSo yeah, I don't I I would just say try to be more motive and tell people what you're thinking and if you're upset and be generous and listen to them and everyone has their own dynamic.\nI don't know.\nI the Northern Europeans just walk around morose all the time and it seems to work for them.\nI I think it a lot of it is just situational, but I I think more than I'll go back to one of the things.\nI think it's just so important you articulate how fortunate you are and what we've built together.\nAnd I send my partner pictures of my kids when they were younger.\nAnd I constantly highlight, wow, isn't it great that we can do this?\nAnd she will say to me, you know, I'm really happy right now.\nAnd that makes me feel really good because I see it as a reflection on my competence as a man that she's really happy.\nBut all of this is situational.\nYou know, it's it's the biggest decision you'll make.\nIt's not where you work or where you live.\nYour biggest decision you make is who you decide to have kids with because you're in that person's life whether you want to or not for 25 years.\nAnd so it's a really important decision.\nAnd you know, but I have a lot of very successful friends that have a really lovely spouse but not a real partner and their life is full of unnecessary anxiety.\nAnd then I have friends who aren't that successful professionally but have a real partner and everything burns just a little bit brighter.\nSo, it's hands down the most important decision you'll make.\nAnd for a young man like you, all you want to do is be out a lot and meeting as many people as possible, but also giving stuff a chance and seeing where it goes.\nYou know, I mean, you're people would pray for your problems.\nYou have everyone you listen to, everyone who hears you talk about your problems is going to go, I would kill for those problems.\nI'm not exaggerating.\nI'm embarrassed.\nYou're the first person I told about this.\nI've been in a funk for the last 72 hours because there was was a hugely successful IPO a few weeks ago and I had a chance to invest and I got the CEO texting me I was going to get allocation the IPO and I was just too [ __ ] lazy to follow up and this was a monster IPO and all I can think about is the fact that I I I I'm just so angry and upset and I'm embarrassed because why do I I don't need more money but I'm still just so [ __ ] angry at myself that I was that I missed this opportunity.\n\nWhy though if you don't need more money?\n\nBecause I, you know, it's hard to get off, it's hard, it's hard to get off the hamster wheel of identifying your self-esteem and your worth with money.\nAnd also, I would love a bunch more money to give away.\nAnd you know, in a capitalist society, it's really sad, but the more money you have, the more power you have, the more virtue you have.\nLook at we're willing to forgive a guy who disowns his children on podcasts and is being sued by two women concurrently for sole custody of their child and cuts off food stamps to kids and benefits to veterans because he's the richest man in the world.\nI mean, in a capitalist society, every signal is telling you there's never enough.\nSo, I think it's sort of a natural or understandable instinct.\n\nIs there anything you would do differently if you had a billion dollars?\nWhat would you do differently?\n\nOh, I give I give a lot more money away.\nI'm not I'm sincere.\nI anything above my number now I give away at the end of the year.\nIt makes me and I don't do it I don't do it out of ethics or virtue.\nI do it because it makes me feel important.\n\nWill you give your money to your children?\nDo you believe in inheritance?\n\nYeah, I'll give some money.\nI I'll give them enough money so they can always have a house, always afford education.\nI'll give them a start, but they won't inherit I won't give them a ton of money.\nI'll give them I don't know what that number is, but I'll give them enough money.\nI love what Warren Buffett said.\nI'll give them enough such that they can do anything, but not enough so they can do nothing.\nUm, I'll give them enough money so that they always know they can afford a home, afford their kids' education, you know, which is a lot of money, but I'm not going to they're I'm not I'm not interested in building a dynasty or anything like that.\nI don't I know a lot of rich kids.\nThey're not any less happy than other kids, but they're not any happier.\nI know a lot of rich kids in London, and they are they are much less happy.\nThere's no reason to get up.\nThey put most of it up their nose and there's no there's no passion.\nI can get the Ferrari.\nI can get the Lamborghini.\nWhy would I bother doing the work to get it?\nWell, the the joy is in the work.\n\nWell, yeah.\nIt's funny.\nIt's not It's not having money is great, but it was the getting it that was really rewarding, right?\n\nYeah.\nAnd we did you grow up with money?\n\nNo.\nSo, you know what it's like.\nIt's just so rewarding.\nI didn't either.\nIt's so rewarding now to spend money that you made and have some success.\nThat's just such but I had this like anger at society.\nI saw our family home be taken away and I had this like ruthless desire for revenge against what I thought was a brutal and unfair system for taking my family home.\n\nYeah.\n\n\nBut those fires and that anger. So you were talking about rich kids. If my dad had been rich and I knew I was going to have money, the only two things I know I would have in my life were a Range Rover and a cocaine habit. I'm not a self-motivated person. I'm a fundamentally lazy person. And not having money and growing up in America and just seeing how important it was and also feeling humiliation around not being able, my mom got very sick and not being able to take care of her and having that amount of stress in a capitalist society in the US where you're underinsured and if you don't have money, it's really difficult to deal with real illness, that was really, really motivating for me, and I think probably the same disappointment and anger. Those are embers that have burned and motivated and probably been net net a positive for you. So, you know, recognize that those things, you, it sounds like you channeled into very productive ambition, and now take the gratitude and try and extinguish that anger.\nCan we do a quick-fire round? I've so enjoyed this. I'm going to say a short statement. You give me your immediate thoughts.\nSure. So, what one belief do you have that most people think would be insane?\nWell, on a practical level, the young people need to drink more. I get a lot of pushback from that. Um, but my source of power that most people don't engage in is I'm an atheist. I'm 100% convinced at some point I'm going to look into my kids's eyes and know our relationship is coming to an end. But it's hugely empowering for me knowing that everyone I'm worried about what they think, worried about being shamed, worried about being embarrassed. It doesn't matter that they're going to be dead soon, and so am I. So my atheism is like this incredible source of, you know, courage and comfort that I think a lot of people don't have the joy of participating in.\nHow does knowing that you'll be dead soon in the atheism change how you act on a daily basis?\nMost people don't start companies because they're worried about public failure. Most people don't approach a strange woman much hotter than them because they're worried about embarrassment. Most people don't ask for $30 million for their VC fund because they don't think they're qualified or they're worried about public embarrassment. Most people don't tell other people they love them because they're worried about it not being reciprocated. We're all going to be dead.\nIt doesn't matter. Like why wouldn't you take all sorts of risks with the even if it has a very outside shot of paying off? Why would you be scared? Why would you care what the downside? And as long as you don't hurt people, as long as you're not taking stupid risks, you know, if you want to score above your weight class economically and romantically, get out a big spoon, get ready to eat [ __ ] endure rejection. And if you ask someone for money or a job and you don't get the money or the job, or you ask someone out on a date and you don't get the date, you're all going to be just fine. You're all going to end up dead. But the person who is unafraid and asks for all of those things every day ends up wealthier and with a higher character mate than their peers.\nWhat were you most afraid to ask for?\nYeah, I've always had that. I've always had a certain level of imposter syndrome. So, I didn't think I was going to get into college and I didn't. And then I got in and I felt like I fooled them. And then I got into Morgan Stanley and I felt like I fooled them. I've so I've always been, but I've always done it, but I've always felt like an imposter. If you don't feel imposter syndrome, you're either arrogant or not reaching far enough. So I'm consistently kind of embarrassed to ask for stuff, but I never got in the way. I don't, I got past that pretty early. I, one of the best things that happened for me was I ran for sophomore, junior, and senior class president in high school and lost all three times. And based on my track record, I decided to write run for student body president where I lost. I asked seven women to prom. All seven said no. And I think that has built a level, it didn't traumatize me. It built a level of calluses and scar tissue where I'm sort of, you know, I'm just not afraid of rejection. I think that's, if I could teach my kids any skill would be one to communicate, but two to be able to endure rejection, to be able to mourn and move on.\nWhat do you think is great communication?\nThe ability to make people feel something. Um, the communication that resonates for me with people is when I die about when I die about when I write about putting my dog down. When I write about coming home from a long business trip and noticing that my kids had grown and wondering if I'm, what's the point of all this success if I register my kids' growth because I'm not home for two weeks.\nSomething that makes people feel something where you, you, you talk about something in a very real, vulnerable way and it makes people feel something.\nCompletely agree with that. Okay, you mentioned your father earlier. What are your biggest lessons from your mother?\nYou know, unconditional love is is is everything. Like giving simply, you know, it was simple. My mom, you know, I, I said this before. If you tell people you love them and that they have value every day, they can't help but at some point believe it. And that's that's that is, you know,\nYeah. That's that's what she gave to me.\nDo you tell your boys you love them every day?\nEvery day.\nWhat have you changed your mind on in the last 12 months?\nI don't, I don't know. I can't think of anything. I don't, I'm very open to change. Um, I don't, um, but I can't think of like any one big thing where I've changed my, uh, changed my view on it. I'm drinking less. I've decided that I've always said I love alcohol. I've stopped, I've just substantially reduced the amount of alcohol because I realized my 60-year-old liver isn't what it used to be.\nUm, but I don't know if I've really, I can't think in the last 12 months of anything I've really changed my mind on.\nI'm very passionate about being a good interviewer. I care deeply about telling people's stories and and bluntly having a great experience. When you reflect back on the many interviews that you've done for people that listen to you today and go, \"Fuck, he was great,\" what would you say other than this is the best reflection of you in an interview, in a piece of writing, in an article in your mind?\nWhat piece of content have I produced?\nYeah. Yeah.\nI struggle with happiness. I'm, um, I struggle with anger and depression. I wrote a book called The Algebra of Happiness. I read every book and study on happiness, and it's my least best-selling book, and it's, it's yeah, I think that that's what I want my kids to read.\nScott, as I said, it wasn't the show I was quite expecting, but this was incredible, and it's one of the reasons why I love what I do, doing shows like this. So, thank you so much for doing this with me.\nThank you, and congratulations on all your success.\n",
