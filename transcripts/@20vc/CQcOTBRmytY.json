  "cleanText": "Will we look back in 20 years and say OpenAI was a fundamentally important company? Maybe the hyperscalers have taken very good cash-efficient businesses, and they would break Mr. Buffett's heart because they've turned them into capex hearts. Public company investors are just mean VCs on steroids. We turn on a dime from \"I can't believe you're not spending more\" to \"What the freak do you mean you're spending so much money?\" Every company's market share is up for grabs when there's a platform shift. Will Elon be out as Tesla CEO before 2027?\n\nReady to go.\n\nGuys, I am so excited for this. We had so many interesting things that we want to dive into this week. I just want to start with diving in actually on the deep end on a series of Chimamath tweets, and Chimath basically said, \"Hey, uh, TVPI's [ __ ] vanity metric. You can't eat IRR. You can only eat net DPI.\" When you read this and when you read his quite opinionated stance, how did we feel? I mean, I hate agreeing with Shimoth on principle, but I agree with him.\n\nWell, well, you know what's interesting? If you read the Wall Street Journal article on on on to Tomo Bravo, they just raised a $34 billion fund, right, Harry? You're you're buddy. What it's what the Wall Street Journal said, that's a record fund for PE, 34 billion. It's a record, but Q1 was a low point. No one no one raised a $5 billion PE fund because of lack of liquidity, right? So, it's kind of ties to Chimat's point, which is if you have the liquidity in today's world, you're going to get the capital, right? Tom Bravo had had $30 billion in distributions last year. $30 billion. I think that exceeds most guests, right? 30 billion in distributions, not paper markups, but distributions.\n\nLook, from my perspective, this is simple, right? Which is there's two very different games that are called venture capital or even, you know, private capital in general. One game is actually making people money, finding companies early, making the right bets, you know, paying the right prices and selling. And that is a DPI game, and all that matters is DPI. And that's the game I like to play. That's the game I think I value and I respect. There's also an asset gathering game, right? Um, and the asset gathering game does exist. And here's the thing. I say this as a seed investor with full transparency as a business. The asset gathering game is actually a better business. Like if you're just in it to make money, right? And like that's you're, you know, then like you're an asset gatherer. Like that's what the market wants. And we can talk about why and the and like the whole nine yards. The public market wants that. They care about fees, etc. So, the problem is like I just am an intellectual snob and I have no respect for asset gatherers. Like I think it's a stupid game. And so for me, it's like it's, you know, I I think they're just two very different things that are called the same thing and you just should be really sober about what game you're in and what you're trying to do. I think it's really fun that we had this conversation and we ended up thinking that Chimat's on the side of good. Nice job, Sam. I mean, I I don't I'm the first to say like I think that's wild that I agree with. My default instinct is to completely disagree with him on whatever he says, but like in this case, I happen to agree with him. I'm comfortable disagreeing with him. I honestly thought it was kind of a trit comment. It's one of the It's a very typical traumat comment. On first glance, it sounds smart, but on deeper analysis, it's kind of vaguely right, but not useful. I mean, and you cuz obviously for you, he cited his 2013 and 15 vintage funds. Obviously, at that point, DPI is the only thing that counts. If you're 10 years in and you're still selling promises, then you're in trouble. So, it's that's a trivially obvious comment. But at the end of the day, you know, to say TVPI doesn't count, the truth is venturers investing in illquid assets for 5 to seven years with the expectation of making a greater return. That means that for 5 to seven years, you don't have DPI. You've consciously just you've consciously undied yourself. You've taken money and you've given them the title in the ground. So in that period of time, you have two choices as an investor gauging these guys. You can say TVPI means nothing. I'll stick my head up my ass and I'll look in seven years. I'll see how they're doing. Or you can use TVPI for what it is, a proxy, a loose proxy for performance.\n\nHere's the upshot. You have to understand that LPS are just incentive driven, right? And from an LP that what you should do as a rational human being if you were it was me investing in the fund. You say yeah the money's in the ground for 5 years and after that we'll see where we're at and that's all that matters what you deliver. I know full well I know this as an investor that the marks that you made up or the marks of Soft Bank listed something somewhere completely irrelevant. In fact negative signal in a lot of cases. So like the marks are irrelevant and stupid. Now here's the reality is institutional LPS are people too right? there's some junior guy who wrote the check, right? And he wants to get promoted, right? And he exists in an organization that's trying to deliver something. He doesn't want to wait seven years to get promoted, right, for making a good call or a bad call. And so it really is just a marketing thing where you're saying, \"Hey, I'm going to give the person who wrote me the check some marketing thing they can then use for their own internal purposes because everything in life is about get laid or get paid.\"\n\nI think that I mean there's no doubt that part of um kind of having a positive TVPI is all that marketing. But I think at some level, look, let me ask a question here. If you had two funds 3 years in and one of them had no markups and one of them was a 2x TVPI, would you regard those two funds as exactly identical? No. What I would regard them as though, and this is how I actually do regard them when I look at my own portfolio or things like that, is very simple, which is how many credible things do you have that are going to be fund returners? That's it. Just give me the list of four things. I don't care where they're marked. Like you either have a set of legitimate shots on goal for important companies and important outcomes or you don't. If a company has a two is marked at 2x where it went in, SoftBank, some crazy person marked it up in some crazy. My point about the traumat comment is to say it means nothing. Let to say it means nothing is a gross exaggeration. There almost certainly is some signal in that data. Let's let's kind of take it. Let's go right down into TVPI means nothing. I'm willing to bet if you got some kind of machine learning algorithm and looked at all the funds that four three or four years in had a TVPI of 2x and all the funds that four years in had a TVPI of 8x and then correlated that to the ultimate outcomes. I bet you there would be data in that signal that says it has some value. Therefore, to state incorrect. It was actually it's not the only source of data. You're right. There are better source of data if you're in a position to evaluate better data. But as an LP in the absence of anything better, there is signal in the data which means the comment is wrong. It would be fun to it'd be fun to look at. I actually bet that firms that hold positions at zero or cost or even are willing to mark down positions that are more honest about it in reality might actually out I don't know we can look at it but the reality is I think there's this inc I mean I as an LP in many funds you have funds you get their statements and you laugh because they hold everything at ridiculous the high water mark they can possibly come up with are these numbers that make no sense and you look at you're like this is like kind of funny and like the numbers look but you're like this is not real right And I just think that like it's because there's no like because everyone has methodologies all over the board. It's all marketing, right? And I kind of unfortunately I hate being with Chimoth. I hate it, right? Like I've known Chimoth a long time. Not well, but casually. And I got to say it drives me nuts that I have to be. But with him it's like all I care about early is give me five names that matter. And all I care about after you've had enough time is did you make me money or not. Okay.\n\nBut I get your point. Like it's a it's it's zero is an extreme statement but you know we live in an age of memes. Yeah that's the real Yeah. Go ahead. We said we're living in this kind of two dichotomy world or this kind of uh binary world of venture in the middle. You know SVB did this great analysis and they were saying that middle of VC funds is getting really hollowed out. In other words kind of mid-tier firms in terms of size are really falling apart. What happens to them? Is it a game of the very small and the very large do we think when we look at this report? I mean, you got Yes. Like, there's no middle. You can't be a billion dollar venture fund.\n\nIs a billion middle.\n\nWell, I'd say this. I mean, we're we try to raise we we try to call it $200 million early stage funds. That's what we do every few years. I'm very confident we know how to deploy that. Like, I believe there's a market where you can from a a DPI perspective make money on that. It's not a great fee business, but it's a great it's a great DPI business. I don't know how you make multiples on a billion dollars consistently, right? in VC. I think once you're doing 10, you're playing a completely different game of asset gathering and asset deployment where you no longer have the same goals. So, I personally think that the billion dollar zone is like the death zone. Gotcha.\n\nGood to know as a $900 million fund.\n\nYeah, actually I did actually look at the SVB that first of all, I I was thinking are they are they throw me under the bus, too? I checked the data and they were actually saying the two to 500 um was the middle zone. So, then I felt even more depressed. Now I'm a behem now I'm a small behemoth which is even more degrading. I'm kind of a a low rent um conglomerate but I saw this stuff I I don't buy it. I mean I think your statement is I think in the end you have to be sized for the stage you're playing at and to achieve the portfolio construction you want to achieve. And I'm pretty confident that, you know, our typical check size is 20 to 30 million in your 30 to $40 million rounds. We want to get 30 checks. The mat works, right? Um 30 kind of deals total. So I I I think you have to be sized for the game you're at, right? It still doesn't mean you can't get it wrong. And I do think to your point, one of the things I've, you know, Jason and I have been kind of batting this around over the last kind of eight weeks is I do believe the impact of the conglomerates has made everything harder, including it's harder for us to make money. I so I I totally buy that. The existence of people with $10 billion to spend makes it very hard for people with 900 or 500 or $600 million to spend to do that rationally in a way that probably and I'd love to hear from Jason on this in a way that if you're putting out 100 or 200 million you're probably a little more inured to it. Maybe the more interesting question is for founders, right? If if if I I I think the SB report, which I wrote up, I don't think it was really saying 800 to a billion was the hollowedout middle, but I guess I guess it is part of the analysis, right? um that they're not raising funds. If if if if that is true, then every founder wants to raise 20 or 30 million in their A. Now, no one wants to raise an eight the $8 million series A is now three safe notes, right? So, does that mean in a couple years your candidates outside of some scales are going to be limited to mega funds? Like, are they the only people that can't be able to write series 8 checks? Because 20 to 30 million isn't even a large series A today, right? It's a normal one. So if if there if there is no one in the middle, then we're all stuck with mega funds to do to to fund the seed companies, right? I mean, I guess it's an obvious point, but founders just they better get to know folks with five or 10 billion funds before demo day or they're all going bankrupt and these are all bad companies. Like I like I think that's the other way to look at this is like I you know I know a lot of people are pulling out of series A's entirely because they're like these are completely mispriced and like these make no sense. And like I I think that the other possibility, right, is that we're in an era where there are good companies to be built and there are places to make money, right? And if you are going into corners of the economy or funding things that other people won't and so you're an end of one or an end of a few looking at spaces that are kind of really novel, there are places to make lots of money. Um, but I think we also have to look at it the other way, which is like there's just a massive amount of capital being massively misallocated right now. It's always funny when people simultaneously have the worldview that, you know, the big funds are going to win everything, but all the money is being wasted. I mean, at some point, well, I think the thing with human mind is like I don't even know the big funds need to make that much money, right? Like that because they're asset gatherers, right? Like they need to make enough money to generate gathering more assets and they need to justify their own existence and it's a good business, right? That's different than saying you're trying to make a lot of money in venture capital.\n\nbroadly agreed. But I actually think Jason, I want to go back to what you\n\n\nSaid because I thought it was spot on.\nIt's like you think if there's only to\ntake the if there's only $200 million\nfunds and billion dollar funds, then\nyou're exactly right.\nLogically, those 20, 30, 40, $50 million checks are going to come from only 10 names who are writing 40 of them a year, not eight like us, right?\nAnd it's I that's possible, but it's just a weird fund construction because those people are then going to be writing, you know, 40, 50, 60 checks of this size.\nYou're going to have a very spread out partner base.\nI don't know if they'll be able to meet the founder needs where it is.\nSo, I do believe.\nIs that not what your insights have today, though?\nI mean, we've mentioned before kind of the outcomes that they have with your Hinge Health is returning 400 million on a 6 billion fund and them having like hundreds of positions and actually that being the construction they have.\nIt might be the construct.\nYes, it is the construction they have.\nBut at some point it gets easier when you're running big sums to put big money in a smaller number of companies than try and you know diversify away.\nIf we're trying with 900 million to have 30 A's or B's, someone who's running 9 billion if they were trying to do the same thing would have 300 A's and B's in three years, it would be silly.\nSo at some point it becomes a part of their business but not all their business.\nAnd then I think Jason's right, there won't.\nI mean, it's so funny, we're going to talk in a few minutes about and Sam mentioned earlier this idea of you, a lot of A's are struggling to be raised.\nI mean, the only way that worldview makes sense is actually what Sam said is that if you have a world where people which with can I call them midsize funds, quote unquote, can't survive because of the big guys and the big guys are quote stealing all the good deals and at the same time we're also saying many companies are struggling to make a series A, get a series A raised, those things are coming almost opposite to each other.\nOne says capital is scarce and one says capital is plenty.\nAnd the big guys, I would say, actually the way you resolve that illogical seeming statement is quite simple, which is every generation there's only a few companies, companies that matter.\nYes, it's very simple.\nSo most of the money at series A is completely wasted, right?\nAnd they might want it in larger quantum that just is like kind of it's kind of a war of attrition, right?\nIt's just more money being lit on fire.\nNow the mega funds will just win, can win because they can say, \"Okay, look, I'm going to plow a gajillion dollars at almost any price in and because of AI or whatever argument they want to make, you know, the there's no upper bound, right?\"\nAnd so they say, \"We make lots of money just on lots of money being deployed.\"\nAnd that can logically make sense.\nSeed funds are fine because you still have to be in winners, right?\nBut it's just a multiples game, right?\nWhich is if you're in it at zero, right?\nThen like, you know, you can make a bunch of checks and like make the math work from a DPI perspective.\nYou also have a nice benefit which I very much appreciate, which is I really strongly believe private to private is an important future.\nAnd I love being early and small and first because I actually can sell into the private markets in a way that you can't if you written a 30 $40 million check into the series A.\nToo big, right?\nSo I think those two things survive.\nBut what do you think about so for selling, if selling early, right?\nSelling in secondaries, unicorn secondaries.\nHow do you think about the goals?\nIs the goal we talked, is it one extra fund, 2x your fund, half is, is it just risk allocation?\nBecause this, this is I think if you have a smaller fund, it's really it's interesting.\nIt is a debate because you get a like I just the other day I had a 1x exit opportunity to return the fund once and one of my anchors was I also brought them in as part of the deal and we talked about it, right?\nThey followed me, so it was less for them, but for them it would have been very high IRR and me a 1x, right?\nThat sounds good on on the internet, right?\nBut then it's gone.\nYeah, so look, it's all gone.\nThere's no, there's no more returns in the end of the day.\nThere's a few things that matter, right?\nAnd the number one rule as a fund, an allocator is you cannot sell the things that matter.\nRule two is right because I, you know, we were one of the first investors in Alberts, right?\nLike or Astro rockets or plenty of things that got out and people were excited about, but thesis broke, right?\nAnd so I think you have to be really honest with yourself, right?\nAnd honest and and you're going to make mistakes, you know, I think one of the things I always say is as a early stage investor, you get hundreds of shots to buy, you get really good at buying, you have so fewer shots at learning to sell that it actually takes much longer to learn to sell well, right?\nBut it's still as important as learning to buy well.\nAnd I think you just have to be really honest with yourself, which is like, is this an infinity shot or is it not?\nAnd the second the thesis is broken and it's not, if there's a buyer at a price that makes sense because someone else has different fund dynamics.\nMaybe they already own a lot and for them it's like about rounding down their average in cost, maybe it's their capital allocator and they don't care as much about the negative return.\nLike they have different goals, there are opportunities that work for everyone.\nRory, can I ask you if it's not one of the companies that matter?\nIs it lighting money on fire in the kind of binary way that No, I I'm glad you came back to that because I would say again respectfully I disagree and it's a matter of degree but no I don't think that's a correct statement, right?\nI think that you it is true that and how do you express in every decade you look back and you go the vast bulk of the value is driven by one or two companies, it's a power law, we all understand the math to a rounding era.\nThere was a decade where it was Google and then everything else, right?\nSo, you could that's true and it's intellectually absolutely true.\nSo, you could say to yourself, if I didn't do Google, I must have lit the money on fire, but then when you make that sentence a few times, then you go and you look at Schwab account and go, oh, I have money in there, so I mustn't have lit it on fire.\nThere are more wins than the biggest win.\nIt is a power law.\nI would prefer to have done in Google than any whatever I made money on in 2000 to 2010, but I'm damn glad I did that one, too.\nRight.\nAnd the over extrapolation of the only three deals make money so therefore everything else at series A is burning money is just I mean it's true in that you'd prefer to be in Google but it's not the only way to make money.\nI mean just in the last couple of weeks we've had as you mentioned a couple of decent IPOs, Hinge Health, um we're going to have Chime, we had something else Mountain last week, we have another one this week.\nTake Hing someone made $400 million for their investors.\n20% of $400 million is $80 million.\nI say this every time when someone at the office says, \"Oh, it's just a 3x.\"\nEvery single one of you will cash the [ __ ] check.\nEvery single one of you.\nIf I left them on the counter there, you'd all take them home with you, right?\n$80 million is still real money in America.\nRight.\nAnd Roy, that's almost my point.\nBut just to put you on Chime, like Chime's a great example of this, right?\nLike if you are an early stage investor, you're very sad you didn't sell last round in Chime, right?\nAnd I would argue at 25 billion or wherever the last round was done, when you look at that rationally, you'd say, look, it's a gold company, right?\nIs it an infinity company, right?\nAm I betting on this for infinity or is this a really great place where I did my job, which was to fund it early, to find it early, to fund it when money was scarce?\nAnd now we have capital allocators who are making a different assessment.\nI think the answer is you clearly would have wanted to sell last round.\nAnd I think it's incumbent on investors.\nI I only know what's in the S1, but I didn't see any of the early shareholders make the cut on the on the on the principal stockholders.\nWhen I look at principal stockholders, there's dilution, but I don't see any of the seed guys on the table.\nSo, that says to me they probably sold the 20 some amount of 25 billion when I literally only see DSD cross link and they did their job.\nThat that did their job.\nWell, not if it's a $250 trillion.\nTwo separate things floating around and I want to disagregate them.\nFirst is I'm going to fight in defense of mid tier, right?\nDid the mid-tier investors who didn't do the seed but didn't do the $25 billion round, are they happy they did that round?\nThe round that Menlo did, I think it was out of the BC, it was a couple hundred million.\nCan't remember what the pre was.\nThey're damn happy they did that round.\nRight.\nAnd that's a classic example of a midsize venture firm making a savvy bet doing good stock picking long after the seed but still making good coin.\nSo that's to me that's the first point which is the validation that you can at that fund size probably it was a $45$500 million fund then make really good coin and move the needle at the fund level.\nSecond comment to your point, Sam and Jason, you're right.\nYou look back and go, hm, I might have been marginally smarter if I had bought at two 300 and then sold at 25 billion rather than holding and selling at 12.\nBut the big advantage they have is they'll still book probably 10 or 20x.\nNow 40x is better than 20x, right?\nSo they've made good coin in a situation where, as we discussed before, the kind of $25 billion bond is going to lose money.\nSo I think that's proof.\nIt goes back to that's proof that you can make perfectly shrewd A to C bets sub a billion pre and make very good money in a non quote unquote generational company.\nChime is an extremely good company.\nIt's not one of them.\nI agree with all that, Roy.\nAnd again, I'm obviously trying to be provocative on purpose, but I think we directly here's my voice points to bring it full circle to DPI though, right?\nWhich is when you think about how I relatively value DV DPI versus TVPI or any other metric, right?\nIf I'm an early stage funer, really anyone, and you said, \"Hey, I sold my chime stock at 25 billion for American dollars like for cash and I gave it to you years ago, right?\"\nLike from an IR perspective and a cash perspective that is a great move right yeah versus hang yeah and so that's I think the thing to keep in mind when we go back to all this is like you know again we're talking pretty deep cuts on the the game of VC right now right as opposed to the game of company building but like I do think like when you come back to this like this is why I believe the Chimamoth line unfortunately and it's going to get clipped and I'm going be upset about it but like whatever is like he's right is like it's like in the end of the day like good investors, good capitalists make people money if that's the game they're playing and they're not asset gatherers.\nYes.\nAnd of course in the end it's true.\nOf course my the point is it's in the end it's true.\nIn the end check in the bank counts.\nSometimes even as you correctly say it's often even true.\nI like what you said about Facebook.\nYou said sometimes it's even true that a smaller check earlier has more value than a bigger check later just for a whole bunch of life reasons.\nI mean that's why we have interest rates.\nThere's time value of money.\nI remember a friend of mine we saw this company.\nI was giving him grief.\nAnd then five or six years later, another company in the same space went public at two or three times the market cap.\nAnd I foolishly gave him [ __ ] about it.\nAnd he called [ __ ] on me.\nHe said, \"Look, I've been at the thing 10 years.\nI made a lot of money.\nI got married.\nI have a life.\nI have a lovely house in Spain and I started another company.\nYeah, I'd have more money if I'd held, but that was my life life choice.\"\nI think he was exactly right.\nSo I I I agree.\nI just thought Menllo Ventures.\nSo obviously I don't know what their basis is, Rory.\nObviously they'll make a ton of money on Chime, right?\nA classic great bet.\nThey said they did the series B, right?\nThey win.\nSo they did the series B at 200, 300.\nMaybe we can figure it out on the fly.\nThey're going to this will be a nine.\nThere'll be some dilution.\nThey'll 10 or 15x their money, right?\nThat'll be a fun returner or more than a fund returner.\nProbably just maybe a little under.\nBut yeah, now when I want and I and I and I do like that team and then back when when in 2021 they wanted to invest like in all of my companies.\nThere was very high very high alignment, right?\nFor better or worse, right?\nWhat's interesting to me today from the start of the conversation is all they talk about is anthropic today and this is a smart team.\nIt's every they have an entropic fund every because I follow all the guys and on LinkedIn on nothing but their ser they didn't do the seed and they're going to make a lot of money off this right because anthropic is 1 to three billion in revenue in 5 months right but it's it's a sign of the times isn't it probably I don't see them trumpeting their coming DPI from Chime which is epic but Anthropic is on their social media 11 times a day as as perhaps it should be but there's no I don't think they're taking any DPI they're marketing to entrepreneurs they're not marketing to LPs I think in venture capital it is unbelievably difficult to know what anything is worth, right?\nAnd if you're Menllo or you're anyone in the middle, my god, you have to price things properly, right?\nIf you're plowing enormous amounts of money and saying late on the infinity dream, price doesn't really matter, which is how you get these ridiculous prices, right?\nLike, and like the reason is\n\n\nIt is very simple.\nIt's like, it's like, what is OpenAI worth?\nIt's like, who the hell knows?\nBut like, it's like one of those things where people can dream, right?\nYou can have a trillion-dollar dream, and that means that like there's very little pricing discipline.\nIt's basically a game of pissing of who can pay more or who's willing to go further.\nAnd at seed, nothing's worth anything, right?\nAnd so you just have to have pricing discipline and remember that.\nThe problem with me is I don't know how you know, like the I, you know, I said this as someone who started my career at Banning Company.\nI think with these private companies catching the right price and the right dynamic and being right at series AB is like the hardest game.\nI think some parts of that are true.\nI think price, you are right that the seed investor.\nI mean, I always say, you know, we tend to do A's and B's, and I always say we're at the first point where you can start to do some analysis versus just people and market, which is what you have to live on and broad directionality, right?\nYou've got at least some pitiful facts to look at and try.\nI have no facts.\nI, I exist in a fact-free zone.\nYeah.\nYes.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd we live in a fact-thin zone.\nSo I do agree that we have to be a little, yeah, you have some data to bring, and it's, but I don't agree that our pricing, I don't agree that pricing for us is quote harder than pricing for the late stage.\nI think late stage on average, it's very, it's, I think it's much harder to price at that late stage, cuz on average you'll be wrong, and we're seeing a whole bunch of down rounds where the last round loses money and every other round prior to that makes money.\nI actually think price discipline is even more important the closer you get to an exit.\nThey don't lose money.\nThey just get their prep.\nWe, we, we've thrashed that one to that.\nIn China's case, they're going to lose money because they don't have protection.\nThat's a fair eye roll, Jason.\nBut, but, but I think the more important thing is the interesting is we always say, and I think entropic by, I think men are doing entropic was a genius move, right?\nSo come to that in a second.\nGenius move, too.\nTotally.\nI, I think, look, there's always some deals, and it's very surprising that even at that two, three, five billion valuation level, there's still another 10x from there.\nNow there's not many of them.\nThere's literally one maybe every second year.\nBut if you do that one, you, you're right.\nYou, you can, you can price like it's an A or a B, but deploy money like it's an F and make a return.\nYeah.\n10x plus return as if it's an A or B.\nIt's an awesome deal.\nThere's, as I say, one of them every couple of years, andropic was one.\nOpenAI was one, probably Angel was one, but the average late stage deal isn't that, right?\nAnd there's just less degrees of freedom on the average late stage deal to compound.\nSo, I think you have to be a little, when I look at the people who do it well, like the Meritex, like the IVPs, there's a fair amount of shrewd price discipline in what they bring to the table or what the product they're selling is, you know, just a different product, right?\nThe product they're selling is access to this pool of companies that are late for people with too much money or that need private access with a cherry on top of infinity, right?\nAnd they're actually not in the business.\nI think that's probably not as true for the names I cited, but I think you're right.\nThere are people who are, there are funds who are playing that game where, you know, it gets back to the whole, when all the cute sexy stuff is private, there are eventually going to be entities whose sole goal in life is to put public investors in contact with those sexy private companies.\nThe one thing I will say on Chime and the 25 billion is every single round in the billions for Revolut, everyone was saying, well, how much more can it be?\nHow much more can it be?\nI think everyone is realizing now that Revolut will quite likely be at least a hundred billion dollar company and likely 150 billion.\nIf you sold at 25, you would be grossly underestimating, missing 125 billion of gains in a European NEO bank.\nBut it also just depends what business you think you're in, right?\nLike, you know, again, like I don't, I don't, I think that there's a very, like, I don't, aren't you in the business of making as much money for your investors as possible?\nOh, well, so I, there's another real debate, I think, which is, which is a tough one, which is, look, I would argue that there's a strong case to be made that as a venture capitalist, you should not have an opinion about the public markets, right?\nThat like, you're not paid to have an opinion about public markets.\nPeople have their own opinions about public markets, right?\nAnd like, you're paid, your job is to to manage the private markets or private pricing.\nAnd that once things's public, it's like, look, that's, you know, the game should be over.\nNow, there's all sorts of people that juice that or like decide they do have opinions about the public markets.\nBut like, I don't know, it's something I've gone back and forth on to be totally honest with you about whether VCs just thematically should be doing that or whether you say, &quot;Look, you know, we can turn over shares.\nYou guys figure out what to do, right?\nBut I would probably sell Revolut and Chime right now.\nRight now, I'll tell you why.\nAnd you can criticize it.\nI'm just, I'm still learning, right?\nI'm going to be a student uh for too long.\nI'll be out of this game while I'm still a student.&quot;\nBut both of them have about 15% market share.\nTrue, Tam.\nIf you're trying to decide when to sell, right, or whether you they have Infinity Runway,\num, market share is a limiter, right?\nUm, and I mean, Revolut, there are folks that can get to 100% market share, but for a lot of apps, 15% I find is a little bit of headwind.\nLike you start to see, you start to see, and and a lot of times in B2B when the market's smaller, it's, it's even before 100 million in revenue, you start to get to double-digit market share.\nAnd just when it gets good because you everyone's heard about you and all the leads come in.\nIt's like, ah, all the easy 15% market share is a lot.\nIt's a lot if you're, if it's not a monopoly.\nIf it's not a monopoly, that is a classic thing.\nEveryone comes, you know, as an early stage, people come to me like, well, the CAC is blank, but it's going to go down.\nLike, nope, CAC only goes up, right?\nLike people just consistently get this wrong, right?\nAnd so I think almost always up at scale, right?\nIt's like this is how the world works.\nAnd like, you know, the kind of argument that you're going to get good at something and all of a sudden it's going to get cheaper is just wrong.\nSo, Chime and Chime's an interesting one.\nTheir CAC has fallen a bit because they track uh brand brand awareness and verality.\nAnd it took a while for Chime to be big enough to have enough viral propagation or word of word of mouth.\nI don't think it's viral, word of mouth, but now it's only since 2022 they said word of mouth is their number one source of customers.\nIt's just sort of interesting because it's it's the only way you can scale, right?\nOtherwise, your cat goes up, goes to infinity.\nWhat's that?\nI just think I say this with respect.\nI actually quite like the Chime team.\nI know a lot of them well.\nI think they're good people.\nI don't mean to be crapping on them.\nI think they're good operators, and I'm excited for them.\nBut I would say this is like, is Chime an important company?\nI just don't see it, right?\nLike, is it, you know, it's good company?\nLike they provided some banking products to unbanked people or underbanked people.\nI get it.\nIt's not bad.\nThey did a good job.\nThey built a good app.\nBut like, is it important?\nLike I just don't know that it is.\nIf if the $14 billion market cap was in my bank account, I would think it was a very important company indeed.\nRight.\nIf it put, you know, so I, I hear what you're saying there, it's just like, who, it's like, fine, it's fine, it's, it's not a bad thing, right?\nIt's just, you know, it's like, I remember, I think it's a good question, and and I honestly, it's a, I liked being challenged.\nI would, if that is the case, if Chime is not a an important company at all, then I, I've never done anything important in my life.\nI've been a decent founder.\nI've seeded multiple, my team has gone on to help run multiple deckorns.\nI've had 5 billion dollar cash exits, but I really don't matter, and I might not, like, I, it's quite possible.\nI don't, I think I've helped thousands of founders build companies from scratch, but I probably don't matter if Chime doesn't matter.\nI think the default is is that most of us don't matter, and most of the companies in the world don't matter.\nAnd but the, but the things that matter really matter, right?\nAnd like I think the job is to find the things that really matter.\nDo you think Salesforce or Oracle matter?\nYeah.\nI mean, that might not matter.\nIt's, I think Arthur Balfur, prime minister of England, a very in the 1900s, very languid, relaxed man, used to say nothing matters a lot and very little matters at all.\nRight?\nAnd that's really what you're saying, Sam, and it's true, but of course the correct response says, &quot;What am I meant to do with that?&quot;\nI think an android can matter.\nI think you can tell it can.\nI'm not saying it will.\nI do think killing people matters.\nIt's very, I think that, I think that, I think that OpenAI could matter, right?\nI think that Microsoft, Facebook, Google, these are companies that matter.\nI think Bitcoin matters.\nI think, so I personally think Solana matters.\nI think Venmo might matter.\nLike we can go down the line of things that are actually paradigm shifting and like have an impact.\nAnd then everything else, it's not that you can't build good businesses.\nYou can, but when we're talking about you're not sure OpenAI will matter.\nYou just think it's possible it could matter.\nIt will matter.\nI think it might matter.\nUm, I mean that's a pretty arrogant thing to say, isn't it?\nWhy the game is young, right?\nLike it's not that they, they, they had, they clearly pushed the ball forward, but like will it, will we look back in 20 years and say OpenAI was a fundamentally important company?\nI think the truth is some, most companies fail.\nSome companies compound to a billion in value.\nA few each year compound to five billion, one every year to 10 and one every one or two every decade to 100 billion.\nRight?\nThat's just so taking away that quote matter, and I think market cap is a rough proxy for mattering.\nI say that pretty confidently because I believe the capitalist system works and the things that matter the most are valued the most.\nRight?\nWhat I'm disconnecting with a little bit is, and I love what Jason said.\nI just want to come back to, I love what you said.\nI'm at peace with the fact that if the definition of mattering is a hundred billion dollars, I may well complete another 10 years in venture, do it for 40 years, and quote never matter.\nRight?\nAnd I'm actually okay with that.\nYou know, my, I'll take it over my therapist.\nI'll be fine, right?\nBut I know I'll have invested in perfectly good companies that have built real value that create perfectly good businesses that, you know, in some cases are worth 5, 10 billion, and that's okay, right?\nAnd that's probably, I mean, the problem with the only do the things that matter is in the end it tends to some kind of nhilism, which is that nothing else does matter, and I do think that people should wake up every day and have the opinion that they want to do things that are going to matter in the world.\nI'd say the most insulting thing you could ever call me is a market participant, right?\nLike I find that an incredibly insulting, like, yeah, yeah, it's pretty efficient market.\nCapitalism pretty efficient.\nYou pay 150 billion, 120 million.\nWho cares?\nLike it's fine, right?\nAnd like you have a company that's like a billion dollar company that does some stuff, and like fine.\nI'm glad that happened.\nThat's capitalism working, but like then you're really just a cog in the system, right?\nAnd I think that's not a recipe for outsized returns.\nUm, but it is a recipe for doing fine.\nIt's just not my goal.\nI am a cog in the system.\nI am a, I mean, I might want to be more than that, but I think if you're not, Yeah, but I think, No, but you're, you're a hollowed out fun that doesn't matter.\nHarry, you should have asked Aaron Levy when you interviewed him yesterday if he mattered.\nI don't think he matters.\nI don't think Box, I don't think he matters.\nWhat's, I mean, he, he has Aaron Levy.\nOh, Box.\nI, I love, it's nowhere near, I don't think Aaron Levy would say Box is more important than OpenAI.\nI'm confident.\nFor what it's worth, I love Aaron.\nHe's like a, but his company doesn't matter.\nIt's only four, five, six billion.\nIt's irrelevant.\nI completely agree.\nHis company doesn't matter.\nAnd in fact, one of the things I told him when it went public, should he just shut it down tomorrow?\nHis 5.5 billion company.\nAbsolutely not.\nBut it does leave the keys for some random person to come run it from some hedge fund.\nAaron is very excited about AI if you didn't know, right?\nAnd I think part of that is is an opportunity for him and for Box to matter, right?\nBecause Box is, again, he's done an incredible job.\nI'm like very pro Aaron Levy, and what I said to him when the company went public, I said to him, I was like, look, one of the things I most respect about you is you just worked this to make it happen, right?\nLike this was not from a first principle is like an important company, right?\nThis is not like a sexy company, but you just ground it out, and like I really respect that on, like I think that's like an incredible thing to have done, but I think part of the excitement about a lot of founders, but he's wasted his life.\nI mean, Aaron and I started together, so he was 20, if his company doesn't matter, when we started, he was the wonder kid.\nNow he's the greatest CEO I know.\nHe's wasted his whole [ __ ] life is\n\n\nBasically, what you're saying, cuz it doesn't matter. He wasted his life. But he could have sold his... Rory was there. He could have sold his company to Citrix and made hundreds of millions with retention payments in like 2008. So he wasted it, according to you. He wasted the last 16 years of his life. Well, he flushed it down the toilet by doing a B2B company. Money at the IPO. Flushed it down the toilet. Well, I... I think, but look, I do think there's this thing going on right now where there's a lot wasted his life since Citrix. Wasted his [ __ ] life. The poor guy. For what it's worth, I think... I don't know. I think you probably know the math, but my sense is that he actually probably would have made more in that deal than ultimately going public. Now, I don't know where he is now, but like from that cash at 2008 plus his shares in Stripe and Gusto and others. Yeah, he should have just... he should have just founded Allbirds instead of doing Box. If he were a fund manager, he definitely should have sold then. He was not. He's a person and he wants to run it. That's fine. The second thing I say is, I do think there's a lot of exuberance about AI right now from a lot of people who are kind of in these positions. This is a company that's kind of been meh, but maybe there's an angle to not be meh, right? And that's exciting to people. Like I think that's awesome for orgs to try that, but I think it is the race to matter that is becomes interesting. And that's what I think the AI stuff is so interesting in so many cases is some of it's real, some of it's not, but like there is this new opening where people are like, \"Oh my god, does this now matter?\" Right? And like that's kind of like that's kind of the big game to play. Anyway, guys, with that, I'm actually holding up my partner reading, so I'm going to drop. But that was fun. Talk more soon. I love this. As I say, I'm... I hope I have my therapy session set up for tomorrow. I don't matter. I'm hollowed out, but I... but I'll get through it somehow. I'll... I'm sure you will. As my wife says sometimes, go get some Allbirds, Rory. You'll feel better. Go to the mall at Stanford and get a few pair of Allbirds and you'll feel like a winner. Bye, guys. The thing that I do want to go to though now is actually I thought a phenomenal report, which Jason, you did brilliant work on, which was Mary Meeker's AI report. So, I want to go to it though. You posted an incredible thread with 10 fantastic takeaways. I want to hand over to you on which takeaways you found most striking and why and just start there. Look, some of it was obvious. The one I first started off, which is obvious, but I'll tell you why I put it in there anyway, was that ChatGPT is the fastest... even though... even though Sam Lessin said he's not sure it's important, it's the fastest gain of users in... in the history of the world. 0 to 800 million in 17 months. Okay, that's... it took... it took Netflix 15 times longer. It took TikTok five times longer. The rate of adoption... I talked to so many folks, especially in B2B here. They're like, you know, I... I don't know. I don't know that AI can really replace a... a good hardworking marketing manager or... or a good PR person or they say there's too many, you know what they say, Rory, there's too many hallucinations. To me, it was a reminder of the rate of change. I don't think as humans we can process the rate of change of AI. That was my point. I don't... it's so fast that we don't understand almost how quickly it's changing. That was the main point I tried to bring in. So whatever you think... whatever you think AI could do three months ago, it's like super dated. The second one, maybe Rory, you know, you could help me. This is the second one I'm struggling with. I've been struggling with this in AI for three years. Okay. The second Mary Meeker one was showing that the infrastructure spend is unprecedented in the history of the internet. Right. That the big six spent 212 billion on capex. Um, and yeah, the top line's great, but the spend here is insane. I'm just still a little confused where it's going because it's early at the application level. Where is at the... at the application level? Is this all going to coding and support? Is it all going to... to custom data analysis? Is it all going to subsidizing our ChatGPT 20 bucks a month? I just don't... I... I just don't know where all this infrastructure... I think it's... I think it's laying a foundation that is transformational, but I just... it feels so far ahead of the application level. I think you're right. And the hyperscalers have taken very good cash-efficient businesses and they would break Mr. Buffett's heart because they've turned them into capex hogs. Right. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook all have had capex as a percentage of free cash flow go up significantly. Now, as she pointed out, the good news is in the last four or five years, free cash flow themselves have grown. So your cash flow hit hasn't been enormous. It's only been about a 10% decline in free cash flow, right? It hasn't been horrific. In a less generous economic environment, the shareholders of Microsoft might well be screaming and saying, \"Wow, 60 billion and nothing in the show for guys. Come on here.\" Right. So it's been perfect timing. That's been... it's a little actually in that respect like 98, 99. The overall economy has been favorable. The performance of the hyperscalers existing businesses, not their AI businesses, have been pretty damn amazing. And as a result of that, the market's been able to say, \"Guys, knock yourself out. Spend $260 billion.\" You know, I'm sure something will come of it soon. The $600 billion question is, \"Where are the apps?\" Right? And, you know, since then, you know, and it kind of implied, though, they didn't say it. \"Oh my god, there's going to be a correction.\" And obviously, since then, there hasn't been, right? Everyone is just plowing on, right? They're investing the capital and the revenue is coming, but you know, relative to the spend, if someone said to you, \"You can finance a $600 billion capex business and you know, 10... you know, four, five years in, you'd have 10, 15 million billion in revenue and 400 and 585 billion in losses,\" you'd probably say, \"Ah, no, I don't need that right now,\" right? But that's where we're at. We say that on the revenue side, but then, you know, I think end of year next year, OpenAI is going to be at 25 to 30 billion. We saw Anthropic crossed three billion in revenue, up from a billion just 5 months ago. 3x from a billion in 5 months. It always takes time when we're laying infrastructure. Revenue comes later. The variable that we're missing in this discussion in my view is time, right? I totally believe that all the apps will come to fill the space available for it with all this capex. I believe the LLM guys will make amazing [ __ ]. It'll be impressive and businesses will find a way to use it. But to Jason's point, I think if businesses adopt in two years and then the revenue comes quickly, it'll all be fine. If businesses take four or five years to get there, you know, it could be... you could be looking at a more extended period of, you know, you're having the costs but not yet the revenues. I think that's the as yet unknown. How quickly will apps revenue fill the gap? When you look at percent of free cash flow, you said they're 10% and actually investors being okay with that. There's a ceiling to what they are okay with. If it is five years out and that is now 30, 40, is there a ceiling to what investors are okay with? Satya, Larry, Sergey, you name it, spending... I'm sure... yeah, I'm sure that... look, you... I mean, yes, there is, is the answer, and it seems inconceivable today because everyone's like, \"Rah, go for it,\" but you know, public company investors are just mean VCs on steroids. We turn on a dime from \"I can't believe you're not spending more\" to \"What the freak do you mean you're spending so much money?\" And we've lived in '99 where, you know, you'd call the team in and say, \"Double the burn,\" and without blushing, you'd call them in six months later and say, \"Why are you spending so much money? Let's cut.\" Right? If the economy slows down, if your core growth rate starts to decline or slow down significantly, I think you'd see mild to... to reasonable level pressure on... um, all the hyperscalers. I mean, an interesting example would be in a different market, you know, Meta changed its name, wanted to go all in on VR. They're two years in. There's no return. There was a little bit of pressure and I think Zuckerberg heard the pressure and pivoted nicely to, you know, I mean, still spending a lot on virtual reality, but not as much. And there was kind of a little bit of a belt tightening there. So, when the pressure comes on, I think, yeah, I think CEOs respond. You know, it's funny. I do... I... I said this when we chatted last time that if you really... One of the things I admire about Sam Altman, some things I don't understand, admire is how he... he's telling you the future even though if you just got to listen like... Yeah. And... and you know, when he started talking about Stargate, that he alone needed 500 billion just to get going and up to 5 trillion dollars, right? And we got... I'm like, \"What's Stargate? Wasn't that a movie or what do you mean 500 billion?\" But he's socializing the whole market, right? That it's going to be an order of magnitude bigger, right? He's socializing the market here because... because it's... this isn't Amazon. Not only is the size bigger than the classic Amazon investment losses, but you need everyone to go all in on this. You need all the big participants to say, \"We're going all in on this... on this big bet.\" It's not just one company making a... making a big bet. This is all the high... the big companies making a massive bet. I think the interesting question is, you know, there was a time when Amazon stock was perilously low and a whole bunch of banking analysts were sneering and saying they'll go bust, and obviously, in retrospect, they didn't and all those banks did, and Jeff Bezos got to say, \"Nino,\" but there will be bumps along... intuitively. You just know when you're spending half a trillion dollars in advance of revenue, at some point in the next 2 or 3 years, there'll be at least one scary moment, right? And that could be actually an interesting opportunity to invest, but it's hard to believe it's up into the right from here. What... What is a scary moment? Can you just help me visualize that? When we see the commoditization of models, them all becoming very efficient, them all becoming really bloody good. What is a scary moment? Maybe if OpenAI just misses... misses... um, a growth plan, right? If it's just 30 or 40%, if they have two rough quarters for whatever reason, right? Some sort of saturation we're not anticipating, that would set off a mini panic, I think. Agreed. And you know, I was just looking at their numbers. It's interesting. They're exactly 20 years apart. Their numbers versus Google's numbers from 20 years ago. So literally, 2002 is the same as OpenAI as 2022. 2003, I think I'm doing it from memory, is about 1.3 billion for OpenAI, 1.4 billion for Google four years ago, 20 years ago. This year, 2005, 2004, sorry, 3 billion and 3 billion. So, roughly the same. And now, what's interesting is the projections for OpenAI now start to... as yet unrealized projections start to pull way ahead of Google. In other words, OpenAI will... it was the Google of its day until now and is projecting to become twice the Google of its day for the next four years. Now, maybe it will because I think it is a more impressive piece of technology when you use it, but maybe it won't. And if all it is, let's be... let me make the statement clear. If all OpenAI is is just as good as Google, then it's going to miss its number next year by about 40%. I'm simply saying that the expectations are so high that anything less than freaking amazing could feel like a fail, even though in any logical terms, it isn't. Just as Amazon wasn't a fail in 2001, 2002, it was just in retrospect minor growing pains that a panicky market interpreted, \"Oh my god, they're going bust.\" No, they're just building a business where it's going to take three to four billion dollars of losses to get to cash flow, break even, and then you're going to make billions every year. Yeah. Right. Jason, just to be clear, we're going to do a visual of Rory looking mean with OpenAI doesn't matter. No, no one else in the frame. No one else in the frame. You're such a dick with your captions, Harry. I just want to say that and you get me into trouble, but I'll give you up. You got to do it. You want... You want to do the third point because it's kind of interesting that I brought up. Keep going. No, keep going. Because this is when we stop talking like Elon, you know, you could make... you could... you could have opinions on Elon Musk, right? But now that he's out of government, man, the guy is direct, right? He was direct today. He said, \"This... this spending bill is ridiculous for all parties,\" right? And he's been talking about China with AI, right? Right? And Mary Meeker's number three point was, \"We're missing what's happening in China,\" which is natural. We're not even connected to them on the internet. We have different internets, right? Her point was, you know, it was X months ago we thought Deepseek was going to change the world. It didn't, right? But 93% performance at the time of OpenAI's 03 Mini for a fraction of the cost. Alibaba, which we can't even use here, right? Outperforms both by Ernie, which I don't even know, 2% the cost of GPT4.5. And um... I don't know what to make of it, but people smarter than me are worried about China and AI. That was kind of her third point. And we... we... we've stopped talking about safety and I think we've stopped talking about China. I mean, the simpler point is probably some version of, you know, I think ChatGPT will be the Apple level quality.\n\n\nProduct, but there'll be a whole bunch of Android type quality products that are out there that will just keep pricing honest.\nUm, if they're commercially available, you know, universally, and I don't think, to Jason, to your point, obviously, if the models are built in there, there's two separate issues.\nIf the models are built in China, we won't be accessing them here.\nH, just even if we were even legally allowed, my guess is corporate America wouldn't want to, right?\nBut the interesting thing about the meta point about Deepseek was that it was possible to get quite close, quite cheaply, and a whole bunch of, and you know, you're going to see that independent of China, just in terms of competition here.\nBut I think the undeniable fact is we ain't a monopoly anymore.\nIt's not two or three companies monopolistically producing LLMs.\nThere are four or five companies the other side of the pond cranking them out.\nAnd I think Mary made that point.\nJason, were there any others that you think were specifically relevant for B2B?\nWell, maybe just two more.\nUm, and you can, you can shut me up.\nThe second one, which is like, which we all know, but I think it's very useful to see it simplified and compressed into a chart, which is, cuz this folks still get this wrong in B2B today.\nToken costs collapse 99.7% in two years.\nNow, if you're a developer, if you're, if you're sitting in Windsurf or lovable all day, you get this.\nAnd it's not this simple because you're consuming many more tokens, right?\nBut every, all these like, you know, ill-fitting Blazer and jeans SaaS guys who are saying it's too expensive or the mediocre VP of engineering that don't code anymore, who haven't coded in five years that are constantly telling me why AI is too expensive and don't work.\nLike, find a new job, right?\nIf tokens collapse 99.7% in the next two years, you can tell me, Rory, but I don't know where they're going to be in two years, but it's at least going to be exponential decrease in, in absolute cost per token, right?\nWe'll use more, right?\nTraining costs will go up, but I even today in June, if when I, I, I want to just jump off the roof when I hear a VP of engineering that doesn't code anymore saying it's too expensive to do enough AI in the product.\nLike, we, we'd like to do this, Rory, at our B2B workflow company, but we can't.\nIt's too expensive.\nUh, Mr., Mr. board of director, like, I just want to tell, I tell the CEO to fire that guy.\nYeah, you, you, you should pummel him to debt because, um, you're exactly right because there's some things I'm angsty about in terms of the road ahead in terms of the economics of it, but just from a raw information, knowledge, intelligence, for lack of a better word, is just going to get cheaper and cheaper, faster and faster.\nThere's going to be, there's just intelligence is available at a price that's declining, you know, by log or log orders of magnitude every freaking year.\nThat's just huge.\nAnd therefore, I mean, it's, it's, as I say, one of my boards where I've a wildly smart, a core AI model as a fellow board member, it just repeats over and again, so you can't do it today, build the product, by the time you've built it, the stuff will be cheaper, it'll work, and if it doesn't work, then it'll work six months from now, and he's totally right, right?\nSo you, that's the big trend that you're all leaning into, right?\nWhich is the cost of intelligence, a unit of intelligence, the price of a unit of intelligence is plummeting every month.\nTherefore, anything that you control intelligence at will get cheaper every month.\nJust lean into it.\nThe models will make it happen.\nI call it the AI slow roll.\nAnd I think it's the number one thing killing B2B companies is the AI slow roll.\nYes.\nYou mean we're talking about it.\nWe're, we're going to roll something out in Q4.\nWe're going to do a limited release in, in Q4, Rory.\nAnd then next year, if it goes well, we're going to roll it out to a little bit more of our base, right?\nYou're just going to be slaughtered.\nThat's actually a fun discussion because it is so hard to watch companies turn on a dime and, you know, push towards the new thing, right?\nAnd, you know, we're talking when Sam was on early.\nI give Aaron huge credit.\nHe's like, \"We're going to do this.\nIt's going to be top down, right?\nI mean, the quintessential example is Facebook just after the IPO this year deciding mobile is it, strap ourselves into the office, we're just going to get it done,\" and it takes top down leadership and I agree if you don't do that and if you don't do it well, you're just going to be slow toast over the next two years and it's just hard to do, it's just hard to shake companies out of their inertia because you'll always feel that doing a little means at least you're trying so that gives you points and that's the problem with startups doing a thinking they get points for doing a little right here.\nYeah, exactly.\nI thought, I thought it was fantastic.\nI had Verun, the founder of Windsurf, on the show.\nIt released on Monday.\nUh, and he said, \"Listen, startups beat incumbents because of existential dread.\nIf you are in a startup and you don't ship great product and it converts to sales, you lose.\nIf you are in an incumbent and you don't ship great product that converts and you're a great engineer, you're definitely getting reassigned and re-reallocated.\nYou're not going to lose great engineers.\nYou're just going to put them on different products.\"\nSee, you know, that's the problem with B2B today versus where Verun is.\nI don't see enough existential dread in most B2B startups.\nI don't see it.\nAaron has it.\nYam had it when she was on stage.\nShe's Aaron and Yamin at Saster this year.\nI mean, Rory, Rory, Scale's investor, both.\nThey both said the same thing.\nWe're so excited and we're scared.\nI don't see enough existential dread in B2B startups.\nI don't see it.\nI see, you know, a little bit of some discussion.\nI want to walk into a board meeting and and see a little bit of shaking because there's so much going on in the world and they just had yet another hackathon this last weekend and they're rolling out AI voice agents on Wednesday.\nLike, if that's not you, I, I honestly think you're going to fail.\nYou want dread.\nDread.\nVerun's right, cuz Verun, I mean, Verun at at Windsurf, he has, he's had three different companies in 18 months, right?\nAnd every month he's at risk of being displaced every month, right?\nHe and he's honest about it.\nHe was honest on 20VC, right?\nWe need more of that in B2B, not this slow roll, right?\nYeah, I know.\nSo, the other point she made, which, which we knew if you want, but I really think for B2B, this is super interesting because she, a lot of stuff she said like, like pricing and, but this is one to slow down on.\nUm, uh, and and Harry sometimes jokes that he's old, but this is where Harry is old for real.\nHer point was the next 32% of the world is just coming online right now.\nThey will all be AI first.\nShe says they'll use voice agents, agent-driven interfaces and national language interactions.\nI think that is to 2025.\nI think what I do know is that this generation will not use the internet remotely like we do.\nThey will not use lead contacts and opportunities.\nThey will not use files.\nFiles are disappearing overnight.\nKids do not know what a file is.\nIt does not matter.\nAnd it, it will, and everything will be MCPed or AIed.\nAnd this is an existential threat.\nLike if I'm Aaron or Yam, like these are S tier SaaS CEOs, I got to worry about AI today, right?\nI got to worry about agents, I got to worry about automation, and then I got to worry about what happens when no one uses these applications remotely like they use them today.\nLike, you really think that the next generation is going to like, like even understand what a Salesforce UI is?\nIt won't even make sense to them, they'll never use it, right?\nMy, my son helped us at SaaS this year.\nWe have a, a, a SaaS platform we use for like tickets and, and he's like, \"Wow, this is the first time I've seen software like this.\"\nWow.\nAnd he codes every day.\nAnd and I, I do think that is true.\nI think in front of every system of record, there's going to be some system of work that does it, and it'll sit on top of the system of record for now.\nAnd if it does a good job, it will gradually displace, make irrelevant, or replace the system of record if they allow that to happen.\nYeah.\nRight.\nThe AI that's doing the work, and I can never take the AI that's closest to you is the worker.\nIf I'm the worker, if the, if the thing that I interact with every day that helps me do my job, over time, that just become the most important thing in my life, and anything back behind that doesn't matter.\nSo if I'm a sales rep and I have a lot of automation, voice automation, AI, SDR, whatever, telling me what to do, doing things for me, act where I'm acting as a controller of the agents, that's just going to become mentally my model of what a CRM is.\nAnd back behind that, yeah, there might be some database called Salesforce, but I just won't care, right?\nAnd there might even be multiple ones, you won't care.\nYou won't care if the company's using Salesforce and HubSpot and Adio and its own database.\nNo, I think the smart companies can reimagine what those workflows look like and built to it.\nAnd that's obviously what they're trying to do.\nBut if you, if you fail, if you're not relevant in terms of how your next generation of workers use AI, you will eventually be displaced.\nI mean, it might take a long time.\nI think, as I've always said, I think Salesforce instances will be there at scale long after I'm dead, but the value accretion will all go to the technology that's helping me do my job, not the technology that's count keeping score on how well my job's been done.\nThe one I'm really struggling with today, and I, I have asked Aaron and others this, right?\nUm, is, um, I think that it's, it's, it's early, but it's, I think MCP is an existential threat to almost every SaaS app, and now you can MCP into Notion, you can MCP a little bit into HubSpot, but it's very limited, right?\nYou can MCP into Google calendar.\nI just don't know why if I can just talk to my, my AI, my cler chat GPT and do everything I want to do at HubSpot elegantly, I don't know why I would ever log into HubSpot or ever even learn what HubSpot is.\nThat's Sam's perspective though, isn't it really?\nWhich is that, you know, in an agentic first world or an agent first world, you basically have all of these applications that become databases and then agents basically become the data transporters and you never need to engage with the core database then.\nYeah, I thought it was too nerdy when he started saying it, right?\nAnd too technical, too Microsofty.\nI thought it was too Microsofty, right?\nBut time goes by and now that I can see MCP applications just starting.\nAnd the problem today is you need to listen, I'm not an expert, but everything I've tried, you need a key.\nSo a key is annoying, right?\nI got to go to some website.\nI got to get a secret key and I got to add it to my thing.\nBut when those keys go away and I can just talk to all my apps through my through my chat GPT or Claude, man, I just don't think we're ready for this world.\nI don't think we're ready for this world.\nAnd I'll give you an a personal example.\nLike Harry knows, there's a company I invested in, um, that I, I love called Mangle Mint, okay?\nAnd it's, it's, it's next generation SaaS for spas, doctor's offices, and the like.\nOkay?\nThey're coming up on 25 million.\nLove the co to death.\nWould do anything with them.\nLike he was all over MCP the day he could use it.\nOkay?\nAnd he's like, \"Here's the problem for me.\nLet me be clear.\"\nAnd he's the best in his space.\nThat's why they were able to do it, right?\nNot a huge TAM, lots of issues.\nLike now, let's say I want, I want an appointment at, uh, what, what's at Watercourse Way in Palo Alto, right?\nWhere, where Rory goes to decompress after, uh, after a tough, tough pod totally, and let's, but right now he might have to figure out which application they use, do they use Mangle Mint, do they, which of the var, what do they use it?\nMCP if it can just abstract away and you'll have no more relationship with this application, and like he's like, I could become a pipe overnight, right?\nAnd he's already completely changed his value proposition because of that, because like, if I don't change what I'm doing today, no one will even know which of these applications, and Harry's invested in some adjacent companies, not in this space, but you might not know, you might not know which restaurant application it is, which spa application.\nIt might not matter.\nAnd it's very difficult for me to imagine you can increase your prices in that world.\nMaybe you can increase your prices.\nI can tell you one thing, dude.\nIf you're doing SaaS for spars, you definitely don't matter according to Sam.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nI mean, I wouldn't even restaurants, you are just not even in the conversation, dude.\nWe're both doctor's offices, spas, but he was, he was, he was in a good way.\nHe was, it was a instant wakeup call.\nHe's like, if I don't address, if I don't add even more value, I will be partially obsolete because people won't even know who I am anymore.\nThey'll just use AI to just to just go out and be and pick it for them.\nAnd I'll be quite, but I just, he's right, Sachi, it just took, I'm not as smart as him.\nAnd he's anytime everyone starts talking about agentic this and that, I start to roll my eyes.\nIt's too nerdy, right?\nThe real world doesn't think about agentic this.\nBut the world does think, can I go to chat GPT and get my haircut?\nI mean, Rory's, Rory's upgraded his haircut for the show.\nLooks good, right?\nThank you.\nBut, uh, why can't my chat GBT just figure out where's the best haircut in the mid peninsula and do it for me?\nWhy do I have to like do these\n\n\nApps? The closer you are to what the customer or the user wants to do, the more right you have to swallow anything that's behind that. And that's really what you're saying. If do you want to be the person who keeps track of who's coming to the spa, or do you want to be the software that helps decide who's coming to the spa? I want to be the decider. I don't want to be the tracker because tracking on its own is inherently just not as valuable as a thing to bring to market.\n\nSo yeah, the long-term trend is clear here. I do not like it. It's very interesting that DHS is on the bleeding edge of this, um, for HubSpot, and I think HubSpot is threatened by MCP, but he's, I mean, I think he's doing the right thing. You got to like Aaron, you got to embrace it, right, and learn from it and get better. But like, it's just, you know, HubSpot is a system of record too. Yeah, it's a very good one. It's a very valuable one, and I does HubSpot really want everybody abstracting away all their structured data and using it however they want in their own applications and their own CRM and their own marketing applications?\n\nThe incumbents will last a long time, but that doesn't matter, cuz what matters to us is where the next new dollar goes and what could happen. And you know, remember we're all about the next 100 million of new ARR coming on, and it's hard, and I that could comfortably go to these next-generation products, while at the same time SAP can compound for the next decade happily, right? But they want, they won't be getting the new money. Our job is to find the companies that get the new dollar, not to find, and and you don't have to have a world. One of the big ahas for me has been quote unquote last generation companies can compound happily for years on their existing base on expanding within those customers, while at the same time effectively you're signing new customers who are saying that that old thing is not where the world is going anymore. But it just has such momentum, it just keeps on compounding. But that's okay for that as a public company. For you as a venture investor trying to find the new new thing, it's all about the much smaller dollars in budgets that are available for the new stuff, cuz that's the only money we can live off. We can't take the SAP budget for our new product for the next 10 years. We got to take the new companies or the new functionality that sits on top of those apps, be it SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, etc. And it's hard to imagine in 2025 knowing what we do about AI to say, \"I've been thinking we really should build a screen just like the other SAP screens.\" That's not where it's going to go. Every company's market share is up for grabs when there's a platform shift. The very biggest ones don't go to zero. They just slow down. But you're right, the mid-tier ones can really hit a wall, right? And if you're running one of these companies and you're not afraid and you're not 110% focused, you're almost certainly going to fail. And the only question is over what period of time. Turns out, yeah, making money is hard, keeping money is harder.\n\nGuys, can I just roll to one thing we said about not being a public markets investor? Everyone loves the analysis we do on your chimes of the world that we have done in the past. There've been a lot coming out in terms of M&As and IPOs. There's Chime obviously this week. There's Grow filed for an IPO. It's an Indian IPO. Shien moving IPO from London to Hong Kong, maybe finally getting that one out. Amada Health coming out for a $1.1 billion price. Circle files for IPO at 8 billion. Salesforce acquires Informatica at 8 billion. Of those free-for-all, which one do you think's most interesting? I I'll hit two. I do think Circle's interesting, right? Just cuz it's a fun business model. It's basically it's a it's like a Bitcoin-enabled money market fund. And you know, they get your money, they're able to invest it in treasuries, they get a nice yield, they have to share some of that money, um, with customers, with distribution partners, and they build a perfectly nice business there, right? And you valuation that around 18 plus or minus reasonable. It's just an it's an interesting business. It's got like it's like a 43, 44 billion the way think a $44 billion money market fund where they're getting roughly four or 5%. So just under two billion in revenue, and then they have to share a lot of that with distribution partners, and you know, so they have a net interest margin. It's just like a little mini bank type thing, and then they have opex, and they make a couple hundred million bucks a year, right? Perfectly good business. It's the boring version of crypto. Crypto but safe. I think it'll be an interesting IPO. Yeah. I think it's bounded in terms of value because there's no magic explosion thing. It's very clear how the model works. Anyone financial can figure it out and value it. But I think it's interesting.\n\nJason, over to you. What you like? The question was the most interesting M&A or other transaction, Harry, was that? Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you the one to me that was the most interesting, although I'm still trying to fully understand it, right, was that Snowflake bought probably almost pre-revenue startup called Crunchy Data, which is a Postgress implementation, right, after Data Bricks bought its own Postgress database company Neon for a billion. Yeah. Okay. And I assume Neon had some real revenue, right? Um, I 250 million for Snowflake suggests to me they're buying, um, some distribution. But the fact that trying to understand to this conversation how AI shifts the battles that Snowflake and Data Bricks now need to be database companies to some level in a year or two could be like fundamental change and all these lines blurring, right, instead of Snowflake figuring out how to work with all these different Postgress providers and open sourced and forked versions and all the different databases, now they're database companies. Yes, they need their own custom databases so their agents can efficiently work on all the data that's been leaked and stored here. But pretty interesting within 60 days, including one yesterday, they both became database companies. It's a big change. It's a big change. Would be a data warehousing company. But I think what it really is is feeling the need to support all the different types of data structures and as you say, morphing from a world where the the typical snowflakes data is, you know, data warehouse type data to now the kind of data used for AI. So feeling the need to support a wider variety of data types and data structures. Yeah, they're both, and it actually segues to those are the two, you know, I nearly said, this is funny. I nearly said those are the two publicly traded companies. And then I remember Data Bricks isn't publicly traded. It's just as if it was a public company and it should be, of course, and it will be, but you got Snowflake and p as public. You got Data Bricks, and then Harry, you're going to ask about it in a second, but companies like ClickHouse, which are, you know, exploding company in the kind of database space, col database that's really seeing explosive growth and just raised a big late stage round, I think around 6 billion from, you know, a host of who's who, all of them kind of this is the AI plumbing business is a great place to be, right? And if you're even adjacent to it, like I would argue five or six years ago Snowflake wasn't in it, they were adjacent to it, so they're trying to fearlessly move into it. I think the Data Bricks advantage was they were in it from the start. It was kind of their thing, moving data and then ultimately, you know, using moving data which enabled for AI. So venture guys make really good thematic bets about the next 10 years and are pretty horrible at assessing how the market's going to react to the next quarter's data. Hedge fund guys are the exact opposite. They literally, some of them, you know, the overnight traders don't even want to think about the big picture trend. It's just like, is this EPS number over or underestimate? And will the stock go up or down? And that's just a different skill set. I'm no good at that. Proof that we're all no good at. It's a fun thing you can do when you have a public company. You're on the board of a company. You have some interesting results. You're about to announce. Some things are better than expected. Some things are worse. You can go around. I've seen this over and over again. You can go around the boardroom and ask people, \"Here's what we said. Here's what we're going to announce tomorrow. Will the stock go up or down?\" at best 50% accuracy often. Oh, I've seen that over and over again. It's like, hm, we think these things are great, and then you go out and everyone glums on to the other thing. Sometimes the stock goes down and you thought it was going up and you want to cry. Other times it goes up and you're like, hm, okay. So, it it it's kind of like two worlds talking past each other sometimes.\n\nCan I ask one more final one for Koshi quickfire, which is just, um, I see obviously new batches out this week, and they're raising, and everyone's doing 10% dilution for the round total. You guys are much more experienced than me. I'm very lucky to learn from you. I appreciate our relationships. Really, like, how do we play in a world where the total round is 10%? Our fund sizes are bigger, and really you've got seven and a half for a lead and two and a half for angels. Jason, how would you advise me?\n\nYou do YC very well. Well, first, I think at YC, it's not 20. I think the new deal they're trying to do with a lot of startups is at least 50 to 60 post for for even pre-revenue. There's a ton of deals in this batch at that level. So that's what they're pushing toward. And no criticism. Like you got to, you got to see YC as a business, or the stuff will drive you nuts. You have to admire the game that's being played on the field, right? Which is, you know, when YC went to 15, people thought it was crazy, and then 20, and now it's they're trying to get everyone to 50 to 60 that are AI, that just have AI, which is 70% of the batch. That's the goal. That's as far as I can see. There are plenty of folks raising at 50 to 60 or more with essentially no revenue, right? With with very little revenue. Um, so I didn't So that doesn't change the ownership question, but it does make it all even harder, right? Because because then the A has to be at like, you know, 200 for for the math to really pencil out, right? Uh, this is this is what what I taught investing is like for for for seed investing to really make sense, the next round should be 3x to justify the risk. And for A or B, it's got to be 2x or you should just wait. You should just wait for the next round because not that it's that simple, but intellectually it seems about right. Right. So, but uh, I don't know. I think you gota you can either play that game and buy as much as you can or you can cry on it on on the internet. Um, all I can tell you my little analysis of YC is I've ended up owning about a little less than half of what I would have. That's one guy's analysis because you I've bought more. I bought more in Revenue Cat. I bought a lot more revenue. I bought more in Algolia. I've bought more in others that have done reasonably well. You can buy more in the next round, right? But but it only works unless you have a massive fund. There's only so much you can buy in the next round, right? I mean, you run out of you run out of money, don't you? So, you're going to end up owning maybe half. But Gary would tell you since 30% of the batch is unicorns, it don't matter.\n\nI think Jason, first of all, I couldn't interesting, could not agree more. I think it's what you said right at the start about they're doing their job and they're doing it well. It's one of the best business. value proposition to founders is we'll take you two unknown guys or gals from unknown place and we'll turn you into something that god bless these people in Silicon Valley, they'll value at 20 to 40 to 50 million pre, and their success is a function of the more they can do that, the more people are going to want to come in, the higher quality people they're going to be able to attract. They're doing their job and they're doing it well, right? So you're right, bitching and moaning is a waste of time, right? All you can do is do your job well, right, in response. And you know, it's that's obviously not the stage we play at. We typically play at a round round and a half later. But the only weapon you have on your side of the table for the if you're going to pursue those deals is picking. You obviously have to be way better at picking or you have to find other sources of deals, right? I mean, you know, by definition, I mean, what's happening is as the pricing goes up, they will be correct on the winner deals. it won't matter because it never matters on the winner deals. But, you know, if your rule is only do, I mean, if if your if your advice is only do good deals, it's not really that actionable. I mean, I'm trying to only good good do good deals, but it's really hard in practice, right? You know, the truth is when you're paying significantly more per unit, it's just a lot harder to make money, your picking has to be much more fine grained, right? That's just yes, they've done a great job representing their side, which is I mean again going back to I give him credit, the Paul Graeme stated intent make it easier to found companies. He's making it easier and more profitable and more attractive for entrepreneurs to found companies. More companies will be founded, sorry, founded. It's I don't I don't think it's I think the own the thing is listen, I guess it's the same math, right? But there's plenty of ways to justify paying60 million in a seed round. Okay, if it's if it's a generational company, what's harder, even though the M you can do it on a spreadsheet, if you have a fixed fund size, it's harder to take the low ownership. The low ownership crushes you, right? And so you can say, listen, this is low risk and this is the best team ever, but when you end up with 3% ownership with a large fund, that's the\n\n\nOne and, and that's where I think there's the slight fallacy in the YC data.\nAnd I love Gary and I love the team, but that's a model that for folks that either are angels or have tiny funds or don't need to have a fund returner or a material impact, right?\nIt's just the math works better if it don't tie that to fund size.\nI think I don't know how you do make return a lot of funds with 3% though.\nAt the end of the day, until the only thing that makes this whole process work and kind of normalizes errors and kind of corrects for overvaluation is ultimately returns.\nYeah.\nCorrection on this kind of issue is a lagging issue is a lagging indicator.\nIf these in fact are on average overpriced, then five or seven years from now the people invest in them will slowly realize they've made a mistake and, you know, pricing will come down.\nBut the weird thing about venture is it just takes a long time.\nTakes a long time.\nYou know, it'll take 10 years to discover if the eight billion dollar funds work and deliver an acceptable return.\nIt'll take 8 years to figure out can you pay 60 pre for an AI Ycombinator startup and make money on average.\nAlong the way, there'll be an anecdote of one company that worked, but the real test is does the overall asset class work for those prices of deals.\nAnd so far, Gary's exactly right.\nHe cites the data.\nThe data from the earlier batches has been obviously amazing.\nBut, you know, the synagogue says if it worked at 20 and gave you a 3x and then you pay 60, you do the math here, people, you know, your returns going to go down by the same amount.\nBut not for YC.\nAnd the founders get 6 million instead of 2 million.\nThere's a lot of conceits for venture.\nAnd so many VCs are like, \"Hey guys, take less money at a lower valuation.\nIt's less risk.\"\nThere's a VC conceit in that one.\nA third the money is riskier if you if you don't burn it, right?\nWhich is a if assuming you don't burn it, three times as much money for the same dilution derisks your your life as a founder, right?\nThe second thing that the grouchy people miss is one of the other things that YC is quietly normalized is if you do this round next week at 60 or last week, right, at 60 post and you have to do the next round at 20, it's okay.\nYeah, it's actually they're all this safes are a beautiful vehicle like yes you'll you will folks will end up every time safes convert there's 11,000 different prices right there's my best friend that invested 3 weeks before the batch then there's the alumni price then there's the price Harry paid then there's the price Lin had to pay on demo day and then there's the poor price Rory had to pay two weeks later right so when these notes convert at 11 prices and then there's another set of notes at 14 other prices nobody cares nobody cares that one was at 60 or one was at as long as Rory gets his ownership in the series B.\nUm, listen guys, is there any other IPOs, anything that we've missed that we should discuss?\nNo, honestly, I think the most salient fact is that they're happening, that the window is open, that normal IPOs, I mean, I think normal IPOs are taking place, normal service has been resumed.\nI know we glossed over it in the beginning, but I do think Tomo Bravo raising a record fund this week is a good sign, too.\nIt's $35 billion to buy B2B companies, almost entirely B2B, right?\nSo, so something a friend of mine used to say years ago, and it's always struck me.\nIt's just so true.\nPrice clears all markets.\nIn other words, if you, you know, you can get deal, it's it we're seeing it now is you can't get your deal done at 25, which is the price you billion, which is the price you paid for the last one.\nBut there is a price at which most decent companies can get public at, you know, above a certain critical mass.\nPrice clears all markets.\nThat's what price is meant to do.\nAnd what you're seeing now and it is a degree of realism creeping in and as a result of that transactions taking place.\nIt's totally healthy.\nI agree.\nAll righty.\nWe're going to do a cowi quickfire.\nAs I said, this is like the prediction marketplace my team adores.\nSo, we're going to go with the first one.\nWill OpenAI Johnny Ive device have a screen?\nYes or no?\nWell, I your team didn't ask when, right?\nYes.\nThank you, Jason.\nYou've got it.\nSo, here's my thesis.\nListen, if you read the internet, it says that it'll be it'll be a pendant on your neck and it'll have no screen.\nAnd even Sam's alluded to that, right?\nIt's going to be a a voice interaction device.\nI think though, and I this is just now now I'm not a consumer guy, but I I'm pretty into this stuff.\nOkay.\nI think the only thing that makes sense, and this is why you buy Johnny Ive, is it's everything.\nSo, it's a pendant on your neck.\nIt's an app in your phone.\nIt is listening on our computers.\nIt is listening on our laptops.\nIt is a ring like Aura.\nAnd importantly, it's a it's a it's a AirPod, right?\nBecause AirPod is great.\nAirPod already does all this.\nAnd if you build all of them and the sunglasses like Meta.\nIf you build all of them eventually like some combin, you got to have a watch.\nSo, you you just people do watch.\nIf you do all of them and they're all Johnny Ive level, you solve this problem because we're not all guys sitting in a coffee shop with three things on the bar and our triple espressos.\nSo some my, you know, my son's wears AirPods 12 hours a day.\nRory probably will do the necklace cuz he likes that kind of open the button shirt, hang out with the necklace, gold chain kind of look, right?\nHawaiian shirt.\nHarry will have the sunglasses, the polarized sunglasses with his uh with his AI in the land of no sun.\nSo yeah, yours will have AI.\nNow there may be a screen in it.\nSo I think the so I I'm just having this I have thought about I think that the the first thing that comes out will be no but ultimately it will be all of it.\nIt will be yes it'll have audio.\nIt'll have screen.\nIt'll be everything.\nIt'll be in those sunglasses.\nUm because I don't think anyone's going to figure out a new paradigm.\nHe's just going to figure out how it's all elegant.\nI don't wear a eyewatch or whatever you call them.\nRight.\nBut I might wear his his watch, right?\nYou're saying you're saying yes.\nI I think the hit the the the family the family of devices will have a screen.\nRory, yeah, I'll probably go with Jason's answer in an uninformed way.\nI think the when question is more interesting and will it work?\nI mean, the interesting question would have been, will the device sell more than 5 million units in the first full year of shipping?\nAnd I would take the under.\nIt might be 50 bucks though.\nThat's the thing.\nYou could they have enough money to subsidize it.\nIs it true?\nUm, dude, I I would I would take the over on that and Okay.\nSee, that's a fun bet.\nDo that.\nYou want to do that as a bet?\nYeah, fine.\nDone.\nGreat.\nAmazing.\nWhat What are we going to betar?\nWe'll figure it out.\nYou know what?\nYou can buy me the device when I beat you.\nSold.\nThere we go.\nDone.\nYeah.\nJason, when they sell 5 million in the first year, I will buy you the 5 million and one.\nAbsolutely.\nDone.\nOh, that's wonderful.\nAnd if not, you buy me dinner at a restaurant of my choosing.\nDone.\nIf if it's $50, I'm [ __ ] on that trade, but okay, cool.\nYou're highly confident.\nWill Meta release an AI model that isn't open source this year?\nThey don't appear to be able to release a lot right now.\nThey appear to be having some kind of gear grinding internally.\nMy guess is that would be a decision based on some perceived na security issues around open source.\nOther than that, I see no reason to change the bet they're currently on, which has been the open source bet.\nSo no in the absence of DC intervention is my call.\nYou know we we underestimate the importance of llama in portions of the developer community and it's not it's already not fully open right it's not fully open.\nUm I I it's not you know you you you don't we don't even know what data set it's trained on.\nSo I would say the one thing you know from these guys going even they are in levies but but Zuck's on another level hyper competitive right and if releasing a fully closed source model brings makes them more competitive I I think they will I think it's more than 35%.\nI'm with you I think it's a yes I think Zach knows that he needs to I wouldn't bet against Zach on that final one Elon Musk is yeah out of public life as much and back into Tesla and everything in between.\nWill Elon be out as Tesla CEO before 2027?\nTo be clear, I read that as an odds bet.\nIn other words, it's not just yes, no, it's a 30.\nThey're saying 2/3 pro.\nThey're saying it's only a one-/ird chance that that happens.\nCorrect.\nYeah.\nI don't think it's likely.\nI don't think it's the base case, but you never discount the random event.\nI mean, I don't know the guy's motivation from Adam, but you know, it's it's been kind of painful on every dimension.\nAnd, you know, coming back, it's probably not going to be fun.\nAnd so, you you can never discount a rage quit, I suppose, would be that, especially when you have the fun of SpaceX and XAI to go to.\nSo, you don't do it because you think it's likely.\nYou do it because you think the odds on the the Kali bet are low enough are high enough in terms of return that it's not a crazy thing to do.\nListen, he's not the CEO of his other companies for a reason.\nI don't think he wants to be CEO of Tesla.\nI just don't think he could find anybody, right?\nI think he he had his CTO.\nI I I forget how you pronounce his name.\nJB Strable.\nIs that how you say his name?\nI think he wanted him to be the be the CEO of Tesla when he was ready.\nI think the problems were huge.\nHe needed to be the Sam Lessin of Tesla.\nHe needed to be the face.\nUm and the problems were to do everything, electric, AI, automation, trucks.\nIt just was so intense.\nHe had to be the CEO, but he wasn't the founder.\nAnd I think if he could find someone better now that he's out of that administration and now that he's reflecting on life, right, and working harder, I think if by the end of 2027 that I think this is the question, by the end of 2027 or end of 2026 is the bet, right?\nBefore 27, can he in the next 18 months find someone better than him for the job?\nI say actually more than 32%.\nYeah, you see, I'll go 50%.\nYeah.\nSo, that means I got to say yes on this bet.\nIs that how it works?\nThat's what it means.\nYou know, you think that Yes.\nI mean, he didn't even like pick someone very good for for Twitter.\nWhat's her name?\nShe's terrible.\nRight.\nLinda's I mean, and he could also find a nominal CEO for Tesla.\nHe could find someone that's better than her, right?\nBut he could still run the company like he does Twitter or X, right?\nSo, I think it's more than 50% because he can't scale as a human being CEO of Tesla and Neurolink and SpaceX and going to Mar.\nit just you just can't do it.\nSo he's now that he's out of the administration.\nI think he will try to recruit somebody just like Mark Benioff will.\nMark Benioff's tried four or five times to get out too.\nHe's hired three other co-CEOs, right?\nIt just hasn't worked.\nIt just hasn't bounced the right way.\nI just want to throw it out that there is the complexity of the great comp package that has been held up by Delaware judge who clearly just has a thing about stopping him and that's got to be kind of run to ground.\nBut yeah, there's enough complexity there that just as a pure betting person, I'm I'm kind of with Jason.\nYou look at the odds and you go, it mightn't be the right thing to happen.\nIt mightn't be what you want, but hey, it's not a crazy outcome just given the amount of change that's going on right now.\nAnd um also, to be honest, from the Tesla brand perspective, it might allow them to put some distance between their customer base and a fairly controversial person.\nSo I I could totally see it happening.\nI also think when you look at the time difference there 18 months now till 2027.\nYou look at how X AI and Grock are going for him.\nThey're recent raise as well.\n18 months is so long in AI.\nElon is a master of moving to the most impactful thing in the world that he has.\nIt could be that.\nIt could be.\nAnd I think you see the performance issues at Twitter and the realization that he is a human still.\nHe's not.\nYeah.\nAnd that realization comes home to Roose and he actually goes, \"Fuck it.\nI need management teams.\"\nI mean, he recruited Ilia to OpenAI, right?\nHe's The guy can recruit.\nLet's not lose sight of that.\nHis most talented CEO.\nWell, don't hate on Twitter.\nThat was an impossible job.\nGwen Shotwell appears to be one of the most amazing managers ever down there at SpaceX.\nI mean, you know, sending rockets up and mo most of the time having them work and building an amazing business.\nThat's just been stunning management.\nSo, you know, you have to think he wants to reproduce that if he can now that he has a moment to reflect.\nHe's like, \"Can I have a Gwen for for different company?\nIt's public.\nThere's drama.\nThere's comp issues.\"\nBut he's got to be he's got to have thought for a decade how.\nAnd I think he did try with his CTO, but now that he can try again, I got to find my Gwen.\nI got I can't survive with with the 58 kids and the 11 companies if I don't find one.\nRight.\nYeah.\nThe kids is a pretty pretty big load to be fat.\nYeah.\nThat's a I mean, good god.\nGuys,\n\n\nNo politics,\nno personalities. Let's leave families\nout. Okay, fair point. No politics, no\nfamilies. It's just a cognitive load.\nThat's all. It is a cognitive load.\nTotally. Even Elen only has 24 hours a\nday. Turns out and the Neuralink round\nthis week. I thought that was\nfascinating. But guys, listen. I always love this. You know it. There's\nThis week was a spicier week. Um we made\nit through. Um we still all love each\nother. This was much very cordial.\nSo, thank you for doing this as always.\nIt's the highlight of my week and I\nreally appreciate you both.\nAll right, to infinity and beyond. Thank\nyou, Harry. Are we back, guys?\n",
