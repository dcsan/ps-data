I could imagine an entire IPO cycle where, once again, neither of the two names decided chose to go out, and we get to the end of the year. I'm starting to lose confidence in the old guard. In situations of ambiguity, the person who has the most leverage has the best chance to win. And I would argue Microsoft has quite a lot of leverage, cuz it's not existential for them, especially now. I think they have no leverage. Actually, honestly, I'm not trying to be a chaos agent like our prior guest. Ready to go,\n[Music]\nguys. I'm so excited for this. It is my favorite time of the week, and oh my god, what a week of news we have to go through. Uh, we're also thrilled to be joined by Garrett from Handshake. So, I wanted to start with the news of Scale and the acquisition there. And so I'm gonna start with obviously Scale, 14.83 billion to Meta. I wanted to start with that. Garrett, how should we read this? You're the expert in the room. How did you take the news? Well, I think it's pretty unprecedented uh to have the leading player, one of the leading players, like, completely bow out. What we're seeing is uh many of the labs having to reallocate their spend and uh trying to diversify away from uh some of the leading players that that they no longer can trust to do work. Right now, I have a bunch of questions I want to ask Garrett since we have them at at I mean at a deal level, it seems pretty clear. It's a weird deal. They've put almost $15 billion into Scale. Rory may have the details. most of it comes out as a dividend, and the CEO leaves to go run uh seemingly a much broader portfolio at Meta, right? He's not just running training, right? Which this is the whole mystery is um is that Facebook does or Meta doesn't even seem to care about the revenue, right? Um but if only OpenAI is committed to to maintaining that as a partial presence, I assume the revenue will decline rapidly, right? Um I don't know though that's that but you've already benefited from that, right? I mean almost overnight you've benefited from that. So, so in a way you are you are the mole here rather than us. Agreed. Yeah. I mean we have seen uh a huge surge in demand. Primary concern right now is hiring on our team. I mean demand tripled in in the you know in in the advent of the week. Uh I'm running on an average of like three and a half hours of sleep for the last like 10 days. I think I'm going to zoom out even one level four just to restate in case I mean we've dived right in because we're so in the details, but zooming out a million miles. Scale AI is an amazing company founded 10 years ago to do to help companies build great AI models, and they do that by rounding up human experts and initially just doing very simple data labeling, but increasingly over the last four or five years, as Garrett had said, as the tasks that the model builders have to attempt to solve get more complex, they've been hiring experts and at the PhD level to help with post-training reasoning questions around making the models better zoom out company. It's an amazing business. It grew to 8 $900 million. Think of it at kind of one level below the model providers themselves. This is a company selling to those five or six amazing model provider companies a vital service that's probably kind of a pain in the ass. If you're OpenAI or Entropic, you don't want to spend your life rounding up literally thousands of people to answer, you know, what 10 years ago were very mundane questions like, is this a stop sign? and are now as the AI has gotten smarter much more advanced questions as Garrett knows better than me right at the level of PhD knowledge. So that's the business AI scale I was in, and it was doing $800 million, and its customers were in the main the five or six large model providers. That's where we were a week ago. It was a highly valued company just raised at 14 billion. So that's kind of the level set here, and probably the leader in the space in terms of size. Not making any comments on quality. And then as you say a week ago in the last week, you know, Facebook/ Meta announced a fascinating transaction whereby they that definitely is a bit of a headscratcher whereby they invested 14 billion into Scale AI, took 49% nonvoting control, allowed the other investors to literally take that money back out as a special dividend. So all those other investors got 14 billion in cold hard cash some and some of the key executives at Scale AI move over to effective to working with Meta. So that's those are the facts on what happened, and I think you know the open questions that we're starting to think is why what's the impact on Meta, what's the impact on the remaining Scale AI business, and then as Garrett says, what's the impact on all the other providers who probably as Garrett just hinted, if you think about it, Facebook again to state the obvious, Facebook is another contender in the AI model wars, so if you're open AI, if you're entropic, if or any of the other guys. You now have a key supplier who's selling you a pretty important subsystem of what it takes to build your model who is now owned, controlled, dominated, infiltrated, pick your word, by one of your direct competitors. It's got to make everyone pause, which is exactly what you'll see happen with Windsurf being turned off of anthropic. And then back to Garrett, what you're saying is in the last week, the phone's been ringing off the hook. Uh, absolutely. And I think as you talk about the shift from generalist to experts, like we haven't even talked about like the future too, like future is going to involve more audio. The future is going to involve more tool use. The future's going to involve more trajectories as some of these agentic systems uh and step-by-step problem solving is trying to be improved by all the frontier labs and their pursuit of AGI. Right? So um really what that means is that like you need experts in domain, mostly in in right now where we're we're focused is on you know core science skills and also skills that you'd imagine like finance, law, medicine, like the large markets that these that these frontier labs are chasing after. One key question for you though Garrett as you're having these conversations post the announcement, right? If I was running procurement or v for one of the other AI company and I've had this happened to me once, right? How do you think it will impact how they contract with people like you, companies like you, and how much of the like how much of the process will they let you have visibility into because one could argue that Scale, the asset that Meta may think it's bored, is that Scale AI has a lot of knowledge just by virtue of the questions they're being asked and the kind of expertise that people are seeking from them has a lot of knowledge about where the most advanced LLM companies are going, and if I was procuring Handshake after that experience, I might have some different perspectives in what I can let you see or not see, or is there anything you can comment on that when we're talking to our customers? I mean they uh we are talking about uh the absolute frontier fear of what's happening. Um and uh the you know our customers really care about three things that are always in balance. They care about quality first and foremost. You have to have high quality training data. Uh you have to have high quality evaluation set, like you you have to have high quality. Then they care about volume.\nYou know it's really hard to get to scale on volumes if you don't have an audience. Like I would say the only durable moat in in the entire human data business is access to an audience. Uh and then they care about speed. How fast can you turn them around? If you're another company in the space like you know or one of our advantages I would say is the ability to activate volume and quality quickly. And we don't have to run month-long advertising campaigns to make that happen. In a year, Garrett, over or under, one word, does Scale have over a hundred million or under 100 million of revenue? Over 100 million. That's a great call, Garrett. And the reason it's a great call, it was such a savvy thing because you're probably correct because it takes a long time to go from 800 to 100. So, you didn't diss anyone. And you also gave probably a factually correct answer. If Harry asked a different question, which I'm now going to ask, do you think the revenue goes down? Do you think customers will reallocate significant spend away from Scale AI to other providers of data in the light of this acquisition? How would you answer that question? What we're seeing right now in the market is that there are hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of uh spend that is trying to be reallocated to uh leading providers. Um and the primary constraint is the ability to deliver volume and scale. And we can we can deliver we can deliver quality and we can do it really fast. I I I want you know after you're wildly successful in this or in the in this entrepreneurial endeavor, there is a career in politics ahead of you. The way you answer those questions without avoiding the pitfalls is excellent. But you're right, what you're what you're saying basically is yes, there's a massive spend reallocation away which gets you know which gets to the interesting question about the deal.\nWhat did they get for their 14 billion? I know what the v I know what the investors got for their 14 billion. and they got 14 billion and it's just interesting to speculate. I didn't think this I think everyone's really confused by this in a way that they shouldn't be. Zuck was behind with Llama. He needed to show the public markets that they were still a front runner with an AI slant. Bluntly, that was the play. The price is less than 1% of the market cap. Honest, he doesn't give a and he gets good talent with some people that he likes. Roll the dice. I I agree. That is the analysis.\nSo, I was asking the question, but you're right, Harry, implicitly what you're saying when you make that answer, and I to be clear, I 100% agree with it. What you're saying is this is not a corporate. There's no internal DCF that says why this is a good idea. There's just a I want to be relevant. It's less than 1% of market cap. I'm doing it. Somebody pay for the file. If you piece it up logically, you're right. You gave a company 14 billion for half of the company. the 14 billion has moved out of the company. So that's now gone, right? It didn't move out as a repurchase of shares. So you you still only own 49% of the company. The cash is gone and therefore you now have half ownership in a business that obviously doesn't have that 14 billion and just has whatever revenue it's had and we just agreed that's declining. The value of that asset, it's not nothing, but it's nowhere near 28 billion post, right? It's a we now have an 800 million declining revenue business with so so gross margins. Right. The amazing thing you've got is you're exactly right. The talent of those people that you brought across and you know the talent the talent and the messaging for a company and the messaging and the knowledge. Well, I'll tell you if I had to simplify it. I think the question is is um Alexander Wang as good or better than Bret Taylor? Because look, here's my view. Salesforce spent $750 million to buy Quip in 2016, a word processor that barely worked for one dude, right? One of the greatest of all time, you know, CTO of Facebook, right? And then almost CEO of Salesforce, except he bailed, right? And so Rory's really good at this math. What is 750 million in 26 where great exits were IPOs were lucky to be a billion compared to 2026, 10 years later? It might be the same as scale like the mult. It might be 20x bigger. So 20x * 750 is almost exactly the deal size. I I don't think it he's not saying I think you're placing emphasis on bluntly the talent acquisition. I think 27 billion of the 28 billion is on messaging. It is about showing the public markets in the world he is still a front runner. Important in fairness to say it's only 14 billion not 28. Yeah 14. So I think the math to quip is actually pretty good. Roy you're better at math than me. 750 in 2016 14 today for one dude basically. I mean, who used just you? Raise your hand, Garrett. Help me. How often do you use Quip for your word processing? Pretty pretty often. Every day. Don't be mean. How's the How are the LM? No, what I'm saying is it seemed crazy, right? It's it's got to be. But if it's the same deal or Google buying BBOP to get Diane Green for 400 million, right? That was the generation before Quip. What's it? Everything's bigger. Everything is bigger now. There are seven companies who can write stunning checks and only cost them a quarter cash. literally one quarter of free cash flow. And therefore, if you're in the path of the corporate imperative for one of the top seven companies, you can just get huge amounts of money. And you're thinking, &quot;Oh my god, this is the most amazing thing of all time.&quot; And they're literally thinking, &quot;Tick, that's Q2 done. What am I doing in Q3?&quot; Right? And it's just and I I Harry, broadly speaking, we're all saying the same thing. Facebook's market cap is 1.7 trillion and their free cash flow for a quarter is 15 billion. Even if it's a total writeoff, he literally goes away. Mr. Zuckerberg goes away and in 90 days come back and said, &quot;Whoops, that was an error, but we earned it back. Keep moving here, people.&quot; Garrett, I'm going to with that Microsoft put down an offer tomorrow for $4 billion to acquire Handshake. Would you say yes? What? Absolutely not.\nI love it. I think a broader opportunity for us is like, you know, leveraging all of this trust we built with a million employers. Jeff at GGV is just calling me. He says, &quot;Fucking sell at 4 billion.&quot; I think there's an opportunity to I tell all founders to sell now, by the way. No, I just I as a only as a challenge. I'm not saying you shouldn't take the this fake offer, but this is my this is what I my life lesson. I tell you to take it and then if you come back the next day and say what you just said, which is f no, it's the right answer, right? But I want to I've decided I want\n\n\nTo be the one, as crazy as it sounds, I want to be the one guy to tell you to sell as a challenge. My observation is no one's opinion on what they would do at a hypothetical offer is worth a damn, and what people actually do when the money comes into view tends to be very different on both sides. Listen, Garrett, you're going to get a term sheet from a $4 billion price on the back of that. So congratulations. This was a very well spent. I'll put in 100k, Harry. I, I'll, I know that I, I believe in Garrett. I'll put in 100k. That's it's good, especially if I get like 10% off. Can I ask Garrett one question, Harry, before, just if we have time, just because a meta question for founders out there and VCs struggling with all this demand that you have now? Are you an AI company? Is this a two-product company? Like, because I feel like you, in a way, listen, you've worked so hard, right? But you also have a little bit of luck. This has bounced for you, right? You've become an AI company. That, I, when did you found the company? Uh, nine years ago. Okay. So you weren't AI first. When you were a network, when you were sort of the network for, uh, for, for jobs to university students. How do you think about it yourself? Um, how do you think about taking advantage of these opportunities? Like, what's the meta lesson? Harry, you're the boss. I just think it's very interesting because so many founders are trying to become AI startup companies, right? But they're not quite, they're not quite hitting it, right? They're launching features and products, but the growth isn't there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think this just accelerates our mission of like, democratizing access to opportunity and becoming the number one job platform on the internet. No, the, no, that's not the takeaway, Garrett. Sorry. No, no, the takeaway is stay in the game long enough. Don't burn too much cash and bluntly get out of business too soon. I've been in a business that could have, sorry, there was aggregating student, and they just spent the money badly, and they finally didn't survive. The business is about being ready to play when you're called on the pitch. Garrett, we're going to let you go, my man. Great to meet Garrett and congrats. Rock on, man. Great job. There's a man who's going straight back to the phone to start returning customer calls. Good for him. Now, now the thing that I do want to discuss on the back of that, guys, back to the show. It's $14.8 billion back to LPs as well. Is a lot of money. Do we see a resurgence in LP activity? Reinvesting that money, given what has been a period of ill liquidity and people struggling with liquidity? Do we see now LPs return to the game at speed with Chime, with Circle, with Scale coming back? I mean, it's got to help. Look, there's no doubt that liquidity this year is going to be way up on the last couple of years. It's got to help. I mean, I think, you know, when you're dealing with a couple of trillion of NAV, you know, terrifyingly, 14 billion. Let's call it 20 billion, round up. It's 1%. It's a good start, right? But, you know, that's the terrifying thing about big numbers. They're big. LPs, at least the LPs I interact with, don't get ahead of the distributions. What I mean is, uh, yeah, Scale, as near as I can tell, Scale's already distributed cash as a dividend, right? It's out, and folks are going to be, may have already wired the money out to their LPs, right? Have some fun, right? The Chimes, the Circles, the rest, the six or six or seven great IPOs. A lot of the top VCs are going to be managing those distributions out over 36 months following a lockup, right? So, my LPs don't, they're looking at dollars out now, this quarter, before they get excited about putting money, even though they should get excited because they can see it, right? You know, the money's coming back over 36 months, and you can do a model and model whether it's going to be more or less than its current price. But I haven't seen that excitement until the cash is agreed back. I think that's what's so unbelievable about this deal, though, is like, how rare do you get cash back this quick? No lock up, no delays. Yeah. I mean, it's actually totally weird. And I think it will, it, it's even more unusual. I mean, in the sense of the deal, it's already closed, right? And it's such a, it's such a getaround on the Department of Justice that, you know, the, I'm sure somewhere in the DOJ, someone's head is pounding, and if, you know, we, under the prior administration, they'd be trying to do some kind of retroactive restraining order. It must make everyone's head hurt because it's such an obvious getaround. You know, if the real asset is some combination of the people you hired at Meta, I'll call them Meta, and or, as Harry said, some kind of market perception. It's very hard to imagine a DOJ, what's the word for when you, um, recision that says you can't work at Facebook anymore. You got to go back to where you were. I think it would be, it's very hard. This is such a weird transaction. It would be very hard for any kind of judicial review to unwind it, in part because it's so weird. Right. So I think clever, clever, clever, and amazing clever, but, but you have to realize you're get, it's clever if you want nothing. They're bought no revenue, no assets. They've bought a, as we just discussed. I mean, if Handshake has already gotten, say, 50 million AR from Scale already, this is the wor, as a revenue asset. They don't even own it. It's the worst purchase ever of all time for, for, for assets, right? And that, by the way, that was very, your, your first sentence that I can't remember what it was is, but that was a very succinct summary here. I thought that should be one of the sound bites because you nailed it exactly, Jason. And you're right, the funny thing, and you're right, the funny thing is Scale AI is still the same amazing company it was, right? Two or three, I don't know how many talented people have left, and Alex is obviously wildly smart, but you still got, you know, hundreds of really talented folks there. But the issue, as we said, is that the impact on your customers is so traumatic that it may be very hard to get back from it. So yeah. No, I mean, I, I love you, but it's a dead man walking instantly. There's no way that Scale can recover from losing its founders. It's, it's like this is too dynamic a business, and it, it can, it can manage 200 of its 800 for 24 months, but it's, it's, it's a dead company. By the way, I'm just, first of all, I agree with your conclusion. I'm just being precise. It's not because, quote, you've lost your founder, because, you know, a company can survive the loss of one person. It's the way it happened. Yeah. Sends such a signal and about your ability as a customer of Scale AI to continue doing business with them when 49% of the company is owned by one of your competitors in the LLM space. So I agree with you 100%. Practically speaking, trying to say it nicer. I'm working on being nicer. Practically speaking, it's hard to imagine an independent, viable business selling to the LLMs who are the competitors to your 49% owner, where your founder and charismatic CEO is currently working. When you put it, it'll be fun. In like three or four years, we can do an analysis, or you can help. It'll be the AI stubs. What happened to all these characters, Scales, that were sort of bought, right? We got a big one called Open AI, which was sort of bought by Microsoft. They're trying to undo that one right now. But the rest of these little stubs, they're what will they look like in four years? That's a fun fact. Yeah. We'll leave like, you know, we'll do, we'll pay 14 billion for Scale, but we'll live a, we'll live 200 million in the bank. Okay. That's what they're doing. They're leaving a little pot of honey in the bank. And as folks leave, because they're all cashed out, when we're left with 18 employees, the 200 million can last a long time. I think the interesting thing for me as a Mccor investor is how's the spend distributed across the other players? One, and then is there additional acquisitions that the others feel they have to make as a result of this acquisition to compete with Facebook's acquiring Scale? Yeah, agreed. But, and I just, and I could be wrong on this. I agree that that's the question because as, as a good investor, Harry, you're right. The only response to any great outcome is that's wonderful, but what does it mean for me? Um, Rory, you know me so well at this point. I, I, I think this is going to be a unique thing. I don't think ever, I could be wrong on this, but I don't think everyone else is going to wake up and say, Open AI is going to say, I need, well, maybe they might, but I don't think I missed that back. I don't think they'll buy a person like this happened. You might see some of them say, &quot;hm, I would, I would prefer to take some of this work inhouse or parts of this work inhouse because I'm giving too much information to a third party, and therefore, maybe I continue to do business with Handshake with America, but maybe more of the process is handled by me, or maybe I buy a small one of these.&quot; But I don't think you'll see someone else do a crazy, let's hire the CEO, buy 49%, give Harry the money, and let Harry dividend it out and pretend it's still a company. I, I mean, the one thing I just want to highlight, I always want to do this. I think it's nice. We hear enough about down treading on people in terms of like, bringing people up. Excel made $2.5 billion. Well done, Daniel Lavine. Amazing seed bet early. Paige Craig led a preede, a,000x return. The dude, the dude is well known for passing on Airbnb, which he very humbly always talks about. Awesome news there. No, he's humbly talks about screwing it up. It's even better story for him. Yes. About screwing the deal up, right? So, I think that's awesome. In terms of CEOs moving around, as we heard with Alex at Scale there, Delian tweeted about Jason at Discord being removed, um, potentially by Benchmark due to a delayed IPO of Discord. I wanted to hear what you guys thought of that. If you think about, because I, I've always been interested in the, you know, you see the threads of, you know, XYZ, everyone hating Bill Gurley for replacing Travis Kick. I always thought you want to very much strongly bias to backing the founder the whole way. I think that's been a really good move in venture in the last 30 years. Not because it's morally right, though maybe it is, but because it's savvy. Whenever you have to change out your founder, by definition, you're going to lose a couple of years, and it's a pain in the ass. So even apart from the moral issues, it's just not good for investing. But I also feel sometimes maybe you do have to make a change, and you know, Rory, have you ever fired a founder?\nI've done it, yes, mainly consensually, and I'm proud of the fact that a couple of the founders I've said you need to be replaced are actually have been references for me thereafter. I believe almost all of the times, even when a founder is struggling, you do a lot better by working with them and saying what does success look like, can you get there, agree on what success is, and if you're not getting there, then most of the time people say, you know, maybe you're right, maybe I can get someone else to do this. So I very much, I believe the following statement: if you walk in and fire a founder or any CEO and they're surprised, you have massively failed as a board member, cuz you didn't have the guts to tell them in advance you're worried. Personally, I don't have the capabilities, or forget about interest, I could say I have no interest, which is true. I just literally don't have the ski, like, for me, like, if a founder came to me and said, I'm out, right? I don't have a guy. One of the deep reasons for not making a change is, oh my god, it's such a lot of work, and you're right, you rarely have the guy, and I always tell people this is open heart surgery, even if the founding CEO wants to make the change. This is open heart surgery, and you got a one in three chance of dying. It's really brutal. Well, just, just one, one a little while ago, I haven't updated, but I don't think it's going to change. I did analysis of all the B2B IPOs. Okay. Of the IPOs, 90% still had the founder CEO as CEO. And as near as I can tell, all but one had an elective step down. Okay? Like, we're, we just don't want to do it anymore at Scale. Okay? That's like the PagerDuty story and a few others. Okay? So, like, if we're going now, and then let me, let me contrast this a little bit with Discord, because Discord is not a B2B company. Okay, it is, it has elements of it. I, I, if, if we're, if we're aiming for these great outcomes and nothing else matters today in the B2B world, then if the founder CEO is out, I'm out, because there's no, there's no hope in B2B. This is just my view. If the founder CEO is out, I'm out. If the founder doesn't want to go the distance and works here to hire someone great, it's a little riskier, but you can have amazing outcomes because that's what the facts say. The violent change is very hard. I could come up with some examples of where violent change worked, but it's just so hard typically. I mean, you know, the one canonical example, as you say, Jason, in consumer is Uber, which is why it attracts such attention. It was a violent change. It was very controversial. But if a board member feels it's his fiduciary obligation, and this is where I do give Bill Gurley credit, if you're on the board of a company that's raised $10 billion in money from third party investors, I don't think you can just say, &quot;I religiously don't fire founders.&quot; If you come to believe it's your fusy obligation to make a change, and again, we can't run an alternative history. You don't know what Uber would be with or without Travis Kalnick versus or without Dara. But in particular, in the light of the kind of backlash he got from it.\n\n\nAfterwards, I do give credit for anyone who says, \"I'm in the boardroom. There are lots of people's money on the line. I'm going to be a good fruity and do the hard thing, not the aesthetically pleasing soft thing. I'm going to step up to my duty.\"\n\nI don't know the exact story with Discord, but um if I had the choice as a seed investor, you have two choices. Um Jason Citroen, he's clearly one of the best founders. I mean, he seems like the I only I followed him since the beginning. Okay. I'm a super fan from a distance. Okay. If I was the seed investor, you said you got like the company's plateauing. Jason doesn't seem to want to go public. We're worried about him. And you have two We've done the math. The last run was at 15. Okay. We can either bring someone in and try to go for a 20 billion plus IPO or stick with Jason. We're probably going to have a 10 billion IPO. Okay. I'd stick with Jason in a in a heartbeat. I would stick with the I would stick with the risks of the founder that oh okay we're going to have a somewhat worse outcome. I'll take my if I invested at 20 pre what's the multiple with dilution like a I'm I I'm there for I I don't want to do that. I don't want to I don't want and I think what Bill Gurley's doing at Uber was doing a mental calcul and if they did it with with Discord I'm sure this is what happened. I don't think if he's he's clearly one a generational founder, right? But he's not the the the belt and he's not the guy running Starbucks from Newport Beach, whatever that guy is, right? I'd rather make less money. I would rather I'm okay just making a billion dollars, Rory, in in car in in or two a couple hundred million in Carrie and sticking with the founder. In all seriousness, I'll take the genuinely had those conversations. I'm on the same side as you and it's not just because less is I want less. It's often because it's less but with a higher certainty because I go back to my comment. Whenever you make a change, you've got a one in three chance that the person you hire is an empty suit and a freaking disaster. So, I hate making change, but I'm going to say it again just cuz I can't stop. I do think there are still sometimes when you say the combination of reasons, including for juicy reasons, you do you just dear God, I hope that doesn't happen a lot. If I'm a founder, okay, would do I and let's say Benchmark did push them out, right? Right. And Sequoia used to be clear like we'll find the right CEO whether it's you or not, but you're going to make a lot of money. That one used to be part of the Sequoia's pitch, right? It may not be you. Like I I think founders it it is a important factor for founders to weigh in. It is. And when you when you sell 3% of your company at demo day at 60 post, it's seal your company. Totally. It's seal your company. It is. And more and more founders do ask it. If you they should and I would say the com I I first of all I totally agree with that. is relevant and I think actually his you'll talk about founders for a while. It's pretty clear that early on part of the reason that Squire aren't in Facebook is residual frustration with Mike Moritz for prior you know prior situations where they had in fact made a CEO change which is why I think the pendulum which was way too far over on the you know always make a change has massively moved the other way. So if you had to pick, so maybe the maybe the clear statement is this. If you had to pick one default mode, it's clear and you could only have one button that you always press the same button, you would go for the never change button because it's statistically the right outcome.\n\nOkay, I we're going to move on. There are a couple of other rounds that I do just want to cover. I want your wisdom on, guys. RAMP can announce today they've raised a $16 billion price. I mean, these guys just never stop fundraising. The price just goes through the roof. Amazing. And this is not criticism. It's astonishing.\n\nSo, one, how did you think about that raising at 16 billion? And then two, guys, I don't get it. Brex is like 101 and Mercury's at 3 and a half with 500 in revenue and owning the banking relationship, which is more valuable. How do you guys think about this? So, just to frame it like this is 1% dilution.\n\nHere's the thing. It's 200 million at 16 billion. Uh, no one's no one's going to be cuz some of these rounds you look at them, they're great, but they're 20% dilution, 30% dilution, right? That's an expensive unicorn, right? 1%. I mean, I I know it's a lot. Like, but like we're not really going to notice the dilution on our cap tables, are we? I think Harry's not asking why did RAMP do it. Um, you know, I could I think Harry's asking how does it pencil out for investors? Am I correct, Harry? Is that a good and and you know and that that's the question. Yeah. Why why would you pay 16 if I think it's a better comp I mean I think it's a so you made two statements you know you compared it to Brex and then you and then Mercury and you were implicitly saying Harry you know why would you do that 16 I mean my sense of it is that they have a very nice business which has bought card and software and have headed more up market has also moved up market and the quote unquote competitor here is a combination of the card business from Annex and the accounts payable business from the accounts payable suite of SAP and Oracle. So they have a software plus kind of transaction business which is pretty nice. You know they've got hyper growth. So you I I get it in terms of just the explosive growth they're seeing in that space though I I think it's slowed down. I think look the million-dollar question on all these on all these fintech companies is how ultimately do they trade if and when the growth slows down and yeah that's probably a question you'd be asking yourself if you were paid 16 billion for that business for a what looks like a 7 $800 million revenue pretty you know reasonably high growth business it it feels lofty but as we're going to discuss if we get to our agenda which I doubt founders fund have shown an uncanny knack for getting these things right so I'm not going to bet against it you're Right. Ramps probably are basically the same amount of revenue, right? Mercury's approaching. I don't think Mercury's bank relationships are worth anything, Harry. I think they're worth zero. I could tell you why. But putting that aside, here's the theme that I see in in the private markets, which I think is weird, which is that it let's assume RAMP is the fastest growing of the three for the sake of argument because it has the highest valuation. It should be, right? It should be. I still feel like for startups, we're giving revenue valuations that don't have an adjustment for different ways their comps trade in the private markets. And if ramp is in a space that's 2 to 4x revenue at at when it's public uh or whatever you could look at the comps 3 to four like it see that's the part you know a lot of fintech revenue is lower it's lower margin or the public markets value it lower and that's the part I don't get in even in my own portfolio when I see valuations that value 80% gross margin products the same as 20 or 30 or 40 and that remains a mystery to me in the private markets right where everyone gets the same AR our valuations even if the quality of revenue or even at the public comps the public comps are different right so I totally agree with you there and I I just was like wow um and just the speed they are always announcing fundraisers like I mean it's every 3 months RAM has a new round which is again great I'm just like wow okay 1% every six months with a little bit of tender offer thrown inside is no big deal but I hear your point and as a reminder it is probably at the margin a cash consumptive of business because it is I mean just like Ammex it's giving people credit cards that they pay for things and the merchant gets paid next day and then someone has to float the card for 15 to 30 days. It's not a lending business in any long-term sense but on a short-term basis you are lending money and and you have to fund that capital. So there probably is a capital need. Now, I don't know how much they're doing that with securitization or receivables, but fundamentally, this is not the kind of company you can run on the cheap. It's not like a software company where you can be down to your last dollar and juggling payroll as I'm sure Jason did many times, right? When it's, you know, starting out, you know, you have big ass receivables, right? If you're doing I remember doing the math and you kind of have to make a bunch of assumptions about you know you have your if you have revenue of a billion then you know if you're getting two or 3% you can work out the gross um transaction value per year and then if you say to yourself settled over 12 months you probably if you're doing a billion in revenue you probably have roughly 4 billion in receivables you're financing in other words you're advancing money maybe two to four depending on the credit cycle you're advancing money to your customers that you have to fund on the balance sheet and that's probably where some of the money goes. Totally agree. I actually think it's a really interesting way to do relevance. The most important thing today is to be relevant and to own consumer attention and I think by having frequent fundraisers and frequent media hits. It's just a great way to continuously keep velocity and momentum ahead of someone like Brex. It's actually important Rory like in the nicest way like I would push back on your you went Yeah. No, I do think it is, especially because most c mo a lot of consumers don't know which one to pick. You're you have a it's all brand anyway, right? And ramp Rex, what I don't I don't even I I don't know. But but Ramp is always on Twitter and they got Sasquan and they've got Sasquan or whoever this random footballer is running with Ramp on and that goes viral. You got to do it. They're crushing. You're right, Harry. You did you call me on it correct. I did make a little face, but I'm willing to say you're correct. It it it kind of goss me that you'd be using fundraising as a momentum builder, but you're right. It's so much of the business in this part of the market is about momentum that Yeah, they're smart. I mean, I think almost most of what they do is pretty damn smart and that's probably smart, too. Plus, if you're doing it, if you're new customer, you don't want to invest in a loser in the space. Yeah. It just sucks when the when when the velocity comes out of the product, when they start removing features, you just you just, you know, we are we we don't we you know, this is the enterprise gets this, right? that you're you're you're doing a long-term journey. But I think in this space in this every the beauty to this ramps Mercury at all business is everyone needs it, right? They may not need these pro, but it's 100% attach rate, right? But I I don't want to I don't want to be trapped. I don't want to be ripped off. I don't I want someone that's actually going to make my life easier, where the spend management actually works, right? And so I don't want to see I don't want to see the ones where the energy is seeping out of the company. I just I won't I won't sign up for that vendor. Intuitively, it makes no sense, right?\n\nListen, 16 billion at ramp. Perplexity raising again. Uh, first tranch 15, second move to 18 because there was so much demand. Rory, is it the same as you said last time, which is just, hey, it's an infinite shot at a massive $500 billion outcome. Roll the dice. The two-step price uptick thing is is is weird, but you're seeing some of that now where I think the first round gives you certainty and then the people who didn't get in say, I'll just pay 10% more. I just want in. It's It's just a sign of deal heat. It's a sign of the market right now and rational CEOs take advantage of it.\n\nListen, we have open AI creating more news as always. Uh we have a 200 million defense contract from the Pentagon which is actually very sizable. It's like the largest the Pentagon have given to a single provider. How did you guys read that also OpenAI's first foray into defense in this way? I mean I didn't I mean first of all stepping back aggregate comment it's probably good news. I just love the fact that the Pentagon is spending money with all these you know venturebacked high growth very technically savvy forward-f facing companies. I think it speaks to some level of improvement in the procurement process. You know, I think Palunteer started that SpaceX and I think it you And all that now I think it's great because you know, you look you look at the news right now and you know, wars in other places and you go, I want to make damn sure that we have the best stuff if we ever go to war and it looks like that's not being made by the old fddy duddy companies. So big picture good news, you know, go team. I think I don't know what you guys think. I I I just think related to what you said Rory I I I I think open AI to achieve its mission anyone with this market share you have to be friends with everybody. Yep. And I think before 2020 there were so many principled CEOs. So we we were so principled about issues about not working with defense or the government. There are many things folks are principled in fact many things are I that are very aligned with my values that folks are no longer principled on. You got to be neutral. And I think what the limited press I saw on it, Sam said this is not m this is only 200 million. This is not material to us. This this is like a this is a small deal, right? I he you know, he probably didn't do a customer call on this one. I mean, maybe he did, but it is immaterial, but you have you can't be Republican or Democrat or anti- this. You the the threat to Open AI from being political is so high, right? You got to be friends with everybody.\n\n\nAnd so you've got to, I mean, other than rogue states, I think OpenAI has got to sell to everybody. They've got to own it. For the record, he may want to be friends with everyone, and he doesn't appear to be doing a great job of staying friends with Microsoft. What happens there with the Microsoft feud? Listen, I don't... I think they're lucky in that Microsoft crossed the line first. Microsoft... Listen, it's a weird deal because Microsoft basically bought OpenAI, and they're going to end up being like a 33% shareholder of a standalone company. This is the opposite of Scale in some ways. They're descaling. They... they were a... they were a... you know, they could not scale before chat GBT. This was in some ways a struggling company right before... I mean, chat GBT exploded, right? It was great, but the revenue was, was in the grand scheme of things, relatively minor. So they sold 49% to Microsoft, right? Um, now they're going to desell it. Um, but uh, but Microsoft does use multiple providers, right? It does compete with chat... with OpenAI. So even if it's allowed under the contract, they did cross the line in terms of remaking, I think, the spirit, virtual side of the relationship. I don't know if just because Microsoft quote unquote crossed the line first, and I'm not sure they did. I'm not sure that will impact how... I don't know how it ends up, but I'm not sure that it will be determined by, you know, who quote unquote crossed the line first. I think it's a very weird contract. It... it... it's right up there. It's a very different version of weird than Scale AI, but very weird. It's not just about ownership and preferred stock and common stock. It's, you know, all sorts of different rights around profit sharing, all sorts of different triggers around AGI. I would say in situations of ambiguity, the person who has the most leverage has the best chance to win. And I would argue Microsoft has quite a lot of leverage because it's not existential for them, especially now. I think they have no leverage. Actually, honestly, I'm not trying to be a... a uh... a um... a uh... a chaos agent like our prior guest. Um, but what... here's why. 'Cause listen, I'm still... I'm a student, right? The reason I think they have no leverage is because I think that whatever AGI is, we're going to be there pretty soon. So Microsoft loses... what Microsoft wants out of OpenAI is a relationship where as much of it survives... I mean, obviously it's tied to profit sharing, survives this moment in time in the relationship, right? And they can... and listen, I'm sure they would argue over it, and I haven't... I don't know the details of the contract, but the profit sharing, all the rest, ends at AGI, right? So part of this relationship ends at AGI, which that's a good reminder of that term, because if you recollect a few weeks ago in one of our quick questions, someone... you... someone... when are we going to hit AGI? And I think my answer, which now I feel smart because Jason confirmed it, is my comment is, we're going to hit AGI when Microsoft and OpenAI litigate what open AGI is, because everyone else is using that term loosey goosey. It could be now. It could be 2045. Who the knows? Now half a trillion dollars of value depends on that word. I can tell you it's... you're right, Jason. That is the only part of the contract where you go, \"Oo, that is a bit of...\" because it's ambiguous. So you're right, that will be a fun vector of this discussion. Well, I've talked... listen, I'm not... I'm not smart enough to do a lot of stuff in AI. I've talked with several of the smartest folks I know in AI, okay? What they think about this... a... what they think about AGI, and they basically all say very the same thing, like at this point in time, it's something Sam Altman made up to simplify a lot of concepts. He's the one pushing the narrative, and we none of us really believe there's a magic point for AGI, right? Um, I... I at a lay level, I think we're close to being there already. That's the risk to Microsoft. Like, so I think my only point is, since they both have something to lose in this, and Sam is signal... he always... like the guy... the guy signals early, and he's like, you know, Microsoft will... will end up with 33% of a new entity, and like, he's just trying to create the outline of a deal so that it... it lands there, right? They own a third. He owns six or 7%. It gets reorganized in some weird new way, right? And and... what does Microsoft get out of it? They get a longer tail. They're going to get a longer tail in this agreement, but it's going to be a different one because the cash alone is not important to them for your point, right? The IP and the relationship is more important than the cash. Like, what are they going to do with the cash? Dividend it out? Buy Scale AI Prime? Like, they don't actually need the cash, do they? I think we can agree that they don't need the cash.\n\nYeah, agree. Scale AI Prime coming to you soon. Clearly. Listen, guys, we do have... We've talked about Chime in two separate episodes, and this went out. It went public, and it popped 50%. All IPOs up in 2025 except for sale point. How did you... is this a sign that IPO markets are roaring? There hasn't been a better time in years. And how did you analyze Chime specifically? So yes, they clearly are roaring now, right? Um, there hasn't been a better time in years. Yes, because there's been none, and some is better than none. It's not a complex question. So you think it's pent up demand that's just latching on to available supply, not necessarily the quality of companies coming out? No, I think the great... No, I... I did not say that at all. I think tra... look, how do windows open? Traditionally, good companies go out at attractive prices. That's how... that's how you... if you've had the window shut, you know, the only way you open it is with good quality assets and at prices where it's attractive. And the way it manifests is, unfortunately, you get these pops where effectively the... the company going public has effectively bribed the buying public to like IPOs again, because investors were all pretty pavlovian. If you were a IPO buyer in 2022, your searing memory is, I bought the mall in '21. I lost my... I lost 30%, 40% on average, 90% in some cases. I'm never doing that again, right? So, you take a long time to come back. Now, in the last month, your narrative has changed. It's, oh my god, I piled into the last five IPOs. I'm up 70% on average. I'm up 250% in the case of Chime, in the case of Circle. This has been a huge boost to my fund performance. I got to do me some more. So, the... the m... the pop helps the win. It's not ideal. It... there should be a better way, but there's clearly positive momentum now from good companies, and there's going to be more of an appetite. Will this lead to Data Bricks or Stripe or one of the big boys going out? Even if they go out, this sentence is wrong, Harry. It doesn't lead. You see lead, you're implying that they couldn't go out and now they can. They can go whenever they want. They could have gone in '22. They could go in '23 because they're so big and so good. They can go whenever they want. That's an idiosyncratic genuine com. That's an idiosyncratic decision that they're going to make that I don't have a ton of visibility into. I think... No, no, no. They... they... they can go out whenever they want, but now they have data to suggest that if they were to go out at this period in time, it is highly likely that they will be priced at a premium with a huge amount of demand. They did not have that historical data beforehand. So this data is leading to a new decision for them. I'll give you that. It's not clear to me that the only angst was on pricing. I think it's much more true. Maybe the better statement is this, Harry. I think it's much more true for the whole flotilla of companies in that 200 to 4, 500 range who have been trying to figure out where to go and can now see some kind of exit. For those folks there, everyone is dusting off their plans. For the big four or five companies like Data Bricks and Stripe, you're right. At the margin, it's a more favorable time. Why not? I think their reasons for doing it or not doing it are more about the whole when do they want to do it? Do they really want to deal with it? So, it's not... I could imagine an entire IPO cycle where once again neither of the two names decided chose to go out and we get to the end of the year. Was Chime mispriced or is that pent up demand?\n\nWell, by definition, I mean, pent-up demand. The whole point of pricing is to pick up pent-up demand. So, by definition, it was mispriced. My limited... uh... my limited understanding from from folks that have been involved in some of these recent IPOs, and it's limited, Harry, you probably have had more, but um, the advice was just to be conservative. Yeah. It's just... it's just there haven't... it's... it's a slow market. Will the advice to be less conservative now after these IPOs? Probably, right? I think you're still going to tell everybody to be conservative, right? And it was to be conservative. And yes, we could talk about how much money people really left on the table versus, in theory, you can't sell every share at the highest possible price, right? That's the fiction in the circle math. But even if the company leaves money on the table, the investors distributing over the coming years, they... they may have only lost a little bit from the incremental dilution, right? Dilution aside, the price, the IPO price is almost irrelevant for the VCs. It's when you get out, and getting out strong may be worth the incremental dilution, right? That's the one that Bill Gurley, I guess, disagrees with, right? Is that there's a trade-off. Like going out strong doesn't matter, right? You'd rather go out and and limp along. Uh... uh... but I think that's... that's the advice. The other thing I would say on Data Bricks, and I don't know on Data Bricks, I literally know nothing, but literally the fact that this last week they had an analyst summit where they went through all their metrics, their revenue, their growth rate through... through an entire group of investors and analysts says to me they will decide one day to file, and it will just happen, like they're already... they're not only are they running their company like they're going to IPO, they're actually managing to Wall Street, like they're already... they're at the edge of managing, like they're already public, right? So, I wouldn't be shocked if we opened up uh the news tomorrow and they filed because they're already completely ready, right? They're already... they're already in... they've already halfway there. So, I think we'll be shocked on Data Bricks because we think we'll... we'll... we'll see these signs, but there it's like a Sam Altman narrative. The signs are already there. Like they... they literally could file next week, and no one should be shocked. Totally agree with you on Data Bricks there. I actually interviewed that uh head of sales, Ron, who was unbelievable and spoke in detail about how they structure and run the company. Crazy. He was there since almost the beginning. Yeah, I mean, really crazy. I was so impressed with him. One of the... one of the companies in the flotilla that you... I think very wisely describe, Rory, is is Gusto, who announced a tender at 9.3 billion at 900 million in ARR. I was actually surprised they're at 900 million AR. Amazing. And congrats to Tom and Josh and the team there. It's awesome. Um, I kind of underestimated them, and I thought that was awesome to see. I don't know if you guys had a... a take... a read on on that coming out with 99.3. I mean, I think yes, you underestimated them. We had talked to them way back when, and obviously you should have done the deal. So, I share your pain. I think look, payroll is one of the biggest markets out there. I mean, it's very... sometimes the obvious is the most important, right? It's a huge big market because everyone gets paid, and you get five bucks a month per US worker that you're paying. You know, ADP and Paychex are two old school companies that are, you know, worth approximately 100 billion. There's a bunch of other companies at the 10 to 30 billion dollar level of public comps in the space. So it's a huge ass market with a lot of attach, and it was pretty stodgy. So at one level I'm not surprised, given the TAM, they've clearly executed really well to get to that size and scale, but you know, they're deal... they're have a modern SMB focused payroll solution. There's, you know, half of the workers in the United States work in um SMBs. So, you're probably at 60 million people on which you can get... I'm just doing the math in my head, five... 60 bucks. Hold on. Yeah. I mean, you add... you know, you get to a huge market very quickly. 60 billion market, you know, and they're also lucky. I think all these guys are lucky in that um they have a great comp. So, Paychex again, I think, was founded in the 1870s. Rory, we could look it up. I mean, it... Paychex is an old one. It's trading... it's trading at 10x revenue at 55 billion in market cap. So, it's very easy, and it's... look it up. It's at an all-time... it's not just trading at an all-time high. It's at an all-time high today. So, if you're a VC, it's very easy to say, well, look, okay, Gusto's at a billion. Paychex is at five. Okay, Gusto is growing a little bit faster. It's newer. It's better. It's founderled. You can back into Gusto. All of the payroll folks, you can with a $55 billion ancient public company trading at 10x, you can justify any of these deals, right? The... the... there's some people don't realize Paychex, Toast, a few others. There's some great comps out there. Well, ADP as well. I mean, you have to ADP. I mean, the two big dogs in payroll are ADP and Paychex. And I know Paychex I think was found 60s or 1960s and 70s because the original founder, you know, went on to continually run for governor of New York as a Republican. All very weird. ADP is almost all time high, too. They're both... They're two big businesses. So, provided you can make the economics of replacement work, you can build...\n\n\nA big company. Actually, ADP, I didn't realize ADP is trading at 15 times revenue. Why didn't we just put the fund into ADP, Rory? Forget about putting the fund into these newer kids. We should have put the fund into ADP. Look, if we're going to go and paychecks, ADP and paychecks. I mean, that's what my grandpa's startup used. Like, they use paychecks, right?\n\nRory, what was your reflection on turning down an early Gusto round? And did it change your mindset, teach you anything? Yeah, that I can occasionally be very stupid. Um, which probably didn't need to be thought. I mean, you know, we talked in between rounds, so it wasn't actually an engagement, but yeah, I I think I underestimated both the founder and the the the openness of the market.\n\nWell, two things. One, the founder, the openness of the market to switch. And I'll say something else. The willingness of investors to pay up quickly for that such that it got outside my price range very quickly, right? Stuff happens, you know, and you and you were wrong. I mean, I was wrong on that decision. Being wrong sucks. It's funny. It's still these are and they're still niche products actually. Yes. Because um listen, I've been a Gusto customer for a decade, I think. Right. Um the people people don't get, not I don't mean to spend too much time. People don't get that like the the real value of page and ADP is they do the work. Yes. Like before, listen, I love Gusto. I'm a case study in their website. Okay. I actually think it's some of the best software out there. I can tell you why. But I have to do more work than I used to because when I was a paycheck customer, I just called up my rep. Hey Harry, process the payroll. Hey Harry, take Rory off the insurance. I didn't have to do nothing. My human did it for their commission. Now I got to log in. I got to run the workflows. Like, and it's listen, it's elegant, like it's great, but I actually have to do more work with Gusto than I had to do with paychecks, more work. I don't care. I don't care about the money savings, it's irrelevant on my payroll, right? So, which makes me conclude that somewhere out there someone is building an AI enabled agentic payroll where Jason can just talk to the freaking um chatbot and they will do all the work, and they have some of it, they have some of it, but yeah, I'm sure they will. It needs a little bit more time in the oven, but yes.\n\nFinal one before we do a quick fire, we mentioned old guard competing with new. Glean is a $7.2 billion company today, moving very fast. Dropbox is still working to get Dash out, which I'm sure is a good product, but it's separate to their core product and core business.\n\nCan the old guard compete with a very, very fast, well-funded new guard? I'm starting to lose confidence in the Old Guard.\n\nI wanted to believe. I listen, I I think because the LLMs are open, anyone can use the the API and most of the work is done by third parties. Okay. Most of it is not. Yes, you can build, you can use an open source framework for your chat, and then you can use an LLM, and then you can, it's pretty simple to rag a bunch of data and stick it in, and like, I just figured that the, at the software level, the big guys would catch up, right? Um, but I'm just, I, in my ecosystem, I, they're too, they're still too slow. I just don't see it. I don't see it. I'm worried. First, the minor comment. I do believe the quote unquote old guard can compete if they, in certain circumstances, if the situation is right, and then they have leadership to just push it through. But I don't think that's the issue here. It's a different issue. The the real truth about Dropbox shipping or not shipping whatever the product is, Dash is, it doesn't matter. Let me tell you what I mean by that. Typically, the old guard play is some version of, I'm the system of record. I'm already in there. I can add this stuff on top. That's the pitch every time. I'm Service Now. I can add an agent. I'm Zenesk. I can add an agent. I'm selfless. I can add an agent. Right? And the new guy's pitch is, we have this agent and we can run on any system of record. So you can buy us and you don't have to change out your old guy. Right? And that's the vector of competition. What it means is you can only be an old pro system of record provider. Your right to win is predominantly in your existing customer base. And Service Now has a big one and Salesforce has a big one. And brutally in the enterprise, Dropbox doesn't. So even though we threw out Dropbox and Glean, they're not in the same quadrant. It's not a relevant question. With all due respect, Harry, Glean is out there competing with all the people on enterprisewide deployments for big ass companies, and they're going to have a whole bunch of competitors in that space that we could talk about. Even if, even if Dropbox had shipped a perfect, hear me out. Even if Dropbox had pitched a perfect functionally equivalent product to Glean, it would mean that for their existing business customers, which is a smalish percentage of their total business, they would win all that business. But then when they moved on to customers who didn't have Dropbox, they would be at ground zero competing against Glean for that. And that I think is the real issue. Not some kind of, are they powerful? Are they good enough engineers? Are they strong enough founders? I think just situationally starting where they are. It's just hard to get there.\n\nRory, the joys of me is I have very few feelings. And so you can always say it's a wrong or a moronic question. My retort to you would be, you're very wise. What would be the right question to ask with regards to the new versus the old guard? Then whenever you're dealing with the old guard, by definition, they're not going to bring oomph to the table. They're going to bring the assets of what they have. So the interesting questions are things like Salesforce, Service Now and people like that. And you know, we had a mention there of, I will say the whole service Salesforce throttling Slack seems pathetically lame, irritating to customers. And I was asking someone about this and they had a good take on it. They said it probably doesn't survive in that form, but it probably survives because if I'm a customer, you're telling me I can't access my Salesforce records. I want and when I want to, you know, run it through Glean, that's not going to, I'm sure that's not going to survive. But the question is, is there some kind of API connectivity fee? Are they going to try and monetize that? But it definitely felt a little lame. I mean, you'd really want him to say, of course, you shouldn't use Glean because our product is so much better.\n\nIs is Slack bluntly have its best days been and it is now in a decline? I mean, almost by definition, your best days are as a startup and going public and then selling for 27 seven times revenues. I don't think it would get 27 times revenues today. So yes, by definition, it's, you know, on the downward slope of excitement, which isn't to say if it was well-run and integrated well, it couldn't be a perfectly good and successful part of the Salesforce ecosystem. I mean, we're, you know, small small in size, but big Salesforce users. So, it's not like it's doomed, but they got to make it happen. Do you think it will be a good and successful part of the ecosystem if it continues as it is? I don't have a developed opinion, Jason.\n\nWell, look, first of all, it's probably maybe doing two and a half billion in revenue today, somewhere around that. So, just as an aside, I don't think Salesforce got a terrible deal in the end. It ju you just got to you got to view it by where it ends up as a revenue multiple and think and Salesforce is growing single digits. So I don't think Mark would want to give up that 2 and a half billion today, right? And in fact, interesting for sellers, all of their, not all of them, but the light, so many of the acquisitions, Slack, even Tableau, which I think was founded in the '50s, they're actually all growing faster than the core Salesforce. So like, we can say, oh, Slack isn't what it was, which it isn't, but growing in the teens when the core is growing 7, 8%. That's and and you have billions in revenue, that's material, right? This is hard stuff to do. So I think Slack today is is pretty successful, like LinkedIn is not as good, but like LinkedIn and Micros, it's just a different Slack. Will it be a hub for developers that that people build their eco those day the h Slack force as our hub? Those days are are far behind us, right? Um, and uh, but but and but here's the irony of it. My view is Slack got acquired. It was it was a better, even better deal than it looked. You know why? It only had one product. Yeah. My view, Stuart is a generational founder, right? Did it multiple times. Did the condesio we'd all love to work for, right? But I think deep down in his heart, he didn't want to do multi-product or they would have been multi-product, like it had an existential ticking time bomb because it could only be so big as a single product company. So it had to, it had to evolve. Um, and so this is a new enterprise Slack. It is what it is. We still use it, right? Um, and just like workday and LinkedIn are locked down. It can only be locked down and and the three of us can complain, but if Allstate and State Farm and and those folks don't complain, ain't going to change, we don't matter, the small Slack and Salesforce customers, we don't, we don't matter at 30 billion AR, we just don't matter, right? We don't matter.\n\nWe're going to do a cowi quickfire. We've got three to go through. Again, Kowi, essential prediction marketplace where different people bet on different things. Will Apple announce iPhone assembly operations in the US this year? Everyone, I I'm sitting outside the US. I hear constantly, oh, we want to bring back manufacturing starting with phones. Will they bring it back? I based on the news today, I don't know what the odds are. I don't have the the in front of me. I'm going to say they're going to announce it. Yes. Because Trump announced a Trump phone at $499 to be built in the US yesterday. It's gold. It's gold. You guys are so, you guys are so classy. Your president's announcing phone packages. Look at you. I like all gold. Like you haven't seen our new office. It's all gold as well. Prime, that's cuz your prime minister couldn't build one. Look at you, Rory. You've got you've got a you've got a coin and a gold phone. Not nice. I think, listen, I don't, I I don't, I would, I would have to do more analysis to see if it's not possible, right? If if it's it's close to impossible, but announcing it and beginning a process, you might have to do it. You just might have to do it. So, I'm gonna go Yes. Announcing, yes. Rory announcing doing yes or no. I think politically it would be smart to announce it even though it's impossible. I think Tim Cook is such a straight shooter that he just couldn't pull it off with a straight face because everyone was know it's absolutely. But yes, in a cynical world, I would make one phone in the United States of America just to confirm that, you know, we can we too can do the low margin commoditized parts of the electronics value chain and end this question.\n\nWill the S&P finish positive this year? Yes or no? You know, if I knew that, Harry, I wouldn't be talking to you. There's an easier way to make money than venture capital if you know that. So, it's just not knowable, right? I mean, and you know, look, the the record of, that's why it's the bet, Rory. That's a different question. I made the bet. No, actually, that's exactly where I was going to go. So, I was going to say the record of analysts predicting the S&P at the start of the year, they do this exercise as analysts predict the S&P at the end of the year. Universally wrong. The error rate's huge. There's nothing to it. Much more interesting question is, okay, now let's talk a bet because then you have odds and now you can actually make an economic decision because the odds here is S&P, will it finish on the, I'm reading it as 70% likely yes, is that correct? So that's what they're saying, given that, I would take the no, you know, I I I think you would make more money betting no than yes at at that kind of ratio, which is not to say I have any insight on the S&P. I just merely look at the volatility and I say, hm, on average, well, not on average, in this case, not a bad bet, but it's a very ill-informed comment. I'm I'm I'm all in. I have no more cash, so I'm all in on this bet already. I think it's an easy bet. But this, but but Rory's right about the 70%. Like, I'm not, when it's my own money, I don't get the benefit of the 70%, right? I get the benefit of the 50. But, uh, personally, I'm 100% in. So, I already made the bet.\n\nYeah, you're right. That's actually a good, because often I want to build on that. I think when people ask, especially investors, their opinion on, the correct answer is don't even answer that question. The real question is, where is your position? And I'm with Jason. I'm about 75% equity. Mildly terrified, you know, almost nothing in bonds and then invest in short-term and weird stuff. No, I'm back where I was in 2008. 100% uh equity in in my personal position. 100%. Back just like 2008. It was great.\n\nYeah. What do the white part of 2008? It was great. It was great. Okay, final one. Will a Chinese AI model reach number one this year? The odds are pretty well. So, obviously they do evals on effectiveness and performance. Will a Chinese model reach number one in evals this year? My bet is yes, but not published. So, no. Oh, easy call. In other words, I'm right, but no one will ever know. I don't have anything to add here. What are the odds?\n\nWhy?\nSo, it\n\n\nIt's very low.\nIt's again, yeah, you look at that and you go, not a crazy bet just because it's a.\nDo you think there's a one in five chance that they'll?\nI do.\nI'm going to try to get back to China this year.\nUm, you know, I just, uh, I, I don't know.\nI should know.\nI mean, obviously, we've all been shocked the last whatever eight months by performance, right?\nAnd I, I'm, I, I don't mean to date myself, but man, um, you know, outside of pockets of San Francisco and areas of London, I've never seen folks work remotely like they do in China.\nI mean, it's just insane.\nAnd maybe it's changed, cuz I, I haven't made it back in a while, but I, I plan to go back this year.\nAnd, um, if there is clearly huge government backing, what's that?\nI don't think they're working in less.\nIf the government's behind you in China and and it's just this, there is so much energy in that culture that I, I'm, I, it's just, I don't want to take the under on this bet because I, I just, I feel like this is a hubris, this is a Bay Area, there's a lot of Bay Area hubrises, and this is one of them.\nWe can't access, they can't access our internet.\nIt's a different world out over there.\nUm, but man, the power when everyone's aligned.\nJason, I'm coming around to you.\nThe bet has to be yes.\nYou know, there's all sorts of noise of will, you know, there's all sorts of noise how it's moderate.\nBut the idea that there's a less than one in five chance, which is what the odds are saying, that at some point this year, one of five or six really aggressive, well-run Chinese tech companies can't achieve even temporary par with one of the things just feels to me a stupid bet.\nSo, you're exactly right.\nThe bet at these odds has to be a yes, which is different than saying they're quote unquote going to displace Open AI.\nProbably not.\nJust like at various times when one of the other models sneaks ahead of open AI for you know a month in the various measures you kind of go that's interesting as a state-of-the-art, but that's not actually how the business value is created at that level.\nI come around to I'm with Jason, the answer is yes.\nThere's no world where we've got all the smart people and they don't, it's silly the minute you say it, so of course they will.\nGo, well done, Jason.\nWe, we, we got that was a very definitive answer.\nRory, yeah, Jason convinced me.\nHe's exactly right.\nNo, I love it.\nGuys, I hadn't spent a second thinking about it beforehand.\nIt's just not, I never.\nWell, now you're a true venture investor, Rory.\nOkay, you should be proud.\nYou say things with little thought, but great confidence.\nSee, that's why I was afraid of would happen if I did this.\nSo, that actually, that never have you said anything more likely to cause me to fade.\nDon't worry.\nDid you have such a visceral reaction to Jason saying about Tableau in the 50s because you turned that one down at C?\nOh, no, no, no, no.\nUm, I didn't, but it was, I, I want to say the early 2000s.\nI remember 2003.\n2003.\nYeah, exactly.\nYeah.\nAnd I'm sure the poor tableau guy is screaming, you know, like, \"Please don't say that about me.\nI'm, I'm relevant.\nI got 40 million.\nI am somebody.\"\nOh dear.\nWell, guys, listen.\nI always love my time with you.\nThank you so much for doing this with me and you've been fantastic.\nRock and roll.\n",
