and we lost money on Uber.\nWhat?\n40% of my third fund went into Spotify.\nI went back to our LPs and said, \"Listen, we [ __ ] up.\nWe need to pivot.\nWe need another 300 million bucks because I need to protect this thing.\"\nThe next 3 years were some of the worst of my life.\nReady to go,\n[Music]\nLarry.\nDude, we walked around the park, and I heard your incredible story, and to be fully transparent, I didn't know the incredible story before, which is why at the end I was like, \"Dude, we have to do a show together.\"\nSo, thank you so much for doing this with me.\nWell, that's humbling.\nYou know, it's sometimes difficult to open up and tell the story, but uh, I enjoyed our walk.\nListen, it's the short shorts and the great legs that make you feel comfortable to open up.\nI completely understand, but I want to start on the entry dialing for dollars is kind of how I was thinking about this.\nHow did you start your way into venture?\nAnd what was that entry point?\nYeah, for me it was it wasn't really, hey, I want to be a venture capitalist and managed, you know, billions of dollars.\nIt for me it was, you know, I come from nothing.\nUm, I was a fundraiser for academic institutions for their endowments.\nI was good at that.\nAnd everybody I raised money from, most of people, not everyone, most people made it investing in private companies.\nIt would be at PE funds or venture funds or running their own operating businesses.\nIt didn't matter what it was from, you know, Windows to financial management to to PE.\nThey created real wealth for their families.\nAnd I was like, they're not that much different than me.\nI work hard.\nI'm smart enough.\nUm, maybe I can do it.\nSo, I went back to business school late in life, and our business today was my thesis.\nAnd I started buying, you know, the smartphone became something that was running our lives in 2010.\nAnd I just started saying, \"This is super interesting.\nWhy don't I buy shares?\"\nAnd I follow Twitter.\nI like Twitter.\nYou know what about um early Uber?\nWhat about early Spotify?\nAnd I just started buying shares from my classmates with my own money.\nThat that sounds great.\nBut these companies are not public at the time.\nSo, how does one do that then?\nHow did you approach it?\nWell, I guess it's not knowing what you don't know is ignorance is bliss is kind of the same thing.\nI didn't realize it was something you shouldn't or couldn't do.\nI just asked people, \"How about you have shares?\nCan I buy some of your shares?\nWell, I never really thought about selling them because I really can't sell them.\nHow would you buy them?\"\nAnd still to this day, 15 years later, there's a form that I created at the Kerry School of Business at Arizona State, onepage form that then we sent to the company to buy stock and it still floats around.\nI got I got it back from a broker not that long ago, and it's like literally the form I created in 2010.\nOne page and it's binding though.\nThat's scary.\nIt's binding.\nWhich has bitten me in the ass a few times.\nSo, we're at business school, and we're like, you know what?\nI see the mobile revolution.\nI'm buying Uber.\nI'm buying Twitter.\nI'm buying Spotify.\nWhat happens then?\nAnd also, how much are you buying?\nYeah.\nSo, small, you know, I I I wanted to make a change.\nI was working in college athletics.\nThat was changing as it's become today.\nYou know, this whole thing pay players should get paid and coaches salaries.\nAnd pretty soon the inmates were running the asylum, so to speak.\nAnd I was like, \"This isn't my passion.\nThat's not where I came from.\nI I want to make a change as a former athlete.\"\nLike, \"Hey, maybe I can use my brain, not my bra.\"\nAnd I just I cashed in my retirement.\nI went through a divorce.\nUm, got remarried, had nothing.\nI had no money.\nAnd I just had paid the tax on my retirement.\nStarted buying these shares.\nAnd I think this is literally your last money.\nThis Yeah.\nWell, half a nothing's nothing.\nMy wife came to our marriage with $50,000.\nUm, I had went through a pretty tough financial situation.\nUm, rightfully so.\nMy former wife kind of took what I had.\nUm, uh, raising my three young kids at the time.\nAnd my wife and I today, we started a journey together, and she backed me with the 50 grand in my small amount of retirement.\nI just started buying Twitter shares and Alibaba stock from Jack Ma's family office, and and then holy [ __ ] it worked.\nCan I ask when you review those today, which was the single best investment on a multiple basis?\nOh, the early ones, I mean, Twitter and Alibaba were pretty good.\nUm, those were those were when I realized there's something here.\nLike making a little bit of money in your whole life, working 10 years in a profession, thinking you've kind of made it coming from I grew up in a orange trailer in my Utah, you know, having like a hundred grand in your bank account one random Tuesday felt pretty good.\nAnd I said, \"This is something interesting.\"\nAnd um, I remember the first, you know, I tried then I was like I got some advice, um, you should raise some third party capital, and that's when I really understood the power of OPM, other people's money, and um, I went around to all those alums who basically I think gave me some money because they were tired of me asking that I worked at five different large academic institutions, and so just so I get it right, what was the thesis?\nFor me it was very simple.\nIf there's fewer institutions to help companies go public, coming off the financial crisis, funds started deploying large sums of money.\nSo then the byproduct would be companies would stay private longer.\nThe average age from inception to IPO was like 3 years leading up to 2010.\nFrom 2010 to 2018, it got to like seven or eight years.\nToday our average portfolio company's 15 years old.\nSo there was to me something that was clear there, which was there's an opportunity to buy shares from these people have no liquidity, and there you should be able to make more of a return than, and also companies wouldn't return my phone call frankly because I had like no money, and hey Twitter, you know, hey Dorsey, my name's Larry Aschebrook, I'm a you know, a retread athlete that wants to become a venture capitalist, can I invest in Twitter?\n[Laughter]\nAnd by the way, my fund size is uh, I don't have a fund.\nI just have like 200 grand in my name.\nI'd like to buy, you know, $10,000 worth of Twitter stock.\nThat that conversation obviously wouldn't go anywhere.\nSo, um, and so you have this moment in time when you're like, \"Hey, we're seeing this extension of private markets.\nWe're seeing a lot more capital flow in.\"\nAnd so, you go out and fund raise for the first vehicle.\nHow big was the vehicle?\nThree years, $35 million deployed along the way.\nWell, wait, pause.\nIt was three years to fund raise.\nYeah, three years.\nUh, 2010 to 2013.\nWow.\n34 million or 35 million and deployed the money as I raised it.\nSo, you did multiple closes.\nOh, yeah.\nMultiple.\nWhat was the first close?\nI don't even know how many.\nCouple million bucks.\nWhat do you advise founders on closings?\nI know it sounds strange, but like you get different advice.\nClose as soon as possible.\n50% one close.\nFounders for for companies or founders for new managers?\nNew managers.\nYeah.\nI think well, first of all, if I if I knew then what I know today, I'm not sure I would start the journey cuz I I don't think I I didn't know how hard it would be.\nI just wanted to have do something different with my life and try to create value for my family and try to try to set my children up for a different future than I had.\nI was lucky.\nI grew up, my siblings grew up in the same house as me.\nWe don't have the same life today.\nI got out of the squalor because I could run and throw and catch.\nMy siblings didn't have that benefit.\nI didn't want my children that who knows what their outcome would be.\nSo the whole genesis of it for me was to try to create something and seeing opportunity and capitalize on.\nSo with my mentality still to this day, raising billion2 billion dollar funds is the money's there, you close, start deploying it, build a portfolio, show some improvement in NAV, it is inertia that makes it easier.\nI don't have the benefit even today with the returns that we've had and the DPI we've had to say, hey, I'm raising a new fund and have two billion show up in two months.\nI just I don't, we don't have the benefit of that, um, uh, and I'm okay with that because I think the way we're forced to raise money makes us better.\nNow 2021, it was very different.\nWe both sat at our houses.\nI was sat at my farm.\nYou sat in your underwear probably and raised, I don't know, in 3 months you, I don't know what you raised, 150 million, 150 million bucks.\nWe raised a billion four and then turned down another 700 million, um, in a very short period of time.\nAnd companies, by the way, also raised a ton of money, you know, in insane insane insane numbers.\nWe're gonna get there, but I want to tell the story before we move into that.\nIt's just such an amazing story.\nAnd so, when we look back at that, okay, so 3 years, 35 million.\nAwesome.\nWhat was the first big mover in that portfolio?\nWhere was the real momentum?\nThe real momentum happened in 2014.\nAnd that's when I really felt the power of what I was trying to do when Alibaba goes public.\nUm, and you had that in the fund?\nI had, yes, I bought bought shares from Jack Ma's family office.\nUm, and and wow, what a what a creator of shareholder value.\nJack, I'm sorry, dude.\nHow do you get in touch with Jack Mah's family office to buy shares from them?\nThat I mean, that's the story of my life.\nIt's like, you know, it's it's it's a bit of bit of luck.\nYou meet a alum that I knew knew somebody that knew somebody, and you know, kind of introduced me to gentleman's name was Barry Pcell, who was running um, some of Jack Ma's money in Virginia of all places, I believe, and he said, hey, we have some shares to sell.\nI'm like, okay, hired a group in India to do some DD because I had like two people and wrote me an invest committee.\nOh yeah, my early investment committee memos in the early vintages were outsourced to, you know, a group of really smart um, analysts in India that you could pay a fraction of what you could pay talent in the US, and I didn't have any money to invest in talent, and that today is what Sam Altman does with deep brea.\nOkay, so we so yeah, Alibaba was the for me and was there's a business here, it was grinding grinding grinding, that was the first one that was material for me is 2014 Ali Baba, and are you putting size into these like Yeah.\nSo from the beginning, again, when you you don't know what you don't know.\nSo I didn't like the idea in my personality is kind of you go big or go home.\nAnd so I don't I didn't like the idea of trying to manage a lot of these positions cuz I didn't really know how.\nSo my idea was I want to have I wanted to put a little bit of money in, understand the businesses, and then pick a few and put all my money in.\nToday we call it land and expand.\nWe have all this [ __ ] that we say that our marketing, you know, our marketing team, our our team is second to none.\nReserves heavy modeled, but we're diversified on entry.\nSee, it sounds like that, but really for me it was, oh, fewer companies cuz ultimately, how do I get liquidity if I have 50 companies?\nI don't, it's my money.\nI don't have much.\nI've got a few people who trusted me.\nI want to get their money in and out as quick as I can because as you're trying to raise that fund and you know what it's like, what do people want?\nTrack record.\nThey want pedigree.\nThey want um, are you you know what's your TVPI going to be?\nWhat's your mo going to be?\nI had people who were running their own businesses give me a little bit of money and say I want the money back quick.\nI want optionality to it.\nSo from the early days it was how can I build a a a strategy that I can actually make a good living at to have velocity of the capital come back and optionality.\nAnd today our business has become that.\nAnd the early generation of it was start off with little checks because I didn't have much money.\nAs I raise more money, the challenge of raising the first vintages, the benefit of that was you didn't have a lot to deploy.\nSo I'm deploying it as I have it.\nSo inherently I'm doing this land and expand without even knowing it.\nThen you look back at the returns and you say, \"Holy [ __ ] it works.\"\nStart off with a couple small checks and then all of a sudden you keep getting the data and I'm sending it yes to my my my awesome group in India to give me the data back.\nI'm sending it over there.\nHey, it's amazing you work 24/7 time zones.\nBut anyway, what comes back is hey these five companies are better.\nAnd so then what I did is I put a lot of concentration in and still to this day, which some people are not comfortable with, 80 hopefully 90% of our risk are in 10 companies.\nSo, so when we go back to that first 35, that's how many companies sort of give or take?\nLike seven.\nSeven companies.\nBut most of it is Alibaba.\nThis is funny.\nAlibaba.\nThis is just dumb block.\nCome on.\nI'm not that smart.\nAlibaba, uh, Spotify, uh, Palantir, um, and Twitter.\nOkay.\nNo, you're not that smart.\nI'm not that smart.\nI'm not you're either the best [ __ ] picker ever or you but but actually you can't get that lucky, and so you have to actually be cuz if you just did one I would have, but what do all those have in common?\nRight.\nIt's the it and now you look back and say well how\n\n\nDo you do that, right? And there were some dogs in there. Blame some clean tech that client Perkins sold me that was just a flaming bag of turds on your front porch. Like, look at this guy. He's super, he's energetic. Let's give him some garbage, you know? And that's what the old line seil firms did in the beginning. Oh yeah, we'll let you in the syndicate. Sure. Oh well, how much are you putting in? Oh, we're putting in very little, but our LPs are co-investing a lot.\n\nThat's an alarm bell. Now that you know it's ringing as loud as like a four-alarm fire. When Doug Leone calls you and goes, \"I've got something just for you.\" Just for you. Yes. You're going to love it. You're going to love it. It's really going to help your first-time manager. I really want you to succeed. So, what do those four have in common then to you when you look back on them and reflect? Um, those, the timing of that period, no liquidity, large private valuations, um, really differentiated, unchallenged business models. None of, no one was doing anything like them. And there was the liquidity window was just, was still early from the financial crisis because you look at the number of IPOs from 2010 to 14, there wasn't many. Was the pricing premium applied to them, and what I mean by that is if you think about that applied to today, your SpaceXes of the world or your, you know, Yeah, which we had in our third vintage. We can get to that, but like there's a pricing premium on it where you're paying an exorbitant price for that defensibility and for that moat. Yeah.\n\nToday, probably, um, then there's no options for liquidity that it wasn't that it was you actually could get really good value. And I think one of the interesting things about the cycle we've been in the last 15 years is, you know, now we look back at the funds and dissect them and say what kind of value did you get as being a secondary direct buyer? In early vintages, we got like 35 cents on the dollar by being a secondary direct buyer over primary buyers because there was no other secondary buyers. So I kind of, because a lot of reasons. Sure. Okay. Give myself a little credit, hard work, drive, run through a wall regardless of how thick it is and just keep hitting it until it falls. That's my mentality, which is good and bad. You're really leaving the brawn, not brain department, aren't you? Yeah, right. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm just running through a wall. Running through a wall. It's there, but I'm going to break it. No, but it's I think that early vintages, up until 2020, all of those vintages, you were getting a lot of value by being a secondary direct buyer. Now, that's a key differentiator. What I wanted was, and still to this day, what I want is I want to touch and feel the founders, the companies, the data. I was amazed by what I started, the the paradigm that opened for me mentally was something that I had never tapped into my entire life was this was really interesting what these companies are doing. Do you think your business model still applies today when you are so detached from the data and the founder at the level that you're going in now to a lot of these secondary businesses? So that is the, that's the misconception of what we do, and I love it because it actually is when a good LP, the light bulb goes off, they realize that it's the opposite of that. We get primary level data, we touch and feel the founders because actually the value of the discount is back, and they value the work that you do today because there's still a massive need of liquidity, but they want a trusted partner. And that's, that's part of the journey to how we got here today is by doing something different. But sorry, the value of the discount is back. Are you kidding me? No, it's amazing. No, no, no. But for the premium assets, yeah, you're coming in at cost. No, not always. No, I mean, it's the market on direct secondary buying is really fragmented.\n\nYou have the people. So, first of all, in the US, you have to be regulated a bit of a different way than most fund managers to do it in quantity, which is RAIA. Yeah. A fully registered kind of like a hedge fund. So, you're seeing a lot of people opt into that. Why? Because they want to pair primaries and secondaries together. Um, and they want to do some one-off secondaries, big checks. One of the things from the early vintages that teased out that we still do today, it was the frequency of transactions and touch points of really microtransactions, sub $2 million, let's say today on a $2 billion fund, give you a lot of interim data that you would not normally get in that touch point as a primary investor. It starts to provide you that Trojan horse moment to know when to triple down on a whiz, which we did in our 2022 vintage fund and have the outcome that we're going to have. Those founders are amazing. But to make 3x in 18 months is because of what they created. But the opportunity to do that is because you offer something different than others. And that's to the people. You asked me a question earlier. If you're going to start raising a fund today, what would you do? Yeah, raising money. Don't take no for an answer. Open every door. All those things. Deploy as you go. But also create a firm that's different. The world doesn't need just another early stage seed manager, growth manager, crossover fund. There's so many. Dude, I agree completely. That's why we have media companies. It's very, very, you differentiate your business by sitting here and doing this and in the know. And how many awesome people do you get to talk to to find and get the references to the next great thing? You have figured out a niche. Most don't. Most say, \"Oh, you know, I worked at XYZ old logo firm for 10 years and I know how to operate. I'm going to start a VC firm and I'm going to go to 10 LPs that were in that old one that I got to know and give me some money.\" And they fund them. And they fund them. I mean, they really do, like right before this, like we love the spinouts. You spin out of Excel or you name your big firm and we fund you. Great. And that also provides the ecosystem for us to operate in. Totally get that. I I want to go back to the four names you mentioned. You mentioned how do you get Spotify? What's the story there?\n\nI I love Daniel. He's one of my oldest friends. Shaq as well. They all special. How did you get a Spotify in 2014? Yeah. So, so one of the first employees I hired, um, young guy out of Berkeley. He's now my co-PM, Spencer Mloud. You got to meet this guy. He, he's a, he's a living caricature of what Silicon Valley is. He was working as an analyst with me. Um, this is like 2014. Um, I think he's like 22 years old at the time. And, um, I was telling him this story about how my, my mind exploded when I was in college and I could download Metallica on Napster. And he's like, \"You know, you've heard of Spotify, right?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Well, maybe we should buy some shares in Spotify.\" And it literally, that's kind of how it started. And we started searching around and we found a celebrity that was going through a unfortunate change of life scenario and a divorce, and he had like $4 million of stock, and we had a, you know, $300 million fund at this point. I'm like, yeah, let's buy it. Well, Spotify had this interesting process of how they approved shareholders. It was kind of onerous and difficult, and my mentality was, hey, well, they're not responding, so let's go see them. So, literally Spencer and I flew without an appointment to Stockholm. Um, my wife came. Uh, we spent a week there in the terrible, nor, like November. Um, we had a new baby, and we were staying in an Airbnb that we rented. Um, which became a great investment for us later on. But anyway, we started going to get a meeting, and finally this young lawyer, Peter Grenelius, I think, took pity on us in the waiting room and took a meeting, and we pitched, I think to, I look back and all the pitches I ever gave a company on how we could add value with a small fund and a lot of co-investment. You know, Spotify is what it's become, but they're like, \"Yeah, we could use the help.\" Very humble, very nice people. They introduced us to a gentleman named Johan Burkus, who's, who was at the end, I think, the treasurer and then went on to Bolt, where we also became an investor in the EU ride-hailing business. And before we left the meeting, they were like, do you think you could buy $150 million worth of stock? And I said, sure, and I didn't have the money, cuz we were in the process of raising the fund, and I think we had like closed on $125 million.\n\nHave you, have you done the diligence? Have you done the diligence? Yeah, by this time we did some, we did due diligence. We'd written a memo, and you know, there's diligence and there's diligence. There's diligence like a $20 million. This is mosaic theory. So most of the early stuff had to be mosaic theory because companies until really Spotify. So the early wins are, you know, gathering data, trying through public sources, but it's not really available. You're trying to gather, um, uh, through contacts and putting as many feelers out and then sending all this information to what became our own research team to develop a thesis around it. Um, and then the Trojan horse became the check to get the info. So in that land and expand strategy that we run as it's developed, often that first check is, is kind of that Trojan horse because you want to, you like it. You've done some mosaic theory work. You think it works, but you don't really know. You go in. So, we go in. They give us, they give us a whole deep dive on the business. And it's amazing. It's like nothing I ever could imagine. Right. It's nothing I've seen before. Why so? Why? So, what was it about it that was made? 20. At that time, the penetration of the usership in in in Sweden was like 25% of the population used it. I mean, that's amazing. 25% of the population used the product, and you're like, it's already cool because you're using it. And of course, Apple Music and I think the Beats and, you know, uh, Title and all these, you know, SoundCloud, all these competitors, but what they divulged to us in that one-on-one personal meeting after saying no to us for six straight days, um, was the fact that the record labels were also investors. That to me was like, okay, this is like Napster on steroids, and it worked. And obviously they went on to create amazing shareholder value. It's one of the best businesses we ever invested in. And we had $150 million to go find. So what do you do then? They're like, \"Hey, we got $150 million.\" Are you yourself into Yeah. Um, because is it 150 million or none? Yeah. So the way that the transfer process worked on that business is pretty interesting. It actually gave you time. So you sign the documents today. It took like 60 days to clear. So we had like, let's say, 25 million ready to go. Awesome. Concentrated position on a $300 million fund. We're going to start. Let's do it. We had 4 million, they said yes to. We'll take another 25. So we went out and went on a world tour with our thesis. Spencer and I, I mean, different countries. Uh, how long did you have? We had 60 days. We had 60 days to raise 125. And we got to day 59, and we had sent 141 million to, to uh, one of the earliest investors, very predominant Norwegian fund. We'll leave their name out of it. Awesome founder of that fund who is an iconic, like pop star, or sorry, metal, heavy metal star in in music in his own right. Very serious guy, very hard guy. And we have $141 million we've sent him and the roofer ends. And if we don't send him the $9 million, the deal blows up, and I don't have $9 million to my name. So I borrow it from him. You borrow it from, borrow the 9 million bucks from him. You call him up and say, \"I'm so sorry. I don't have the 9 million, but if you lend it to me, I'll close and I'll pay you back.\" And he's like, \"Sure, I'll lend you the It wasn't exactly that pleasant, Harry, but it worked.\" And um, God bless my wife. She's like, \"Do you love this business?\" I'm like, \"It's the most amazing business I've ever seen.\" She's like, \"Well, how do you, how do we figure out how to own the 9 million?\" And we figured it out. And that nine turned into a very different number. And that was the life-changing event for me. Spotify buying into our business model. We then went on to become a top 10 global shareholder of Spotify. We went as far as to putting up signs in their break room, we'll buy your shares, buying all these odd lot transactions along the way and built a huge position, and it ended up being like a billion dollar outcome to our LPS. Wow. 40% of my third fund went into Spotify. Wow. How much was that of the third fund? Well, third fund was 380 million. So, it was, it was a lot of money. Wow. Very concentrated risk. What price is it going in? Just kind of give or take, like Yeah. So, um, in many ways, uh, we, we did it at the time in which it was perfect because you had Adele announced she was leaving the platform. You had Apple Music really taking market share. Um, and you, you had Taylor Swift saying, \"I want my library off.\" And and Daniel Ek came out, and I think one of the smartest things he's ever done, and he agreed with the artist. He said, \"I have your back. I understand why you pulled from our product. You're not the issue. And the record labels had an option to buy more shares. And\n\n\nThey executed the option to buy more shares.\nSo to me, that was like there's this aha moment where we can triple down.\nNobody else knows this information.\nYou buy from all the people who were scared to death and you do the counterintuitive thing and you you you take the bet.\nAnd we did and it worked and we bought at like a 50% discount to the current financing round and we just kept buying it there for the next two years.\nSo after the 150 you kept buying.\nWe Yeah, we kept buying.\nSo we we we pulled a bunch of money together.\nSome of it we were able to put into our fund.\nOthers we had very prominent very very prominent logos come into our SPVS to buy the stock because we had we locked in the access.\nAnd to me that became so you have this journey.\nYou start you're just hustling.\nYou get to 35 million, the second fund was 36 million, raise it in a year.\nUm, very 1 million increase.\nYeah.\n1 million increase.\nYes.\nFewer investors, thank God.\nAnd then you get to a $380 million pool of capital.\nUm, and in that you take a lot of concentration in Spotify, but on top of the concentration we had, we did another 700 million in co-invest in Spotify.\nIn Spotify.\n700 million.\nMhm.\nYeah.\nI know.\nHuge.\nBut that fund also, but by the way, that fund also had um Lyft, Uber, um um uh SpaceX, um Instacart, um Impossible Foods, um uh the list goes on and on of companies because of Spotify's acceptance of our model, opened up the door.\nIt opened the door.\nAnd Johan Burrquist and Peter Gandelius.\nThey're they're the two people that have made probably the most direct impact to my life because they trusted that we could do it and they put their names on the line to the to Daniel Ek that we could actually achieve it.\nAnd then we went and and somehow, you know, Spencer and I Spencer poor guy got shingles.\nHe literally got shingles.\nHe was like 23 years four years old got shingles.\nI find it so funny because Daniel is like the guy who I just send rude memes to most mornings.\nI mean it's it's an amazing business.\nIt's it's truly amazing.\nNo, he is absolutely incredible when you go through those names.\nYeah.\nWhat about Uber?\nHow does that come?\nYeah.\nUber comes, you know, we often in our thesis we'll back two businesses trying to attack the same thing.\nLyft in that fund became the value play.\nUm, we sold it.\nUm, and did you make money?\nWe made a ton of money on Lyft and we lost money on Uber.\nWhat?\nYeah.\nWell, how does that work?\nI think it when Uber chose to go public, I think um it was a tough time.\nUm, today Uber's valued off of gross profit, which is I think a good a good metric for them.\nUm and and a massive business and I don't think when it went public it was rewarded properly in our business model we don't hold rarely do we hold post public oftentimes we sell before they're public and as it went public at the price it did on a converted basis um we were underwater we lost uh I think we made we we we lost like 20 cents on the dollar and lift we made like a 3x so how much did you lose on Uber?\nI don't know, 50 million bucks probably.\nAnd you made a 3x on Lyft.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBecause you sold before the IPO.\nWe sold most of before the IPO.\nAnd you know, we won't talk about the names that buy, but you'd be surprised of the it's kind of I think one of the issues with Silicon Valley, one of the benefits of being in Chicago is we isolate ourselves a bit from the herd mentality.\nAnd it's like sometimes it's like sheep.\nthey just jump one on after the other and they buy more stock and things that you see that you should sell and it just takes one brand name to jump on board and 10 others jump on board and we just kept selling our lift stock to to others.\nUm and you know I get why they did it.\nIt was a value play compared to Uber and it went on to work for them but we made our multiple and went home and distributed the cash.\nDo you think it's very clear when rationality leaves the room?\nYeah, that's something I've spent a lot of time in the last few years trying to figure out because 2021 all rationality left the room 2020 2021 and and us like everyone else just kept deploying capital but it left the room in public markets too.\nThe multiples were off the charts.\nYeah.\nNo, everybody left the room.\nI think you know you want and you're told to play the game on the field as Bill Gurley says.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think um a few things about that period that that is the rationality leaving the room that you want to protect yourself.\nI think guard rails are important.\nA good friend of mine and I know you had him on the show.\nI'm a huge fan of what they've done.\nMitchell Green, you know, I best things in life are copied um in in some ways um you know he has his lead edge eight.\nWe have our G Squared 8.\nSorry Mitch, we kind of borrowed it from you.\nUm is it the same?\nIt's not the same.\nUm, they're similar because we have a similar style.\nUm, and uh, they're similar, but I think we had to really adjust ours after 2021 because I think it it had holes in it that were exacerbated.\nWhat were the holes and how did you Too much qualitative, too much my gut, my feel, too much um, who else is in the room?\nToo much Yeah.\njust the soft stuff that venture capitalists and growth managers like to pride themselves about.\nAnd our strategy has to be about the numbers.\nIt it has to be just cut and dry, cutthroat.\nDoes it work financially or not?\nBecause at our stage, unlike yours, which it doesn't, you know, from your seat, in a lot of ways, I envy your seat because if you pay 50 pre or 100 pre, if it's a good business, you're still going to make a 5x.\n10 pre, 50 pre, does it really matter for you?\nMaybe for me, is it 3 billion or 2.5 billion?\nYou walk that forward, I can't make my 2 and 1/2x net in a 5-year period if I miss that.\nNow, I get an okay return, but I'm not rehired.\nDoes your mindset change around that when you see the elasticity of outcome sizes that we have today?\nI completely agree with you in a normal world of the last 5 years, but when you have companies that are hitting a trillion, a trillion, five, two trillion, Dude, who gave us a [ __ ] if it's 10 or 15 billion?\nYeah, I think that that's in a shorter thesis.\nYou're able to play that game.\nAnd that's and that's one of the benefits to our thesis is is yes, as long as you don't get caught at the end of that cycle, which happened in 2021.\nSo, our earlier vintages were selling into it like it was happy days, right?\nDid you just offload?\nOh, just massive amounts.\nI mean, we made ridiculous sums of money for LPs in that period, which set our business up to be able to survive a bad vintage.\nAnd we're working our tails off, our asses off on our 2020 vintage, but it's hard when you're shipping a ton of money back.\nLP's happy.\nYeah, I think LPs are happy.\nUm, it's also their expectation.\nAnd so looking for a pat on the back because you did your job is something I talk to our team a lot about.\nYeah, it's a big win, but hey, we also lost $400 million of their money over here.\nLike, yeah, we made them money, but we look at these losses.\nLike, how how can we lose that kind of money?\nAnd and I think keeping our team focused on that and reducing the amount of mistakes because in a short fund life, liquidity is already hard.\nIt's really hard as a fund manager as you know.\nYou're a five to sevenyear fund life, aren't you?\nYeah.\nWith some levers, we can get it a bit longer, but um you know, for the first time, we've had to pull one of those levers and it it it really guts me.\nIs that a mistake on your behalf or is that a changing landscape that is in Yeah, I think it's, you know, you are what you become, sort to speak.\nAnd yeah, are there businesses that I would love to take a 10-year horizon on because I think they're, you know, amazing companies.\nYes, 100%.\nBut that's not what our LPs have hired us to do.\nThey have hired us specifically for this Northstar DPI statistic that I've pitched them on and our team have pitched them on and for 15 straight years across seven.\nThey hire you to make the most money for them and you can go back to them and say listen the job of a manager is to change to moving markets and I believe that actually we will make more money for you with a longer hold period because of X Y and Zed reason.\nYeah, I think and you now have the data.\nI'm so sorry to interrupt you data to go look at Palantir.\nLook at Oh my god.\nWhy so Larry I I I even if I would have held Palantir for three more years.\nI mean who knew they would go on to How much money would you have made if you held it?\nGod I you listen Harry we would be having this podcast in my bubble in outer space.\nBut is it like 2x more like Oh my god.\nNo.\nLike I had an LP, longtime LP, first vintage, been back every time.\nI was talking to him the other day about the the difficulties of our 2020 vintages and the lessons learned and and you know how I'm more energized today than ever before and how, you know, we're going to make it make it up in spades.\nAnd he said to me, you know what, Larry, you get a free pass on that one.\nyou made me because I distributed the shares to to to to some of our early funds.\nWe distributed shares.\nWe no longer do that.\nWe just sent cash.\nAnd he's like, I held that Palantir stock and I've been investing in every one of your vintages from the proceeds of my first 50 grand I gave you.\nSo, it just gives you a perspective.\nI sold it at like I think we made a 3x on it and sold it at like $9 a share.\nYeah.\nWhat's it now?\nOh, I don't know.\nI try not to look at it because it's one of those things is is you're like, you know, you don't want to inflict the self-inflicted wound of the pain.\nBut I think it's I don't know.\nIt's 80 90 bucks a share.\nMy question to you is have your guard rails not now become a constraint, a negative constraint.\nYeah.\nLook, I think if if the answer to that is we're doing what we're hired to do, and that is to generate the velocity of the capital for our subset of LPs.\nThat's not for everybody.\nOur LPs are looking for an ability to play the fastest growing, most dynamic technology companies in the world, and they want to get in and out with optionality of their capital to give more to firms like yours in every a 5-year period.\nSo if they backto back funds of ours, they make a 4x cash on cash return in 10 years, but they have the optionality of it.\nAnd if you have confidence in the mouse trap you've built, 4x in 10 years, cash on cash return is pretty hard to beat.\nThat's phenomenal.\nOh my god, dude.\nWe all count these.\nWe all count these big numbers.\nLook at the real numbers.\nI've seen them.\nYou've seen them.\nThey're very different in reality.\nYeah.\nI mean, when your northstar is a DPI figure, there's no hiding.\nListen, let's go to the 2020.\nYou said there about, hey, you get a hall pass.\nI look back on on mine.\nI, you know, I said to you after our war, it's really special to actually have the conversations that we do.\nAnd I really meant it.\nThe candidness is important.\nWhen you look back now, what do you think your sins were?\nI and I've talked a lot about this openly to our LPs because um I take pride in going around the world and we have 60 countries and six continents of LPs.\nIt was smart in my opinion when I started the firm.\nIt was fun.\nUh it's it's difficult now.\nThe main mistake we made was believing our own [ __ ] was believing that we were cuz coming up to that point we had some of the best returns in our industry.\nlike we were raising money.\nIt didn't we just to put the flag out there.\nIt was hard.\nWe go around raise money.\nCo-investment raise money.\nLife changed dramatically for my partners, myself, our team.\nJust to ship back, you know, uh 2018 vintage fund by 2020, we had the DPI to almost one.\nOh yeah.\nAirbnb goes public, make a 3x.\nCorsera goes public, make a 3x.\nSell our SpaceX stock privately, you know.\nmake a make a big return.\nImpossible foods make this huge return.\nImpossible foods.\nOh, yeah.\nWe made a killing.\nHow did you make money on Impossible?\nBecause this the herd mentality.\nI mean, I think that that it it's it's all a product of the time you're operating in.\nYou go back to that period.\nImpossible Foods was a big deal.\nPeople made a ton of money on that.\nBeyond Meat and what was the other one, the egg company in um one of my best friends made like $10 million on a Beyond Meat SPV.\nAnd I'm like in the market cap of the company today.\nYeah.\nNo, I think and that's the I look at the big wins that the where the market cap goes in a bad way is look, we made we were the largest shareholder of Corsera through our strategy.\nWe owned 16% of Corsera when it went public.\nThey're trading.\nWe sold the stock at 36 bucks a share and it's at $8.\n$800 million back to LPS on Corsera.\n$800 million back to LPs on Corsera.\nSo, so that's part of the strategy where you get the concentration and the law of large numbers actually works and it's easier to manage a fund on liquidity, but getting to 2020 the mistakes we made.\nSo, you had all these exits.\nToast was our largest position in that fund.\nIt's trading at 76 bucks a share.\nMitchell Green and I did Toast together, man.\nWe were It's like you're popping champagnes around the office.\nYou're like, &quot;This is We're so smart.\nWe're the [ __ ] smartest people in the room, you know?\nAnd then I'm on a ski lift in Montana and I'm looking at unfortunately and I'll admit it out loud, Yahoo Finance.\nIt was before Perplexity.\nIt was before perplexity.\nAnd I'm like, wait a\n\n\nSecond.\nY Toast is $76 a share.\nWhat the hell?\nWait a second.\nHow is it $76 a share?\nIt's a great business, but 76 bucks a share.\nI mean, whoa.\nAt the time, now Toast is amazing company, right?\nIt revolutionized the restaurant space.\nAnd by the way, saved tens of, I don't know, hundreds, tens, thousands, hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US because of the way they pivoted during COVID to help restaurant tours.\nAn amazing business, great founders.\nUm, all that being said, it wasn't worth as a public company that price.\nSo, to me, that was kind of the canary in the coal mine.\nAnd I started freaking out because we just deployed $900 million between, you know, beginning of COVID and 2021 to your point jumping on board with all these primaries and secondaries.\nAh, we're super smart.\nWe can do some primaries, too.\nSo, what was the realization when you saw Toast is so that that Toast was I have a problem in this vintage.\nWe've overpaid for all of it.\nAll of it.\nThat we've overpaid.\nGo to the team and a lot of them aren't with us anymore because we had to we we really went through a kind of identity crisis and said, \"Listen, I had went through a period where I wanted to believe that our firm was you know more than just the co-PMs and Spencer and myself and that we could we could do a traditional model because we don't do that.\nWe deploy the capital between the two of us.\nWe have a research team that support us.\nIt's more like a hedge fund.\nIt's quick decisions.\"\nBut at that period of time you're like, \"Hey, we've made all this money.\nWe're growing our business.\nLPs are coming aboard with big checks.\nThey want to chase MO.\nThey want to chase TVPI, right?\nWe have to have a thesis that's a bit longer, seven years, not five.\nSo, let's divide the capital up amongst a bunch of people.\nLet's build the traditional fund model cuz we're so smart.\nAnd you know what?\nWe're still conservative.\nSo, we're going to pay 12 times last 12 months to enterprise value on SAS.\nPublic markets are trading at 25.\nPat yourself on the back, guys.\nWe're super smart.\nOh, the floor can't be lower than 10.\nThat's a historic multiple.\nWake up in 2025.\nThe multiple is four.\nSo when that happened when when a really awesome business which we made a ton of money on by selling it at the right time and harvesting and they toast in toast and they they've went on to create a tremendous amount of shareholder value as a public company, don't get me wrong, but it was trading at this crazy multiple.\nI went back to our LPs and said, \"Listen, we made we we we [ __ ] up.\nWe need to pivot and we need to we need another 300 million bucks because I need protect this thing.\"\nAnd so we went in and we did structured equity deal after structured equity deal.\nAs that market's falling and the house is on fire, we're running in the front door with cash and we're going and doing minimum IRR deals.\nWe're partnering with the super savvy investors and the light speededs and the dragoners and the DSTs of the world.\nAnd we're doing deals that nobody knows about.\nThird point code and we're putting all kinds of structure in where these founders believed their own [ __ ] and they said, \"I'll take the high price topline, but I'll embed structure in the equity.\"\nAnd so that vintage of all of our vintages has 70% primary with and 40% of that has structure.\nFor people that don't know what does that mean, it means you embed IRR hurdles in multiples in the paper.\nSo regardless if you say the business is worth 8 billion on paper, the company has to generate you a 25% IRR or a 2 and a half x, whichever is greater.\nSo every day the returns ticking and you walk it out now 5 years, the entire prep stack is totally [ __ ] because we the last money in has this ratchet that's just eating up all the value.\nAnd that pivot and and and the willingness I think our team, not just me, the willingness for for Spencer and I to get together and say, \"What what were we thinking?\nWe have to try to save this thing.\"\nOur LPs trusted us with a billion at that point.\nBillion five.\nBut but you're going like on the offensive with cash in the door when everyone's running out.\nYeah.\nIn terms of the actual saving, what are you doing with the overly inflated asset prices that you have?\nSelling.\nSelling.\nCutting your losses.\nSelling, taking a different perspective on multiples and saying, \"Okay, you know, yeah, you have to get the price to 10x.\"\nSo, you're going back in and assets you overpaid and you're using the secondary market as the market's falling to lower cost basis.\nSo, we did a lot of primaries.\nYes.\nBecause we we didn't like the secondary multiple because it traded at a premium during that period.\nSo if you paid 25x in a public company to enterprise value to last 12 months of ARR in a SAS company privately they traded at 50.\nAnd so you're like, \"Shit, the secondary market is overly in the secondary market doesn't work.\nMy business model's broken.\"\nAnd so you go to primary.\nYou go to primary.\nYou go earlier.\nYou do small cap.\nHindsight, the mistake I made was not having besides thinking we're smarter than we are.\nUm is structurally in our business not having the levers to pull.\nCuz leading up to then it was like whatever we did worked and you could get in and out in 5 years and make a 2x net.\nYou're a hero.\nYou just keep raising money and it keeps getting bigger and your amount your wealth generation keeps getting bigger.\nSo we're unstoppable.\nWe're you know Tiger Woods in in 2001.\nYou start to create this persona that everything works and and pivoting.\nIt was a lot of soulsearching.\nWe had a a a large meeting and was it difficult for you as a leader?\nI was.\nYes, it was difficult because I couldn't believe that I talked myself into it.\nI could, you know, Yeah.\nI had a Silicon Valley uh uh coach here.\nYou got a me, a person that grew up in a trailer in Mighton, Utah, athlete, and I have to have a coach to tell me how great I am.\nI bought into the whole hook, line, and sinker [ __ ] of the entire problem in my opinion of Silicon Valley and so did our firm.\nWhat is that problem?\nI think losing focus of what you're hired to do and paying more attention to um the lifestyle that comes along with being a money manager and the circles that you roll in and about the deals that you're doing and the money that you're managing versus at the end of the day the actual value you're creating for your people who have trusted you with their capital and making a difference for your underlying companies.\nThat's what's important.\nNot going to a dinner party and saying I just invested in Whiz or Anthropic or OpenAI or Airbnb.\nThat's the culture in my opinion that in Silicon Valley and it's people deploying the capital that don't have the responsibility to sit in front of the LPs to explain the problems.\nIt's a herd mentality that rushes in and LPs follow.\nBy the way, LPs follow at the wrong time.\nIt's very easy to raise money in a crazy market like you and I both did and many other managers did when it's the wrong time and it's very hard.\nOur 2022 vintage we raised very difficult to raise.\nHow big was that fund?\nBillion two.\nBillion two.\nWas that the first billion fund?\nNo, 2020 was a billion four.\nSo you went down in fund size.\nWell the 2020 vintage we topped that up.\nRemember was I was saying we went back and said, \"Hey, we've made all these mistakes.\nWe have to protect.\nWe need more money.\"\nAnd it went from a billion two to a billion five and the protection there was because pay to play was coming in.\nIt was because we saw that we had overpaid on the first first trunch of capital so I wanted more to combat that with secondaries and also structure so you hadn't lost faith in the underlying assets.\nSome of them have went on to monumental failures um that have been well written about.\nUm, but most are really fundamentally good underlying companies.\nSo when you review that period of 2020, what do you wish that you had done or if you could replay the tape, go back to the first half or quarter or whatever you Americans like to call your timings and sports games.\nInnings.\nThat's cricket, my friend.\nNo, that's baseball.\nOh, right.\nSorry.\nIt's okay.\nBoth, I guess.\nBoth.\nThere we go.\nBoth.\nUm, what would you have done now if you could replay that tape?\nUm, if I yeah, if I could go and talk to my myself then like I would say sit on my hands.\nYou did not need to be part of that ridiculous 700 million priced round for a 10 millionaire or SAS.\nYeah, I think that that's the that's the easy answer is is wait.\nUm, I think if I could do it all over again, I would keep the control tighter to Spencer and myself on deployment.\nUm, and that way as we went forward, the only excuse we could have is that he and I made the decisions and we could we wouldn't have any excuses.\nIt would be clear that we made the mistakes versus, hey, we tried to do the Silicon Valley mentality and hand out the capital and build teams underneath and, you know, it's, yeah, it's the G Squared logos that we invested in, but the attribution actually goes to X, Y, and Z.\nYou don't like attribution?\nNo.\nWhy don't you like attribution?\nI I think that it it it causes unintended consequences.\nIn what way?\nBecause it's a very common Yeah.\nIt's because people want to people want to pat themselves on the back for the wins and deflate the losses and deflect the losses.\nExcuse me.\nI think if you want to build a firm that stands the test of time, the logo makes the investment.\nIt withstands any transition period in any leadership role in the firm because the logo made it, not the individual.\nAnd that's what I'm that's what we're trying to build at G Squared is when I look out 20 years from now and say, \"Where do I want it to be?\"\nI want, you know, hopefully some grandkids to think about the logo that was built and say, \"My grandpop built that and it's still there and it's like the Jim Simmons 40% annualized IRRa for 20 years.\nDude, it's what I always say.\nI always say that about my grandchildren.\nI don't have children yet, so it's really quite a step.\nUm, but can you tell, you know, we mentioned lessons on a company basis?\nIf you look back at one of yours that was a big loss, what was your subsequent lesson from that?\nWell, we've had a lot in that concentrated equity portfolio.\nYou're going to have some monumental misses.\nHundreds of millions of dollars, you're gonna light on fire if you have the fortitude to stick to it.\nSo, we've got a lot of those lessons to draw on.\nWhat's the one that most that's most painful?\nUm, there's a couple I would think.\nUh, one is is Theranos and the other is 23andme.\nHow did Theranos happen?\nSo, the nose um secondary, we actually the the the the big loss there was for for me personally um because we did it we we signed up to do a secondary um at a really good price and met with management.\nSomething didn't feel right.\nDon't know what it is.\nCan't say that I was like, \"Oh, it's a gigantic fraud.\"\nI didn't know what it was with Elizabeth.\nNo, the um the the kind of seauite without her.\nUm and something just didn't feel right.\nUh so you know we went back and we had a that form I told you about binding to transact.\nOh no.\nOne page one page simple companies love it.\nIt's easy things that change on it.\nName, shares, company, dollar amount, binding transaction.\nUm, so I ripped it up and I got uh sued to finish the transaction and I agreed to settle where I would pay a fraction of the transaction cost, but I did it personally so our LPs didn't have to go in.\nUm, and I think that what that taught me was was before we signed that paper, we better be certain because it cost me a few million dollars at a time where I didn't have a lot of money.\nAnd I did it so that our LPs didn't take the loss because that was one of those spider sense moments where it's like to yours you're saying the risks were tangential to the data.\nThis was, you know, and my wife would say if she were sitting here, she told me that it couldn't work cuz she's an epidemiologist and they collect, you know, blood and saliva and you can't you can't get that much data from a whatever.\nShe was saying feel the magic.\nShe's like, she was sick.\nYeah.\nShe's like that that doesn't work.\nUm anyway, uh long story short, uh the Spider Sense came up, um going through negotiations to get out of the contract and then, you know, some of the material started to come out and we just like, \"Hey, we're not doing it.\"\nUm and then actually, I don't think it was formally sued.\nIt was threatened to be sued and I agreed to settle it out of court and gave him a couple million dollars to go away.\nAnd obviously, it went on to be, you know, one of the more, you know, notable frauds of of the time.\nUm but that was painful for me.\nThat was bad process and bad outcome.\nSometimes you can have bad process and good outcome.\nSure.\nBut what that taught me was that you just need to have a good process.\nAnd if the outcome is bad, okay, that's fine.\nWhich is 23andme, which we'll get to.\nThis was bad process going in.\nWas jumping trying to jump on board, play the the the elasticity and pricing and follow the herd.\nRespectfully, the herd there was not professional.\nNo, it wasn't.\nDid that not worry you to me?\nI was chasing the the the the discount that was available and the thought that if it just traded at what the last round was, I made a lot of money.\nSo, that's on the secondary side.\nThat's what you're chasing, right?\nYou want to get that disc value of the discount and that you could get it in bulk and I should have seen I should have seen a lot of warning signs.\nThat was a tough one to do due diligence on.\nI would say that added a lot of our check boxes that we\n\n\nNow, I have to make sure that we don't make those mistakes again. And we really, we really averted a massive issue in our business by doing that. Massive. What was the chat size going to be? The agreement was to buy about $50 million of stock over like four months because, you know, um, because because I'm still raising the fund. Um, anyway, we got a way. That's one of the biggest wins. I know, I know personally, personally, it sucks. I mean, personally, and personally, it sucks. I agree, but actually, for the damage that it would have done to the brand. Oh, it was catastrophic to our to us. Yeah. Actually, mega win. Couple of takeaways though. One, always listen to your wife if she's around. Well, hopefully she doesn't listen to this, although I'm sure she will, but don't, don't say that out loud because she'll say, \"See, Harry's right.\" She will, trust me. And the clips go viral. Um, and two is when you feel icky in your gut. My one spider sense, dude. I've had this, and I'm not going to name the company. It's still going. We, we did a $5 million investment, and I called up the lead investor, um, who's a very, very pedigree firm. I just don't. This is off. Yeah. But you still did it. I did. Now I don't [ __ ] do it. Yeah. I'll pull out of everything. If I feel the ick, I feel the ick. Yeah. You go through this phase of building a business where you feel like you have some allegiances to some of the people who helped you get there, right? So you have other, and you're too far in to say no, and you know you shouldn't do it, and and you know it's not what we're humans. Oh yeah. Now I'm like [ __ ] you. It's like too far in is is uh, first mistake on on you. Second mistake on me. That I totally agree. And the the one that's probably from a financial perspective the largest that hurt.\n\nUm, there's two really uh, is 23andme and Getir.\n\nYeah. 23andme not selling. That was my mistake. When did you come in? First investment 23andme in, I think, 2017.\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, really bought into the business model on the consumer side. Um, loved it, really enjoyed interaction with an, really bought into what she was trying to build, and she really embraced our model to be helpful. Um, and I, I, I was really, you know, taken back by by what she was doing and believed in it. And we built a large position in our 2018 vintage fund. I think it was the second largest position in that fund.\n\nUm, like co-investment, we have maybe had 50 million in, and and LP Capital maybe 30 or 40 million in, and it in uh, during the spa craze, you know, pair up with Sir Richard Branson, like what an iconic pair, right? You got an Mojicowski, who's is a fantastic founder in my opinion, uh, to to to not maybe a great public CEO, but awesome founder and visionary of what she wanted to build and and the ability to go do it. Amazing. Richard Branson on top of it. Awesome. Let's go. Put gasoline on it. Trades 10, goes up. We can start selling at seven, which would have been about a 2x.\n\nI think I sold the last share at 70s. So, so that's chasing multiple. That's me chasing multiple. And that's a problem in our strategy. And you need guardrails in that to protect from Larry chasing multiple, which is what a layered approach to selling. Yes. Dollar cost average out, just like you dollar cost average in and just start getting liquidity when you can privately and continuing it through when they list. Liquidity is hard. How big was your position in total? Probably 100 million bucks. 100 million bucks. And you said you can do a 2x. Yeah. And instead, lost $70 million.\n\nThe LP is cool about that. No, the pool of the capital is awesome. Yeah. It's just, you know, don't. What was the number one position in that fund? Toast. Yeah. Toast. Awesome business. It's like 3x and started in 2018 during co. Mitchell and I talking about it. Mitchell Green and I saying this, people don't get it. Let's buy a bunch of secondary.\n\nYeah. Awesome. I'm on. Also, Asana too. We teamed up. Mitch and I teamed up on Asana. You know, it was fantastic. Yeah, we was just. It was just like you're conquering the world, you and your buddy, buying stock, people, people running out the front door because their house is on fire during COVID, and us running in with capital. It was fun.\n\nWhat about Getir?\n\nIs is one emotionally for me that's really hard. Um, when I think about that, good process, you know, good outcome. You had good process. We had good process on the first money. Gorillas, the investment in Gorillas, we had good process. Um, we had made a lot of money in kind of the food revolution. We were in Instacart, we were in Postmates, we were in Maitan. And just to be clear, sorry, cuz people will hear these names. You made money in Postmates. Oh, we made a uh, that's a that's a Founders Fund special, man. We did a lot of work with Founders Fund early. Fantastic group of investors there. Um, I mean, I think Peter Thiel's got more money than God now, but um, uh, yeah, they were the largest investor in in Postmates.\n\nSebastian Leman, awesome guy. Spoke at our 2018 LP day. Um, yeah, we made a 3x on Postmates in how long? 18 months. Wow. It was amazing. And Spencer Mloud, who was my co-PM, he led that deal, and he was like this, you got to meet this founder. He loves what we're doing, and he wants to help all his employees. Let's do it. I was like, \"Yeah, the data looks good, man. Let's go.\" And you made money on Instacart? Yeah, we made a lot of money on this carart. We sold this car privately during co. You're one of the guys who sold at like the 20s. Yeah. I was like, \"Come on, Sequoia and the price because Sequoia bought.\" Yeah. Sequoia make money in the long run on that. They also bought along the way. I mean, Sequoia's business model is fantastic. We do a lot of. We have a lot of investments in common, and their partners are awesome. There's few evergreen structures I'd ever invest in. Theirs is one. I agree with that. So, why did you sell at 25 and you just ordered? Okay. Funny story. Um, and and personally, you know, you have experiences with companies, and very frustrating experience with Instacart during COVID where, you know, it went from Whole Foods only pickers and grocery shoppers, which was an amazing service, right? To then having your Uber driver shop for your groceries and try to get a ripe avocado and co from your Uber driver. It's not a great experience.\n\nAnd I remember a point I'm hunkered down at my farm. The world's falling apart, you know. Um, and uh, it's just like I can't get the order, just can't, it's just not right. And they don't take it back. You just keep getting stuff delivered. And I was like, \"It's time. I just got to get out.\" I'm sorry. Wait a minute. So, the fact that your Uber driver can't get you a [ __ ] ripe avocado, you're like, \"You know what? I'm not the only one. Harry, come on. I'm out. You know what? We're going to sell at 25.\" And you do like a 3x on it. Yeah. But also for us, the decision to sell becomes somewhat easy because we're also solving for something that's different than others, and and we're solving for this velocity of capital. It's not part of keeping in the middle of our, to use a sports analogy, fairway is don't chase the mo.\n\nWe make a 2x net in a 5-year period. Cash return, not shares. We stop distributing shares because LPs blame you if they hold it. Don't founders see you as a bit of a tourist. No offense though. If it's like if you want that short compression, you're not exactly a long holder. You're not a long believer in the company. No, we're a pro, we're we're a point in time problem solver. We're like the is, we're like this the janitor that's cleaning up the mess. They have an employee that leaves that they're out there in the market making noise. They don't want them to take their shares. We get the phone call. You've got a fund that wants to show their LPs that there's value in the extension they're giving them. We get the phone call to buy a little bit of their position. You don't buy a 100% of somebody's position typically in a in a company unless they're on year 15 of their fund and have no extensions because if it's a large position in their in their in in their holdings in their NAV and you buy it all, you kind of scratch your head like, well, why are they selling it to me? Yeah, but dude, I've had this before. I've got a great company and I want to buy some and I ch, and then roofers happen. Yeah. How do you get around a roofer? You know, that's the relationships and and companies buying into the in our business model, the companies and your peers have to see value in what you can bring to the company because what we're after is large concentrated positions. We're not indexing secondaries, buying with no information, playing the arbitrage and pricing, and putting 200 secondary positions in a fund. That's not what we do. We're going to have 10 companies make up 90% of our risk, and we're going to become very large shareholders of those companies by doing our business model. And so it requires your peers to say, okay, they do something unique. They are going to provide value to us by consolidating the cap table. They're going to help us with employee structured tenders, shareholder tenders. Uh, we have an employee or a former share or current shareholder that that needs to leave. They're going to buy it. And it's it's really the barbell of the small microtransactions that nobody cares about that we, some of our companies we've built through 50 transactions to get to $75 million, and some we've done four to get to 200. It's just a, and you're you have to sell that you're going back to raising money as a new manager. Be different. Be different because different, that's a pain in the ass to do 50 transactions. It's the the the the muscle memory of that is not replicable for others. And the back office you have to have the investment to not just pay yourself and to hire big teams to run it requires the ability for you to know that the actual outcome is the benefit of the carry, not the management fee. No, I, I totally get you there. Going back to Getir.\n\nYeah, that one took years off my life. Um, good process. Look, I think how did you come to?\n\nSo, we made those investments and made a lot of money for LPs and uh, uh, get in introduced to Getir, but one of our, excuse me, to realize we have an office in Zurich. Uh, we have a a team of about 10 in Europe. We've been here since 2017.\n\nUm, say, \"Hey, you got to meet this company in Berlin.\" When I'm there visiting, we had a bunch of portfolio companies in Berlin at the time. Met the founders, and the business was growing like a weed. This was when it was in Turkey only. No, this was Guerrillas in Berlin. Oh, this was. So, we were acquired. Guerrillas was acquired by Getir. Yeah, that wasn't a good deal, was it? So, for a group of shareholders who we were a part of helping structure alongside of five others, it actually was a good deal. We actually got um, good value for our money. You get cash out there? Uh, we did get a little bit of cash. We got most of the preferred value in the transaction. So four or five shareholders of Guerrillas received of all of their shareholders received the majority of the preferred equity that we received from Getir.\n\nSo in a good place then, fine. Getir valued at 10 billion.\n\nThe next three years were some of the, you know, worst of my life. Why? Yeah, just the the seeing that we needed to then try to protect that money with more money and then get involved at the board and do the heavy lift of restructuring and battles with the founders, and we'll leave a lot of it out because it's still ongoing, but I think it's it was it was really hard, and my willing the mistake I made was the second tranch of the capital. How big was the first? How big was the second? The total first was I was like 50 million bucks in total between secondary, primary, kind of we got that plus sum in value of Getir, and then the next check was 100 million bucks to restructure that equity to pull it forward. So you got 200 million risk total, a lot of LPs in it with co-invest, of course, everybody during that period signed up for you just put it out there, and dude, the co-vest craze was [ __ ] nuts. It was nuts in 2021 and and and created a lot of unintended consequences, um, that we can chat about, but and different from our normal co-investment model, which we went back to from that period. But anyway, the long story short was I think the major mistake I made there was was not willing to just walk away after the first check. After the first check. My it's a the fight that when you grow up in like severe poverty, you're fighting with your siblings for everything. You're fighting at school. You're fighting for food. You're fighting. You're fighting. You're fighting. And and as you grow into business, that doesn't leave you. It subsides a little bit. But the pe, there's many people in our industry that have backgrounds like mine, and you don't stop fighting, and it's it's becomes, is it a blessing or a curse? It starts to become a curse if you can't manage it because in that scenario, my thought that I could fight and will the outcome, little old G Squared amongst giants, like it, it was like you were you were dead man walking without knowing it. You were just, you were already dead. You just kept fighting and and making sure that we don't make those mistakes again are important. Um, and that's where guardrails, um, other people with voices in your firm. Was it obvious that it was going wrong? Like it seemed like just an enormous amount of cash going into a business before it was ready and premature scaling and you see the\n\n\nEconomics that didn't work. It seemed very obvious to me, respectfully. Yeah, hindsight, it's easy to say it's obvious. Um, I'm sure to many looking at me and watching from afar, it was obvious for me. You still hold it though. Still, we still hold it. It's now a business focused in Turkey, and you know, lots of great people in the business working. Um, and I'm still on the board. Uh, so I'll be careful some of the things I say, but because it's a major, major part of Turkey. Oh yeah. It's, by the way, that was the biggest mistake for me of the business. It should have just continued deeper penetration. Well, yes. And I think, you know, investors would say one thing, founders would say another on how it became a global kind of strategy. I think the mistake the company made there was it left Turkey, um, and didn't focus maybe on other markets that were similar to Turkey from an employment cost perspective. Um, but look, today it's still operating in Turkey. It's a big business. You got a lot of sophisticated people from um Muble in there working with the business. You've got people inside the business that want to win. You got 10,000 plus employees that are working hard every day trying to create values for their family. For me as an investor, I lost a lot of money. Um, why I'm still involved is because those people that are commuting in some cases three hours a day to work in Turkey, you know, they deserve a good outcome. And that's the piece of our investing as a secondary investor. You often don't get that granular involved with, and we do it with a handful of companies, unfortunately, typically when they have issues that you're trying to save. Um, but yeah, it was a very hard journey.\n\nHow much money do you think you lost though?\n\nWell, there's kind of the numbers you can quantify, and then there's probably the dollars that you lost from a fundraising perspective for your next vintages um from LPs because you lose their co-investments. Yeah. Because you, cuz when you lose Kernbass dollars, do you lose them as the next round up here? Depends on how you structure your co-investments. Um, in that case from that fund, my guess is those decisions we made cost our partnership probably a half a billion dollars of capital between capital actually lost and investors that you can't bring back.\n\nYeah, it was a monumental miss on our part. Now I have lost money before in co-invest, and the only lesson that I've learned actually on that is use it as a chance to build trust and in crisis communicate more than you ever have done before. Yeah. And try to overcommunicate.\n\nI think a lot of LPs um because of that um have come back and now they're. Does it make you question your co-invest strategy? Because the thing that I don't like with co-invest is often LPs, they're almost not aware that it's a single shot. Um, water. Yeah, please. Thank you. They're not aware that it's a single shot. And what I mean by that is, you have a portfolio in a direct in a venture fund. Fine. You have a get it. Fine. We've got a toast as well. Yeah. But it's like they're almost shocked that, oh [ __ ] I didn't realize that's done. Yeah. I think that it's so, so kind of going through our co-investment process in the early vintages, let's say vintage one through four, in some cases we were four times co-investment to fund investment because four times. Yeah. But here's why. Because the kind type of companies that we were interested in investing in, we weren't large enough to make a difference.\n\nSo if you want to run our business model, you need capital. A lot of capital just to get in the door, just to be able to solve the problems that they have. To your point of being relevant to the roofer.\n\nIf you, if all you can do is onesies and twzies and you can't write a $100 million check when they need you to do it on the secondary, they go find somebody else. And when they turn that faucet on of shares, when they when they buy into your strategy, when Daniel X says, \"Hey, you guys are interesting to us. Oh, by the way, here's $150 million to put the stock.\" If I say no and it's at a good price and he picks up the phone and calls somebody else, it's gone. You're not getting that opportunity back. So with our strategy, you have to have scale.\n\nSo is the co-investment in the early days was a significant part of our strategy. Over time, it's more normalized. Today it's about, you know, I don't know, on a billion five it'll be 700 million. It's still a lot. Um, the mistake we made in 2021 vintage or 2020 vintage is we didn't just do co-investments around our core positions.\n\nWe had LPs coming to us saying, \"Hey, I built my fortune in, let's say, wellness. I like health tech companies. You've got one down here in the land. I want to buy stock directly.\" And we felt at the time, hindsight being 2020, it was wrong. We felt at the time that we were enabling our business model to help them achieve what they wanted by being an LP of ours. Okay. But let me just push back on you. We're partners now. Okay. I say they have directly requested that asset. I share with them my concerns and how we believe the company's doing. And if I do that transparently and offer them access, am I not providing them a service that they're asking for? Yeah. Until it doesn't work and then they blame you. So you should block them from doing. I wouldn't. So the way we run it today is the way I think people should run their only in conviction when your funds are investing alongside of it. That's when you do the co-investment. You don't do it the way we did it in 2020. You do it the way we did it today. Our 2022 vintage fund, there was a billion two in size. The co-investments we ran are our top 10 positions. You got a couple LLMs, you know, the high-f flyers. You have um companies like Fanatics, Whiz, um Data Bricks, um uh Turo, the Airbnb of cars, um like Monzo, companies like that where there's you've already decided those are your core positions and then they make a bespoke portfolio of additional exposure to them in equal weighted size. Why are you in Monzo?\n\nValue play to Revolut and TS is fantastic. I think I think Revolut is the generation. We were in Revolut in our 2018 vintage fund. I agree with you. Amazing business. Did you hold it? Um, yeah. I mean, I some of the stuff we can't really talk about holding it or not in in the live positions, but cuz for me you don't need to. I just look at it now and I'm like [ __ ] me. This is a 500. We have it in our 2018 vintage fund. It's made an awesome return for that vintage today for me. How did you get Revolut in 2018, dude? Sorry, I'm about to say something so offensive. You're like a mid American.\n\nI love the bias and I'm sitting in [ __ ] London and I don't see it in 2018. I was [ __ ] hustle, Harry. Hustle. I was 12 then. [ __ ] you.\n\nOh, you know, but seriously, how did you see it then? This was this was well before. Yeah, well before I think so. What? Four mega trends for us. Fintech is one. Um, and we had good success coming off of SoFi. Um, the founders of SoFi and now the current management really believed in our strategy and SoFi was actually also in our 2018 vintage fund. Um, yeah, that fund, man. It's it's just crazy what was in it. Um, and off the back of that win and then we had um early N26 before the growth restrictions. Did you sell? Uh, no. No, we didn't. We didn't sell. They're they're they're working their way through some things and and looking fairly okay right now. Um and and they're doing a really good job of managing through the the the stress they had in the business and now more of a um focused in um Germany versus kind of a continental play. And then we had uh Revolut. What a what a great little pool of companies, right? What a great pool. And so you were like but Revolut went like a hockey stick, man. So in our strategy, you need like and so you're like I see Revolut like always I'm going to go into Monzo. Well, Monzo is a later vintage. So yeah, Revolutes in our 2018 vintage where sometimes and we have them in every vintage. Um you know in our current vintage we have Chime. Awesome business, but believed in our our business model, but it went so fast that you can't you can't build with you over time dollar cost averaging in through lots of transactions. You can't build a scalable position if the company goes from zero to 100 in no time. You know, Whiz was very short for us. 20 our current vintage. Um, we did it in 3 years, but that was only because it was it was only because it started with the back of of the the downturn.\n\nWe caught it at the right moment, right? Normalized scenario, we would have never been able to build this position in Whiz because it would it was a hockey stick from day one, but the capital availability even to the best assets in the world wasn't great for 18 months. What price do you get into Monza?\n\nOh, sub four billion.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, for us again, we're not solving for what you're solving for. So, you have to TS is great. I really. Yeah. TS has a great operator. Great guy. So I think what you have to build a portfolio in across the four mega trends for us, the way we look at it is you have to diversify that risk. So you have SAS, you have fintech, you have consumer internet and mobility. And so what we do across those is we try to build conviction positions pretty equally weighted across those mega trends amongst 10 companies. And so for every Anthropic you have, you have to balance that with a fantastic business in Fanatics, which is more of a traditional um, you know, last quarter talk about growth. I mean, the business is fantastic and it's at scale, massive scale, billions of dollars of of revenue and hundreds of millions of dollars of like a massive company. Michael Rubin owned pretty much a significantly owned um sports apparel merchandising business to you balance that risk because what we've learned over time is you can't just play the momentum because you can get burned and that's chasing multiple. Totally get that. You can't just play the momentum.\n\nHow the [ __ ] do you play AI then? Because it is go to the leaders. That's easy. Go to the winners cap. What's what's what's holding back the next generation of the LLMs to get to Anthropic and Open AI scale in three years? Who's going to rival them? No one. You just answered your own question, Harry. No, I completely agree with you. No, no, I I literally No, if for what I'm about to say, may my LPs forgive me. If I could do anything, be careful. They're your blood that pumps through your heart. Oh, no. I adore them and I think they probably agree with my next statement. Okay, we'll see. I would put my whole fund into OpenAI.\n\n350. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, you know, you and Spencer Mloud should start a fund together. He's amazing. He's my co-pm. He believes the same thing. At 350, do I see this being a $1.5 trillion company in 5 years time? Easily I do. That is a 5x with fair confidence, very large confidence in a 5-year period.\n\nYeah, it's an amazing business. Yeah, that I would do that 100%. It's reached escape velocity. I speak to Kevin Scott at Microsoft and I'm like, \"But dude, there's no defensibility on the search.\" And he's like, \"And you can't just switch from Google to Bing. Of course you can, but it's the brand.\" Poor Bing always gets picked on. Bing [ __ ] Come on. Everybody picks on Bing. Everyone, even even he does. CTO. You don't need to pick on Bing. It was him, not me. But but like point I was like, \"Wow.\" Yeah, that's absolutely true. And so I agree. But okay, but I I have friends who are in Anthropic and got in at four. And you didn't need to comment. Yeah. And it's now 60. Yeah. 61. At 61. And they've got like a forex. Yeah. On their money. And so there's a question of like, okay, value acrew. Have them call me. I'll buy all their shares of Anthropic at 61 billion. You would buy an all day long today and twice on Sunday. Are you serious? 100%. But even though the dilution is so intense. See, now you're talking like an early stage investor, Harry. I don't give a [ __ ] about the dilution. Why I give a I care about the price I pay in dollars and the price I'm going to sell it at in dollars. I am focused on DPI, notic.\n\nI don't care about the dilution. So, are you not just going around now hoovering up anthropy? Oh, 100%.\n\nUp. What's that? A lot. A lot. And I've got appetite for more. Same with OpenAI. Same with Data Bricks. Whiz. I love those guys. They're awesome founders. I mean, holy [ __ ] what they built was amazing. And if you ever We have a We hosted them in our LP day. Half the things they say, I don't even understand what they're talking about. Scares the [ __ ] out of me. The world after talking to the three of them and what's out there. But man, did they build I mean how they did that. By the way, they also sold a business to Microsoft together and made a bunch of money and then said, \"Hey, yeah, we're well healed. You know, you should they're humble people. They've made a lot of money.\" And some of them live in like a one-bedroom apartment in Tel Aviv. I went to see them in Tel Aviv. Went to see a bunch of companies. We'll leave the other ones out. A couple wouldn't even see me.\n\n\nAnd this is after I managed five plus million dollars. The whiz guys welcomed me in, gave me a sweatshirt. How you doing? Yeah. I'm like, \"Oh, by the way, I want to land in your company. You're raising like half a billion dollars. I want to give you like three million bucks.\" Three million bucks. They're like, you know, that's a little small, Larry, but we like you. Uh, will you settle on nine? Sure, I'll give you 9 million bucks. That's how we started. And we then we went on to build a $200 million position, but it takes that buy in. And so you go back to Anthropic and the others. Um, you know, we were fortunate enough during, you mentioned FDX earlier, to be awarded during the bankruptcy a bunch of stock. We bid on it. We went through the whole process, bid on the stock, bought a big chunk, and now the company, look, the company is, in my opinion, is unstoppable. That and OpenAI, they're just the beginning. So how do you play the space? You go to the winners because I have a shorter thesis. How many winners are there? I think, I think the LLM space is challenging for new entrants, and it's because it's time and capital, but I think it's like OpenAI and Anthropic. I don't, I don't see a ton of room for more. Not because I don't think so. Are you going to play the application layer too? And are you going to try and do cursor and a bridge in medical? No, I mean, I think for us, um, our view is take a few concentrated bets in the foundation models and the winners, and then let's play a bit of the picks and shovels. That's why we have Lambda. We also had Coreweave. Um, and then on the business models themselves, let's play a scale AI and software to help them scale on the hyperscaler side and focus the balance of our capital on our other mega trends where AI has been embedded into all businesses. So you have exposure to it throughout cyber and SAS. You have exposure to it in fintech. You have exposure to it in consumer companies today that are created without AI embedded in their DNA. Like why, why would you do it if you're not going to, if you don't put it in there? Like why, the challenge you have in our industry is you have vintages of managers who invested basically for the last 20 years, many of them without liquidity, and most of their businesses don't have AI embedded in the DNA of the company, and so they're chasing. Now you have incumbents that are large, we call them, there's two types of companies that were, that, that are big and private that aren't in AI, they're kind of, we, we talk internally, we call them, um, vampires and zombies because they're massive, many of them are profitable, they have to now implement AI in their business models, and you have some that are going to get out of it and be okay. And those are the vampires, and the zombies are dead. They don't, there's, there's hundreds of them. I think there's far more zombies than there are vampires. I think it is a much more difficult transition to implement AI. I think a lot of product change is actually from bottoms up, and you can't just slap AI on it. Here you go. It's hard, and it's companies are going through. I really want to do a midlife crisis and name it PFU, which is private, actually, [ __ ] you. And I just want to go down Anna Plan, Cooper, you name it, and just take out one by one by one where you got to have a couple of things. Founders not there, engineering team cut, customer service cut, price increases. No. And then, by the way, layer some secondary on, lower the cost basis, and you have, you can make a 5x in three years. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's, it's, it's, it's a great idea. I think that there's long in the tooth companies from 2015 vintages. So is, so is my generation and the generation of LPs funding as morons, and I mean that in the nicest way, and I'm being deliberately glib, but like in the liquidity profiles that we're doing, and it is 15 years. Yeah, I think it's hard, Harry. I mean, liquidity is hard. Like I think LPs don't, the one thing, and you asked me this question on our walk, is like, what do LPs think they know that they actually don't? Yeah. And I would say how hard liquidity actually is for us, all of us. It's really hard, and, and that's why the DPI numbers are so low. It's not because people don't want to make money for people. It's because it's, it's hard. It's just as hard as getting into the best deals. It may be harder to get out and the timing that people are doing it on. Is that even the case in the high demand assets like we have today with the LLMs? You want to sell your Anthropic? Yeah. Today. I think there's a handful of liquid private companies. Basically, they're, they're quasi liquid. This is the hard thing. But at scale, small positions, yes, cuz I look at, but try to go move a billion dollars of Anthropic. Agreed completely. But I look at like my first fund, which was tiny, admittedly, but like all of my winners, it was large compared to mine. But all of, all of my winners, yeah, I can sell tomorrow. I don't want to [ __ ] sell any of them. Yeah. But all of my [ __ ] I'm desperate to sell. Yeah, that's, that's, that's the, that's the classic. Sell, you know, sell your dogs and keep your winners. And I think it's, I think it's, it's actually the somewhat of the inverse is you have to be able to willing to sell your winners to have a sustainable business model and to generate the return that will, will actually drive your, your Harry's fund forward. What has been the single best investment for you? Single best investment that we've ever made on a multiples basis, on a multiples basis. Um, it's probably going to be the early, either early whiz or early whiz and probably early Spotify. Both of those were, you know, I think and bolt the early ride hailing. It's yet to be determined. Marcus Filic business. We were the first institutional money from the North America in that business. Those first investments we made in all three of those are probably 10x. Why did you do that? Which Bolt? Yeah, I love Marcus on the show. He was fantastic by it. He's amazing. Dude, respectfully, when you went in, this was pre-Sequoia. Yeah. Pre-institutional accreditation. I think it was like 20 bucks a share or something. It's equated at 260. Yeah. So, yeah. And, and this was like not the brand. Oh, no. But we had come off, in fairness to us, we just came off a great outcome in Lyft. We didn't know yet what Uber was going to be. Um, I was going through all the challenges around the transition of founder and all that. Um, and uh, one of the, you know, uh, Johan Burrquist that was at Spotify, um, called me and said, you know, um, what do you think at Lyft and Uber? And I gave him my, my opinion on both, and, and he's like, \"Well, there's this small business out of Estonia that I'm going to go be the CFO at.\" And Johan has been our to date our single best investment we've ever made. Every, we Spotify early investment that he trusted our business model in, let's say, 8 to 10x. Bolt yet to be determined, but let's just assume it's somewhere between, you know, 50% and face value of what Sequoia paid, it's, you know, 67x. And now it's a big business, it's a really big business, and Marcus is phenomenal. I mean, wow, young kid building that business. This was, well, I'll go where Uber's not and do it profitably cuz I don't have any money. [ __ ] bootstrapped it. Being blunt. Yeah. As I said, you, you said your humble beginnings earlier. You've done very well. When I, it's all relative. What's, well, yeah. But yeah, go ahead. Does money make you happy? Money doesn't make me happy. Money makes my life easier. Money makes your life easier. Complex in some ways. What did you think about money that now you have it, you now see differently? When I was growing up, I thought if I could just make $5,000 a month, I would be set. If I could just make $5,000 a month. And if I could, you know, own my own farm and farm it and I would, I would, I, that's all I wanted to do. And then I spent 20 years trying to get away from the farm, and now all I want to do is go back, you know. But uh, money doesn't make you happy. I think it makes your life complex. How you handle that money, um, is important. And you learned about handling money when it comes to you. Yeah, me personally, it's like, for me, don't increase my spending with my increased wealth. Yeah, I think that's a good goal, Harry, and you should try to maintain that. It's very hard. For me personally, my journey has been about not, um, having that fear of going back to the, you know, powdered eggs and powdered milk and the government cheese, and that fear that it could happen again, and setting my family up so that it, my, my children won't ever have to go through that, and generations won't have to go through that. That's been my desire. And now that we're partly there creating that, I would say I'm in the probably middle innings of doing that for where I want my life to be. I think, um, reminding yourself of where you came from constantly is important because it's easy to be around people in our profession and, um, just in general in life as your kind of financial status increases, the people around you change a bit, and I think that that pull to be more like everyone is there, and maintaining the, the thought in your mind that this always hasn't been what your life is and being thankful that it's here without losing the edge. And I think the most difficult thing to do as you start to make real money, regardless of how you define that, is keeping that edge that got you there. And I think you see that across sports. I think you see it across business. I think you see about high performing CEOs when you think about keeping that edge. Yeah. Is it the running away from the government cheese and bunny poverty or is it the running towards the grandchild memories of G Squared? I think keeping the edge for me isn't about either of those things. Keeping the edge for me is, um, the chase of the next win. And that no matter what the dollar amount is, that the win is what gives me satisfaction and the loss is what hurts. Like I spent a lot of time talking to you about the losses because that's, I can remember every, mostly every moment of those, and as an athlete, I remember all the failures. Should you ever build immunity to losses? Yeah, immunity to losses would be nice to say that you should do that because maybe you'd be happier plus the money. Maybe you're like high on life. Um, yeah. I, I think some people can, um, for me, it's, it's, I think ingrained in my DNA that I don't want to leave. I don't want to know who that Larry is. I want, I want to fight for every, I, I enjoy the fight. I enjoy the, the journey to win and everything in life. I, I just, I want to win. Final one before we do a quick fire. What does no one see about firm building that having built a firm you think is so cool? Building something that then you don't realize that people outside of your small sphere recognize as is something positive, and when, and that is something that you're randomly faced with, like this conversation for me is, is, is I'm, I'm a huge fan. It's like sports radio. Longtime listener, first-time caller to, to, you know, you're a young guy, but you're super successful, and you have some of the most amazing people in our industry on the planet sit here and talk to you. And to think that I'm sitting here with you telling my story, um, is, is for me very humbling in the fact that you're even interested. And I think that piece of building a firm and staying focused on the logo and not me individually has led to this moment. And, and then, and that tells me that we all, for all of our flaws, which we have many, there's something in the water at G Squared. And we're going to keep grinding and doing it. Dude, I'm going to do a quick fire with you. Otherwise, I could keep you all day. Yeah. Okay. So, tell me, whose life do you secretly admire and why? I, I look at, because of my background in sports, who do I admire? I think the longevity of like a Cal Ripken Jr. in baseball, who basically for 16 straight seasons didn't miss a major league baseball game. Major League Baseball plays 160 games a year for 16 years, from the time the guy was 22 to the time he was 38, didn't miss a, didn't miss a start. The grind that that, and people, you know, people talk about records in sports and, you know, all of the high-flying athletes that people recognize and their accomplishments. Here's a guy who was a grinder, played third base. Hard position to play in baseball. You know, I know you're a cricket guy, but, but study it up. 16 years, not miss a game. Of course, he's in the baseball hall of fame and celebrate in that way, but a good player, not, not, not the best, but the grind that that must have taken for him to do that, just to get to the major leagues is not being the most talented guy, and then to play and not miss a game for 16 straight years for one team in 38 when he retires. That to me, we talk about our 20-mile march every day at G Squared, rain or shine, we're marching 20 miles, and we're going to make progress. That is a different kind of intestinal fortitude in a set of massive steel balls that you just don't get in generations today. What that guy accomplished is, is unsurmountable. There will not be another baseball player, in my opinion, in the history of the future of baseball that will accomplish what he did. It's very kind of what you saying about like listening to the show and being a fan, like three shows a week for 11 years. There you go. Like no one giving a [ __ ] for four or five of those years. Yeah. It's, it's the grind and the willingness to have faith and that you can do it and living and breathing the challenge and making it become your identity. And I'm, I don't know Cal Ripken Jr. I can only imagine what he went through, but I imagine it often, like waking up at 38 years old, playing another random baseball game on\n\n\nA shitty team in Baltimore. Like to go out and grind to make that happen for what reason? He'd made tons of money. Why do it? Why do the early shows where nobody was listening? Cuz I loved it. Because you loved it. Because it was and it was your passion. Still is. And that's where people should find their work life balance is when your work is your life. Your life is balanced. I couldn't do this today if I didn't love it. No, of course not. Why? I mean, you don't have to go far. You're in your house. You go swimming next door and walk in the park. Oh, did I not tell you? We do a session in the sauna afterwards. We record that, too. Yeah, that's a little weird, but I'll go. Uh, we're European. It's fine. Yeah, I know. I know. What would you most like to change about G Squared that you can't? I think me personally, I think our people would like me to chill out just a little bit. And if I could be a little chiller and less grinding, I think people at our firm would probably enjoy being there more than they do. The money's awesome for everyone. People don't leave. We only have forced attrition. That aside, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to change my delivery at this point where we are survivable. We will have the next vintage. We're going to have many more vintages. There's not fighting just to fight. It's it needs to be altered without losing the edge. And I wish I could change it more quickly than I have. And I think it's it's led to um unfortunately some really good people moving on um that otherwise I would still like to be on the journey with me. What's the most memorable LP meeting uh here in London? Guy committed on the spot and signed this, you know, said I'll sign the forms for 20 million bucks. Wow. Yeah. First meeting said I'll do it. Never happened to me before. And it was here in London. Longtime LP still with us today. Saw the I probably didn't even care about the strategy just I think liked me and said I'll do it. That was the most memorable for me. What worries you today that you don't think many people are thinking about? Yeah. I I I think fundamentally our industry is is the the the people searching for solutions to the fun life problem. They're searching for a solution to it because it's fundamentally broken and they don't want to say out loud that it's broken. So, evergreen structures, interval funds, quasi liquid strategies and privates, continuation funds. The continuation funds though I find a bit more interesting today than they were in the early inceptions because now you only want they will only buy your good assets. So now they're they've really gotten they've really gotten smart. Yeah. I think that's really interesting space right now. I'm a CIO of a large endowment fund. What advice would you give me today about allocating in this environment? Yeah, I would say where endowments miss the boat. And by the way, I'd love to have many of them. We don't. Um is I think they chase the wrong statistics. What do they chase that they shouldn't? And what should they chase? I mean, my belief is that TVPI and MOIC are not the stats that people should be focused on. And they are. I don't I think they're fake numbers. They should just chase DPI. It's the only thing you can use to buy food. If you penultimate one, yeah, when you think about yourself as a leader, what could you do to be better today? I think I need to continue to grow and be more open-minded to um and which I have and I have full trust now in a co-pm of mine who I think is is one of the smartest people I've ever met and and fantastic investor and he has my ear. I think I could do a better job of having more people have my ear. Like I could listen to more people than I do. Um, and that's a challenge for me in the perfectionist mode. Like just my nature to be productively paranoid and I I I should listen to more people in their advice that they give me. And that's something I've worked on for the last probably five years more extensively is gathering more around me, digesting it, and then acting versus acting. Final one. When has being paranoid helped you? When does it hurt you? Well, I told you about the Theranos that that helped me. That was the productive paranoia and also the productive paranoia of um closing and investing. The money's there, close it, invest it. Money's there, close it, invest it because you don't know when the next one's coming. And that's a bit of just my DNA as a human being and how I was raised is is is that productive paranoia that it's great today, but the wheels are going to fall off. And you have to make sure every day that you tighten the wheels and you have to be focused on the right things. And I think that that driving every day that having that paranoia no matter how good things are and always worrying that it's going to get worse across all things in life is is to a degree it's healthy. Dude, I so appreciate this. I so appreciate the willingness to talk so openly. I loved it on our first walk. I really did. It was very special, which is why I was so keen to make this happen. So, thank you so much for doing this with me, man. Well, thanks, Harry. Congratulations on on what you've built. I'm a huge fan and I think you're only only in the beginning of what you're building and I'm going to be cheering for you along the way. Time for the sauna. Yeah, let's do it. Sauna, here we come. Nine baiten hosen. There we go.\n",
