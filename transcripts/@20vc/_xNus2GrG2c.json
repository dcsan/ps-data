  "cleanText": "I would have not raised as big of a series A looking back.\nI think it was too much dilution.\nWhat did change was that suddenly I felt like a celebrity.\nThat was the moment when I made the biggest mistakes.\nIf you have a Sequoia capital or an Index or a Spark Capital on your cap table, the reality is that your next round will be so much easier.\nReady to go.\n\nJohannes, dude, it is so good to make this happen.\nI have been a fan and follower from afar for a long time.\nSo, thank you for joining me, man.\nThank you for being here.\nNow, I would love to start with the beginning because I hear that GetYourGuide is actually the result of great friendship.\nIt's you and Tao coming up with an idea from university together.\nCan you just take me back to you and Tao sitting in a room together deciding you were going to start a company together?\nYeah, totally.\nSo, this is actually 2007/2008.\nUm, you know, Tao and I were both students at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.\nHe was doing physics.\nI was doing biochemistry and neurobiology.\nSo, something very remote from online travel and uh we both led a student delegation to Beijing and China uh at the time.\nAnd I made a pivotal mistake in that I booked my flight ticket a day early and arrived in Beijing uh without the group and you know I was trying to you know do stuff then in my hotel room.\nI logged on the internet you know was like going on Google trying to find things to do going to Beijing wallet like doing something with the day and I couldn't find anything.\nI got stuck in the hotel room.\nNext day Tao shows up you know he he shows me the city.\nUm you know we go and see um the Beijing wall, the Great Wall, you know, we have Beijing duck, you know, in the Hutong.\nSo it was like a really special day and um you know, from that epiphany really of like having seen the the city through the eyes of a local, someone who speaks the language, we went back um to Switzerland to ETH and said, you know, we have to build a website, we have to build a community for people uh so they are able to do that.\nAnd we did that and like the prequel to to GetYourGuide was like we were building a travel community for everyone to be a guide.\nNo one actually used that you know I think we had 100 guides because that's what I read.\nI read that you pivoted three times before you found real product market fit.\nTotally.\nIt was terrible.\nSo what was the first iteration?\nFirst iteration was literally a peer-to-peer websites for guides.\nYou know small like untold story is we also considered doing something like couch surfing at the time.\nSo, so homes and we, you know, we thought, you know, no one is going to stay at someone else's home.\nSo, like, you know, discarding that idea, you know, someone else in San Francisco picked it up very successfully and then, you know, we went to guides and like you know, go like guiding is such an important thing in travel.\nSo, can't we build a community of guides?\nBut we were thinking this, you know, from the lens of the student.\nWe didn't do any market research or anything.\nSo, we built a social network.\nOnly 100 students signed up.\nMost students don't have time to be guides.\nAnd we we had I think three to five bookings in the first two years of our prototype.\nThree of which was my mother because she took so much pity on us students.\nThree to five bookings in two years.\nYeah.\nBut then like what what we realized through that prototype was that there was this gigantic market out there for experience providers particularly in Europe.\nI mean Europe has 60% of the global inbound travel.\nI mean, just walk out outside of the studio here in London and you see, you know, anything from the London Eye to the Thes River cruise to all of the hop on off buses.\nUh, you know, you see Madame Tousos, you know, the Harry Potter tours.\nLike, there's just so much to do in any city.\nAnd none of that was digitized in 2009, 2010.\nSo, we went back to the drawing board and said, you know, look, like we clearly didn't find product market fit like this first iteration was terrible.\nLet's pivot into this much bigger market that's out there.\nAnd that's just not digital.\nIn those two years, what are you doing?\nI when you have three to five bookings and three is your mother.\nGod loves your mother.\nWhat?\nMothers are brilliant, aren't they?\nBut like what are you doing?\nCompleting our degrees.\nSo we were still at uni at the time.\nSo we're still at uni living honestly off very little money at the time.\nBut the the great thing about it was um you know we could fail like there was no problem in failing.\nAnd um even more so it was just a lot of fun like know we didn't do that really to build a company even at the time.\nIt was more like you know this is a great space you know we want to build like a really successful web product you know Facebook was going viral at the time or so so those were like the days of web 2.0\nAnd we're really working at night to be honest.\nLike we were studying throughout the day and then at night we'd do this.\nThere's a common mantra that like if you want to win you've got to go all in.\nYou've got to go all in.\nRespectfully, you kind of had the the nice landing pad of being at university.\nYou were working alongside it.\nYou were doing both at the same time.\nYou didn't leave university to do GetYourGuide.\nIn a similar way, I was at law school when I started the show and it wasn't actually that risky.\nIf the show didn't work, I'd just carry on being a lawyer.\nLuckily, the show worked and so I could drop out.\nBut like my question to you is, do you think you have to be all in or can you do the no, I'm gonna build it alongside university and see what works?\nNo.\nUh, respectfully, you have to be all in and we had an all-in moment.\nUm, so the first iteration of the product actually failed, right, as I told you.\nAnd then we had to go out with the second iteration.\nAnd with that second iteration, you know, we were done with our degrees and like we really needed to try to make this work because it was clear you can't just do this on the side.\nYou really need to sign up supply now.\nYou need to sort of like build an online marketing function and need to do online marketing.\nAnd at that point in time, um, we really needed to go full-time with a prototype that was unproven and two years of failure, right?\nIt's a in in a weird way it was a very stressful moment a and even worse I need to go to my parents and basically say hi you need to fund me for like another year after university so you know can you please you know put a mortgage on your house and like fund me because there was no seed capital available no one would give a bunch of students money at the time for an idea that wasn't proven what gave you the conviction respectfully you had 2 years of it not working where did you get the conviction to say hey parents remortgage the house, fund me, it's going to work.\nSo, honestly, I have no idea looking back.\nUm, I think like the best thing um that happened to me at the time was that I had this group of co-founders that was really strongly tightly knit after this like know one of one and a half years, two years of like doing this prototype and we just really got along so well and it was just so joyful to go to work every morning with them and like create something.\nSo it was really more of a gut feeling that this is the right thing to do.\nIt just felt right than anything else.\nUm but the way how we operated at the time was really being in this deep tunnel.\nYou know I I once met the great race car driver Nico Rosar like Formula 1 champion and he said you know when you go and race right you look at the road you don't look at the wall because if you look at the wall as a race car driver you're going to hit the wall like so stay focused focus on the road.\nAnd I think that's very much what it what it felt like at the time, like we're even considering failing.\nLike for me, like failure was nonoptional.\nIt was like, you know, that that's not a valid option.\nWe will stay the course.\nWe'll win this.\nI I I love that.\nAnd Nico is a fantastic dude in France.\nSo I'm pleased to hear you drop some wisdom from him.\nUm I do want to go back to that.\nSo then we said to the parents, \"Hey, you know what?\nFund me for another year.\nThis is going to work.\"\nWhat happens then?\nWell, then um what happened was a miracle because we signed up the first couple of suppliers and we got very lucky with a few of them.\nHow do you do that?\nLiterally cold calling and like you know going to people like I you know I remember I traveled to Selzburg and signed up the hop on hop off bus tour.\nIt was very random.\nThere was like no CRM or anything like that right?\nSo it was very much you know what looks good you know so like what's nearby whom can we address?\nAnd um we got very lucky because we got a very good tour agency which did tours to the Vatican very early on and the Vatican is like one of the major sites in all of Europe and no one had sold the Vatican online at that point in time.\nI still remember the day when they went live and suddenly the booking started to tick in and then we had more and more of these types of experiences.\nYou know we you know signed up Madame Tusos we signed up the London Eye, you know, Merlin Entertainment Group.\nUm it's just so many of these supplies that had never sold online and for them was very foreign to even think of online bookings in 2010, right?\nWhich is like very foreign.\nAnd um you know then the the revenue just came and and like you know we're growing and growing.\nI think we did something like half a million then in in the first year in 2010 in net revenue so commission revenues more or less profitable but we didn't have any cash because we're just living off the mortgages from our parents.\nSo we're constantly looking into the abyss and and that was also the first time when I realized there's actually seasonality in travel.\nSo it actually goes up in the summer and then November it really goes down.\nSo for the first one or two years without any type of VC funding we're literally going bankrupt every winter needed to somehow survive.\nUm so it's very tough early years.\nSo take me that.\nSo we're starting to see actually relatively good early numbers and we're profitable enough.\nAt that point, you must be getting inbound from VCs.\nNo, no.\nThis is 2010, 2011.\nThere's basically no venture capital scene whatsoever in Europe.\nAnd the the biggest problem was um that we didn't have a US original that we were a copy of.\nSo, uh I remember I was talking to Oliver somewhere at the time.\nYou know, we had started to relocate some of the staff from Switzerland to Berlin because Switzerland was just too expensive for us to survive in our bootstrap mode.\nAnd you know he looks at me he's like you know so so what's the equivalent here you know like in the US like you know you had the copy of what exactly I was like there is no exact copy you know we're trying something new here like you know experiences marketplaces don't really exist right now but I believe it's future of travel and he was like so do you want to join Rocket Internet or do you want to work on your own startup and I was like you know I'm going to work on my own startup he was like okay thank you very much see you and you know this is really the spirit of the time it's very hard to like recollect because things are so different today, but we couldn't raise funding.\nHow do you feel about the sound?\nI know it's like a bomber, but how do you feel about the sound was in Rocket?\nAnd part of me is like amazing what birthed this like ecosystem and then part of me is like god it's a bit of a dodgy way to go about innovation just blatantly ripping off American consumer trends and selling back to them.\nI think um the three of them are incredibly smart dudes and I think they have created the Berlin ecosystem single-handedly.\nYou're that is it really and and it it is that I never did business with them.\nUm but I must say that without them um even GetYourGuide probably couldn't exist.\nWow, that's amazing.\nIt's it's it's interesting for me obviously not being in Berlin not seeing that kind of firsthand impact that they've had.\nSo it's super to hear.\nOkay, so there's not the VC ecosystem that exists.\nWe're going through this seasonality where suddenly actually oh we're going bankrupt every once every or twice every year.\nWhen do we start to raise money?\nWhen what was your first VC meeting?\nSo first uh VC funding was uh from Brent Hobbererman who invested like you know a small seed check alongside with an outfit called Profounders um here out of out of London.\nSean Satan Rogers.\nExactly.\nAnd that was actually really weird because you know I got a ticket um in a sponsor ticket I think through some like lottery or something to go to L web which was like a big startup conference at the time and brand was on stage and you know I couldn't raise VC funding.\nWe had this business that was constantly going bankrupt but growing really fast.\nAnd then, you know, I I just hit Brent up after he was on stage and said like, \"I'm in travel.\nYou found it last minute.\nWe should talk.\"\nAnd he was like, \"Okay, interesting.\nHere's my business card.\"\nAnd, you know, picked up the business card, you know, wrote him an email, just like cold email basically, and he said, \"You come and see me in London.\"\nBut I think so like I don't even know whether he really knew who I was or what I was doing.\nSo I remember I I went to see Brent at the mate.com offices um you know back then this probably like 2011 2012\nand I had to wait for 4 hours to get like a 10-minute meeting uh with Brent and I still vividly remember the meeting I think he does too and it was basically you know this is what we're doing you know we're creating um you know the experiences marketplace you know this is the you know next biggest thing in travel.\nIt's the last big green field.\nNo one has conquered it.\nAnd Brent looked at me and he said, \"You know, I made one pivotal mistake at lastminute.com.\nI had the opportunity to buy Booking.com at the time as a seedstage company.\nI still regret that to present day.\nI'm not going to make that mistake twice.\nI'm going to invest in you.\"\nAnd that was the moment really\n\n\nWe got our first funding, and, you know, the rest from there is history.\nHow much did you raise then?\nIt was a million bucks.\nA million bucks at what price?\nIt was, um, I think at like a five or six million pre-money.\nSo you did very well.\nWow.\nA million at five or six.\nOkay.\nFantastic.\nBut that wasn't the first VC meeting.\nI heard that you got rejected 100 times.\nYeah, I tried to raise capital, but like, we got rejected everywhere because, you know, again, like, we were not the copycat of anything.\nWe're first-time founders.\nNo one likes to invest in travel.\nLike, you know, this is a very weird industry for a lot of people in Silicon Valley.\nUm, for the people that I met in the US, most people said, you know, move over here, or we're not going to give you funding.\nAnd you, I said, no, we're very happy in Europe, like, we don't want to move to the US.\nWhat advice do you have to founders who are on the 50th meeting with VCs and it just doesn't seem to be hitting?\nIt does not seem to be resonating.\nTo what extent are you like, go back to the drawing board?\nIt's your story.\nYou're not resonating versus it's just a game of numbers.\nKeep going.\nIt's very hard to compare the days back then to, you know, what we have today.\nI think that the constant is you have to have tremendous tenacity, and you will have to pitch a 100 times, and it will only work once, maybe.\nBut I think what's different is you can refine your story, and you can refine your product market fit so much more these days, and you have so much bigger of a community of mentors and best practices, all of which I didn't have at the time.\nI didn't have anyone to talk to who had done that before.\nAnd I think that's really the big difference that I would really lean into today.\nLike, lean into the ecosystem and, um, get that help that is out there because today there's just so many people who have done it before, who have had the lessons, and who can help you succeed.\nSo we raise this million at whatever five or six, or whatever the price was.\nWhat happens then?\nThat's our first bit of money.\nWhere do we go and double down, and how does that change?\nSo from there on, um, you know, we continued with our, you know, I would say, like, bootstrapping mode, but, you know, with a little bit more money, and so, like, not going bankrupt all the time, which is positive.\nBut, um, what Brandt actually then did is he pretty much immediately afterwards set up, um, you know, a meeting with a bunch of, uh, VC funds in the US, and that referral from him as a proven travel entrepreneur made all of the difference.\nAnd so suddenly, we were starting to get meetings, you know, people got more interested, and just, you know, there was just a much better reference for me as a first-time founder as well.\nAnd, uh, ultimately, there was a partner called Alex Finkelstein at Spark Capital who took like a very keen interest in GetYourGuide, and he was like, no, this is interesting, like, there's something there, and then he led the A round in 2013, and that was really the moment that GetYourGuide transformed.\nWhere was the business at that point?\nBusiness is doing somewhere around 2 million net revenue at that point and growing, I think, uh, 2x to 3x year over year.\nGot you.\nAnd your blended take is like 10, 20%, 25%.\n25%.\nSo it's kind of doing 8 million in bookings.\nOkay.\nGot you.\nAnd he does it a series A.\nWhat's the series A?\nSeries A at the time was actually very big for European standards at the time.\nUm, so it was, um, somewhere around 14 million, uh, as a total series A, like, I think, like, 30, 35 million pre-money.\nWow, can actually, that's quite a lot of dilution.\nHow do you think about and advise founders on dilution today?\nI would have not raised as big of a series A.\nLooking back, I think it was too much dilution.\nUltimately, it all worked out because, you know, if you're in the company for long enough, you know, there's also founder reups and all of that.\nSo I would say, personally, uh, it didn't matter, but I do think, um, you should actually manage dilution, um, because otherwise you end up, you know, with problems with your employees, you know, with the, you know, other investors, and also the, so, like, share of, like, early stage investors just gets too large, uh, which might be a problem later down the road.\nWe fortunately at GetYourGuide got all of that fixed over the years, but, uh, I do think at the time was a little bit too much.\nI'm going to get in for this.\nDo you think founder reups are kind of fair?\nI mean it in the nicest way.\nLike, as you said that with hindsight, you would have not raised as much and not diluted as much.\nIt's like me as an investor going, \"Oh, my bad.\nI paid too much.\nI want a better, better price now with 3 years of data down the line and then me wanting a better price.\"\nWell, no.\nI agreed to that, and that's the deal.\nTotally.\nI don't think that you should walk back, and you cannot correct, uh, mistakes.\nI'm just seeing so many founder reapp packages now, and like, investors are getting screwed, and it's like, why are, why are we getting screwed?\nDo you know what I mean?\nTotally.\nNo, look, I think the, the founder incentives, uh, that you see, uh, first and foremost, should happen after a longer period of time, right?\nSo, so, you know, if I look at myself, I think the first founder incentive package that I personally, um, got awarded, um, by the board with, um, I think happened after, like, a decade or so.\nLike, much later, and then there's a lot of market best practices and standards, and, you know, if you're a more mature company, you know, an investment bank can come in and, like, benchmark that against peer companies, and then it works out, but at the end of the day, you know, at that point in time, you get awarded as a founder CEO, right?\nOr, like, as a founder management team, um, you know, for the work that you're doing, um, in terms of driving share price for shareholders over the next decade.\nTotally get you.\nOkay, so needs the A, and that's a US fund leading.\nBeing a European company, that's a big moment.\nHow does that change the company?\nCompletely changed our life because at the time the series A was very large, uh, in terms of total quantum.\nSo we had a lot of money, and also very few US VC companies were investing in Europe at the time.\nSo we went from a nobody to a superstar literally overnight.\nAnd could you feel that in the ecosystem, in the presence, how people respond?\n100%.\nI think the only equivalent, uh, at much greater scale happened in 2019 when we raised from Softbank Vision Fund, like that massive round.\nSo, so those were like the two, I think, defining rounds of of the company, but with the A, it was really going from being a complete nobody to someone who is like very present on the startup radar and and in the scene.\nWe could hire like completely different people, but also I must say, um, that was the moment when I made the biggest mistakes, uh, in hindsight, in in building the company.\nSo we almost lost the company after raising that A round.\nOh, what were the biggest mistakes that you made in that period?\nSo, we first and foremost, um, listened way too much to the VCs.\nYou know, we were like these young founders not having a clue, and we completely lost our way, and you know, going to the board meetings literally, uh, looking for advice of what we should be doing in our strategy instead of pushing for the strategy that we saw working in the day-to-day.\nThat's interesting.\nWhat do VCs want you to do, and how did that compare to what you would have done if you'd followed your gut?\nWell, they had a much longer-term vision, um, around, you know, hey, you should build, you know, SAS products for your vendors.\nUh, you know, you should do multimarket, you know, you should go into all of these new customer segments, into all of these new supply segments.\nAnd most importantly, you should hire all of these senior people to do all of that.\nAnd that's about the worst thing you can do as a series A company without really, like, you know, proper management experience.\nUm, it's much better to stay very narrow and go very deep and continue to drive the growth that you're seeing from the core customer segments that you have and do much less, but do that much better.\nSo we, we were going way too broad, hiring a bunch of people that were completely wrong for the stage of company, no culture fits, and growth then started to really calm down while expenses spiraled up like crazy.\nAnd I remember, like, a year or so after raising that A round, I needed to lay off 30% of the company and completely rejuggle GetYourGuide to refocus us on the core.\nDid you do that quick enough?\nCuz sometimes you can leave it quite late.\nI did it thankfully.\nI did it quick enough, and I got incredibly lucky that at the time a, um, person that's not actually not very well known in the European startup, uh, ecosystem, it was probably one of the most successful European founders of all time called Case Colon, called me up, um, you know, one Friday night.\nI was watching Netflix with my wife, you know, we were sitting there, and, you know, he called me up, and he said, you know, here's Case Colon, and I obviously knew him because he was the founder and CEO of Booking.com, and he said, you know, look, Johannes, I left Booking.com.\nI've heard about your company.\nI think you're on to something.\nUm, give me your numbers.\nSo, I run him through the numbers.\nHe was like, you know, give me like every cohort and like, you know, every kind of like supplier.\nAnd it was just just like really going deep, like, on the first call.\nAnd by the end of it, it was like, you know, one and a half hours in, he said, \"This is interesting.\nI'm going to be in Berlin tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m. at your office.\"\nThis is Saturday morning, right?\nAnd, you know, next morning, I 9:00 a.m., I'm there.\nSo Case is there, and like, he goes to the meeting room with me and to the whiteboard, and like, he basically maps out, like, the entire journey of, like, you know, where he sees value and, like, where I see value, asked a ton of questions.\nIt was literally like, you know, being in the room with the Jedi grandmaster, you know, for, like, you know, almost, I'd say, the full day, and then he leaves, and he's like, I'm going to come on board, like, I'm joining a board of directors, and I'm going to personally invest a million bucks in the company.\nThat was incredibly pivotal because it happened exactly at the point of time, like, when I was laying off the 30% of the people, when I needed to reboot the company, at that point in time, I had someone alongside with me who had done this before and who was like a really good mentor, and that that truly transformed me, and you know, I told Case 2, 3 years later when the company was success, I probably learned more from you than from my dad.\nWhen we look at those bad hires, what do you wish you had known then that you know now about what makes a good hire and what you did wrong there?\nI think you need fundamentally different people for a series A to series C, D stage company than, you know, for a pre-IPO or public company with billions in revenue.\nAnd I do see it today being on the other side of that.\nPeople who are incredibly effective at Netflix or Meta or Google, or, you know, even GetYourGuide today, are not the type of people who really thrive, um, you know, with a 30 or 50 people company where you still need to continue to refine that core product market fit, uh, where the way how you manage and do things so different because you're in the weeds every day with the team, you need to ship stuff, you need to be really opinionated about what's going on, and then the muscle that you have later on around, you know, managing multip multiple teams, managing organizations, doing road maps, and, you know, creating more structure in the organization, which you need at some point, otherwise things don't work anymore, um, when you're at a certain scale, those are just fundamentally different skill sets, and typically also different types of people.\nOften times, VCs mix these two phases, so you really need to have these very entrepreneurial people, um, in the early days, who often times, by the way, don't work out in the late days, um, so when you're going public and, you know, that stage of of your life.\nThose are not the same type of skill set.\nSo, it's really about can you find these people who are strong culture fits, who are right for your company at that point in time.\nWhat are some of the other big mistakes?\nHiring the wrong type of people, maybe listening to the board too much.\nAnything else?\nNot having a really tight strategy.\nYou know, founders typically think that they have way more capacities than they really have.\nSo being really tight on what's the core thing that we want to be doing and how can we deliver value to the customers and how can we obsessively focus, uh, on that.\nSo this is really the core lesson from Case and Booking.com was don't do too much.\nHe told me at Booking, you know, they had looked at experiences for, you know, many, many years, and you know, he said, you know, on these type of innovation projects, um, you know, people had to go to the innovation department.\nThe innovation department had one person that was himself, and it was called the no department because he was always saying no, go and refocus on the core because typically people underestimate the runway that they have with their core products and really improving that and and and achieving product market fit and scaling that over a longer period of time is much more valuable than doing 10 things that are all sexy, but you're going to be mediocre at all of them.\nI totally agree with that.\nI often see it with kind of founders who want to go into enterprise too early, and I'm like, SMB is so much larger than you think.\nHubSpot did it for, you know, 15 years.\nUh, you can too.\nSo I totally agree with you there.\nOkay.\nSo we have those three learnings.\nWhat happens then?\nWe've got 14 million.\nIt's probably like 8 now.\nWe've laid off 30%.\nWe're refocusing.\nPressure's on because now, like, you got to perform.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd we did perform.\nSo the beautiful thing was we had a lot of really good people in the company.\nSo instead of hiring expensive new execs, I just promoted the best people in the company, which was the best thing I ever did, and gave them a responsibility.\nAlthough a lot of them were very junior to their jobs, but they were just incredibly motivated, and they were in the trenches, so they knew what was going on.\nWe refocused, uh, the company really on our core segments of attraction tickets and guided tours and just the core European capital.\nSo we weren't looking worldwide as we did after series A, but just looked at Rome, Paris, London, and we went and acquired, you know, all of the supply there, and and, you know, no big magic, but, um, you know, suddenly demand was coming back and growth was coming back.\nWe're going back to more than 100% year-over-year growth at much\n\n\nBetter unit economics and just, you know, I think six to twelve months after that, we could raise a really good Series B. What was the Series B? Series B was co-led by Spark Capital and Highland Europe. So, Spark Capital was so impressed by us going through that roller coaster of like dropping off the cliff, you know, reshaping the company, bringing Case Colon in that they said, \"Hey, you know, you guys are clearly on to something. You're doing this right.\" And this, by the way, is another advice for a lot of founders. We gained so much more respect when we went against the board and said, \"We're not going to do this, we're not going to do that. We'll focus on this. This is my opinion. This is where I stand.\" You know, suddenly the VCs were like, \"Yeah, you know, we follow you. You're right.\" Instead of just saying, \"Oh, this is a great idea. We're going to do it.\" You know, really shaping the opinion of the board and of the investors is something that I really learned during that period. And that is something that I would also say then afterwards helped us actually raise the subsequent rounds because we're so much more opinionated about what we were doing. Series B is often said to be a very hard round. You need to have a very clear proven model and say about kind of edging into the scale capital phase. When you think about the Series B and getting Highland, how many meetings did it take to get the Series B together? It was very easy because Highland actually co-invested with Spark and you know those guys actually really liked each other and the partner who actually joined from Highland, Fergle Mullen, is a tremendously great guy and we had immediate kind of product market fit with him. You know, he loved GetYourGuide, who was a customer. You know, he sat down and I vividly remember, you know, when he invested, he literally let us pitch for 30 minutes and then he pitched for 30 minutes. So, we were like, you know, this guy is like something special. Like, I had never seen that VC before. Uh, you know, he showed me through his fund deck. He was like, \"This is my strategy for the fund. I wanted to do something for Europe, you know, Highland Europe, but you know, he just came back from the US and it was really about creating that ecosystem here in Europe.\" So, we felt it was such a good connection. And so it's actually that that was a very easy one. How big was the Series B? Series B was I think roughly 25 million if I remember correctly. Added like 100. Yeah, a little bit less than that but 90, 100. Yeah. Okay. Any lessons on that on price dilution cuz we're still in a safe zone here, aren't we? In terms of like not crazy price. No, it's still I mean those are also still the days where you know there were no crazy prices. That only happened you know from 2015, 16 upward to 2021. For us that was an easy one because we had such a strong comeback. This one of the easier runs that we had raised. But I would say what really was the difference is that we had a strategy. We had a good team. Not the team with like the big CVs, you know, but a team that was really on to it. It was entrepreneurial. There was hustling every day. And then lastly we had the traction and the numbers to prove it. Huh. Love that. To what extent do you think Series B is traction versus story? It's all in the numbers. I think from the Series B and C onwards. If you don't have the numbers to prove it, it's very hard to raise that round. Fascinating. Okay, so we have that and we're now like totally looking great again. We've got 25 million, we've got Highland, we've got spot, the numbers are good, strategy's perfect or better. Um, what happens then? Like we continue to just like nail European cities. How do you think about going broad versus deep? Talk to me about that. So from then onward we basically rinse and repeat for a number of years. And you know we're obviously growing our supply base. We're growing the demand base. We're growing to more European countries. We're doing a little bit in the US. Um but it was basically rinse and repeat all. Why did you do the US? That's an interesting one. It's a big big one to take hold of. It was a big one to take hold of and to be honest probably we did it prematurely. If I'd go back in time is another lesson for a lot of founders. I would have not gone as early. I would have done more in Europe. I think we would have had even more growth and more profitability, but we did a little bit in the US. It wasn't detrimental. So, we weren't overextending ourselves and we're building a good foothold there. And then all of that leads up to raising a massive round from SoftBank Vision Fund and Timas in 2019. How does the SoftBank round come together? At the time there was a small team there with Jeff Hosenbball, Ted F, Andrew Loto, some of which have worked at Airbnb. Airbnb had tried experiences from 2015 onwards. They had failed. They had seen GetYourGuide as being you know clearly the innovation leader in the space and you know they were like this is a big market. We just raised this massive vision fund. Let's put some dollars behind it and make that market a reality. And to be honest, the vision fund in a way actually did do that. So, with that funding, our market, you know, went onto like a completely different stratosphere and we had the How did those meetings go? People often talk about Source Bank where it's like 500 million in 30 minutes. Was that how it went? What was the experience like? It was not with us. I think that group of people which was doing marketplace investments at the time out of San Francisco. They invested in DoorDash, they invested in GetYourGuide, they were much more like traditional growth equity investors who are very metrics oriented. It was a very deep diligence process and ultimately while I did get to meet Masa, you know, he was just one meeting along the road of raising that investment, it was very much a growth equity investment process. So there was nothing crazy about it. Dude, how was meeting Masa? Very interesting. So, so interestingly, Masa was very Okay. Was it in London or No, it was in his private home in San Francisco. He had this incredible painting of Napoleon right behind him, which I still vividly remember. This is kind of funny. Are you nervous? I was very nervous. Yeah, of course, because he could have just, you know, put his thumb down. We just worked on this investment for, you know, half a year and, you know, this meeting of like one hour determines whether you get it or not, right? And but Masa was a very friendly person. He's Japanese so you know he's in a way very calm and he's very gentle and he was very interested actually in the P&L surprisingly. So he was literally looking at okay how do we value this business, you know, how can this be very profitable over time. So with marketplace investments I think he's much more financially oriented than with the deep tech stuff. So he's really going deep there, surprisingly deep. And he's actually really good at this. So I was surprised because, you know, you have these stories of Masa that he's just this crazy person, but he's actually a really good financial investor as well. So that knowed by like all of the headlines, he knows what he's doing. The second part of the meeting, you know, apart from like the financial traction, the KPIs and like P&L and all of that was really about the product vision itself. And to give him credit he was already completely on to AI in 2019. So he was like how is AI going to transform this? You know how do you think about the UX of the future? You know how can you build an app that is much more personalized, much more engaging? How can you embed you know virtual reality in there for instance finding the meeting points or you know even like being in the Louver, like you know how can that trans experience transform. So he is really very visionary and at the same time very grounded in the financials both of it. Wow that's amazing. Okay and so you have this and you have that second half of the meeting. What happens then you leave and you get a call from Jeff saying hey we liked you. Yeah pretty much you know we like this you know let's go and make it out. How how big was that? Between SoftBank Vision Fund and Timas we raised an aggregate of roughly $450 million dollars at the time. We did take some of that capital to buy out earlier shareholders. So, not all of that was primary. Do you think that was the right decision? It's a lot of money. Do you think you needed that much money? For us, it was the decision that ultimately made GetYourGuide into what it is today because just six months after we raised that money, COVID hit. So, we would be bankrupt without that round. Okay. And so, we have that. What was the price of that round? I think that was at the time 1.5, 1.6 billion. Did you feel the weight of that at that point? 1.5, 1.6 or No, not really to be honest. Um at that time I was already so used to tremendous amounts of pressure and you know being at the helm of this company. What what did change was that suddenly I felt like a celebrity. You know it was like you're going into rooms like everyone was trying to please you know it's like you know everyone wanted to do business with you all of like you know the VPs of like the Googles and matters like we're calling me up and you know all of the VCs in the world wanted to have a meeting and were suddenly speaking of you as as if you were like the greatest and like smartest person on the planet. That's when I do you believe the hype? To be honest I had too little time to really reflect on that because six months later we were managing the biggest crisis in the history of online travel. So that was such a brief honeymoon period that to me it was very surreal looking back. But I actually did learn the hard way that when you're down then none of these people call. Okay. So six months go by. We have this honeymoon period. Great period to have and then COVID happens and there was this kind of week or two week period where it was like, \"M, like what is this coronavirus?\" It started off with. Take me to that the internal discussions there around how bad is this going to be and then how it transformed. So in February 2020 we have this board meeting with SoftBank, Timasc, obviously, you know, Asian funds, and they're already seeing what's going on in Asia where you have lockdowns and everything and they were saying you know we better build some contingency plans you know if this actually spreads to Europe and the US and you know the naive like you know still very gung-ho founders that we were we said you know look we've managed crises before we've had the butterclaw attacks in Paris in 2015 which hit us hard you know we we managed to survive and all of that. We're going to manage. Famous last words. It took three weeks from that board meeting to us being at zero revenues. Literally zero. Like I was going on the Website weeks. I think there was like maybe 15 bookings a day down from like tens of thousands. There was no one on our website. I looked at Google Analytics. It was just really no one. It was just no traffic. You know you we we had you know 600, 700 employees. We had no revenue. What do you do? That's a really good question. Like you get in a room with town and go, \"Fuck.\" I mean, the closest I can describe to the feeling that I had was like having a car crash on the highway at like 100 miles an hour just straight on hitting a wall basically. So, I was like, \"My analytics must be broken.\" I was like, for like two or three days, I I felt like this is surreal. This can't happen. This can't happen to me. I did this for more than a decade and and this is just not right. I felt like no, the world is not right. There's something wrong in the world right now. But then I quickly turned into a mode that in retrospect I describe as being the surgeon. So I tried to put myself out of outside of the car and the car accident just said, \"Okay, everything is broken. Like the car is completely destroyed. The patient needs to survive. I need to help the patient survive.\" So I put my strategy hat on and thought about you know what are the potential scenarios that we have from here and how am I going to survive and not only survive but also thrive after this crisis. And the good thing was I had you know a lot of cash on the bank. The bad thing was I had a lot of investors who basically called me up and said you have to lay off the entire company immediately to save all of the dollars you have on the balance sheet and then afterwards we'll rebuild. You know with these different pieces of information I needed to build a picture of what the right solution was for GetYourGuide at the time and you know to Neil's the CFO and I we all huddled in a room for multiple days to work out that crisis plan in hindsight thankfully I think we made all of the right moves at the time which was number one not to listen to the investors who wanted to lay off the entire company but to rather focus on different scenarios of how long this crisis could take and then how we could build a company that is actually prepared for the rebound because already in March 2020 we felt that this is a massive crisis but there's also a tremendous opportunity in here. We have the cash on the bank. So if we are the first ones out of the gates afterwards if we do really well by our suppliers in the interim and we help help them survive as well. If we're really agile, if we continue to build our product, you know, we could be a much better company actually coming out of this pandemic than going in. And that was really the mindset that we took. That same week, I sent an email to the entire staff and I told them about something that I had learned you know, a year, two years earlier when I did a tour with my wife Anakah through Sequoia National Park. And one of the interesting things about the big sea trees is that they actually grow after wildfires. So when the park is devastated\n\n\nThe biggest trees grow because they have the nutrient-rich soil after wildfire, and they have full exposure to the sun. And I said, I want to be that sequoia after the COVID crisis. So let's build that sequoia now. So where did you invest in that time that allowed you to come out stronger postfire?\n\nSo we did a couple of, like, very extraordinary measures. First of all, we came back with that vision and that target picture to our entire organization, and particularly the engineering and product, which is the majority of our expenses on the people's side, and we told them we would love for you to reduce your salary, but we'll give you shares as a compensation. So if this actually works out financially, it will be great for you. But you'll need to take the short-term hit. And what happened was magical. Our product and organization, and even beyond that into management functions, people on average reduced their salaries by more than 30% in exchange for shares. Some people went down to, like, 80% salary reduction in leadership. I kid you not. It was crazy. It was such a testament to their belief in the company. And then for a lot of the other operational staff, there was these short-time labor, you know, things in Germany and elsewhere where, you know, the government would actually cover some of the cost. And with these type of measures, we basically could go very deep into the pandemic and only had to cut marginally. So we only had to ultimately lay off throughout the entire two years roughly 15 to 20% of the staff. Not a single engineer, not a single product person, despite being at zero revenues for more than a year afterwards.\n\nWhat happens then? We start to see these borders open up, and we start to see the world come back. Because, I don't know in Germany quite how it worked for you, but in the UK, we had, like, the summer of opening up before, like, the winter of closing down again. You had the same. We had the same. So Europe unfortunately was a disaster for two years. So we had spikes again where people did some domestic experiences and some domestic bookings. There was some travel going on. Some hope come back. That was the hardest part was, you know, the hope coming back, and you know, as a CEO, you want to energize the company, but you also want to be careful and not, you know, giving them false hope. So that was really difficult, and you know, 2021 is slightly better because the US, where we had built up, you know, presence at that point in time, already had a very robust domestic market. So, so that was actually driving a lot of the demand in 2021, but we're still 50% below 2019 and 2021. So, still severely depressed, and we're still burning through oodles of cash every month. And I... What are the board saying to you at this point? You've not listened to them. You've not cut team. You're burning through oodles of cash, and the consumer demands are not coming back. It goes back to the lesson of 2013. I was so opinionated and so straight as this is the path that we're going up. The entire company behind me. People are just sacrificing more than 30% of their salary. We had not a single person in senior leadership leave the company. So there was such sheer determination that they did trust me. At the same point in time, I did cut expenses wherever I could, right? So in territories where we felt, you know, COVID is not going to come back anytime soon, you know, we did cut people, we did cut, you know, all of the SAS contracts we didn't need. We really went down and, like, turned every dime in the company. They did see that, and they also felt at this moment in time that was the right thing to do to rally behind the leadership and follow the plan. And obviously, we had also other alternative plans if things would have gotten to last even longer. But you know, I said this is, you know, the plan that we're going to follow, and we should focus on that. Knowing all that you know now, what did you not do that you wish you had done? To be honest, and I don't want to praise myself, but we did all of the right moves during COVID in hindsight, and this is not because we knew it. A lot of it was also luck, and I think the thing that really, you know, helped our plans was that the recovery then after... I forgot it was the delta virus, like, you know, was the benign virus, I think, in early 2022, you know, people were storming back to travel, right? And suddenly there was, like, this complete over-demand, and we had kept all of supply. We had even, you know, struck better deals with the supplier during the pandemic because they needed to have more revenue. Everyone was switching to online channels during the pandemic because people were just getting so used to online bookings. So, having rebuilt the product, having fine-tuned all of, like, the kinks that were there before, having, you know, streamlined the supply base, better contracts, more direct contracts with all of the major suppliers and attractions and theme parks in the world, we were coming back insanely fast. And did you really see the numbers just go? We went from, you know, late 2021 to March 2022, we grew 10x. It was crazy. And then all of 2022, we already doubled pre-pandemic volumes. So it was... So wait, how when did you get back to 2019 levels? Literally, like, in 2022, we're double 2019 levels. Wow. And 2021 was still half 2019 levels. Wow. Was that quicker and more than you thought? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't expect the rebound to be as forceful and as quick, but I did expect it to happen. Can I ask in mid-2022 when everything's starting to come back and, \"Oh, thank God, the world it looks better.\" How much cash do you have then? We thankfully, because of all of the measures, still had plenty of cash, and we did another thing during the pandemic which actually helped us quite a lot, and that we raised some convertible debt. On top, we raised roughly 100 million both from existing and some new investors. So that was kind of like the reserve that we had on the bank. For people that don't know what's convertible debt, now convertible debt basically means that's a note that converts with your next equity round at a discount to that price.\n\nThe only thing that was kind of not so great was the moment we came back, the equity markets went down like crazy, right? So it was this completely weird world where everyone in 2021 was celebrating in tech, and it was, like, the boom year of tech. We were deeply depressed. We were saving the business. We were nowhere. And then in 2022, we had this massive year growing super fast, everything was working out, but, like, no VC was available because they were all, like, you know, working on saving their portfolio, you know, for most of their companies. It was really doomsday at the time, so it was a very interesting dynamic. So we actually held off raising more capital until early 2023, which is, like, the first round then we raised after COVID. Given all... Just before we move to that, before we say, do you advise founders then always take the money if it's on the table? Yeah, you could look at your Softbank round and go, \"Wow, it's ridiculous, crazy amount of money at the...\" But no, actually, it wasn't, and it turned out to be incredibly precient. If it's there, take it or not? I don't think there's a general rule. So I, I do think that founders can over raise, particularly in the early days. I told the story of my 2013 race, so I don't think founders should take too much cash too early, so I often advise against that, but fundamentally, if you have traction, and if there is a big market opportunity, and if it's clear that there will be plenty of competition later down the road, make sure you raise the capital and make sure that you go fast. But the tricky part is to maintain the discipline of raising and then not overspending in your own organization and staying nimble and staying focused, right? So you need to do both. You need to stay incredibly focused on building out your core customer segments, your core value proposition, and then you ultimately need to outra your competition. You need to do both at the same time. Okay. Fantastic. You mentioned also earlier, and I forgot to ask it to you. You mentioned US VCs coming in, Spark in particular, you're suddenly able to hire great, great people. Do you think that brand-name VCs are incredibly important for signaling?\n\nYes, I do. I've seen that time and again, also with my personal investments. If you have a Sequoia Capital or an Index or a Spark Capital on your cap table, the reality is that your next round will be so much easier. Would you say they should take them at a discount? I wouldn't take anyone at a discount. I would actually have a competitive process, and then I would really look at the GP. I think that's very undervalued. Because, you know, there are many people at these different funds, and I think the GP probably matters more than the fund itself. You know, I do think the brand name really does matter. The GP probably even matters more. And then I would go, you know, what no one considers is, like, is this GP going to be here in 10 years? Exactly. And and I promise you, no GPs will be there in 10 years. I promise you, they will not, like, 95% will not be there in 10 years. That's why most VCs are not rich, actually, is because they're not there long enough for the carry to hit. That's why you go with people who founded the firm, because they're stuck. They're never leaving. Exactly. So, Alex Finkelstein, the guy who wrote the check from Spark, and then also Fogle Mullen of Highland Europe, they were both kind of, like, co-founders of their respective firms, and they're never leaving, which I didn't consider at the time, but that was genius for us because they're still with those firms today. They're still, you know, crushing it, and that's, like, a very important consideration. So I would take a discount for that. So for these type of people, I would take a discount. I've seen so many recently where people have led rounds at firms, they go to another firm, and suddenly, even if you're doing okay, like, you're not doing badly, no one in that firm wants to do you, because you're just orphaned. It's the most dangerous thing. Okay, so we have that world comes back. We're like, \"Oh, thank God, we're now double pre-pandemic levels. Thank 2023.\" Then we raise another round. We raise another round. We never touched any of that capital because we broke even at the same time. Wow. Which is great. But, you know, I love... Was that a special moment? Yeah, totally special. Particularly after the pandemic, you know, we were at scale at that point in time. You know, fast forward today, we're now five times the size of pre-pandemic, and and and and we're profitable, and it's a very different company in the sense that suddenly we can invest our own cash flows in into innovation, right? We can all do all of these great projects, you know, we can do all of this stuff, but it is actually own cash flow. And ultimately what I realized is your cash flow enough to invest in innovation to the extent that you'd like. Yes. Really today it is. Yeah. Wow. So if I were to ask you the question, if you had unlimited cash, what would you do?\n\nGive it back to shareholders.\n\nNo, there's nothing where you're like, \"Oh, I'd invest super into VR or AI personalization of content,\" or naturally there's always areas to invest in. And if I had an idea where I'd say we absolutely have to do this, and we can't stomach it from our own cash flows, I would go out and raise that capital and do it. But the reality is when you break even and you have that constraint and you start to grow your EBIT, it's a wonderful constraint in a way that you're much more disciplined about investing your own cash actually, and that is an important lesson I wish I had a little bit earlier, you know, being an entrepreneur, because very often we're, like, investing, and we hope for the best, and we don't cut these projects, but they're not really working, and again, we dilute our focus, and the beautiful thing is if you're a profitable company. I feel it actually forces you to focus a lot more. That's super interesting. No, I, I can absolutely see that. Okay. And so 2023, then we do go out and raise more though. How does that go? And how much we raise then? Back then, we only raised an incremental 100 million. We still had, you know, quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet. Was this to convertible debt? No, that was after convertible. So we converted the convertible debt, and we raised some additional capital back then. What price did you do that at? Because it was on top of the one and a half billion from Softbank. So, we raised at an up round compared to that. Got you. Were you pleased with that price? It's a hard one where it's like, you know, you've done so much better as a business, but the price is probably quite high from 2021, and so it's a tough one to kind of match. Yeah. So, um, this is where you get into, um, you know, the whining of the CEO in a consumer internet company these days. Like, you know, we all feel that we're very undervalued compared to a lot of other AI or, like, even SAS businesses, but the reality is it is what it is. Like, I do think that, um, at the end of the day, you know, these valuations, um, you know, will, you know, expand, and sometimes they will contract, and you need to build a really good business. I very much empathize now with Jeff Bezos who said, you know, willing to be misunderstood, right? So I think you need to invest for the long term, and then maybe the valuation will be slightly below where you would personally want it, you know, that's fine as well, because ultimately, I don't need to sell any shares, right? I'm going to be in this for the long run. We're profitable, we're investing, we're growing like crazy, the numbers are amazing, they're better than they've ever been. I'm pretty sure that over time, you know, the valuation will take care of itself. Can I ask, did you sell secondaries? You mentioned there selling shares. I did sell secondaries, thankfully, um, in 2019 as part of the Softbank round, um, which actually was very helpful. I was very averse against selling secondaries before that, and I had a very hard time. Why were you averse against it before? Because I felt I wanted to be all in, and I felt like I, you know, that would show that I'm not 100% committed to the company anymore. Um, and I was really wrestling with myself whether I should be selling or not. You know, I told you, like, you know, I had even debt, you know, so so so from my parents and you know, you know...\n\n\nPlease tell me, you paid them back family and friends.\nI offered; they never wanted to.\nUm, and with the suffering run, I said, \"You know, finally, I can pay you back.\"\nBut my mom said, \"You know, this is your inheritance. You know, go be happy. Don't worry. Like, we, we love you.\"\nAnd look, I'm, I'm very happy ultimately that I did, because that gave me another level of calm, uh, in the pandemic.\nBecause how much do you think is a reasonable amount to take off?\nWell, I think for far, it depends a little bit on how big the company is and how mature it is.\nSo, I think a couple million bucks is probably the right thing if you're a mature company.\nI don't think that you should be taking too much off the table.\nSo, it shouldn't be enough so that you retire forever, never need to work again.\nI think that's not the right amount.\nDo you think 10 million is too much?\nIt's probably on the upper end.\nYeah.\nI had a founder on the show the other day, and they're like, \"I mean, why would you bother unless it's like 30 or 40 million?\nYou can't live life without 30 or 40 million.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Wow.\"\nBut that's the point, like, you should not.\nI was like, \"Wow, okay, that's, uh, you should not get into that lifestyle, right?\"\nSo, so the way I'm like, also like, for me, right, I put that money into MSER, right?\nSo, like, I haven't touched it, right?\nSo, like, you shouldn't change your lifestyle.\nI think that's the most important part.\nLike, you should have some, do you not think you should, and what I mean by that is, I might do, change your lifestyle, do up level, like being blunt, now I have the best food, which I never had, so I'm much more healthy.\nI have the best gym, so I'm much healthier.\nI have a PT.\nI changed my lifestyle phenomenally, and my performance has gone up 2x.\nOkay, let me rephrase all of these things, totally fair, and I do that as well.\nUm, you should not live the lifestyle of, you know, all of your paper wealth being liquid.\nAnd I think that's what a lot of people do.\nThey even take loans against, you know, their paper and all of that.\nSo don't do that.\nDon't do the private jet.\nDon't go to like the most expensive resorts.\nLike, don't hang out with all of the crowd, you know, that has that level of wealth, and don't delude yourself.\nThat's what I'm saying.\nTotally get you there.\nDid you ever find that tempting?\nWe're both in this world where it's...\nNo, it's not my thing.\nIt's not your thing.\nNo.\nWhat do you advise young founders who are approaching that?\nYou, you invest as well, and you see some founders where you can almost see them getting sucked into the vortex of tech power and influence and money, and you're like, \"Oo, that's, it's going to lead you badly.\"\nYeah.\nI, I don't think you'll be successful if you will, if you look at the most successful founders in, in Europe, like you look at a Peter Vunderdose, right?\nYou know, you look at, you know, Mickey from, from Vault, like all of those people are like very grounded people.\nUm, they are super smart.\nThey've been working on their companies for a long period of time, and they don't get eaten up, um, by their success and by their wealth.\nIn fact, they reinvest a lot of this into the startup ecosystem, which is like the same thing that I'm doing.\nLike, I don't think that, um, you know, hanging out with that type of crowd or living in that world brings you joy and fulfillment.\nLike, what brings me joy and fulfillment personally is seeing the next founder succeed.\nReinvesting in success, seeing the next founder succeed.\nYou angel invest now today.\nCorrect.\nYes, I do quite a bit.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nHow many angel investments have you done?\n30, 40.\n30, 40.\nWhat's the best one?\nI was, um, you know, just literally, like, you know, with some pocket cash and some advisory shares in the seed round of TravelPerk, which was, um, a big success.\nSo, Avi Meyer, you know, is an amazing, love him, fantastic, amazing CEO.\nUm, I was early on in Trade Republic, which is amazing success, and you know, next to Revolut, is probably one of the best ones, and like lots of smaller SAS companies that are growing really fast.\nLove that.\nDid you have a strategy going into angel investing?\nNo, it's, uh, the strategy of investing behind great people and business models that I really enjoy and also spaces where I think I want to learn.\nSo it wasn't a consistent check size.\nNo, it was somewhere between 500K to 150K somewhere.\n200K somewhere there.\nGot you.\nHow has investing changed how you think about operating?\nSeeing 30, 40 companies grow, build the founders within them.\nHow has seeing that as an investor changed how you think about operating?\nVery much so.\nSo, so I had a couple of, um, learnings, I think, being an investor that really changed my worldview, and that, um, before investing, I thought there was just one way to be successful, and there was the way how we built GetYourGuide, because I saw how that worked, and I had some such strong beliefs, and I'm such an opinionated CEO, and I was so opinionated and deliberate about building our culture and all of that, even the operating model and the strategy.\nI felt there was just one way to do it, and then, for instance, take Trade Republic, which, um, you know, is a very successful fintech company, probably one of the most underrated companies in Europe, you know, they're absolutely crushing it, and the founder is great, but in many ways, what he's built in terms of culture, in terms of operating model, is 180 degrees different to what I've built.\nLike, I would not make the same decisions at all, like in many instances, but he's very, very successful.\nCan ask what decision did he make that you would not have made the same as he's centralizing all of product under him.\nUm, you know, basically every product review runs through him.\nUm, you know, he has a culture that is much, much harder hustling than we are.\nAnd maybe to a degree you might call, do you ever worry that you're soft?\nLittle less empathetic.\nSo, so what I learn, my, my, my take on this is different markets deserve different cultures.\nSo, um, we're in the business of selling experiences.\nWe're in the business of hospitality.\nWe're in the in the business of unlocking unforgettable memories for our customers.\nThe way how we have to build our cultural DNA, by its nature, has to be different.\nIt needs to be a little bit softer than a Revolut, because we're just serving a different type of customer.\nAnd also the employees that will join us will have very different motivations and personal needs than people working at a fintech company or people working at a SAS company.\nSo, it's really how can you build a culture for your market and for your customer base.\nSo, I, um, posted the other day that if you want to win today, in other words, be 0.0.1% successful, you have to work 7 days a week.\nSilicon Valley has turned up the intensity, and that is the new reality.\nDo you agree with me?\nThis is a very tough question, uh, because any founder who's built a successful company will remember that they did work seven days a week, right?\nSo, so it, it does happen.\nIt, I don't know of any founder personally, none of the ones that I've backed, and certainly not me personally, who have not been absolutely obsessed, uh, and have not worked insane working hours.\nAt the same point in time, I think the danger with the general statements is it is not always the same throughout the entire journey, and clearly I would not expect today people to work 7 hours, uh, sorry, 7 days a week, um, at, uh, GetYourGuide, and I don't work seven days a week anymore.\nIn fact, uh, there comes a time when working too much can actually destroy your startup as well, because after a time, it is actually much more about sustainable growth and sustainable working hours at very high intensity at scale.\nSo today, you know, I'm much more focused on push back in the nicest way.\nYou see Jensen, Jensen does not take a day off and very openly admits it.\nYou know, when you look at the greatest founders that they still don't, and like we talk about sustainability, I don't, I don't know, I would describe it differently.\nSo, so for me, I don't, I'm not arguing with you, I'm more just like ideating, cuz I totally, first five years, 100% there's just no, no debate, I don't think, but when you build infrastructure, you have the ability to be a little bit more...\nI don't know the exact routines of the different CEOs.\nI think as a CEO, you need to see yourself as a system ultimately, and you need to build up your own capabilities and your strengths as part of that system.\nAnd you need to understand what you're uniquely qualified to do and what you can do different than anyone else in the organization.\nAnd that's particularly true for a founder CEO with all of that history and that context.\nSo for me, what that means is I have a strong spike in strategy.\nI think I've built a really successful business because I've made the right bets, and my intuition is very good.\nSo that means for me personally, I need to take some time off to actually brainstorm, talk to people, understand where we at, review the numbers, review the metrics, and refine the strategy and bring that back to the company, because that's my unique position and my unique role.\nAnd I structure my day exactly like that.\nThere are other people, you know, I'd say Daniel E, for instance, um, you know, is probably, you know, one of the world's best people, like at, like product, right?\nAnd like for him, it's really a lot about introspection and understanding what product he types he likes to build.\nAnd you know, he actually, I think, said that he doesn't have anything on his agenda all day long.\nSo I think they're just like different ways of doing it.\nUm, you know, my agenda is still very full because I'm very systematic about actually getting the insights, building the strategy, being in the front lines, doing customer service rotations, understanding the customer, because I constantly want to enrich myself with a greater level of immersion in our data, in our customers, and our suppliers, and understand the entire cross functionality of the business.\nBut, um, I don't think there's one single answer.\nAt the end of the day, going back to like, what's the right quantum of hours that you invest, any founder is going to be in the business anyways all the time.\nIf you're not thinking about your business all the time, you're not doing something that you love, and then you won't be successful anyway.\nSo any founder thinks about it all the time.\nDo you think we have too many tourists?\nI think there are a lot of people who think that being a founder is sexy.\nThere's so much VC money that they get funded and they kind of can start the life, and it's, you don't get it.\nYeah, and that's I think the point where we need to be careful with ourselves and we need to make sure that we have a sustainable lifestyle.\nDon't become you.\nUltimately, life is long, and I, I do think, um, you know, when I'm 60, 70, I want to look back at my life, and I want to make sure that I've spent the time in the right way, and that means I will want to have built a very big business, but my lesson has also been, you don't build that in a year or two, you build that in decades, right?\nAnd you need to sustain over decades, you need to sustain that pressure, and you need to have that high level of energy over decades, right?\nHow, how do you do that?\nThat's like a question I ask myself quite a lot.\nI've completely changed my own lifestyle because of that.\nYou know, I do a lot more sports.\nYou know, I do spend more deliberate time with my family and my kids, for instance, because that actually helps me sustain.\nThat is the antidote.\nI've got a company now, a great company that's raising a series B in Europe, and they're, they've just gone to the US from Europe, and they've just raised a little bit in, have meetings in Europe, and now they're out in the US raising, and they're like, \"God, the difference is just insane in terms of series B investors and how they think and how they operate.\nWould you say that you had a vastly different experience between UK and US investors, or sorry, European and US investors?\"\nUm, I had mostly US investors, so I didn't have many European investors.\nSo, I can't really speak too much, um, to what it's like to have a very European...\nYou had European engagements, though.\nWe had some European engagements.\nWe had some European investors.\nI think the biggest difference is that the US investors just have, have had much bigger home runs, and that relieves a lot of the pressure.\nSo, talk Spark Capital, our series A lead, you know, the deal after Get Oculus Rift, right?\nYou know, Palmeri.\nSo, you know, we were basically off the hook a couple of months after they made the investment in us because the fund was already returned, and then afterwards Wayfair was in the same fund.\nYou know, the fund got returned another time, and then, you know, if GetYourGuide returns it another time, like that's great, but that's, you know, icing on the cake.\nSo, that I think has a completely different dynamic, and VCs in Europe don't have that.\nAnd that allows you to think much bigger because your early stage investors don't have feel the same pressure.\nI'd say the, um, on the US versus Europe, um, the, the bigger point is, I think we have the same ambition level, uh, among the founders in Europe and the US.\nI think it's, to be honest, when people say European entrepreneurs don't work as hard, are not as ambitious.\nYou know, I've heard Peter Thiel and like others say that, but I, I think that's BS, to be honest.\nLike, I think people here on average have a much tougher time because it's much harder to raise funds.\nIt's much harder to build a business across Europe than in the US, where, you know, when you raise funding, the addressable market, everything is much bigger.\nI think where we have a big difference, and that's where we need to catch up, is just the overall flywheel of having had successful VCs, you know, that have raised bigger and bigger funds, and also, and that's very important, having the talent density in the different, you know, startup capitals of Europe.\nIf I want to hire, let's say, the next chief product officer at GetYourGuide, it's almost impossible to do that in Europe.\nI need to go to Silicon Valley because the density of people who have done that scale, have served tens of millions of customers a year, built a business that's, you know, 10 billion plus valuation, that just doesn't exist to build the structures and the processes and everything to do that.\nDo you think Trump and a less stable America makes it easier for us to bring talent to Europe?\nTotally.\nI think that's why both of us are so committed to Europe.\nI think that's the Eureka moment of Europe.\nI think we need to seize that moment, and I wish, like, um, we had the, the landscape and the leadership to do that.\nI mean, if I was in charge of Europe and, you know...\n\n\nThis, that was going to be my question.\nThis is, you know, so like completely unrealistic, but know, let's just assume for a moment that's true.\nI would say pump up venture capital funding to match US levels.\nYou know, we spent 50 billion a year in VC.\nIn Europe, the US is north of 200 billion.\nWhy do we have that gap?\nDoesn't make any sense.\nI mean, just to give you another number, like Germany subsidizes its broken retirement system every year with 100 billion, right?\nBut we don't.\nWe have 7 billion invested in VC, 100 billion subsidies in retirement system.\nThat doesn't make any sense.\nThat's not the future.\nI would, I would just push back on that and say we have way too much money in European venture.\nWe have so much money that your execs are getting emails from VCs encouraging them to leave GetYourGuide and start companies where execs are saying, \"Hey, I'm not leaving.\nThis is a weird VC rumor that I'm leaving.\"\nAnd I, I disagree with you, Harry.\nSo I agree on like the seed and series A and like all of that territory.\nYes, probably there is enough capital, maybe I don't know, but you know, probably that there is enough capital, but you know, when you look at the GetYourGuide stage and like our last couple of rounds, like we had to go around the world.\nIt is harder to raise as a European company, and that's where the big rounds happen.\nI get you.\nSo you were saying kind of CDE, CDE, pre-IPO, and then even public.\nI mean, like, how can a German company go public in Europe?\nIt's impossible.\nAnd like, if we go public, it's only with American funds.\nWell, you're not going to list in Europe.\nSo, you know, we haven't decided that, but the reality is, regardless of where we list, sorry, I'm, I'm not being a journalist being on top of like, how could you?\nIt's very difficult because we don't have the pools of capital here.\nThat's the problem.\nAnd, you know, we don't have these pools of capital pre-IPO.\nWe don't have these pools of capital post IPO.\nSo, that's what I mean with like, we need to invest a lot more in innovation.\nAnd it's not just about the next seed round.\nIt's really about scaling these companies and making sure that they stay in Europe and making sure that they continue to innovate and build in Europe.\nWe need way more budgets for innovation, and that ultimately comes with a lower cost of capital, which means higher valuations for growth stage companies, and that means more money for these companies.\nSo I agree with you that like on um, what is it when you kind of uh, you know, you meet in the middle, like at growth, I totally agree with you there and get you there.\nOkay, to more money at growth for companies in Europe.\nAgree.\nNext one, as the prime minister of Europe, that I would uh recommend here is we should attract talent like crazy right now.\nWe've got the entire immigration debate in Europe just kills me because we have the wrong debate.\nI mean, of course, like we cannot have all the refugees in the world migrate to Europe.\nWe need to solve that problem.\nAgreed.\nBut why don't we spend that air time now discussing how we get the greatest minds in the world to Europe because that's going to make the best time ever because they're all going, \"God, the US is a show.\"\n100%.\nIt, I would go so far to say anyone who relocates to Europe, um, you know, with a computer science degree or like joining a tech company should get massive tax benefits.\nI don't know, 5 years tax-free or like no taxation on stock options, whatever it is, like bring them over.\nLike we can't compete with less capital, a more scattered European landscape, more bureaucracy, and less talent.\nLike it's not going to work, right?\nSo we got to solve the talent part.\nAnd the great thing is we can turn our weakness into a strength because everyone wants to live in Europe.\nLike everyone I talk to, they want to live here.\nThey want to live in London, Berlin, Munich, like you name it.\nWe're a very livable continent.\nPeople love to be here.\nSo let's make sure that they come.\nThat's such an instrument.\nOkay, you do like tax incentives for great talented people, whatever that is.\nBy the way, I recommended that in Germany, got shut down immediately because, you know, people said, you know, this is not egalitarian.\nYou know, it's like we need to pay the same taxes everywhere.\nBut I think it's so misguided because we have such a progressive tax system then.\nIt's not egalitarian.\nYeah.\nI don't ask me the the problem though, if if you look even at the, you know, old industries.\nSo Volkswagen and Mercedes, etc.\nWhat do they need?\nBrilliant software engineers.\nThey do need the next people figuring out autonomous driving, right?\nSo, we need that level of talent.\nAnd Harry, at Get Your Guide, we have 90% of our employees in Berlin are not German.\nAre not German.\nAre not German.\nMost of them don't even come from Europe.\nBecause the reality is with demographic change, we don't have enough people here.\nEven if I wanted to hire only Germans, I couldn't do that.\nLike, it wouldn't be possible.\nLike we don't have, and 90% are not German.\nThat's astonishing.\n90% are not German.\nAnd it's not because like we opted to not hire Germans.\nIt was really because that's the only, you know, candidates that are available.\nLike we re-relocate massive amounts of people from India, you know, Northern Africa, the United States, you know, and then obviously in the European Union.\nIs there anything else you'd do to attract great talent?\nI love that in terms of the tax incentive for software engineers.\nAnything else that you'd do?\nWell, it sounds very sad, but actually making it easy uh and removing the red tape and and the barriers.\nSo, we hired a CTO from Netflix uh last year, Gorov Agaval, amazing guy.\nHe was the guy who led all of growth at Netflix, um, you know, which was very successful, was at Meta before, tremendous resume.\nHe's Indian.\nUm, for him to get a visa to come to Germany after he had signed a job contract.\nThis guy makes a lot of money.\nTook him 6 months.\nWhy?\nBecause he had to go to the consulate in San Francisco and they only take appointments two times a week and they've been booked out for the next 6 months.\nSo I literally had to call up, you know, the foreign office in Germany to get him an appointment in San Francisco so he could bring his paperwork, literally the paperwork, because he can't send that anywhere, so that he can get the visa and migrate to Germany.\nI kid you not.\nI mean, if you make it that hard, you know, it's no wonder that we don't have a tech ecosystem in Europe.\nOkay.\nMake it easier.\nAnything else?\nI think lastly, this comes to the nuts and bolts, like you need to have like a really functioning society.\nI'm actually really concerned about the far right in Europe because that will be a huge detractor for these type of people.\nI mean, it's something that we do.\nI'm so sorry.\nWhy the AFD is kind of been diminished/ reduced?\nNo, no, no.\nIt's stronger than ever.\nOh, and people like, I understand why like Germans or like, you know, Brits are very upset uh because we have all of that red tape.\nYou know, we have these stories that I just told.\nUm, but the problem is if we turn into nation states and if we turn into kind of like, you know, these very nationalistic things in in Europe, then ultimately will detract the people that we really desperately need right now.\nSo I think having really a functioning civic society and and that ranges really from good education systems to good hospitals to good roads and infrastructure to actually uh, you know, people just engaging and and and loving Europe again, to be honest, and like advertising it, that is something that we need, and and I think frankly in Germany, we've done a terrible job at this over the last couple of years.\nUm, you know, we've had a really good brand for a long period of time.\nI think we've really tarnished our brand over the last couple of years.\nHow do you think you've tarnished your brand?\nI think today, like when you think of Germany, you just think of things that don't work, and like, know, social media has just spiraled that up so much.\nI think the UK is a little bit in the same spot after Brexit.\nSo to be honest, I think we need to turn the page and like be much more optimistic about our future.\nWe're able to reinvest in energy, in innovation, in technology the way that we need to fast enough to.\nI mean, fundamentally, our governments are are totally ill-equipped.\nAbsolutely.\nBut I think that's going to be the challenge for our generation, Harry, to do that.\nI think if we don't display that level of optimism, if we don't believe in Europe, if we just look at the US and are like,\nmy question to you is, would you ever go into politics?\nA lot of people have asked me that.\nI think the biggest contribution I can give to Europe right now is build a really big company.\nPost that.\nWould you ever ask me then?\nCuz I always say the same thing, but it's like fundamentally, if you have the power structures broken and actually we don't have the time.\nChina and the US are accelerating away from us faster than ever before.\nSo what I do is I support a lot of, so I donate to a bunch of different political parties across Europe.\nUm, I do support young politicians.\nI don't know whether politics is the only thing that's broken here.\nI think a lot of it also has to do with the education of the people.\nI think it's really the the the politics are ultimately a reflection of like what the people think and what they want.\nSo I think it's really upon us also as leaders in technology to bring that progress closer again to the people.\nThat's why I try to speak out about this type of stuff as much as possible.\nTry to educate, even if you get a blowback like I got with the tax incentives.\nI don't give up, you know, I continue to try to make that the point, and I try to do that in a way that is as inclusive to these people as possible.\nAnd I, I feel like if more of us do that on a continuous basis, ultimately things will change because we have a very loud voice from the younger generation that are very dissatisfied.\nA lot of them in, I don't know what it's like in the UK, but a lot of them in in Germany actually now vote for right-wing or leftwing parties.\nAnd we need to make sure that they understand that they can still shape their future.\nAt the same point in time, I think we need to build up the empathy from the older generation, which is the biggest voting block, right?\nThey, they have the power to change things to ensure that we have again opportunity for the young generation in Europe.\nDo you think we're going to see the concentration of capital towards few people and wealth inequality like never before?\nWe're in these kind of rarified airs.\nWe both came from the same conference where everyone's loaded and everyone at the top is just getting so much richer and that will get smaller and smaller and we will get richer and richer as blunt as it sounds.\nDoes that know why?\nI think in Europe much less than the US, uh, to be honest.\nI think that's again something that's quite positive about Europe.\nIf you look at Germany and many other European countries, our Gini coefficient is actually quite healthy uh overall, and we have a ton of redistribution.\nSo I don't think that redistribution per se in Europe is our biggest problem.\nI think it's rather how we choose to invest that money.\nAnd if I'd sum up, you know, my uh claim here is, I'd say we need to invest that more in the younger generation, not just in the older generation.\nI think ultimately we'll need to make sure that the older generation understands that that's the right thing to do.\nProject Europe.\nWell done.\nProject Europe.\nUm, listen, I want to do a quick fire on.\nI've loved this.\nUm, so I say a short statement.\nYou give me your immediate thoughts.\nDoes that sound okay?\nAbsolutely.\nSo you can add anyone to your board that you don't have.\nWho would you add?\nJeff Bezos.\nWhy?\nObviously Amazon.\nBut what would you like to learn?\nHe's been one of the most inspirational leaders uh for me and how I built the company.\nI think for most people in marketplaces\nand I think just his level of rigor and thinking about the customer and about building the business would be amazing to have on the board.\nWill you have more engineers or less engineers in five years time?\nWe'll have more, but a lot less than we thought we would add.\nSo, so in other words, will gradually grow, but I think the productivity gains from these engineers will be massive.\nWhere has AI most impacted GetYourGuide today on the supply side?\nThe supply side is completely transformed.\nUsed to take, I think, days to upload a product because experiences are so complex.\nYou know, you need to add a description and photos and like take a 100 boxes in the meeting point and you know, the tour itinerary, etc., and now you just paste in a URL or you know, you upload a bunch of files and done.\nSo it's, it's huge and and then the pricing and availability management and like the AI insights on, you know, how you can improve your experience.\nI mean, all of that is pure magic.\nWhat supply do you still not have that you would love to have?\nI would love to go deeper into what we announced this year is shows and events.\nI think that's actually massively important for tourists.\nSo when I come here to London, I want to see Arsenal, London.\nI want to see Chelsea, etc.\nAnd we're just dipping our toes into that market.\nThere's tremendous interest also from these, you know, clubs from these, is not a show going into the ticketing market.\nLike it's such mafia.\nWe're not going into the core ticketing market.\nWe're going into the touristic part of the ticketing market.\nA very different market.\nMuch higher margin.\nPeople love to spend on hospitality uh tickets and um that's something that the clubs also love because they get the true fans, they get to build their brand internationally, and at the same point in time, uh those are people that spend much more when they come to the games or the shows, etc.\nSo it's a different part of the market that I think is very interesting, is going to grow a lot over the next couple of years.\nWho's been the most impactful angel?\nForget Your Guide case as I described.\nCase, amazing, totally get that.\nHow have you most changed as a CEO when you look back over the last, what is it, 15 years?\nYeah, I've become a lot more humble.\nI do know my deficiencies and I think the things that I get wrong a lot more.\nI, I really, you know, was very, very self-confident when I when I started the company, which you know, really helped us survive and I think grow over the first 5 years.\nToday I'm still very self-confident, but I also understand much more how I need to be\n\n\nComplimented. Where did your confidence hurt you? Where did it help you? I think it helped me in just having the sheer stamina and energy to drive the company forward time and again and not take failure as an option. I think it hurt me and that I don't think I was as inclusive as I could have been, and I think that has hurt innovation to a certain degree at times.\n\nMy brother just had a baby. What's your biggest advice to a new parent on being a killer at work and also smashing parenting? Yeah, exactly. Don't do that. Don't be too hard on yourself. You will not be a perfect parent, and that's fine. And you also won't be a perfect CEO, and that's also fine. I think find your balance. I think balance is the most important thing when you're a parent and you're growing a tech company and you have that demand on you. So really like make sure that you find time for both, and at the end of the day, you know, when we're 60, 70, 80, I mean, GetYourGuide will be a very important part of my life, and I will want to make sure that that is as successful as possible, but at the same point in time, I think my kids will mean more than anything else in the world.\n\nIs GetYourGuide your last job? I think it will be very hard to have a job after that.\n\nFinal one. What do you most want to be remembered for? Like when people say about Johannes and the impact you had, what do you most want to be remembered for? At the highest level, if Johannes had a massive impact on creating more human connection, I think, and that's across GetYourGuide and the product we sell, but then also the topic of Europe and recreating the future of Europe. I think if I would put that under one theme, it is creating human connection.\n\nDude, this has been such a joy. As I said, like I'm a European. I have heard so many wonderful things about you for so many years. So, this was such a joy to do. What an incredible story. Thank you for coming on the show, man.\n\nThank you so much, Harry.\n",
