  "cleanText": "Why do you think it's my responsibility to make you better as professionals? [ __ ] you. Seriously, if you're not going to take the time to make yourself valuable, to embrace reality, you're doomed. I'm not going to help you. If you don't want to do this, you're either going to be poor or a burden on society. And again, this is a part of this awakening. Wake the up. Grow up. Ready to go.\n\nMicha, it is so good to have you on the show today. Listen, I've been looking forward to this one. So, thank you so much for joining me.\n\nThanks for having me, Arie. Not at all. I've heard many good things for a long time. I had Adam at Bessmer on a while ago and he sung your praises then and so I wanted to make it happen then. And then when you, you know, did your recent activity, I was like, [ __ ] we've got to make this show happen.\n\nSo, I want to start AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it's coming for my job, too. This is a wakeup call. Can I just ask what spawned this post? What was the reason/ catalyst for it then?\n\nThis was boiling for for a while. And I think that this is also echoing some of my team's thoughts about their futures as professionals. And for some reason, some of it might be also frustration of not seeing people going through this wake up moment. And I really wanted to validate a lot of what people were thinking between themselves or in you know in small groups but and be very blunt about it but also offer some directions or at least thoughts about what you can do about it and then have this as an invitation for a discussion which we did have after the email and this this was surprisingly large. I I've asked my chief of staff to assign a room that can that can hold I don't know 50 people and I wrote an email saying look I'm I'm going to spend 3 hours sitting in that room with my laptop just working and if you want to have a conversation I'm there just come sit beside me let's chat and so so we we've scheduled that time and I came to that room and there were about 250 people just cramping in that room and I wasn't prepared to give a lecture. The idea was that this would be a conversation and it turned out into a into what started with a brain dump on my part and then and then just having having a conversation which which is pretty hard to do with 250 people.\n\nCan can we start on that brain dump? I I'm so you bluntly you're a direct dude. I'm a direct dude. Um my question to you is we've seen Cheg be bluntly killed as a business by AI and you know Fiverr is one that people say is very vulnerable and I'm sure people you know talk about it in that same vulnerability. When you did the brain dump to people what did you say in the brain dump?\n\nIt was again very blunt. Um and what I told the team is this. I said in an ideal situation my expectation of you is that each and every one of you and it doesn't matter what you do is going to replace 100% of what you do with automation. Now, maybe it's impossible. Maybe you can't get to that number, but ideally that would be the number. And and the obvious question is great. If I can automate 100% what what I do, you don't need me. And my answer to that was actually it's exactly the opposite. Because if you can automate 100% of what you do, that means that now you have 100% of your time free to figure out what are the things that you can do that cannot be automated. You can spend more time, you know, having nonlinear thinking. You can you can work with me on strategy. And I actually said that this was as as I was writing this um it it dawned on me that there's something very interesting about this process when you when you understand how AI augments who we are and and how we do things is that maybe in in a in a weird way what's happening with AI is forcing us to rediscover our humanity because in many ways if if if functions that we do as dude seriously as robots can be automated then there's no reason for a human being to do it but what makes you Harry special what makes you special is is this the fact that you have a very advanced taste for things and you can determine right from wrong. Um I is is it the fact that you are great at ideiating and thinking in a way that is unconventional? What is making you special? This forces you to actually get down to understanding your humanity again.\n\nThere's so many things I just want to unpack there. You mentioned there about um finding your humanity again. An inherent part of humanity is also vulnerability and fear. Um running from things that can kill us. I'm literally just came from a board 10 minutes ago where the CEO was like, \"My team is not embracing AI because they're like scared that it will replace them over time gradually. How do I as a CEO encourage adoption without fear?\" So that gets me to another point that was that was super blunt. Look, when you think about high-tech, um, the average age is very young. And, you know, I've been I've been building companies for almost 30 years. And when I started when I started developing my career, um, it was very obvious that as a professional, you need to be up to-date. You need to be able to be valuable. And in order to do that, you need to constantly upgrade yourself. But I think that what happened in the past 10, maybe 15 years was this notion that your place of work has the responsibility to make you better. And my point to the team was, look guys, this is an aberration. This is like you're getting everything wrong. And let me tell you how things uh really are. Whose responsibility is it to make you a better person? Whose responsibility is to make you a better spouse? Whose responsibility is to make you a better dad, a better parent? And why do you think it's my responsibility to make you better as professionals? [ __ ] you. Seriously, if you're not going to take the time to make yourself valuable, to embrace reality in a good way, you're doomed. You're doomed. I'm not going to help you. I am not. It's not my responsibility. But I will tell you what I will do. I will help those who want to go through that process. Meaning, if you want to help yourself, I'll be there for you. That's my vow. Okay? But if not, [ __ ] you. You're done. You're done. You're not done at Fiverr. You're done. Period. Because no one There's not going to be demand for people that cannot upgrade themselves. people that have, you know, uh, that are having a bad time coping with reality and understanding what it means. I'm I'm sorry. So, this changes now. And each person should figure out what what they want to do with their time.\n\nI mean, essentially, when you were saying, it's funny. I was like, no, I disagree totally. Like, a a husband or a wife should want the other person to be better, push them, challenge them in ways that make them grow. But to your point, it starts with you. The the the additional is good. If your spouse wants to help you become better, but you're not interested in doing that, it's not going to happen. If you don't put the time, it's not going to happen. I'm putting the time to give the infrastructure for growth. That's fine. But I am not res I'm I'm not your dad. I'm not I'm not responsible for you. So I I agree completely with that.\n\nMy subsequent question then without sounding bleak is I'm very good friends with Jason Lanin from SAS who has quite a bleak summization on this but he says yeah and no one wants to work today like young people don't want to work like they used to and so my question to you is when you reflect and look how much of society is really wanting to embrace that change versus not\n\nI think that it's going to be wrong to try and understand reality through the lenses of the current of the present of the current present. I think that right now we're in a very fuzzy state in time where you know things things change very very fast. I feel that we are in a period that is very similar to the do but it's now. So it used to be pets.com it's now pets.ai AI, whatever. It's the same [ __ ] And there's like in my feed, there's like 40 startups every day. There is no need for so many. But but everybody's trying to cope with the endless amount of information that comes and and and and this is very discouraging. I don't think that this is going to be the situation in the future. And so I don't think that the way people judge the present has too many implications about the future because we're in a very unstable world right now. Now the question do do people want to work or not in my view is a personal question. If you don't want to work the exit from the building is on ground floor. Bye-bye. That's fine. I don't think that it it is my primary function to figure this question out with people. My assumption is those who want to come and engage um in in the activity of working either to make a living. It's usually the combination making a living um expressing yourself the search for meaning. Um, look, we we spend the majority of our time, our awake time at work. It needs to have a meaning. If it doesn't have a meaning, then it's it's very miserable. Now, if if you don't want to do this, you're either going to be poor or a burden on society or a burden on your parents. And again, this is a part of this awakening. Wake the [ __ ] up. Grow up. If you don't want to work, don't work. I think that as human beings, we're by nature a competitive creature. Why? Because we need to compete for food. We need to mate. Um, and if you translate this into modern times, you want to, you know, you you want to have the best looking girl at school. You want to have the fastest car. You want to fly business, not coach. You want like it's these are basic stuff. They don't come out of thin air. They come out of hard work. And in my view, it's more important to actually look at at the meaning part of it.\n\nYou know what I love about my job honestly is the fact that I admit to my woeful lack of experience in some respects. And you have 30 years. You there draw the analogy to the com. when you look at today and the.com where do you look at today and go that's unsustainable and the sign of bubble like times.\n\nOh, look. So, I I mentioned 40 new companies a day on my feed. There is no market for so many companies. And by the way, it started, it actually started, I don't know, eight or 10 years ago when I started talking about bubbles because when you look at markets and you look at the amount of companies that are actually competing for the same customer, for the same function or need, you realize that there's just too many companies for a market that cannot entertain that amount of companies. So I think that it was boiling to a point where the market needed to have a cleanup and sometimes cleanups happen with a lot of companies go bust and sometimes it happens through consolidation of saying oh there's whatever there's five companies competing for a market that is very specific in cyber security this is a market that can probably entertain one or two in that subsegment. Um, someone's going to win, which by definition is not going to leave that much for the rest, which means that there's going to be a cleanup either through consolidation or through companies going bust. Right now, what we're seeing is on steroids. And what what's you know I was I was reflecting about this uh a while ago of saying you know when I started building my first company the I I was referring this as time to clone. Okay meaning um you create something that is outstanding you succeed. How fast would someone clone you? And maybe 25 years ago, this would have taken a year depending on the sophistication. When we launch launched Fiverr 15 years ago, time to clone was between 6 and 9 months. Okay. The time to clone right now is I don't 10 days, whatever. like I probably for simpler stuff it's nothing. So so the influx of just of just the the amount of things that are being built and they don't have a differentiator. They don't have the delta of what they're adding to the existing is is really really marginal. And there's another thing that is really interesting about this. Um, and and and you can see this it's hard to um I I think it's hard to uh measure exactly, but what's interesting is think about think about the horizon of of building something. So it used to be that you had Mount Everest in front of you and this was the the mountain of building something. So you you had to spend tremendous amount of preparation, energy, all of it to climb the mountain. When you reach the peak, what you realize was that there is like 10 other Everest in front of you that you need to climb. And what's happening right now is I think that we've received a lift. So now you get a ride to let's call it 300 ft from the peak. Okay? So you can take a ride and usually when you build stuff that that could be lovable, that could be whatever then you you get stuck at some point and then you need to climb the rest of it with a professional or whatever getting help. But when you reach the peak, what you understand is now it's really easy to climb, but I'm still at ground zero because who's going to know about what I've built? H how would I how would I market this? So, it shortened that phase, but it didn't change the actual tough issue. My sister builds apps. Great. And this is what's happening with AI. It's so easy. Everybody is building. But what's the what's the true value? It's it's very small to none.\n\nWell, that was my my question to you, which was on the time to clone. Does that not just reduce the importance of time to clone? Cuz respectfully, I would say that Fiverr's value is is built in its brand, is in its distribution channels, is in the trust that it has with the supply side. It's not the front end of the website or the payment system of the website. It's all of the externalities or other products that make it an enterprise valuable company.\n\nYou're right. But but here's but here's the butt. You know, when when the company was 9 months old, there were already like 30\n\n\nClones and years after, there were thousands of clones.\nAnd we were having a debate between ourselves what to do with it.\nAnd we had two camps.\nUm, there was one camp that said, \"Let's [ __ ] them all, okay?\nLet's go after everyone.\nLet's let's fight it.\nIt's unfair.\"\nUm, people should not be just copying our labor and our concepts and all of our hard work.\nIn my camp, the way I was looking at it, I said, \"Look, the the the advantage that we have um is double.\nOne, we're first for the market and we're in um it is speed.\nIt's just like we're running really really fast.\"\nAnd when you think about the analogy of running, when you run, your head can point to only one direction.\nIt's either in front of you or you look behind yourself.\nTry running by looking back.\nYou're going I'm I'm telling you, you are going to slow down because it's it's you lose your balance.\nYou're afraid to hit, you know, like a wall or, you know, or a pole.\nUm, so you need to look straight and you need to run as fast as you can.\nThe second advantage is they don't know what we know because we're ahead of the game.\nWe're the ones who are innovating.\nWe're the ones who are actually figure out figuring out how to solve the very very fundamental tough questions and challenges.\nAnd as you said, there's the front end and there's the magic that happens behind the scenes.\nBut what's the butt?\nThe butt is we had nine months of head start which were the nine months where we started seeding the brand and creating something powerful and creating a movement and a community around it.\nIf the time to clone is 10 seconds, you don't have that time to develop it.\nSo you leave more to luck.\nLook, everybody has I mean luck has a tremendous portion in su in in success.\nI'll be the first to admit.\nBut the portion of luck varies and if you don't have the head start then you need to be super super lucky.\nThe the all the stars need to align for you and I think it just makes things very hard.\nAnd what I see a lot of entrepreneurs doing these days is they're just building off of stuff and they're trying to introduce a a marginal advancement on what was already built because their imagination is not large enough.\nAnd the and the fact is that when you do incremental stuff, you get the incremental results.\nDoes defensibility not shift in terms of where it occurs in the system?\nI don't mean that sound like a VC with a load of [ __ ] words, but if you think about time to clone being where defensibility was before now, time to clone is almost nil.\nSo there's no defensibility there.\nBut it's in the midspectrum where you're at 1 to 10 million in AR where you're getting great data from highquality customers, enterprise or consumer.\nThe way you collect it, cleanse it, utilize that data, maybe defensibility just shifted different parts of the spectrum.\nUh you're absolutely true and I think that this is where again as I was saying that AI forces us to discover our humanity.\nThese are the things that are going to you know to generate the most interesting startups.\nIt's it's that level of thinking.\nIt's that level of building.\nIt's not I'm I'm not just building for the sake of building.\nI'm I'm taking the time to understand their real needs, their real challenges, and and trying to build off of that instead of saying, \"Oh, people like this, so let's make X.1 or or like the next version of something.\"\nAgain, another the reason I love the show is because I just get to ask advice from much smarter people like you.\nI'm an investor for a living, too.\nUm, and there's 20 companies in every single category that I invest in.\nUm, I just invested in an LLM optimization engine.\nUh, we've both seen 30 of those.\nUm, how don't laugh.\nHow do you, we'll edit that out.\nUh, my question is, how do you advise me as an investor then to navigate and operate a new world where every category has 20, not two to three like it was 10 years ago?\nLook, this this goes down to to maybe again a more fundamental view of what's happening with technology right now.\nLook, technology by itself doesn't give advantage to anyone when it's 100% democratized.\nOkay?\nAnd and here's the tricky part.\nThe goto market of open AI in what was it?\nNovember 2022 was as democratized as possible because they gave it for free.\nYou can't you can't be freer than free.\nAnd so what happened with that is and this is what people don't get and this is and definitely they didn't get at launch or the year after but they're realizing right now they everybody felt smarter.\nOh, I can write incredible stuff.\nOh, I can, you know, do research uh much faster.\nYes, but so does everybody else.\nMeaning, yes, it's super powerful, but then it doesn't give you advantage because it's giving the same advantage to everyone, which makes everyone get back to ground zero.\nIt is elevating the standard but it is just picking up everyone to the starting line.\nAnd so as you think about how to apply this to a VC thinking it goes back to the oldest way of making judgments which is look at the people that are running the company.\nYou know because you make decision based on people.\nTechnology will evolve, ideas will change, companies will pivot, but who are the people that are running the show?\nHow talented are they?\nHow passionate are they to what they're doing?\nAre they 100% opportunistic or are they missionaries?\nRight?\nThey they're not going to rest until they get it.\nAre they adoptable?\nDo they think about problems from first principle kind of thinking about fundamental truths about are do they have these things and invest in people I mean at the end I mean I've I've invested in tens of companies it's it's the it's the best people that get it I wrote off companies of saying this okay this is money lost for sure and these were the most successful companies I've invested in because they had the best people period.\nWhich company did you write off that was the most successful?\nThis would this would be brutal.\nWell, they were successful, so I'd be thrilled.\nNo.\nUh yeah, but it's a public company and I don't know if telling the story would uh would would do would do well.\nBut this was I mean this was this was a company.\nThis was seed stage.\nUm it was a tough market.\nIt was a it was a tough not to crack.\nUm the the company had internal things between you know between the founders I mean all the all the all the tough tough stuff and and I said you know it's it's I mean there's so many reasons why this company needs to die but it didn't.\nI mean pe people I think um I think one of the investors of Etsy um talked about them in the same way.\nHe said you know why I invested in I said no why he said because this company h you know should have died at least seven times and it didn't and this this to me speaks for the strength of the company and the strength of the team behind it and and so this was the same story with with this company.\nI mean this I mean I I I at some point I also lost a little bit of connection with the company um which is which is fine and and then I realized that they were going public and I was like the [ __ ] seriously and and I think that this is this is probably the best investment I've ever ever ever made.\nThe multiples were like in the in the 50 like like crazy crazy story.\nIt's all about the people doing I always say seed is about three things.\nFounder being directionally correct.\nIn other words, you don't make pillows or you know beds.\nUh and three is the deal.\nOkay.\nI'm not going to do 50 on 250 for a seed.\nIf the three go.\nAwesome.\nSo there you have it.\nI I don't think that this principle has changed and to be honest I don't think it's going to change.\nYou you made the analogy to the com.\nDo you think we will have a an AI bubble burst in the next few years or do you think the exponential advancement in the core technology means that we will um sustain excitement and financing in terms of the amount of companies that are going to be around?\nAbsolutely.\nLike I don't know like 90 you know 999 companies out of a thousand maybe is going to be around for a year maybe two it's going to be it's going to be ruthless and and I've already explained why I think there's just too many companies that are not introducing interesting advancements and I think it's just it's just opportunistic which by the way there's Nothing wrong with being opportunistic, but the market can sustain it.\nI think that the market is going to start sorting itself out.\nSo, you're going to see much like we've seen before.\nYou're going to see I mean, we're I was speaking about the com.\nThe com also gave birth to Amazon, right?\nSo it's like so there are companies that have true value, true mission um and and the patience to actually build that and and and and staying true to your, you know, core reason to exist.\nIt's going to be the same here.\nThe market is going to arrange itself.\nThere's going to be very very large players that are going to be foundational players which some I think we know who they are or have a a good chance of being these companies.\nI mean the Googles of the world of you know the entropics the the open AIs which I I don't know what the play is going to be exactly but it might be reduced to the equivalent of paying for CPU cycles.\nIt's just going to be GPU cycles.\nIt doesn't matter, but it's a cloud play essentially.\nUm, and then there's going to be the other applicational layers on top of it.\nBut again, I don't think that we can judge from where we are right now because it's just changing too fast for the market to get a chance to organize itself.\nI think it's going to it's going to go through a cleanup process and that cleanup is going to be triggered by investors because at some point they'll say, you know, [ __ ] it.\nLike, I'm I'm out.\nLike, I I'll I'll let it sort out and then I'll figure out.\nSo, that's going to dry up.\nLook, if you're an AI company right now, um you you have you have two fundamental problems.\nUm one is getting noticed so getting getting customers and then it's retaining them.\nUm in both the vast the overwhelming majority fail rightfully so there's not that many there's there's no space for so many companies and there is so much space for people to actually pay for something.\nSo what I think we're in the infancy of that market um because there's there's I think two main things that are missing.\nOne is regulation and the other is expensive tech.\nOkay.\nAnd what I mean by the second is um the the type of technology that is not free or 20 bucks or 200 bucks.\nThe technology that is freaking expensive so that very few can actually allow themselves to to have it.\nSo that's going to create differentiators between players.\nAnd so those who are already large or at least have the backing to actually invest in it are going to have it.\nAnd those who don't won't and that's fine.\nWe're before these two these two transformations regulation and expensive expensive tech.\nAnd this is going to be another force in arranging and sorting out the market.\nI was on on a call with a massive bank this morning and they were like, \"Harry, there's no way that we can use notion, let alone use AI tools, dude.\"\nLike enterprise adoption is so far comp why what was the reason compliance like you cannot for data and privacy record calls, record calls and then take summarized notes.\nNot a chance.\nI mean, they laughed me out of the room.\nMisha, look fine.\nUm, so they shouldn't use it.\nUm, which is which going to be another reason why banks are going to be going to be left behind, whatever.\nBut look, it needs to be sorted out.\nSo if if compliance is the issue, compliance is going to sort itself out.\nSome of it is going to be like uh hosted on location, some of it whatever there's solutions for that.\nUm, do banks use any cloud services?\nI guess they do.\nIs cloud safe?\nWell, you know, here and there.\nUh, do you have companies on the cloud with compliance?\nYes, you do.\nSo, you can use them.\nLike, it's nothing is nothing is 100% safe.\nI don't think that these are the interesting problems to be honest.\nWhat do you think are the most interesting problems?\nWell, I I think that um questions like um are we okay with the fact that um truth is dead?\nLike that we we can't even tell what's real and what's not.\nAre we okay by not being able to uh differentiate between things that are human and things that are not?\nYou know, when are we being manipulated and not?\nDo we?\nBut but there's even a much much greater and much more interesting question which is are how do we consider ourselves as human beings in our place in the world?\nMy view is I'll I'll give you my view.\nMy view is that humans you you and I are the center of the universe.\nEverything evolves around us acting from from an assumption that we are in the center.\nAre we okay with losing that center?\nBecause what's happening right now is going there.\nBecause if you know if if we continue to develop technology in in in a way that eventually is going to be unsupervised because it develops itself and we feed it because it's based on us but it doesn't it doesn't care about us because you know AI now is eating the world.\nIt is learning from everything everyone ever created.\nIt's mixing it.\nIt's churning new results without even saying, you know, I've I've just uh generated a a nice podcast based on what I've learned from Harry.\nNo, [ __ ] Harry.\nRight.\nIt's just generating stuff.\nSo, my actual concern is that if this will go on over time, then what's going to be our motivation to continue creating and sharing stuff?\nIf if it has zero value.\nI mean some of some of some of the motivation to create is internal but as human beings we need feedback.\nSo we we want to see what how the things that we create impact others.\nThis is why we share.\nThis is why you have open- source code, right?\nBecause because people can people can use what you what you've done but they can build off of it.\nBut if this if if it has no value then why why would we create and if we stop creating why why would it why would I'm sorry why would it have no value if you look at AI generated content today it has yeah not quite the same value but it has a similar value a lot\n\n\nOf short-form video.\n\nToday is actually no, but that wasn't the question. The question is, what is the value for those who created the actual content on which AI is being trained? If, when AI generates something because it learned from me, I don't get any credit for it. I don't get compensated for it. You know that copyright is dead. Essentially, it is dead. It's a notion from 1710, and it's dead overnight. There is no copyright. It's done. It's dead. I'm so sorry. Can you help me understand why copyright is dead and when so much of content and media is predicated on it? Just help me understand. I'm really naive. If you look at the arc of advancement of humanity, you know, homo sapiens have been around for what, like 300,000 years. It was pretty linear for a long while. What changed the the the pace of advancement of humanity was the printing press or the the uh uh the the printing machine. And because it allowed for the distribution of knowledge, which made more people knowledgeable, which inspired them to create stuff, and then through press distribute it so that more people can enjoy it. Very close, maybe a 100 years, maybe less after the Gutenberg, uh, there was the 1710 act in the UK that was that was called the uh, the act for the advancement of learning or something, which was the basis of copyright, which said to motivate people to create and share, we want to give them protection. One is their right for their for the uh, creation to bear their name. So the you know, and and then to commercialize this if they want. So one is a moral right, right? And and another is a commercial right, and this is how we advance because people wanted to both create stuff but share it be because they they they got the recognition um for doing this and because it created connection because you knew who wrote this piece. So you can get in touch with them and maybe it nurtures new ideas and maybe there's forks and maybe there's it inspires other people to do stuff. This was this was on steroids over a course of 500 years with you know, modern media with the internet, which is incredible, and with AI. So now the distribution of information is incredible. But what happened with AI is it jumped over the hoop of, you know, attributing anything to anyone it is based on, which is why I say that essentially copyright is dead, and everybody calls it fair use. I'm fine, whatever, like I'm not a regulator. I'm fine. But my theory is that if people produce stuff, they publish it, it gets eaten and churned out without any recognition, without any connection to what they've done, their motivation to create and share is going to start slowing down and then decreasing because you lose the benefits of actually creating and getting the recognition and maybe commercializing this, which to me is troubling. I don't know if this would be the case, but I'm raising a flag, and I think that this is, and I'm not raising the flag as the CEO of Fiverr. I don't like whatever. Look, I, you know, my place on this planet is is finite. It's like, but I have kids. There's future. I think about I think about the fact that everything that happened in the past 500 years made our quality of life much, much higher. I don't want this to slow down, and I don't in in my view, we should be the center. We shouldn't be right now. Harry, I have news for you. You are working for AI, and so do I. Because we're producing content, and that content is going to be eaten by a machine and used to produce new stuff. It sounds good. I don't know. Maybe fine. Um, this is up to you. But I think that we we lose our place in the or we we're at the risk of losing our place in the center when we start, you know, working for something else. You're very vocal in a very refreshing way, in a very unguarded way. Do you feel the pressure to be vocal on AI, given your role? Like a lot, I think a lot of public CEOs feel the pressure to have an AI strategy. Do you feel the pressure to have an AI opinion? No. Oh, I no, I wouldn't use the word pressure. I would say that I have a responsibility. It's not the same thing. The um garbage of once great companies that are now no longer with us is is overflowing. Um, and a lot of the reasons why these companies are not around is because they they couldn't sustain transformational waves. Compare this to surfing. Like you you you have to start rowing to get a wave, then and then you can ride that wave. It used to be for 7, 8 years, and then you need to prepare yourself to catch the next wave so that you can ride it. Um, today those waves are much shorter um in in distance between their attack waves, but but it is the responsibility of a of a of a leader of a company to ensure that you're able to um to actually be opportunistic about each one of these transformational waves. And in some ways they force you to invent your act two and act three of a company. Most companies don't don't don't manage to go even the successful ones do not manage to go through the phase one of the company, even if they're a big company already. But there's always going to be a transformational wave. Um, and if you're unable to catch it and make the use its energy to surf for for a period of time, then you're going to lose it by definition. So, you start, you know, getting left behind, waiting for the next wave or just going past. What are your biggest questions on whether you'll be able to transition to the next wave and stand on the board to ride the next wave? Look, I I was asked in a in a in another conversation, uh, so how is it like to be a CEO right now? And I said, you know, it's it's like you asking a, you know, a captain of a ship in the middle of a storm, how is it to be a captain? And the answer is it's wet, it's dark, and you can't see, you know, a mile ahead. Um, I I I think that does it feel like that? Well, in a way that in a in a when you compare 15 years of Fiverr, how does today feel in context to the Look, my you know, my my dad was a was a very senior executive at the at at at the semiconductor business. The beauty about that business for many, many years was that it had Moore's law. Great. So you can extrap like unless it breaks, you can extrapolate and say I know exactly what's going to happen in 10 years to the power of computing and the size of chips, period. I you we can reminisce about those times and miss them, but it's not the case. So right now the cadence is super fast. People that ask me, &quot;Oh, uh, what do you think, uh, what do you think the business is going to look like in 5 years?&quot; I start laughing. It's like, it's a laughable question. Um, you can have grand general ideas, but people that ask you to describe it are just out of touch with what we're seeing. I think that because of a lot of changes, let's just push on that. Why? Why is that a laughable question? Like I think it's perfectly legitimate to try and stretch someone's thinking. You know, Sergey Brim was asked the other day, what will search in the internet look like in 2030? And he said, quite understandably, I don't know. We're taking every year as it comes. But I don't think it's a bad question to try and stretch. No, that no, I I think it's a fair question, and I I think it's a fair question that we should ask ourselves constantly, but also understanding that right now, and I I told you, we're in this what I refer to as like this intermediate phase of technology where things are not are not sorted out. There's the signal to noise is impossible. And and then there is the question of will it get regulated? How would that change stuff? Um, will will countries governments actually take hold of it? What AI companies is doing right now, like the foundational companies, it's like privatizing the Manhattan project. Okay. All right. So, imagine that they do build the atomic bomb. And now they're sitting and saying, uh, you know, I don't know, maybe we'll do it non-profit, or maybe they say, oh, we'll license the atomic bomb. Do you see a government allowing this? Seriously? Serious. Think about that for a second. If you get to AI that cures the worst disease in the world, which actually is worth a lot of money, do you see government leaving this in private hands? If this could create the ultimate weapon, if this could be the whatever, the ultimate solution for infinite food and energy. No way, dude. No way. So, we're pre all of this. So to try and extrapolate five years from now, seriously. But you, but do you not think we're just seeing the commoditization of all model knowledge and advancement when you look at DeepC, the 12 different open source models in China? China versus the US is kind of a moot point at this stage because the do you not agree? No, I don't think so. And and and again, we're pre-expensive AI. We're pre AGI. We're pre super intelligence. We're like, we're not there yet. We're probably not that far, but we're not there yet. So, I think that right now companies are allowed to play. At some point, it's it's going to cross a line where governments are going to say, I'm not comfortable with that level of power. Not in my hands. Right. What happens then? They become nationalized. I I don't know. I mean, some functions of AI might be um prohibited and kept only for governmental branches. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I'm thinking about these questions. I I don't have answers because this is like these are equations with with with too many variables. How do you feel about value dispersion being concentrated? And what I mean by that is it feels like today's environment is more and more about the 0.00001% anthropic, open AI, Nvidia, TSMC, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, short becoming the multi-10 trillion dollar companies, and then everything else kind of languishing in no man's land in a way where that value chasm has never been greater. Do you worry about that? But but is it really different than um, you know, the AWS, Azure, and like how many how many how many cloud providers are probably plenty, how many take 80% of the market? Two, two and a half, whatever that that level of concentration exists for many, many, many years. Well, how is this different? Do you like being public? Do I what? Do you like being public? Sure, why not? There's many reasons why why, you know, I would advocate to being a public company, but there's time for that. If you're under the illusion that you can actually control the market or influence your share, don't do it. Uh, it's a bad idea in for those who are long thinkers and understand that this is a long game. It it it's it's a great choice. It has tremendous amount of benefits. Help me understand that because the feedback that I get is that the market relies on predictability and values predictability almost more than anything. Which means that your ability to invest in very long-term projects which do not have concrete upside guaranteed and are timeline variable are less available to you. And so if you have a long-term mindset, surely it would disincentivize you. If your capital structure um is very solid, if you generate free cash flow, you're your own engine. If you have very solid execution, which means that you have high trust and confidence from the market, and you decide to make bold moves, you can raise more money. Um, and that shouldn't be that hard. Will you have more or less engineers in 5 years time, do you think? Probably more. I don't know how much more, but probably more. Why more? Because of the same the same reason when I said that technology levels the playing field because everybody has it. So it's like it's square one all over, and so great, now you can squeeze 3x out of each person, so does the next company. Great. How do you do more? How do you move faster? You know, in in a market of a lot of uncertainty, one of the biggest strengths of of of a company is speed. It's just your ability to just move super, super fast. When is more worse than better units? And what I mean by that is HubSpot said recently that actually they're producing so much code, they can't put it into production, and there's too many features to release. It's just too much. When is more actually worse than trimming and having better unit? The the fact that you can generate more doesn't actually mean that you can just generate more. Which is why I never, when I talk with my team about the concept of moving fast, I never use the term speed. I always use the term velocity. Speed is just the speed of movement. Velocity is speed plus direction. So, so speed is not enough. You need to you need you need energy in a certain direction. If you're unable to push the code that you generate, it means that you didn't solve your infrastructure to be able to do this. So it means that your priority is incorrect because you don't solve the things that the bottlenecks that are actually keeping you from moving fast. So take the same energy and instead of building infinite amount of things, try to figure out how can I entertain that many ideas. So solve your infrastructure first, then start building like crazy. Plus, you're probably building stupid things. Stop doing that as well. Um, when going back to this conversation that I had with with with the team, this meeting with 200 people, two 250 people in in a cramp room, one of the things that I told them is like I'm I'm thinking um as I'm thinking about velocity, I'm I'm thinking um of how do we re like the the interpretation of it or the the the result of it is just reducing the cost of failure because because essentially, look, all companies, all companies, the majority of what they do fail. The the reason why you don't know this or maybe some people are not aware is because they don't talk about their failure is because there's nothing to talk, it failed. Um, so the amount of things, I mean, if you take a company the size of Amazon, I'm guessing they have, you know, 5,000 tests running at at like concurrently because they have enough traffic to entertain that. Um, the the vast majority, maybe at some point of time, all 5,000 failed, that who cares? But if building something took 10 engineers 3 months and you failed, that's unpleasant. If it took one person 3 days and it failed, great. So we reduce the cost of failure so that we can test more things, we can have more progress. So so the way the the way I was thinking about this is is is really, you know, um, how do we you know, double or triple the output per\n\n\nA unit of time and the same for quality per unit of delivery, but by doing so, we just reduce the cost of error.\nNow, if you do this and everybody else is doing this, you're again, you're in the starting line.\nSo you need to have those differentiators.\nLook, the profession of being a developer is going to change dramatically, but you always need brilliant people.\nWill you need many, many more of them?\nI don't know, but you ask me, is your team going to be larger?\nYes.\nI think, does AI help normal 1X developers become 10X developers, or does it help 10x developers become super, superhuman developers?\nWell, the second one is easy.\nIt's an easy yes.\nThe first one is probably an easy no.\nWhat function, if engineering actually becomes more a part of our org and more important, what function do we have today will we not have in five years?\nEverybody talks about customer support as an example.\nUm, which function has been most impacted in Fiverr by AI?\nCustomer support.\nThe area that is going through the most fundamental disruption is actually marketing.\nIf you think about coding and you think about, you know, how developers are actually using AI, it's really interesting.\nBut when you look at the fundamental function of all the types of co-piloting, what a lot of them are doing is actually what developers hated doing, which is copy-pasting from open source, looking for a library, then reading the, you know, the repo notes, and then, you know, figuring out if you want to use it as is, or you want to go through it and look for security, or you want to fork it and build something off of it.\nLike, it, you know, it's like doing research on Google, following blue links, you know, copy-pasting stuff from different websites and putting a document.\nWho likes to do this?\nIt's robotic.\nUm, I think in marketing, it's a whole different because there is no AI at the level that we have in programming in marketing.\nSo you need to figure out how to use AI without actually screwing up or giving it too much freedom because essentially right now, we're at least still marketing to human beings.\nAnd so whatever is being produced, it will be consumed by a human eye or ears, and therefore there is a much deeper sense of understanding human behavior when you do marketing.\nAnd I think that this is where, you know, marketeers get tempted to use synthetic technologies to automate their work.\nBut I think that's, you know, what they're, they're, it's not ripe yet, and they're not necessarily automating the right functions still.\nUm, and so I think that this is a less charted territory in AI at this point, but it feels, it feels like there's no need, oh, there's no need to write copy.\nThere's no need to manage social.\nThere need to write, you know, to create, you know, ads.\nLike everything could be automated.\nUm, and I think that what we've seen over the past year or so is that there's a, there's like an awakening out of this illusion that this could be fully automated.\nAs someone who spends a huge amount of time in social and in viral content, the truth is, you're absolutely right.\nFor your Virgin, NatWest, Chase Bank social media manager, you're [ __ ] You're [ __ ] already.\nWe're thrilled to announce the launch of our new product.\nSee you later.\nGone.\nBut if you're a [ __ ] master of social and viral social posts, and it includes nuance contacts from current events media, like very trending gifts that are particular today, not yesterday or tomorrow, today, the way it's structured, it is a [ __ ] art form where I can't even hire people today and pay them a million dollars.\nYeah.\nLiterally, I would pay a million dollars for someone to do social like me.\nSo I think that in marketing, the entry-level juniors have been replaced the fastest, definitely faster than developers because still, if you use AI, you still at some point need to open the code and understand what the heck is written there, and if you cannot do this, then you don't have a job.\nBut even relatively young developers can do this.\nIt's not the same with marketeers.\nI think that this is the, this is the area where there's the, you know, the most amount of disruption.\nFinal one before we do a quick fire, just in terms of your leadership style, have you changed anything in the way that you communicate, the tone with which you communicate, the style?\nHave you changed your leadership approach in a world of AI?\nI don't think so.\nI, I don't use AI to write, uh, which is very important for me.\nYammon from HubSpot said that she writes some of her public update, well, she writes her public update with AI.\nYeah.\nYou know, we, we, we've been, you know, I've been talking to other public companies, um, you know, friends from other companies, and we were saying, you know, we need to, we should build our own investor relations, uh, AI so that we don't need to do these calls every time.\nWe don't need to answer the questions.\nWe don't need to write the letter to letters to shareholders.\nAll of that, it's anyway, it's most of it is read by machines for algo trading or whatever it is, and they analyze the tone, whatever, so let's feed them with their own, let's, you know.\nBut when you have those CEO groups and conversations behind the scenes, is the consensus that AI is further along than people think, and we are moving towards more unemployment quicker, or is it that it is further away than we think and not as close as people assume?\nI think most of them are just making the healthy assumption that we're closer to it than further from it because the, if it's, if it's further away, then great.\nLet's chill.\nIt's fine.\nBut if you assume that this is closer, then you, you, you at least think about the necessary, or you think about the implications, which I think is the healthier thing to do.\nI haven't seen companies go through massive layoffs.\nUm, I think companies that had fat in them started doing that.\nUm, because they understand that it's very, and which is what I wrote in my email as well.\nI said, \"Look, um, be, be before we figure out that we need more people, let's just make sure that we're extracting the most out of ourselves, out of our existing team.\"\nThis was true five years ago, which, which is why, you know, if you run a lean company, not too lean, so you can actually be very, you can be aggressive, but lean enough so that there's, if, if you say, \"Oh, fuck.\"\nLike, I, I need to cut cost.\nThere's like, you know, 50 people that, you know, are going to be the first.\nIf you know this, you, you, you should say goodbye, you know.\nUm, but the message was, how do we maximize our capacity before we actually think about bringing more people?\nAnd if, if we think about bringing more people, these people need to be AI natives in whatever they do.\nI don't care if you're whatever, if you, you're joining the legal department or the finance or customer support, you need to be very well-versed in this new world because again, I'm not, I'm not going to teach you.\nAnd what cost would you most like to cut today?\nBut for whatever reason, you can't, shareholder pressure, um, whatever it is, in general, if I could cost marketing, I would always do it, uh, I mean, just because, because the only way you can actually do it is because you can grow without it.\nSo if you can, if your organic component in growth is crazy strong, then you have a good case of going even deeper into your marketing and saying, do I need the incremental additional customer, um, that I'm, that I'm actually paying money for or not?\nUm, but this is not because of pressure.\nThis is just because, you know, we're, we're not in that situation.\nDude, I want to do a quick fire.\nSo I say a short statement, you give me your immediate thoughts.\nWhat one belief about AI have you changed your mind on?\nThe way modern AI burst into our life was, um, driven by a, um, non-profit organization, which made me think that this could be, this could be like a, this could be like a global, uh, endeavor that I think would probably give more power to more people, um, and not more power to less people.\nAnd obviously, with the reality, I've obviously changed my mind, you know, seeing how, uh, how open, a, open AI change their strategy in terms of being in favor of them or against them, like, obviously Elon wants open, s closed, you were open and now you're closed.\nYeah.\nUm, AI is as being a very fundamental, um, technology engine, I would probably rather have open than closed.\nTell me, you've got a child who's entering the workforce.\nOkay, they've just graduated from university.\nWhat do you, what advice do you give them?\nProbably rather give them, um, an advice before they go to, uh, to, to the university, and that would be, don't go, because I think it's a waste of time in most cases.\nUm, look, if, if you're, if you're up for, you know, for finding chicks and and getting drunk, that's fine.\nIf you need someone to tell you to wake up and get to a, to a class and someone to, um, scare you with an exam because if not, you're not going to learn, then this is a good instit in, you know, institute to do it.\nIn 90 plus cases of modern professions, you can study on your own, and you can do it in a fraction of the time.\nAnd by the way, if you don't like reading, great.\nWe have video for that.\nOh, you don't like video?\nThere's voice for that.\nAnd if there isn't, then ask AI to produce something for you.\nWhatever.\nIt's like, it is in my view, it's just a waste of time.\nWhat strategic opportunity did you not take with Fiverr that you wish you had taken?\nOne of the strategic opportunities was to create OnlyFans, uh, many, many years before OnlyFans, and we decided not to do it.\nSorry.\nHow does, how does that come as a strategic opportunity, and why did you decide not to do it?\nWell, it is, I mean, if you look at the size of OnlyFans, you understand why this could be a strategic opportunity.\nUh, but, uh, we, we, we just from, from a point of the, our values as founders, the values of our of our board, we, we decided that this was not a direction that we wanted to venture into.\nThe reason why I'm saying that we could have done it is because this was, this was actually bubbling, uh, within the first versions of Fiverr organically.\nWe didn't have a category for that, uh, obviously, but we, we started noticing that this was, this was happening behind the scenes.\nThere were like, uh, code words, um, that people, that people spread on social and said, \"Oh, go to Fiverr, do a search for X, and what it actually means is what you think it means.\"\nAnd so, and we, we started seeing that in the system, and we, we, we decided that, um, this was not a direction that we're gonna go down.\nIs Fiverr your last company?\nI don't, I don't know.\nUm, right now, yes.\nUm, look, I have this exercise that I do every year, um, where I, I take a day or two or three aside, and I'm, I'm, I'm doing an accounting of how I feel about the next year, and I'm asking myself, am I the right person to continue leading this company?\nAnd it has a process, like, I'm going through this process.\nIt's like, it's, you know, measuring my energy, my contribution, uh, my leadership, um, my, my interest, my curiosity.\nDo you not so identify with your company that it is a part of you?\nLike, I would have a very hard intellectual wrestle if I, if I realized that I wasn't.\nBut dude, I, I started this when I was 17.\nI'm now 28.\nTo not be an ABC VC would be very difficult for me.\nBut, but if you, maybe yes, but at the same time, if, if your contribution to the success of the company is not maximized, I don't know if, like, I know I, I have, I have a rule, uh, if I wake up five days in a row saying, \"Oh, [ __ ] no,\" then I'm done.\nNow I'm done.\nAnd it never happened.\nYou can have a day.\nMaybe you can have two, but like, if you have them in a row, that's a bad sign.\nAnd sometimes, I mean, if you're not, if you, like, sometimes you fall out of love.\nSometimes you lose your energy.\nSometimes you, you life cause you to, you know, attend to other things.\nAnd if that's the case, yes, it's maybe you consider this to be your baby, but dude, it's time to move on and find someone who's, who's, uh, who's going to do justice with the, with, with your baby in your creation.\nUh, it is a hard, it is a hard exercise, but I think it's worth doing, um, at least once a year.\nWhen are you happiest?\nAnd is life about happiness?\nI know it sounds weird, but Nick on the show said to me, \"I don't think life from Revolut, I don't think life's about happiness.\nI think it's about success and winning, and that often leads to happiness, but it's not about happiness.\"\nWhen are you happy?\nAnd is it about that?\nUm, I think it's about, it's about meaning.\nWhen you look for meaning, when you pursue meaning, you are going to have a mixture of misery and happiness by definition.\nBut I think it's, I think that that this is that, and as, as long as you're in your element, as long as you feel that you have, there is, there is very deep meaning to what you do, then by definition, your core is going to be very happy.\nYour life might have, you know, swings because we don't control everything in our lives, and you know, the surrounding our family, health, all of that.\nBut I think that generally speaking, I think meaning defines this for me more than, than the word happiness.\nFinal one.\nWhen you think about how you most want to be remembered, I know it sounds weird, but I think about it a lot with grandchildren actually.\nLike, what do my future generation say?\nHow do you want to be remembered?\nYou know, I think I'm a part of a legacy.\nI think that there's a lot of things that have passed to me from my parents and grandparents that are at the very core of what defines me and how what defines me as a human being, but what defines me as a, as a husband, what defines me as a, as a dad.\nAnd a lot of it has to do, and we've touched on some of these things, is about like being a good citizen of this, of this world.\nLike this idea that, uh, it's always better to be a giver than a taker.\nBut in general, it's, I mean, you can't just take.\nI hate takers.\nSo maybe they'll\n\n\nRemember me as a giver.\nThe world doesn't owe you anything.\nSo that's one of the values that I instill in my kids.\nAnd the other is home is a safe place.\nLike, I, it doesn't matter what happened in your life.\nI don't know, you killed someone by a mistake.\nCome home.\nWe'll solve it together.\nThere's like this, which doesn't mean that you're not going to be judgmental, but you, it means that you, you're not going to be judgmental to a point where you break them because your motivation is to help them.\nAnd, and I think this, this also, it's also, you know, uh, penetrating my management style.\nIf you think about this and you know, radical candor, these type of things, it's, it's, it's all, you know, encompassing and, and it, like my contribution, like I'm probably an artist.\nUm, that's what I do.\nI think, I think, um, I, I just express my art in the things I built.\nAnd sometimes you build a business, you build a company, you build a product, you build, you build a community, you build a movement.\nUm, yeah, sort of a builder, an artist.\nI don't know.\nDude, I'm sure this show has taken some turns that you didn't expect.\nUm, you thought about every question so hard.\nYeah, you know what?\nIt was because of the review cycle in my head post a bad question analysis.\nUm, thank you so much for being so open.\nThis has been fantastic.\nThank you very much for having me.\nThis was really fun and uh, and, and thought-provoking.\n",
