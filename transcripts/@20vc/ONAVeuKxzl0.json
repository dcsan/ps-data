  "cleanText": "My rule is, if you haven't grown because of AI, you failed. The amount of money we're investing in AI right now, at 300 to 400 billion dollars a year in capex, will you get the near-end ROI? Will it be an economically rational decision when you look back two, three years from now? I don't know. I think venture is just going to rip. You're getting a lot of money back as an LP, right? Just massive amounts of cash coming back. I mean, if Oracle can get AI-native by June 30th and your portfolio startup can't, I mean, I'll smile, but I'd give up. Ready to go.\n\n[Music]\n\nWell, listen, boys. I am so excited for this. This is the holiday edition. Uh, we have uh, some travels from two of us. So, listen, thank you so much, guys, for joining me on the travels. Rory and Jason for staying up late and making this happen. Very exciting. It's a lot going on in the world of AI and more. Absolutely.\n\nAlrighty, let's kick it off. So, Figma filed for their S1 last night. Numbers were pretty phenomenal. You have um, 821 million in revenue, 46% up year-on-year growth. You have a billion five in cash, no debt. There's a lot to like about this. And so, I wanted to hear your thoughts on where you think it will go out at and how you analyze this S1 dropping.\n\nThere was a lot to like. I mean, an awful lot to like. I mean, I went through it literally on my phone late at night and got went, \"Wow.\" And you didn't even mention one of the more impressive ones, which is kind of the profitability and free cash, free cash flow margins last quarter, like 40% plus. So, upping positive free cash flow, positive, growing 46%. So, again, rough math on an on an iPhone on a small screen, it's like rule of 80, right? Plus. So, it's a company clearly tracking a billion dollars at rule of 80 plus or minus. I think it's going to get a great reception.\n\nI mean, for sure. It's this, this is just games to figure out what the model's going to be, right? Is it going to be 20 billion or 25 billion or 30 billion? And um, will, will they listen to Bill Gurley? I don't think, I mean, Figma is not, uh, is not consumer, but it's got a big enough brand. They don't need to leave money on. I doubt they need to leave money on the table, right? So, it's a minor issue, but where will the trade? I, I, it's um, you know, the only thing is at 20 billion, you know, which is just what Adobe was going to pay almost 24 months to today, 20 billion's 20 times current revenue, right? Um, it's not even at 20 billion, it's not cheap, right? It's not cheap. So, uh, you know, the, the overall NASDAQ's on fire, but you know, um, you know, Bill McDermott from from ServiceNow just joined. That's about as good as it gets in the enterprise. They're not trading at 20x. So, I actually, I'm not smart enough to know exactly where it will, where, how much it will trade above 20. Um, and how that compares to the IRR of selling to Adobe for cash and having no lockup and calling it a day and going to work as a junior SVP at Adobe for four years.\n\nYeah, I, I think the last sentence says it all. Look, and to your point, it's probably not a better IRR because by definition, you know, bird in the hand two years ago is better than a bird in the bush now, but it's a much better way to live your life. I mean, for the team, frankly, for the investors, I mean, it just looks like a great company and presumably gonna have a great run. I, I think it's a, yeah, great IRR for them. You know, it also, you know, I mean, Scott Belsky was right. They should have bought him. People made fun of him for paying overpaying, right? 20 billion, right? Um, but I think the beauty is if you're Adobe, you can be a little patient. It's okay if you pay two years ahead if it's a winner, right? It doesn't really matter. And people just thought they were paying through the nose and that this was a flashback to a 2021 deal. Fast forward today, if Adobe bought it, they would have a pretty good deal, especially because they're synergies. They would have a pretty good deal.\n\nJason, what would you pay two years ahead of if you were Adobe today? You know, I'm not, I, I'd have, I, I'd have to do my homework, but um, you know, when I was reflecting, you know, you, you kind of joked about questions you should ask Mark Benioff when we did this last time, right? And when I interviewed him, I, I dug deep on the M&A. And you know, years ago, John Sannorgi, who's run corporate dev there since like, he was, I think he was like a double-digit employee, right? He's been there like 20 years. And I caught with him. He's like, \"We're just really good at the big stuff. We're really good at buying a billion dollars or more of revenue and not and growing it, right? MuleSoft, Slack, and others.\" So, uh, maybe that's the same lesson here. Adobe should buy, should stop screwing. You know, if you don't have the talent, don't screw around on the little stuff. And what else can you get that's approaching a billion of revenue that's synergistic, right? Um, I mean, Adobe's at 20 some, right? So that would have been another 10%. That's something. But I don't know. I'd have to look what else could you buy at a billion. I mean, I guess I don't want to say the obvious dumb answer of Canva. Um, but um, you could do worse. I think the beauty of the Figma acquisition was it was market expanding for Adobe. And you know, reading even the S1, I'm, I'm, kind of, well, I think they said something like two, is it 30% of their users are developers, only 30 or 40% are designers. I mean, it really has become a pretty pervasive piece of software for anyone involved in building software products. So, I think probably you're right, what you said, the first thing you, that's Jason is absolutely correct, which is it was a great call by Adobe to try and buy it, right? And you know, even the current, I mean, you know, there was a little bit of a thing for a while there when the deal created that, you know, Adobe's mentally moved on to Gen AI and obviously they have and you know, figuring out their Gen AI strategy and how that reflects in media and how that reflects in video is really important. But the more you look at these numbers, the more you realize that could have been a really central, key plank, a separate cool plank for what they're doing. In other words, that kind of exposure to developers, exposure to designers in the software industry. So, yeah, it was a great acquisition and you know, I'm sure they're looking at it going, \"Damn, wish that one hadn't got away.\"\n\nYou know, it's funny looking back on it. I'm sure reflecting on it now, I'm sure Scott Belsky talked him into doing it. Dylan, Dylan talked him into doing it, right? Scott Belsky, our, our, our startups were acquired almost the same time as Adobe, but he went back from Benchmark, right? Resigned being a general partner at Benchmark to be chief product officer at Figma. I never got the call, by the way. I never, I wasn't even like fifth in the line. I never got the call to go back to Adobe um, even though I built a much larger business by revenue, maybe not by impact. Never got the call. But um, you know, all, you know, everyone said he put his, put his career on the line to do that deal at an insane price, right? But my, but I think he had to talk him into it. I don't think, what does Dylan care? 20 billion, 18 billion, he don't care. It's just so much money, right? So, and then the, the, the life lesson for founders, it's tough. Is look, Scott's gone now, right? It's always a weird thing. Um, when you do M&A and it's not with the CEO because there's a good chance you outlast them. There's a good chance you outlast your sponsor as a founder when you're acquired.\n\nYou joke, but it reminds me of like, actually venture deals and the biggest problem that I see getting done today, which is companies being orphaned and junior partners moving on and then having no champion in a firm and actually being bluntly up [ __ ] creek without a champion internally.\n\nYou're right. Across the board, you're seeing a whole bunch of change. You'd think that any partner would, yeah, stand up for the firm and represent the firm, but it is funny when it's not your deal. That willingness to go the last mile to make it happen, to you know, get on the plane, to hassle the VC, the CEO, to try and get around together to save the company. You know, there's an argument that says the new person is actually a little more clinical and maybe they only actually invest in the very best performing companies and maybe the other guy should die. But there's no doubt that when you become an orphan as a company, your ability to get something done in that venture firm does go down. And you know, parenthetically, I would say some people, you know, wrestle with the choice. Do I stick with the, if the company is say, do I stick with the partner who's moved on but is still willing? You know, the company, the VC firm is still willing to say, \"Hey, they can keep their board seat.\" In general, I found that doesn't work over time because you need to be in the room where the money is allocated. Because I'm realistic enough to say that even if I, you know, if you have a venture board member who is an amazing board member, but can no longer speak to the money because he's no longer at the venture, at that venture firm, then to a rounding error are useless. If you want a great independent board member, put them on as an OR, on as an independent board member, but you need to have people in the room to speak for the money when the money is needed. And that frankly is one of the top jobs that a venture firm has to do. Okay. So, I actually know a firm and they say, \"Hey, reserve decision-making is so broken that we have a different partner that makes the reserve decision.\" And I think that's useless because they don't have so much of the historical knowledge and data of how that company's progressed, changed, and then you come in as a net new investor. They say, \"Oh, it means you come in without bias and without any lagging indicators, which could bluntly determine your decision-making.\" Who, I think it's a great idea to have to not have the partner make the reserves decision.\n\nRight. I like this because when I worked at a third-party venture capital firm, when I, I mean, just people would just want to do the like, just bail out their B's and C's all the time, all the time. Like every, like half the partner meetings were like, you know, but, uh, you know, stepping Lumpkin Corp back to 20% growth. Let's put in another four million. And those checks would often be gone in a year. Like the company was going under anyway, right? I'm not even talking about ones and twos. So, I'm talking about three and fours people want to put money into, right?\n\nJ? I, I don't get their confidence, though, cuz every additional dollar you sink in, you're putting your name more and more on the line. If I don't have something that I don't feel great about, hell, I, I don't feel so good about concentrating more and more if it's my firm or not my firm. I think this, this, this is a minefield, not not on the agenda today, but a minefield. Because Harry, to your point, I think first of all, everything goes back in life to incentives in my opinion. So, you, your incentives as you know, the ostensible leader of your firm are very different than your incentives if you are, you know, the the 15th most senior GP in a much larger firm where you know you're going to rise and fall in keeping your companies alive, right? And frankly, the overall return profile of the firm as a whole, I'm not going to say it doesn't matter, but it's hard to weight it highly, right? So, you as that junior partner have every incentive to, you know, find every marginal dollar for your companies, keep them alive, cuz you know something might turn up. So, it's a very different decision in that case, right? Um, which might argue for Jason's comment. I can't imagine having someone else make those decisions, but equally, it shouldn't be the partner making those decisions. I mean, you have to have a combination of partner recommendation and a fairly robust group process because it becomes, I mean, it's a very interesting discussion, reserve allocation, because it's a finite process and you know, you want to allocate as much as possible in your good deals at the high prices, but at the same time, and at, sorry, the lower prices when you can. But at the same time, there is some value if you end up naked and defenseless on all your deals, on all your, on anything other than your best deals. If you don't have any capital to play with, you do stand a chance of losing significant economic value if you know you head into a tough time. And my only point to add here is when I did Fund One, I put out my five top performers that would be fund returners after about an 18-month deployment period. And none of those five are actual fund returners in any way. And the five that will be, I never have as the fund returners. And so bluntly, I think we overestimate our ability to predict our winners. And I said this on Twitter and and Roger Ehrenberg at IA very much agreed with me. And so I think it fundamentally challenges actually reserves as a model entirely at seed. To a, because what, because you're unable to predict your winners. And so when you do allocate reserves, you essentially allocate to the fastest growing, not necessarily the best long-term sustainable capital or value drivers.\n\nWell, that's for sure. You put it, you when you have limited reserves from a seed or smaller fund, you put it all in your fastest growing companies, like 100 [ __ ] percent. There's only one criterion. Triple-digit growth, you know, double-digit per month. That's it. What do they do again? SaaS for haircuts? I'm in. I think your statement is possibly true at the seed level, which is not where we play, right?\n\n100%. I think between B and C, you have a lot more to play with. Exactly. I mean, you even the truth is, this is what I say to people is, you know, we do it when you have product market fit. Once you have product market fit and early acceleration, most of the, if you get what you get, if you get what you want, right? For the first two years after the investment, you're probably going to make money. And if you don't,\n\nWe're going to struggle. I mean, we've done that. I think I shared with you before is that when I look back two years in, right? If they're at or within 25% of the on the right plan, you know, our probability of making a 5x goes from 30% to 70%. Right? At the product market fit stage, right? I think what you said is not true. In other words, you can, in fact, tell your best, quote unquote, your best deals. Not with 100% certainty. I would have said 70%. I'll come back to that. I'm not sure it is 70 anymore. So that is when reserve allocation gets tricky because you have one, the incentive to put a lot on the good deals. On the other hand, there is some value in having capital even to defend your mediocre deals with small amounts of money where finance things get tough because you can impact, you know, you, it's not going to change your life, but you can take a 0.5x to a 2.5x nurturing it along. I mean, and you know, and finding a way to make a big difference and avoid a big hole, a big hole in the fund. So, there is some value in having some capital there, but the vast bulk of it should go to winners. Rory, have you ever had a pay-to-play work out? I was doing a deal the other day and the lawyer's like, \"Hey, you could lose your rights.\" And so, in a pay-to-play, you could get [ __ ]. And I basically responded and I said, \"I've spoken to many of the greats, and all of them have told me very simply that in pay-to-plays when they've participated, it hasn't worked well. Has it ever worked well for you?\" First of all, it never works well. I mean, my first rule of thumb is this: when you find yourself going to look at the legal documents in a venture deal, you're probably on your way to losing money, right? So the minute you start down this road, you've made a mistake. So first of all, let's start with that. So you definitely go from the, you know, if your chance of a good outcome in a normal deal is 30, 40%, a great outcome is 30%. You're definitely going to a different place. You whenever you're in these kind of trouble, your probability of making big money is very low. Famous example, however, it's worth pointing out. He died last week. FedEx. There was a down round in FedEx like six or seven rounds in, and I think Weisspeck and Greer, which is the antecedent of Lightseed, played pretty aggressively there and made out like bandits. So that is an example of a down round in a network business where it was the tipping point round, and the people who played made out like bandits. So it can work occasionally. But you're right. The statistical rule when you're dealing with these trouble situations is you're probably not playing for the likelihood of a home run win is low. It's not zero. It's low, right? But I think so what you're typically doing with a small amount, and that's why it should be a small amount of money, is you're saying, can I manage this thing to get it to a decent exit versus just letting it implode and blow up? You know, the second startup I worked at, Harry, had a pay-to-play and it IPOed. Which one? Unfortunately, went bankrupt between that round and the IPO. So, everyone lost all their money. So, you could argue whether it worked out for the VCs. It not only the ones that did the bankruptcy round, but it did work. Like, it bridged them to the IPO, but they did have to go bankrupt. Um, and then you've got the challenge of the opportunity cost of that cash, though, Rory, being like, \"Hey, do you want to put in that money to do the 0.5 to 2x, which don't get me wrong, is an incredible transition, but versus putting two to three net new lines on the portfolio?\" Yeah. No, you're right. Actually, the real opportunity cost is the time. And I wrestle with this. Like, I would say it's a weakness of mine. I would say sometimes you spend too long working with a company trying to work it out. But, you know, it's funny. Um, partly I think you get connected to the entrepreneur and you want to help them, right? I think if they're my my if if if they're willing to keep on going and they have a credible plan to keep on going, you kind of want to try find a way to help them. And you're right, probably on a cold-blooded basis, you shouldn't, right? And but sometimes this part of this business is not all cold-blooded. You form these relationships with people, they crank for six, seven years, they hit a tough spot for them. Remember the difference between going bust spectacularly and laying off a hundred people and maybe getting a 2x for the money might well be $10, $20, $30 million for them personally. So I will admit that weighs in. And my my rule of thumb is I tell the founder is look, I'm totally willing to help and I've run, I'll come back to the analysis. I've run the analysis on the money overall, it gives a decent return. It's not amazing, but you don't, you tend not to lose money on the bridges. You just don't make as much as you think. So my rule of thumb is don't make this time hard as well. If you have a clear plan that you're going to execute and you're going to get it done and you're not going to dink around, you're going to figure out a way to cash flow positive, figure out a way to build value here, I will support you with a finite amount of money. If on top of that, you're going to make a drama, I don't need it because it's the time that kills you. It's the time. Rory, you are going to have even more fans after this. Uh, I'm I'm actually thinking of one deal where, you know, we've ate for three years. I haven't had to put money in, and the guy's just literally survived on fumes and the promise that if he ran out of money at short notice, we would cover his shutdown costs. So, I haven't even had to put the money in. And I'm just so impressed with the guy for surviving that long. And I'm glad I did it. Who knows, we might make 0.5x, but that guy kept going and I give him more credit. I remember a founder I had to completely bail out from fumes with more money than I had. Um, and that company is doing over $300 million today. Um, and I caught up with the founder the other day. He forgot. I'm actually mentally running through my. I will forgot. I have a second story like that, too. If it's, I wish it was the only one. I could tell you another one that the founder forgot, but this one really stunned me that literally had no, it wasn't like sort of forgot. Literally did not remember that that was the way history had occurred. It's like childbirth. You just, you just forget the pain. The other thing that's just insane with this guys is it's it's going to be $3.5 billion back to Index between this and Scale in a pretty compressed amount of time. I mean, I know there's obviously the hold and the lockup, but it's pretty freaking phenomenal in terms of liquidity and numbers back. I mean, we have a lot of the numbers. The two firms that are able to 3x DPI on fund sizes this big is Founders Fund and Index. Unbelievable. I think venture is just going to rip. I mean, Dave Clark said on LinkedIn the other day that just massive amounts of cash coming back. Massive. I mean, you got to be in the good ones. Like, you can't be, you know, you're only going to get you're only going to get so much back on the Superhuman deal, but if you're in if you're in those two, you could have so I mean, if you're in Kleiner and Index and uh and Sequoia, you're getting a lot of money back as an LP, right? Yeah. And I think there's two things. One is at the macro level, you're right, cash is coming. And at the macro level, what's happening here is the fewer bigger winners. And it's what I always say to people. It's fewer, bigger, winners, right? You're seeing less winners. There's less IPOs, but because they've grown so much longer, they're just so much bigger. So when you're in a winner like that and you're in early, right? Instead of getting $400 million or $500 million, you're returning $2 billion plus, right? So it's exactly it's it's the inevitable outcome of the concentration and the longer holding periods. Now, second comment, the real skill is making sure you're in and one of those that get it. And you're right, all credit to Index. I mean, it's an amazing achievement to get that. Excel just had Scale and um the the the the the stable coin deal. Absolutely. It's a great time to be right. And I always tell people in this business, there's lots to like about this business. You know, the terms, the hours, the money, etc., the the intellectual interest. There's only one problem. In the end, you got to be right. You got to pick the right deals and be in them. And you know, these guys did. I think this is the problem though when we look at fund sizes of today and say, how large they are, and not actually picturing 10 years out to what our outcome sizes will be in 10 years' time because bluntly, you know, $30 billion exits for your Figma's or potential $30 billion or $25 billion IPO would have been inconceivable 10 years ago when the Figma investment was made, honestly. Yes. Inconceivable. Really inconceivable. I for sure inconceivable. And so what is that outcome size in 10 years' time? Is a trillion dollars more likely? People always make mistakes, Harry, when they extrapolate trends at at infin item, right? I don't think you extrap I don't think just because the outcome here is $30 billion and it used to be $1 billion, the outcome you 10 years from now is $900 billion. I just don't think the math works like that. I think there's been a step function change in, you know, the stage at which companies go public. I doubt it will, you know, I I don't think it will continue like that. But I think you're seeing, you know, Listen, Roy, you don't need to get salty just because my friend Sam told me that you were in this shitty messy middle thing. Your shitty shitty middle fund size. I I am not shorty. I am not shorty. I just asked Claude now. Yes. To do these numbers for me. I did it. I can see it on my screen. I asked Claude today to do this exact analysis. Uh, that explains the mild hallucinations we occasionally see from you. It is. I There's an investment today. It's worth $544 million nominally, right? Yeah. Um, what's I uploaded all the financials and the investor report from today and I said, what will it be worth in 2029 and give me give me give me a sensitivity analysis? It told me $3.6 billion. That's the most likely outcome from Claude. So I feel better. Like it's in the bag. I just all I have to do is hang out hang out at the beach until 2029 and it will get to $3.6. Good, good to know. I mean, serious comment here. This is still a cyclical business, right? And you know, and you what you should not do is extrapolate a cyclical trend. I mean, like what you see is the the the investment, the I, the window opens intermittently, and when it does, you know, if you have the assets, you can do really well, but I don't think you can extrapolate, as I say, from where we were to where we are and keep that line going for another 10 plus years. But you don't have to. The truth is, I mean, you you mentioned fund size. I was thinking about it this morning is that, you know, seeing the, you know, the strong performance from Anthropic in terms of topline growth and then just looking at the burn, you know, five last year going to three this year. I mean, I to some extent the fund size argument has been answered by the burn argument, which is, you know, you some of the most compelling opportunities here require a level of capital to be significant in terms of their cap table such that it warrants at least some of the larger fund sizes. You know, I think that there is definitely a place to put large slugs of money, whether it will have, I don't think look, it's never as good as when you go in expecting a billion dollar outcome, you price accordingly, which is what all the investors did in Figma, and then end up with a $30 billion outcome. That's the amazing result because you get you 10, 20, 30 times what you expected, right? You know, now that you maybe perhaps people are more adjusted to higher outcomes and bidding accordingly, you'll probably see some deals missed to the downside. So I again, I don't think it extrapolates on forever, but it's definitely, I mean, we're definitely playing on a bigger stage with bigger dollars and there is at least some justification for being able to deploy those dollars. We talk about kind of bigger fewer outcomes but the meaningful nature of them. The thing that I also found really encouraging though was like Melio, a company that is very good but not in the top 0.01%, uh bought for $2.5 billion by zero. I thought that was really encouraging to see this kind of mid-level or not even I don't mean that badly to them, but this kind of slightly smaller but still very meaningful outcome. I'd love to hear how did you guys think about this and how did you break that one down? I thought it was discouraging. Um, what I mean is that um Melio gets for $2.5 billion. Look, that's a lot of money by, you know, hopefully folks will watch this and mock me for for like not thinking that's a lot of money. It's they but but guys, they're at $153 million in AR growing 127%. 127% at $153 million, like why if you knew nothing would you advise your portfolio company to sell growing 127% at $153 million for $2.5 billion? I mean, we all have, we all have, you know, I just got pitched an AI startup at $2 million AR, you know, it's only growing that fast worth the same amount. H it's not I don't think this is a big like I I could imagine what happened if if you guys know the story, but this is not a deceleration story. This is crazy. I I'm not convinced that the growth rate was that high on a sustainable basis. I'd be surprised. I mean, maybe it is. It's a market.\n\nmight not be sustainable, but I'm literally reading zero slides where that's where they're selling their own shareholders on it. That's what they claimed, right? 153 million in revenue, whether it's growing 12, 27% or 100%. This is not the greatest multiple of all time, is it? That, that, that intimidates me that it's not a great multiple that I find it intimidating as an investor, actually, cuz I have plenty of deals that are great and not as good as Melio. Yeah. No, look, yes, it's like 13 or 14 times, depending on NTM revenue. I thought, but honestly, I thought it made a ton of sense. I, I had it pegged for a lower sustainable growth rate, and I think, you know, we were investors in Bill.com, very happy investors in Bill.com. It's public, it's much bigger. You, the market's been tough to it recently, and they're not. It's a tough comp today. It's a tough comp today, right? And I think that you, that kind of bill payment accounts payable space is fairly crowded. There's a number of plays. There's a lot of go-to-market and consolidation, and being acquired by the ERP adjacent competitor kind of made industrial sense to me. So, to me, I was like, \"Yeah, that's about the right price, and that all makes sense.\" Again, I, I'm disconnecting from the growth rate comment. Then you have the advantage over me because I haven't read the press release, and no one, I'm sure, would ever lie in a press release. So, um, no, I think the number, I, I don't think zero can lie in what they're saying. But I, but they're not showing the forward growth. So, so your point, I'm sure, is correct. But on trailing velocity is a force of nature, right? I think they had some interesting strategic deals that are always challenging at scale. But yes, but I think the other interesting comment about it just worries me for M&A, that this is that like we all throw out, \"Oh, they'll buy my portfolio company for 900 million or 2 billion,\" but are you sure you're better than Melio? I'm not so sure. I think the interesting thing also about that one was that, you know, they'd raised a couple of rounds significantly above that in value. I think they'd raised in '21 two rounds, the last of which was four and a half billion, right? So, you know, you look back on that and you go, look, on the one hand, it just shows what a lovely rigged game the latest stage business is. If you always get a, if you always get a 1x on your losers, and you have enough winners, by definition, you have a positive IRR. It's a nice thing. On the other hand, it just shows how wrong you can be. You know, you sat there in 2021 thinking, I should buy at four and a half billion in the expectation of making a two or 3x, which implies 13 billion plus, and you know, you fast forward three or four years and you're happily taking 2 billion. I mean, the pref stack here was 650. So 650 total pref stack, and then the last round was 4 billion by GC. And so, to your point on like pref stack to outcome size being the risk that you're taking, like 100% here, like you have pretty minimal risk when going in at that. I think. Yeah, I agree. You're still getting a 0% IRR, but yeah, I guess it's Agreed, but you're getting a 0% IRR and you lose. Again, the interesting to me, I guess this is captain obvious, okay? I'm a little slower than the two of you, but this is actually a little bit good for founders. Okay, last round at Melio, 4 billion. Okay, 500, 500 times revenue or something like that, right? And then there was a corporate round at 2 and a half billion. But like, if you, if you're getting your preference back, you know, and it's below your 4 billion, you don't really care what the price is. Like, you know, when I, I, I, I, I almost killed myself as a founder fretting, I had to like at least quintuple my investors' money, right? But as long as if they're only getting one X, they don't really care what the headline number is, do they? Like, in a way, the pressure is off a little bit. Well, they don't. I mean, but the, but I thought you were going to say something different, which is it's the earlier guys care. The early guys care, and more importantly, the founder cares. I mean, you know, the, the Yeah. Yeah. But they're just going to get, they're going to make their own decision. It's binary, right? They're going to, they're going to make their own decision. I think it's liberating for a founder to say, \"Goodness, I can sell my company for two and a half billion, and these, these, these bozos with the blazers aren't going to say no.\" Agreed. Right. That was the fear when I grew up as a kid, right? I was terrified my VCs would say no to everything. I was terrified every day. Totally. I can tell you if you're, if you're a founder stuck in that situation right now, no one who wrote a check in 2021 at 4 billion, if the company's underperforming, is going to stop a 1x right now. They'll be like, they'll be grateful as could be, give me my money back, and move on, right? So, it doesn't matter if they did it at 40 or four, they're going to get the same outcome in Melio, right? They're going to get the same 1x back. Which, which separate comment creates a large amount of weird dynamics on various boards as people wrestle with these prices. But you're right. I mean, the people who, the people, yeah, you're in the room considering it priced at 2 billion, and you've got some people who are blankly indifferent and just want to sell because nothing's going to impact them either way, and then you've got people like the early investors and the founders for whom the difference between 1 and a 0.5 billion and 2 billion is just a huge amount of money, all of which is going to them, and that's great because the founders created the value here. You say, give me the cash back. The only thing I'll say to that is, yeah, give me the cash back, or even a discount as the cash back, but don't give me, you know, X billion company stock at some ridiculous price. I think I have more Airtable than anyone at 11 billion, uh, because they've acquired about four of my companies. It just shows a couple of accounts. One is private. Two privates are hard, right? And you, you always have this like, um, am I getting shafted feeling, you know, cuz it's all notional, which again, going back to first principles, is, you know, one of the beauties of being public. You don't have to, when you get bought by a public company, you don't have to have this existential debate, or in your case, Harry, from our conversations prior, this existential whine about how much or how little you value the stock. You just, you know, you read the Wall Street Journal and you know exactly what your damn thing is worth, right? It's another beauty from a speed of acquisition perspective, being able to do public. Rory, I'm sitting here in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex. Chimath is in Portofino. Okay. I have a reason to whine when my stock, yes, is given at a $15 billion price. Um, yes, you do. Okay, Jason. I, I really appreciate that because it totally made me think differently about the Melio outcome there in a way that I wasn't before, which I love. Um, 187 million in March, actually. So, they could have been at 200, over well over 200 when the deal got signed, right? 187 in March. I can't get my head around why you do that then. Um, but okay, fine. Another I'm looking for. Can also look it up at that 500, at that 4 billion round, which was 500 times revenue. It, I think it was 500 million. So, I, they, listen, I know what the zero slide says. My understanding is a lot of the early guys sold very quickly. Like it was two years to getting out of 5 billion for the small guys, not for best. I think best might have found it. I mean, they, that guy finds all the good Israeli ones, right? Yeah, but my understanding is maybe nine figures of that that quick 2021 round was out, out at 4 million, right? Good for. I mean, there's no Hoppin, but it's pretty good. No Hoppin secondary. I was on a sales call this week. Once a kid was yelling at me, Harry, and he was, I was trying to explain to him something that I knew more about AI than him, and he's like, \"Well, that's not how I did it at Hoppin.\" I'm like, \"What did you learn in the three months that that market existed exactly when that you went from infinite demand to zero demand, right? I mean, the easiest job in the world was Hoppin May 2020, right? Easiest job in the world. Hardest job in the world made 2021.\" I'm just going to say one thing, and I get in trouble for this, and then we can put a pin in this one. The founder always gets chastised for founder secondaries. I remember when he was being forced to take cash off the table by hungry growth investors who were growing the hell out of him, and he was going from 49 to 42%, or whatever it was, and it was a completely rational decision. I think it's okay if the, if the investors got to sell too. Like, listen, you're not the founder, but my point is, if he's being fogrod, okay? And that does happen. Like, it's happening again today. People are getting fogrod, right? For folks, it's when there's so, even though the investors want you to be conservative, they want to put so much money in the hot company that they, the only way they can get it is by giving it to the founders, right? Buying their stock. But it sure would be nice if the investors had the same option. I had this happen to me just once, Harry, where where there was a fog run, and I said, \"Listen, if you're out, I'm out.\" This is what I said to him. Whatever I just want proportionally, whatever you're going to, if you're going to sell more than 10 million bucks, that's like you're making the right decision. I just want to sell, too. That, I mean, it makes sense to me. That was my only ask. Me too. Reversing my comment earlier, I would point out to you both that we do, you do have that right. It's a co-sell right, right? Um, read, read your Harry. That's not enough. Like, you can't always get as much as you might think, but you're right, but you're right. You have a co-sell right, and it's relative to the, and, and the reason it's there is for exactly this purpose where if I think you assume we have any rights, Rory, I think the challenge of '21 is that we, we, we didn't have any rights, but typically there would have been a, I mean, look, it comes up because, you know, can't they be waived by the majority of the investors though? Yes, they can if you choose. I'm getting waved by some, by some guy bigger on the cap table than me. I guarantee they don't even, the last deal I had, they didn't even tell me when my rights were waved. You guys are both, you're both sounding a little punchy and a little bitter. Remember, no one's going to cry for either. Not bitter, but good, good criticism. Actually, you have, you're lucky to be able to invest, right? Exactly right. Some stuff works, some stuff doesn't, you know, move on. But I would like a super co-sale in that situation. That's all. If you're selling more than like 20 million, I would just ask for a super. It's a genuine comment. And it's funny you use the expression the faring them, which I love, but it's odd. It's this is a far out process where frequently the person doing the feeding ends up dying because they, well, my point in the case of Hoppin, you far out the people, and yes, the company died, but you died too, because you lost all your money, but you're right, the thing that blows it up, Jason, you're right, is I love that expression for growing some latestage investor who just has 100 million to put to work and is just going to do it no matter what. The question that I have is, actually, do AI researchers have the same challenges that fogrod startups have, which is when you stuff them with $100 million, do they become less efficient and less focused? That's my question for Zach that no one seems to be able to find out about 12 months from now. Seriously, you, you give these guys 100 million bucks and they go and buy a massive pad in Atherton. Like, I don't know. I'm, I'm worried. I'm worried about that. Ather. You all have the, the guys, the founders that bought the massive pad in Atherton. It's a real issue. The massive pad in Atherton is like almost 100% correlation to decline in revenue. It's like it's almost a one to one. I, I can't prove causation, but I can prove correlation. Almost one to one. Rory's just like, I can't believe I'm with these two degenerates. No. Yeah, you are putting the general. No, I mean, cuz my, my, look, I, I don't think I don't think large amounts of money necessarily demotivates people across the board. I think what large amounts of money do, it reveals what you really want to do, right? And that's why you see some people make lots of money in venture and decide what they really want to do is double down and keep doing this. And you see other people say, I made large amounts of money all along. I really wanted to be, you know, I really wanted to tour the world and play golf. It's just it liberates you to do whatever it is you choose to do. And thus, by definition, your real person comes out. I think the risk you're running here is you're exactly right. It would be absurd to suggest that no one who gets $100 million won't be a little bit disincentivized. So yes, there will definitely be some hit from that, right? I don't think it's, I don't think it's a rule, a law of nature is what I'm trying to say. I think it's more kind of a law. It doesn't change people as much. It reveals what they really are. Maybe some people have been doing this coding for the last five years going, \"God, I hate AI. I wish I could get out of this.\" And here's my 100, and I'm done. But, you know.\n\nIn all fairness, if you think about it, I mean, this is tough stuff. To get the incentives right is so hard, right? Anything incentives are hard. But I mean, Zach made it work with Brett Taylor, right? He made it work with Kevin Syram. Eventually, they flamed out, but those worked for a long time. He got his money's worth out of those deals.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight. So, Zuck doesn't need 10 years out of this team, right? He has a history. And maybe sometimes we re-look too much in the past, but he's made it work before. I think if it doesn't work, frankly, it won't be because XYZ engineer got $100 million and went weird. I think, as someone pointed out, it'll be because some other engineers got really pissed off. It'll be an internal disruption, the weirdness of different people and vastly different comp. But B, the wider comment of is it a great ROI? Anyway, I'm, you know, it's not clear to me that being, I mean, it's not clear to me that this money will yield. I'm this is almost going to be heresy here, right? You know, the amount of money we're investing in AI right now, at $300 to $400 billion a year in capex, and then lump in a bunch more salaries on top. Sometimes I do wonder, will it in the end be magnificent? But will you get the near ROI? Will it be an economically rational decision when you look back two, three years from now? I don't know.\n\nI think it has to be an economically rational decision when you put it in proportion to market cap.\n\nI know all those arguments. You're right. I mean, the proportion to market cap argument, which I've made as recently as last week, I get it. It's what you're saying is, but you're redefining economically rational. What you're not saying is there are two definitions of economically rational. One is it will yield a positive NPV. That's kind of a very boring accountant logical thing, and I'm questioning whether it will. What you're saying is some grand theoretic game theory version of economically rational. In other words, I got to show up at the party with AGI, otherwise I won't get invited to the party. So, I'm going to spend $60 billion to make sure I'm there. And as I say, it really feels like heresy even to say it. But yeah, at some point in the process, you will, we will become overinvested because that's just what humans do when faced with this kind of opportunity, right? Is it now? Is it two years from now? Was it last year? I don't know. But I mean, if you look at what this capex is doing to the balance sheets of the largest companies on the planet, what it's doing to the free cash flow, it's just astonishing the amount of investment that's going on here.\n\nTotally. I mean, you said it turns Warren Buffett's idea of a dream business into a cash incineration machine.\n\nAbsolutely. The poor man would be like, \"People, have you lost the plot? I only left six weeks ago. God damn you all. What are you doing?\"\n\nOkay, but we said about kind of getting incentives right. I think an interesting one on that perspective is Menlo raised another billion and a half, uh, record replatforming and venture. Um, and when I looked at that, I was like, amazing, like for Menlo, fantastic. And my question to you is, one, sure, how do you think about that just generally? But two, do you think LPs are more excited by incredible returns driven by Chime and some other historical great investments or by Anthropic and a forward-looking AI glance that Menlo, I think, have pioneered?\n\nI think it's good to have both. I think they've done a great job and deserve the money. I think Chime is a big ass return. All credit for that. It's hard dollar money on the table. And then on top of that, I agree. Menlo has done an amazing job glomming onto Anthropic, doubling down on Anthropic, and, you know, telling a strong AI story. It totally makes sense. They've all credit to them. There's, you know, you win, you get the prize. That's how America works.\n\nTotally agree with that. Jason, anything to add there?\n\nNo, the only thing I would say, and listen, you guys have a broader LP base than I do. I think the LPs that I talk to are acute, maybe certainly even more than me, acutely aware of the math we discuss here. They're acutely aware of what it takes to return these size funds. They're acutely aware that their managers, what their managers ask is and what the commitments are in terms of the size of returns they need to do. And I've certainly heard skeptics, right, of that these outcomes are there. But they get where the market has to go to what the outcomes. They know the math on the back of their hand. And so they're participating, right? They're participating in this. And it's the game on the field, right? It's the game on. You want to sit out Index and Kleiner and Sequoia after Figma? Probably, probably you don't, you're not allowed to sit it out. So, but acutely, they can do the math that you do, Rory, that I mean, and you're my favorite here. My LPs can do versions of that instantly, right? Instantly, right? They have an encyclopedic memory of every company I've invested in somehow, right? Because they have a lot of managers and they know everything, and they know the AI issues and the challenges, and they know the exact amounts of how all this capital has to play out, right? And they get the risks. They get that you need huge outcomes to make this work, right? It doesn't work looking backwards.\n\nYeah, agreed.\n\nThey know it. And the only proof you can have that someone will be in the deals in the future, there's only two proofs. Either you have some kind of story for a new fund, or you can say they've been in the deals in the past. And you know, you can look at Menlo and you can say Uber, you can say Chime, and you can say Anthropic. You can join the dots in those three sentences and say they probably will show up in the right place. We mentioned like the numbers needed to make it great. It's an unsexy discussion topic, but it did actually again give me hope. And Jason, I hope you don't dash my hopes on this one like you did in Menlo. But Couchbase, a company most people actually haven't heard of, acquired for a billion five. Again, not massive, not huge, but still very important and meaningful. And the question there is like, hey, will we see a plethora of these PE buyouts or PE buyouts at similar scale, which will actually drive a meaningful amount of liquidity, or is this a relatively one of few?\n\nI'm hoping. I think, yeah, I mean, I don't think it's indicative of a trend. I mean, I think that, you know, I took a look at it, and, you know, Couchbase was bought by H.I.G. I think it's the firm in Austin, which is the former co-founder of Vista, Brian Sheet, who is, you know, an extraordinary good investor at Vista and then spun out in 2020 after a split with Robert Smith. And, you know, talented guy, looks like he's building a very concentrated thematic portfolio, kind of going out with a certain number. I get the impression he went out to find that asset because he has a perspective on what can be done in this space with that particular product. I don't think it's a, hey, every $200 million so-so infrastructure company with 16% growth is going to get hoovered up at 5.7 times. I think it's much more a thematic. I think this can be relevant in AI. They have a newer product that's growing much more quickly. So I think it's someone taking a very rifle shot bet, which may be right or wrong. We'll see. But I don't think it's indicative. If you have 10 other $200 million database companies, don't hold your breath waiting for PE to come along. I remember we, for example, we were in DataStax, which is a similar size private held company sold to IBM, great outcome for all concerned, very happy to get it done. But yeah, there wasn't a plethora of PE buyers. It's not typically a PE asset because they're complex technical products. You always wonder about the thing that encouraged me here was it was $215 million revenue growing at 12%, so not stellar growth.\n\nI love how firms will do those bets with the mediocre growth, bless, and not profitable, which I'm not dissing them at all. I'm encouraged that this is the one.\n\nNo, I agree, and that's why I said I don't think it's typical. I think it was much more a, hey, there's a perception that this asset that they have is of value. We'll see. You're exactly right because there, I mean, look, every venture firm, you know, including us, including everyone, has lots of one, two, $300 million revenue companies, subscale for the new world of IPOs.\n\nAnd you know, subscale in terms of growth and trying to figure out where they go. I'm not expecting PE to save all of us, put it that way.\n\nThis is such a small number, it's barely useful other than anecdotally. But I have two portfolio companies that are kind of in that intersection where a tech company and a PE buyer might buy them, right? And they both got mediocre M&A offers recently. Mediocre, right? Not bad, not great. And the first thing I asked the founders, well, what have the PE firms said to you? No one's contacted them, like, ever.\n\nYou know, even two years ago it was like, every week you're getting a call, right? Who, who's Driscoll, Stebbins, and Limited, right? They neither of them had gotten any calls from PE firms. None, zero, right? So, uh, that is, um, that worries me like Rory said, like these are ones that like, could you could go either way, right? They're cash flow neutral. They have good growth. Um, they have strategic and non-strategic value. You could mash them into somebody. The point is, you can mash them into somebody else, right? And, uh, you'd think you'd at least be getting the VP or the analyst calling them, right?\n\nI'm surprised we haven't seen more Bending Spoons like models in SAS. Bending Spoons obviously does consumer subscription rollups for subscale outcomes for venture firms, but also for too small outcomes for PE. I'm surprised we haven't seen that more in venture. I think you're going to see a lot of it. Right. I think that, you know, you had mentioned is it Vizma, which is a company that's going public in the UK, and we'll come back to that. But the aha prior to that is it's a rollup of, you know, hundreds, literally hundreds of subscale software companies. And there you have Constellation, you know, out of Canada, does the same thing. There's going to, it's going to have to happen once the sellers are willing to take price because all these assets can't go on forever subscale. And, you know, the interesting thing about something like Constellation is at scale, they're interesting, right? Is that a $100 million revenue business where Aladdin has nowhere to go? But if you assemble 20 of them and you're at $2 billion and you have 10% EBITDA, it might be the sexiest business alive, but the market will price it. It will value it, and you'll be able to get liquidity and that.\n\nBut Constellation wants to pay 2x is the slight.\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nThat's their model. 2x, right?\n\nI know that. Yes.\n\nYeah. I had them even present at SaaSter annual this year. The team came and it was that was their, I think that was the title of their presentation, 2X. Who wants 2X? Show up 2 PM on the west lawn. I mean, quite a few people came, right? Um, quite a few people came, which is maybe telling, right? But it's like they'll do some deals at 3x, but 2x is the, it's just the model, right? Is 2x revenue.\n\nAgreed. Because they've been able to build a model whereby they can take all the risk out of the deal on their side, right? And the question is, you know, going back to even the Couchbase acquisition where it's 5.7x, is there something more sensible, you know, a little more growthy that you can do with these assets combined together, maybe with a more thematic approach than just Constellation, such that, you know, the clearing price can be three or four? I don't know. But you're right, how someone's going to have to figure this out because these 300, 400 companies aren't going anywhere until somebody does.\n\nI think someone who's really well-placed to do it is actually Grammarly. They've got no.\n\nJust keep going. Just keep going.\n\nI'm being serious. If you can build a next-generation productivity suite and do a number of great acquisitions, hopefully Superhuman being one of them, then, you know, maybe you can piece together something exciting.\n\nDon't jump out of your seat, boys. Okay, fine. Um, I'm hopeful. My Grammarly stock is going to the moon. Good for you.\n\nWell, I do, listen, we can talk about it forever. I just, I want to believe in Rory, but for as long as I've been in tech, I've heard this story like it's going to happen. Like someone's going to, this is going to happen. These more of these companies are going to get rolled up and mashed up and VCs say it's going to happen over lunch and cocktails. But, um, I don't see, I don't see anybody stepping up. Just because it makes sense on paper doesn't mean it happens in the real world, right?\n\nTrue. But I don't know if it's stepping up. And I mean, there's two people that have to step up, the buyer and the seller, right? So from the buyer side, look throughout tech, people have made money doing this. You know, Computer Associates way back in the day in kind of mainframe land made money doing this. You know, you're right, you've Constellation, you've GoDaddy, you have a bunch of others. So there is willingness to do it on the buy side at the right price. The question to your point, Jason, is what is that price? And is that price one at which sellers are prepared to transact? Don't you think roughly everyone that hasn't raised a round since 2021 that's\n\nStill doing okay, that's north of nine figures. Is cool with selling for 5x? I think everyone's going to be ready. They've already rationalized the 2021 valuation away, just like the Melio example. Okay? And listen, I don't want to move off that mark, right? But everyone's like, it's growing 18%, like it's a 5x. Like, let's just sort the public companies. It's a 5x deal. I think they'll take that deal. I don't think anyone's saying no after four years of this money sitting there making no interest in the bank, are they? I think on average, you're probably right at 5, 6x. I don't know, right? But yes. Um, but no one's buying all these 100 nine-figure B2B companies for 5x. No one's rolling them up, right? Yes. And what you're saying is, you know, the market thought, what you're saying is the owners thought they were worth 10x to 20x plus. Now they think they're worth 5x, but the buyer still thinks they're only worth 2x. So there's still a gap. That worries me. I think a lot of them would sell for 5x right now without arguing. I think they would sell for 5x. Yeah. Well, you know, as I always say, price clears all markets. We will find out, cuz, you know, in the end, I mean, look, as you get into these older and older funds, and as the growth rate becomes more locked in, then, you know, your willingness to get realistic has to just go up. Cuz, you know, as I mentally run through, you know, even my portfolio and stuff I'm involved with, you know, the stuff that's growing mid-teens, and I know why it's growing mid-teens and there's a credible story of reaceleration, and then there's stuff that's growing mid-teens and it's never going to reacelerate. And you don't know at 100% fidelity, but you should know to, you know, you should have some sense of what that is. And for that latter category, you're right. You should just seek an exit. Yeah. I just worry that that AI changes so many markets that like a lot of these candidates are just viewed as hopeless now. It was one thing in 2021 when the software hadn't changed in seven or eight years, right? No, you're right. But man, like, you know, I it's now it's the second half of 2025. I mean, if you haven't grown because of AI, you've failed. It's not just that you have a co-pilot, you have to have grown. You have to have done an Intercom. You have to have reacelerated your business. You had 18 months since ChatGPT launched or whatever it was to do this, right? And if you didn't get it done in these 18 or 20 months, you never get it. It ain't going to happen. I like your line, Jason. I just really, if you're not re- if you're not accelerating, you're losing, right? Because someone else is accelerating. So, by definition, on that's a good point. On a relative market share basis, you're nowhere. So if you don't have, so if you don't have a that story and B, some of those facts, you're nowhere. I'd buy that. Yeah. It's like I know where it mixes numbers, but Iconic just put out this set of metrics of how everybody's growing across like 300 B2B companies, right? And and and and it's not this isn't causation. It may not be correlation, but roughly three or 400, including all the AI leaders, all the hot AI startups, all the Harveys and Schmarveys and all the other ones, growth is exactly the same as it was 12 months ago, just about when you throw them in. So I know we're not like we are stealing budget from each other. We are. And yes, sure, are our CIOs adding an AI budget or this and that, but there's clear, it's net zero. We've learned it's net zero at this point, right? Not an so if you haven't, if you haven't pulled yourself out of now, I, you know, man, I mean, I don't mean to agree with Sam, but you might be utterly irrelevant. It's probably too late. I I think it consistently goes back to one of Rory's most pressing statements, which is, are we able to transition labor budget into technology budget in the next wave of AI? And if we are, let's make a markets are huge. And if not, then it's net zero is bloody how I read it. I think the thing that I just think about is like being AI native is such an advantage. We are in a company that is similar to Superhuman, uh, that will be at more than their revenue in nine months for what it took them eight years to go to. And that's no discredit to Superhuman, just the benefits and the tailwinds that come from being AI first versus layering on is massive. And the other, you know, a fun one and and maybe you guys know more about this than I do, but Cleo, which just raised at three billion, right? 20-year-old company, great CEO Jack Newton. They just bought a 25-year-old company VLAX out of Barcelona for $1 billion because it AI-ified its legal libraries. It did. It did AI-ify it by June 30th of this year. It did get the message for ChatGPT, right? It became this data source, right? I mean, I'm not a total expert, but you know, in some minor ways, it became a Scale for legal, right? And all of a sudden, it's worth a billion. It's it's an AI leader, but they got it done, right? And and Cleo gave up a third of its market cap, right? Or 25%, I guess, depending on how you do the math. That's a big deal to do, isn't it, for a Barcelona company founded in 2000? Yeah, 2000. Oh my god. 25 years ago. But they got it. They made the transition, right? And are you saying, just curious, Jason, because you're not being clear. Are you saying, \"I totally get that. That's magnificent. Well done, Cleo.\" Or are you saying I can't say then VLAX, a 25-year-old Spanish company, made the AI jump. They became AI relevant. They had the time. Got it. They got it done. And now now they're worth something again. Harvey tried to buy them. Cleo then bought them. They became a hot prop, right? But if your other, if your plain vanilla B2B company hasn't done it by June 30th, I don't think June 30th, 2026 or 20 or right in that bridge note or that Series C7 is going to make it. I probably would vote Harry and Harry down at the uh at the uh at the reserves meeting on that one. But to be clear, what you're saying, which I think is this, what you're saying is there are examples of, you know, pre-GenAI companies being able to move quickly enough to become relevant in the GenAI world. Yeah, I spoke too quickly. This one's amazing that VLAX, founded in 2000 in Barcelona, could become AI relevant today, right? I mean, it's it's impressive, right? At least superficially, it's very impressive. And the interesting thing will be, I mean, and I and I agree with that sometimes. Yeah. And but it gets it, but at the same time, I mean, yeah, we're wrestling. I mean, stepping back rather than pretending certainty, you know, you're wrestling all the time with, can the company that has scale become relevant? In some cases, it can. And then on the other hand, oh, are you better off with the brand new company that's less than two years old that started off, you know, the day after ChatGPT was invented and doesn't know any other world? And, you know, implicitly, Harry, you're implying the latter. You're saying it's just easier to start at ground zero or November 22nd and crank than it is. And Jason's example is the former, I mean, which is someone who was around beforehand and then just successfully inserted themselves into relevance. And I'll admit, I don't have a doctrinarian answer here, and we've seen both work, right? But it is probably one of the big investing questions whenever we look at a deal. It's I mine's pretty simple. It's like, for the vast majority, I want the AI native, except for the exceptional product builder that genuinely is like a Dez trainer. Like I've interviewed the best product builders in the world. Just got Dez is the one of the best of the freaking best. Him and Owen, I think, is so phenomenal at this like transition. And I think the other, but they got it done by June 30th. They got it done. Yeah. So basically, whether it's Intercom from 2008 or VLAX from 2000, they got, they had until June 30th. They got it done. Right. But the ones in our portfolio that haven't really, they're still talking about it. I've I've given up on them. Got it. Like that's, they had their time. Yeah. If if you're not with, yes. If you're still going to the board meeting arguing about you need to do something in AI, just stop going to the board meetings, right? Um, because it's it's no good. You know, he deserves credit as well though, is like Howie at Airtable, like, you know, TBD on whether it works, but like what he's done in terms of like the unbelievable shift in product strategy very, very quickly is impressive. Again, TBD it works, but to the Owen and Dez really burning the boats to make it happen. Bravo, Howie. Yeah, you got to do it. It's bold. Yeah. I mean, I I just know, I I will freely admit to biases, cognitive biases, and I just know that's the board meeting where you get up with a sinking feeling and you're like, you know, for three, four years you thought you had a home run on the existing thing, right? You you you could smell the money, right? And now you're coming in and saying, \"Oh my god, I'm in a $14 billion pre-seed startup and I just want to throw up.\" I mean, I I I, you know, I I just admire the courage of anyone who can, you know, there's a lot of cognitive dissonance for about a day there where you just go home and go, \"Wow, that hurts. That hurts.\" I mean, sorry, not to just just to tie it back into one fun thing. I mean, if if Oracle, Oracle just closed a $30 billion a year deal with uh OpenAI, right? An extra $30 billion. I mean, if Oracle can get AI native by June 30th and you're and your portfolio startup can't, I mean, I I'll smile, but I'd give up. If if Oracle can do it, founded in 1972, they could become AI native-ish, right? And you can't. You're still working on it. Like you're still your your team's still arguing, right? You're not sure about hallucinations. Like you're making fun of the of of uh what's what's Fixer? Is that what it's called? They're making that's not real. That's stupid. Those emails don't really work. If that you're doing that, what Oracle, Oracle, 0 to 50 million in 12 months. Oracle went and closed $30 billion with with OpenAI. $30 billion a year. A year. Larry got it. Larry got the message, didn't he? Yes. I mean, I I'll say yes. And yes, he did. Right. And you know what one version of the message is, he stopped brilliantly buying his stock back with his free cash flow and instead spent it on Nvidia GPUs. Um, but it seems to have worked because it's converted into cloud business for Oracle. But he did it as early as Intercom and earlier than Airtable. Like he did he went all in, right? He did go all in. And it's so funny if you look at the P&L, I mean, in the P&L, it barely shows cuz, you know, cloud and PaaS is only a small percentage of the total revenues, and within that, AI is an even smaller percentage. It totally shows up in the capex budget cuz all the money is going out. So it's he's got this, it's amazing. It's got this wonderful upside-down AI business inside a wildly profitable old-school business. But you're right, Jason. A, the market loves it because the market thinks it's leaning in. And B, if he can get this kind of revenue and the, and I'm going to say the sentence here in Debbie Downer fashion, and the investment boom in AI continues for three or four more years, then it'll be a great deal. I mean, I'm looking at Oracle's stock price. I This is like the best stock I've ever seen just watching, looking at Yahoo Finance or Google Finance. Absolutely. This is this is a dream stock. Do you know what I also found interesting? I was actually reading this morning before this Surge AI, which is a Scale competitor, is now raising first-time money at a billion dollars at a $15 billion valuation. We had Gar on from Handshake who said literally he's staying up night and day. You know, I'm in McCord, which is absolutely crushing. Uh, reportedly raised a new round. Who knows? Um, and there there's a tailwind who's picking up the business of Scale? Does the Scale acquisition create an unbelievable net new economy for these businesses? An influx of cash, do you think? Setting a benchmark. Short answer, yes. I mean, Jason said it last time, which is, you know, which was literally the week or two, I think day or two after the deal was announced. It's the remaining asset is an empty husk. Now, maybe we're wrong. Maybe the new CEO figures out what to do with it. But as it looks like all these, I mean, and I think stop Rory, forget forget the end of that sentence. It's a [__] sentence. Two weeks ago, you could maybe have said maybe perhaps the new CEO of Scale AI will be able to figure out what to do with the business and build it back and get relationships with the other LLM companies and continue to sell training data, blah, blah, blah. Since then, the 49% owner of Scale AI has spent their time stealing your best people and offering them gazillion dollar packages. No one from any of the other high kind of cloud providers are going to give Scale AI the time of day. Why would they? They're not going to give them confidential information. Why would they? Right? So, no, there's no business there, which by definition means all the business that was there has just gone to someone else. So I assume a billion dollars in revenue has been allocated out between, you know, touring, um, Surge, McCord, and whomesh and whom ever else got there. Now, again, once that's reallocated, then you're back to kind of equilibrium again, as it were, you know, and then then the bet remains the continued growth.\n\nof capex spend on the AI boom, and that's what all these companies are writing. Just did a billion dollars last year, bootstrapped, right? Or pseudo-bootstrapped. Did everybody know about them except me? Dude, no one knew about them. I didn't know about them. Well, what excuse is there for venture capitalists and technologists to be talking about the 800 million one, just because it raised all the money, not know about the one that did a billion without any outside capital? Shame on everybody for not knowing about a billion-dollar competitor, and everyone talking out of their arse on social media about Scale like they even know what it does. I'm sure you'll find that all the big firms had. I'm willing to bet that the guys at Insight had a call placed Surge once a week for the last three years. I would hope so because all the big. Yeah, once their website is badass. Look at it. It's nothing. This is a good company. Go to go to surgehq.ai. The quality of your data determines the ceiling of your ambitions. That's it. In four paragraphs, we're making so much money. We don't need anything. We don't need anything on our page. Look, and good for them. I mean, remember it's I assume funding genuine comment. I assume what happened here was they had a like all these, they had a small profitable business five or six years ago, and then only seven customers turned up and basically said to them, we're each going to spend 100 million bucks, or you don't need to spend anything on marketing. You only need seven sales reps. It's like, why make a whole bunch of noise? Just put your head down, hire these people, and make some money. I mean, I assume that's what they've been doing, and now that the market. Well, it looks like he's super smart. He was core science at Google Ads at Twitter, research at Facebook, found this in 2020, 20, right? Yeah. And, um, just quietly gets it to a billion. Totally. Dude, that that is the most Thrive Capital benchmark-style website I've ever seen. I mean, look at this. Surge is doing a billion. It has a one-page website which says, \"What made Hemingway extraordinary? His life experiences. War, love, triumph, and loss.\" This is the most badass startup. Let's get him on the pod next week. War, love. Can you track him down, Harry? Dude, I'm I'm going to track him down. I mean, I imagine he only goes by Edwin C, which is badass, too, right? And he goes by Edwin C, founder. He doesn't even say CEO. It doesn't say I'm the COB. And this is his greatest website founder story of all time. Good for him. I I go back to first Twitter. Do your magic. Yeah. He only when you only have seven customers and they're all desperate to spend money with you, you just don't spend a lot of time wasting time doing sales and marketing. Good for him. Listen, there's so many places we could take it. I want to do one more topic before we do a quick fire. Um, we've got LaunchDarkly CEO quitting to be CEO of Asana. We've got Stanford layoffs with the 2.9% endowment tax. We've got Ben saying about 50% of work being done by AI. Where do you guys want to take it before we rack up wrap up with the quick fire? Those are three different choices to be clear. If if there's some mysterious parlor game where I'm meant to have something in common between those three, I just want to put it out. I failed. I don't think. Yeah, listen. I think they're all interesting. We're running out of time. But I do think this quitting is under-discussed. A lot of folks are quitting. A lot of co-CEO, CEO resignations, founder resignations. I mean, quitting LaunchDarkly to go to Asana. I mean, it's weird, man. But like, it's I guess it's okay today after two years. Pause. Why do you think so? For context, LaunchDarkly CEO quits to be CEO of Asana. Asana is obviously a public company. LaunchDarkly is not. Asana is obviously much bigger than LaunchDarkly. Um, so why do you think it's weird, Jason? And how do you think about it? What it means more broadly? It's not weird. It's just the just the turnover everywhere is accelerating. And if it's not, you know, if you're not in the elite of the elite, people are just bailing faster and faster. And the the capital is only going to. Crunchbase did an article this week. There's no such thing as unicorns anymore because forget about AI, only the money goes to 5 billion and up. It's got to be 5 billion-corns. Like 50% of all the unicorn money is north of 5 billion. So, it's either those like even bigger than LaunchDarkly, Asana might not even be worth 5 billion today. Let's look it up. Um, but I bet, I mean, it's probably above the line three billion. Okay. So, it's just it's it's tough. And, uh, it is the the everyone going to join Meta for 100 million is mercenary, and it's just it's the world we are we we're living in, right? And, uh, and at the same time, AI is going to going to lead to a lot of layoffs. I don't think Mark meant to say 50% the way it sounded, but that's what every co talks about behind closed doors of a public company. I I they say, I don't know, I need to reskill 20 to 30% of my people, but they really think I might not even need half. I think there's a lot in that. And let's start with the, you know, the the the turnover comment. There's a lot even there. I do think one thing we're seeing is founders, look, if you signed up for a four to six-year journey and it turns into a 12 or 13-year journey, it's not surprising. But you're see you are seeing people say, this is, you know, this is more than I thought for a whole bunch of reasons. I can't keep doing this. Life reasons, exhaustion, whatever. So we're definitely seeing that as a thing whereby founders are just saying, you know, I maybe I need to get a president, maybe I need to not be the CEO. It's just a lot longer and harder than I think it looked when you, you know, took you know, Dusk and Moskovitz. Yeah, when you took 500k from Y Combinator and said, this is a fun journey. You know, fast forward 10 years, you know, that's probably a third of your working life. And if you're still five years away from an exit, that's half your working life. If it's not your passion, it's almost impossible to keep doing. And even if it is your passion, it gets hard. It gets hard. So we're definitely seeing that. And, you know, we're trying to deal with that in lots of different ways. Sometimes you have to re-incentivize founders, sometimes you have to accept that a transition is appropriate, and then you have to figure out, do you, you know, go through that pain and hassle of finding someone else, or do you actually just say you should look for liquidity for the company? So there's the founder exhaustion thing, and then separately, Jason, you're exactly right. There's this weird kind of, you know, concentration at the top effect, which is by only the winners seem to matter, or the payouts of the winners are becoming so skewed. You know, I saw a tweet that said something like, just go from Instacart to OpenAI to make money. Right. That's exactly right. You just like, I mean, that's what happens when you're in extreme wealth and extreme volatility. Even, you know, even being 10th doesn't look nearly as good as being fifth. And the differences are so stark at the, you know, outer edge of the curve that, you know, you're just seeing all sorts of weird kind of deal hopping and people hopping as you say. I mean, Cursor are raising more money now, and I think it's a reported $28 billion. Just going to your point on like the escape velocity that this 0.01% have being so much more than ever before. Yes. Yeah, probably not. I mean, it said last year, according to Wall Street Journal, record number of CEO departures, right? Um, record or all-time tracked from public companies, and overall 2,221 CEOs quit last year, up 24%. And it it is a little bit. I saw a tweet about it. It is weird. It is a little bit like, you know, someone did the really fun thing about, you know, the Ronaldo post besides some dude that just got hired by Facebook and the book getting 100 million. And it definitely is. First of all, it's Revenge of the Nerds, which on balance I'm good at because no one ever confused me with Ronaldo. But more importantly, they made the point, anything that becomes that high stakes, maybe ends up like that, whereby, you know, are we going to end up like the English soccer, you know, any sporting thing, English like, you know, take the PGA, you know, you win the PGA, you get 5 million bucks. If you're 20th, at 30th, at 50th, then the PGA, you're barely scraping along covering your expenses, right? And that's what it is like in this win or take most economies. And it's interesting, it does feel like this is a stage where, you know, more even than normal, it's a winner or take most world. And that's just really challenging for for venture funds. It's really challenging for to be an entrepreneur if you're not in one of the winner-take-most deals. It's just a weird, weird time. I think what's even more challenging about that for us at the earlier stages when you have that situation arise, the opportunity cost of not being in those winner-take-all deals becomes even higher, and your willingness to pay whatever to get in for your entry price becomes anything, totally. And so your 10 million for a seed for Andre or Insight or any of the others, whatever, who gives a [ __ ], because the opportunity cost of not being in those with the outcome sizes being so much bigger is so much higher. I I I agree and it raises the risk for you. And even at our stages, you know, you can be a perfectly conscientious little seed investor, do your 30 deals per fund, and just not be in the one that matters. And if everything else doesn't matter, then you don't matter, right? Which has all sorts of downstream implications in terms of how should you think about portfolio, how should you think about fund size. It it it's it's quite crazy. We lost a series A actually, um, last 10 days, and it was doing 5 million in ARR, um, and it was, yeah, started at like 225 million. Uh, ended up at 600. Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, eventually it will overshoot, but along the way, it's really hard. Yeah, I agree. We should do some quick fire cuz I'm going to wrap up at what whatever it is 30. Okay, let's do it. Will Elon Musk create a new political party this year? Yes, you get $230 if correct. No, you get $160 if correct. Does it count if it creates a party? And I mean, it's can create a party. The question is, will it poll, right? I mean, you know, lots of. Well, the question is, will he create the party? So, Kalshi Quickfire, will he create the party? I I say no. I think he's just, I mean, I I empathize in a sense. I think he's just too emotional about all this. Yeah. He's just shooting from the hip. He's so upset. And I've been there myself. I have the same flaws, so I get it. But it's not going to happen. He cuz he knows it's not going to work. He's He's so smart. He knows. He knows it's it's impossible. It's impossible to win in the US. It's it's I mean, he knows. From Jason. Rory, I'll go with no because there's not an option that says I don't care, because that's really what I think. I just don't give a damn. Okay. No, you just don't care. Fine. You know this one, Rory. I've been looking forward to. I found this one and I was like, Jason's going to have a banger. Will Rory, founder of Clooney, become a billionaire before 2029? Now, yes gets you $534. That's no gets you $109. Now, my question is, how do you value a paper? Paper, we mean, just to be clear, it doesn't. We can we can get we can cut a little slack for, uh, for our $2 billion friends here. Jason. So, is it worth five billion? Is that the question? By 2029? Yeah. Listen, I think I I think that he's badass smart, but everyone's a little full of [ __ ] in AI and revenue, right? But if if he claimed it was 5 million run rate before Andre invested. Okay, let's put some asterisks and daggers. Could it could it? I think a billion could someone that so 200x that's already a billion, isn't it? Someone might do that deal at a billion. He owns half. So he's worth half a billion already. Let's assume he owns 25%. How many owns? So so this is starting more. This gets more and more plausible the more we work through the math, doesn't it? Wow. If he's really at five growing at this rate and it doesn't it doesn't crater, um, 200, 300x AI deals, um, 2029 seems, uh, you know, we could probably move this to 2028. Wow. I'll see you in. On paper, on paper, on paper, right? Jason's I mean, I would have bet no, but Jason's con. I mean, on paper, by twist say, I mean, I'm not getting 100. I'm getting 100 to 109. I'm basically if I say no, I'm only nine bucks for a win. Is it's barely worth it. But that's a terrible bet if that's the way it works. It's a terrible bet. I just want to be a comm in my heart. I think no. But it's the but I suppose as as I this is proof that the story is, you know, pessimist smart and optimist makes money. I'm going to join Jason in the optimist camp. I'm going to go with yes, despite myself. I'm going to go with yes, too. Boys, this has been fantastic. Rory, thank you so much for for joining us from the holidays. Uh, Jason, thank you so much for putting up with, uh, the late night. Uh, and, uh, Essex coast has never been sunnier. It's raining outside, which is why you don't go to Essex. Nobody. There's so many reasons why you don't go to Essex. But I I put I'm willing to put weather on the top five.",
