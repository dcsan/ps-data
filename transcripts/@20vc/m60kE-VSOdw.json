  "cleanText": "Here's what nobody wants to admit. When LLMs finally work at something, the implementation will be boring as [ __ ]. Harvey isn't some breakthrough in legal AI. It's chat GPT with a law costume. Lovable isn't revolutionalizing code. It's clawed with pretty buttons. Price is the lever for 90% of economic transactions. If you can get a stupid price in the public market that's higher than the stupid price you're getting in the private market, then at the margin most of you should go.\n\nWith all these people leaving, is there any loyalty left in Silicon Valley? This does bother me. Everyone who's getting a billion dollars was in the room when the magic happened. The ability of the US investment banking business to shovel out the door is unparalleled. And the truth is ready to go,\n\n[Music]\n\nguys. My favorite time of the week. What a roster of content we have this week. Now, uh, I was looking at where we're going to start and me and Rory, we were texting saying that this is a good start when it was coming out and it was about Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman and potentially being acquired by Facebook and or Meta. So, I wanted to start there. How did we think about this following the Scale acquisition and how did you guys analyze it?\n\nWell, I think there's a lot in it and we should spend a little time on it. My kind of mental model zooming out is you know why Facebook is doing this, why they're buying. Second question is why these people are selling and what does that say? And then the third and I think also very interesting question is why is it going down this way? In other words, why are people able to extract this kind of value for their labor and how does, for example, California and us being a non-compete state impact that? So lots of things to unpack, but maybe let's start with the first one. So why is it existential to Facebook? And you know, it's just to state what it's not. The idea that they need to do Lama, have an open-source offering and quote unquote compete with anthropic, for example, that's not a thing. It's not going to be a business commensurate with the kind of dollars they're putting out here. So the only logical thing you can be afraid of is some kind of a, yeah, some of the writing has said, some kind of meta meta, no pun intended, model that basically becomes your primary interaction with the internet, with the web, has all memory about you, which is obviously where you know, chachi GPT is going, and it just basically sucks attention minutes away from Facebook. In other words, if they don't build something like that, so I'm interacting with Facebook, I'm interacting with news, I'm interacting also with whatever their version of chat GPT is, the fear is, you know, precious minutes of attention, which means precious minutes of money, goes to Chach GPT, and maybe that's obvious to all the listeners, but it's just worth stepping coming back and saying that's what it is. It's not that they want to open source Lama and make money off it. They won't. It's not that they want to even have an API offering of Lama, something like, you know, a an anthropic offering. That just won't be big. The only thing that makes sense here is if you think that the minutes that people spend on Facebook will become minutes they spend on chat GPT and you can't let that happen as Facebook. And once you perceive it like that, you go kind of maybe. And if that's going to happen, you got to do something about it. So that's the first thing. Then the second thing is you just look at and go, in one cynical sense, you know, the Oculus acquisition was awful. It was like you spent two billion, which wasn't that bad, and then you spend another 60 billion on top of it, which is pretty dreadful, and you didn't get much. But it just indicates this is someone who's going to make damn sure that he is not deplatformed. He is not relevant in the next platform. So they bought 60 billion of insurance with virtual reality. It covered him for two or three years. They didn't need it because the flood didn't come and they're buying another 60 billion worth of insurance off, um, you know, by doing what they're doing in LLMs and maybe the flood doesn't come and it never matters. Maybe the flood comes and they can kind of ride it out when you look at it like that in the context of, as I said, the VR spend of 60 billion, it's like, yeah, I get it.\n\nI'll tell you my my rough guess, just thinking it, thinking through it a little bit more, um, you know, Meta, as we as we do this, is has a $1.8 trillion market cap. My my guess is it's it's fairly simple. Uh, Zuck's put 100 billion to this, hundred billion to to catching up to maintaining a dominance, and that's the budget. The budget can't is probably can't be 1.8 trillion.\n\nThat would be high for, I mean, it is possible to to sustain that dilution. There are deals like that. But in all seriousness, that's when you look when you look at Scale, when you look at looking to buy everybody for 20 billion, right? Perplexity on it kind of ties to having a hundred billion dollar quick M&A budget to get back on track. It's 8% I think if I'm doing my math right, right? It doesn't seem outrageous when you think about spending a quick hundred billion, 8% to get back on track. And just to say it on that, you know, I can simultaneously believe it's totally a bad idea and it won't work and it's totally a good idea to do it just in case it might, which is the really zany thing about it. I mean, I really, you know, I didn't buy into Oculus and I definitely don't, I'm not as convinced you need to spend this money and the way you're spending it will be successful, but I totally get it. When you're the CEO, when there's a limited number of buttons to press and you know you want to press a button and the only kind of button that a CEO of a 1 trillion dollar company presses is big buttons. You don't go to Mark and say we've got an existential risk. Let's spend $2 million cuz that's just not what CEOs do. So there's only a few buttons you can press at that level. There's only a number a few places you can buy this kind of talent and there you go. You know, the um, just to comment it, the uh, uh, Sam Altman quote tweeted this similar web today of I app store downloads and app store obviously is not all of AI and all the world, but it was interesting. It was chat GBT over the last 28 days, 29.5 million downloads, chat GBT, 29.5 million just mobile, that's just its mobile app. Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, and X, 32 million. So chat GBT mobile downloads just about equal to all the social media guys combined.\n\nIt's probably half the answer right there.\n\nYes. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, because the first rule of owning a $1.7 trillion business that spews off a h 100red billion a year is don't blow the hundred billion. Don't lose, don't lose, don't kill the golden goose, you know, and don't let it be killed. Taking the conversation in another direction, I was thinking about, you know, what do all these acquisitions have in common and what makes them interesting and different, right?\n\nBecause if you think back to what happened here, right, everyone who's getting a billion dollars was in the room when the magic happened. And that's the soundbar. Let me tell you what I mean by that. A whole bunch of people tried to do build these LLMs. And the early OpenAI team did it. And everyone who was in that room and knew how to do it went on to build some version of this kind of outcome. You either stayed at OpenAI, you peeled off and went to Atropic, you peeled off and went to say super intelligence, you peeled off and went to Mirror's new company, right? And no one, and for the record, no one in any with the exception of Scali who was selling to them, no one who was in any of the other rooms where the magic didn't happen is ever going to get that kind of money, right? So, you know, I respect people like Coher, I respect people like Adept, the other ones like Inflection, none of them have magic moment money, right? And and it's really interesting if you think about it in a in a that kind of thing happens occasionally in history in industrial history where someone just figures something out that's so damn important that everyone who was in the room when it happened has value just cuz they know and then from there how does that what's interesting is how does that shape out into money and I going to give three examples or maybe four right is that you know when the Chinese figured out how to make silk they basically executed anyone who tried to tell anyone else problems dissolved right if you look at things like William Shockley when they kind of early transistors when anyone tried to u actually let's do Bessemer first, the Bessemer steel process when they tried to leave they just litigated their ass out of it there right the great thing about California is we're in a non no compete state if this had happened in a non in a state that allowed massive fiveyear non-competes\n\nall those guys would be sitting at home getting that 300 grand a year salary going I can do this in two.\n\nRight. And one of the amazing things about California, I think one of the strengths is the fact that since the 1870s, it's been really hard and in fact it just got even harder to enforce non-competes. So all these people were able to leave, rely on the doctrine of inevitable disclosure, go set up their new company and again not copying the past, but they know how to make the magic. And that's the aha here, right? It's just super interesting that they literally if you were in that room, one of those 20 or 30 people in California, you can go away and effectively you're selling that knowledge that you have that no one else does.\n\nDoes that not lead to the commoditization of magic then in a world where that some relative commoditization? You're exactly right. It would be better if there was only one, but it doesn't lead to everybody having it because it turns out the price of buying it is a couple of billion bucks, right? But yes, there's no doubt there is leeching of knowledge out. And as I say, if you look at all those examples, Shockly when a transistor, the Bessemer steel process, everyone's always trying to stop the magic getting out so they can extract monopoly profits. But if but over time it gets out. There's layers of talent acquisition value, which is your scales with your 14 billion and your N and Daniel and your mirrors. But, you know, Sam was on, you know, Jack's podcast and he said that um basically that OpenAI's talent has been offered several hundred mill$und00 million offers by Meta several times. And so, I guess that's the next layer of talent where maybe they haven't seen the magic, but they've been in the building when the magic was there, I guess. And I saw something very cynical that said, and if it is, it's even more impressive. Someone made the point. This could be total jiu-jitsu cuz if you're not getting offered 100 million now for if if if Meta calls you and you're down the hall in Open AI and they offer you a lousy 30 million bucks, now you're insulted, right? Maybe he's just messing with their heads. And the other thing is it's going to be really hard to be the VP of HR in charge of the meta, you the meta LLM project because, you know, if you're sitting there on your 2 million bucks a year thinking you're killing it and then suddenly you discover the new guy's getting 50 again, your head's going to hurt, right? So I don't know how much of that is just very clever disinformation, but at some level you're right. Intuitively, if you it it gets back to the same thing. If you know how to cook this stuff, if you know how to make this magic, you have value. And in California, it's very hard to stop you from monetizing that value.\n\nHarry, how much money would it take for you to dump all your 20 VCLPs and your listeners and go join Meta?\n\nGenuinely, like, I really wouldn't. I wouldn't know what to do. I hate working for someone else. I get great discomfort from being in large companies. I have enough money now where I can do what I want. I'm really happy for one of the first times in my life, honestly, without being sppy. Like, I'm in a really good place. I would be miserable doing that. I got I mark just give me a number.\n\nA billion.\n\nWe'll go running together. Okay. Done. Done. Email your LPs. Tell them tough tough tough malarkey that they just gave you the latest 450 million and show up. You do have to spend four days a week in the Meta office in Menllo Park, but there's great running on the trail on the peninsula. You haven't done these runs. They're great. It's a billy. Invest over five years. And we'll just give their your LPs back their money with a nice spoiler spoiler alert that no one knows. I was offered in the last year $75 million for 20VC media company.\n\nYeah.\n\nOf which I own 100% of it. And I went for a walk with my mother and I said, &quot;What should I do?&quot; And she said, &quot;What would you do tomorrow if you sold?&quot; And I said, I'd start the 19minute VC.\n\nAnd she looked at me and she said, I don't think you should sell if that's what you choose to do with the next day. She's exactly right because now moms are always wrong in this.\n\nIt Well, I'm not going to They give you this great advice from the heart and the soul, but they they kind of sometimes they miss how the stitching works together in the venture industry and the LPs and the holdbacks and whether you have to work for better for four years. The moms are sort of they're directionally correct in the heart, but but sometimes they miss the details in these deals.\n\nIt it depends on how much you have. The marginal utility of the first dollar versus the $75 million is very different. So a lot of it depends on your personal position. That's super clear. But also to be fair, you got to I mean I would imagine in some cases part of the attraction has to be because none of these folks need that kind of money is the ability question, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nnew ability to play. I mean, I don't think it would be more fun running um 20 VC in a media in for Rupert Murdoch. It might be more fun running a AI project for Meta when you literally are told spend 100 billion to make it happen. Whenever we sell companies and their CEOs, and Jason can smile at this, and they sell and they go\n\n\nThey join a bigger company and they sign up for a year, I put a little note in my calendar after about three months to check in, cuz they'll need some therapy, right? I remember one of the guys said to me, \"I've accomplished my day at 9:07, and then the rest of my morning is just about not getting into trouble by saying stuff.\" Right? It's just a very different gig. But that depends on what you need to do.\n\nIs there any loyalty left in Silicon Valley with all these people leaving? I do. This does bother me. Where's the loyalty to your LPs, to dumping your LPs? Where's the... Where's the loy? I mean, I can think of a lot of folks in tech that we look up to that dump their LPs, that quit their unicorn to go into venture or other deals. I get the rationality of it. Quit their fund to go work for Meta. At least um, Alexander from Scale gave his VCs back $15 billion. Like, at least he did that. He did it right. Right. But people just leaving ship. There's no... I... that's what I really... I find a little gross about all this is um, and maybe loyalty is dead. I mean, it's great that everyone on Open AI that was a founder, except I guess uh, Greg and Sam are gone running their own competitors, but it... it... there's also something about it. I don't... maybe it's Sam's fault, but I don't like it. I don't like everyone dropping, leaving everything.\n\nNow, now you're sounding like Bill Shockley or whoever it was when he... Fairchild, you know, just... Yeah. Mr. Fairchild guy, like uh... but if Alexander Wang's highest and best use is as a senior employee at Meta, then isn't it wonderful that the free market system was able to pay everyone else $15 billion? All power to Excel, who probably booked a $2 billion gain here. If that's disloyalty, any of my CEOs who want to be disloyal to me and give me $2 billion, I'm in, baby. Right. So I... I... I think the system work. I mean, yeah, right. It's different sometimes.\n\nI hear you. It's just when that lots of money goes through the system, stuff happens. Um, relationships become hyper transactional, and maybe that's okay. Maybe it's okay. It just creates really interesting expectations between VCs and founders and founders and management. Like I... there's a new vibe... like there's very much a vibe of just, you know, take 5, 10, 15, 20 million from my investors, don't work out, goodbye, here's the keys, right? That's not how I grew up. As if... if I grew up that way as a founder, I mean, Rory, you saw my space grow up. My... my investors would have made nothing. If I could have left the keys on on the table, there would have been two or three times I would have just said, here you go to my VCs, enjoy... enjoy running... enjoy running my e-signature company.\n\nTotally. Um, I think, you know, years ago, someone sent an... a VC actually was a one of the founders of Charles River said, you know, some... he said, you always got to play the game by the current rules, right? And you know, there was a time when you money capital was scarce, and you know, you're right, you had an... it paid you to have an obligation to your investors, cuz you know, you weren't going to get more, and it was get rich slow anyway. You know, SaaS is a compounding business. The truth now is, we're in the exact opposite of that. We're in a... you'll know... you... you know, I think a lot of these things, once it starts to hunt, you make a lot, and if it's not hunting, you don't... I think when people are making lots of money, the institutional glues get a lot weaker. It's just the nature of the beast. And you might... There's no point... get... I mean, there's no point getting frustrated about it. Just play the current game.\n\nGuys, speaking of playing the current game, there was Harvey raising at a $5 billion valuation, $300 million. This really stood out to me as a round. Um, how did you guys analyze it? How did you guys break it down? There's different reports of where revenues are at for them. Uh, but I mean... our best... I don't know what the revenues are actually. I... I... what's... what's our best guess based on uh, Scuttlebutt? But... I think... I think they're at an end of year of 100... end of this year.\n\nYeah. Yes. Coming. I guess... I guess the growth rate's more important, right? But... but so they're... they're approaching 50 or something. So 100x ARR, growing not quite at uh, replet rates though.\n\nNo, but pretty fast. Hold on. Let me clearly says 30 million. All right. He's got his cheat off. I love it. I'll tell you why. To me, it's super impressive in a way, right? Is like, I don't know, like, I know a little bit about the space. I... I know a little bit about the legal needs. I know how... I know about the legacy players. I... I... I didn't... I never met the Harvey team, but I... I talked with a lot of founders doing similar things. And my problem was all the apps were great. If you run a set of legal documents through OpenAI and then ask it to analyze the terms and conditions of a 300-page legal document, okay, if you ask it to research the current status of California, you know, uh, whatever it is, uh, you know, no auto-renew, whatever that law is, like it's great. Like, and so every... a legal AI app that pitched, I saw a demo. I'm like, Mike, they're all great. They're all curing cancer.\n\nSo kudos to the VCs, because if I'd met Harvey at the seed stage, I would have said, \"This is great.\" But I don't know that I could have told the difference from the 11 other ones that were doing this amazingly as... essentially, I hate the term, but as rappers. I think they did some things really well, right? And I think the thing they did really well is, yes, there's a bunch of people doing it, but they... they started off... they grabbed hold of Open AI. They became the deemed winner in terms of Silicon Valley presence and in terms of lawyer perception. Frankly, long before the product was there, they did what... going back to the current game, they played the... they established what I think of as kind of intellectual mind share as being the lawyer's choice super early when the product was still mediocre. We looked at... we didn't look at them. We looked at some other companies in the space, and we did references with the Harvey customer, and the reference was some version of the following. But my partnership has said, we need to do something in AI. These guys have a big story. I'm giving them a million bucks. It's not doing that much for me now, but I have to have an answer. And I have faith that they're on the right journey. Right? They marketed this thing as a limited number of customers. They made it scarce, and they signed some early customers, Allen Overy and... and uh, I think one actually the accounting firms, and they got this kind of stampede effect going, right? Which was brilliant, right? I think the product frankly lagged that. But over the last couple of years, they have filled in behind it. They have, you know, in kind of classic crossing the chasm more, you know, like you... you... that old Jeffrey Moore analogy of the tornado, they claimed the space, followed up with the engineering, and now they have a compelling product. They claim to have 300 of the uh, I think law 500 or law 10,000, but they did it early. They... they... they thought bigger than some of the other people in the space who thought it was just, you know, knock down deal by deal, do good work, be earnest, make good product. Those guys are like, \"No, make noise, freeze the market, declare yourself the winner, you know, details to follow.\" And they pulled it off.\n\nIf you're doing this at $5 billion, what are you underwriting this to on an outcome scenario plan? I mean, obviously the album's going to give you the bland at least a 3x with upside to five, cuz that's the correct answer. But obviously your real question is, can this be that kind of outcome? And you know, I think there's only... so let's talk about that. Most legal software doesn't have outcomes anything like that, because most legal software, you know, there's roughly a million lawyers, and we joke, but a million is actually not a lot of anything. If they... Yeah. A,000 bucks gives you a billion dollar TAM, 2,000 bucks. It's not a huge market traditionally outside of litigation. Outside of litigation, it's not a huge... So, it's not a huge market if you're selling kind of software-like stuff. But fun fact, I mean, there's two... there's two escalators of value. The first is this. For every dollar lawyers spend on um, software, they spend $5 on West Law or Thomson Reuters for actual legal information. Used to be those old books when you see kind of lawyers of the 1960s. Now it's obviously online, but in data and information is 5x the spend of software, right? That's the first kind of argument. And then the second argument for an even bigger TAM is, obviously, you make some kind of army... we can charge a lot more even than Weslaw because we literally eat the work. We replace the lawyer, so you can get paid as if you're a lawyer. So all that is to say is, you can't get the the kind of outcome you need to make this work if you see it as just another piece of legal software. The math doesn't work. If you see it as an adjunct to your research tool, that gets you closer, but you probably literally have to believe it's doing some of the work to make the TAM map work.\n\nI agree, and I think it goes back to a question that you said before, Rory, which I think was one of the best statements that we've said in the last few episodes, which is, are we going to see AI software providers be able to eat human labor budgets? And if so, then we have the holy grail, and we're all going to do very well. If not, then we're overpaying.\n\nYou know, it's just on the Harvey stride. It was interesting hearing Rory... Rory's thoughts. Um, I did meet a little while ago with a legal startup doing something very different, but... but essentially tapping into... I mean, same buyers, right? And they quickly got to 20 million in ARR uh, on very little funding, and um, ROI was super high what they were doing with AI. It was super high, but um, it didn't really do all that much AI, and I... the point was, um, it was not... and lawyers are, you know, the IQ is probably the second highest behind engineers, but that the... the sophistication of the purchase was not particularly high, right? It was to improve lawyer productivity, right? It worked, but the quality of the AI was limited, right? So that it's a question, you know, some of these when we look at the replet versus uh, all these wars versus lovable. There's a lot of equality war there. I don't know if it's possible to have a quality war in the Harvey space. I just don't know. I don't know if lawyers have enough time to switch between 11 tools, dig in and see which one analyzed state law conflicts between Georgia and Alabama properly. Right. Maybe they do, but I don't think so.\n\nI think you're right at a high level, you know, for the case law stuff, it's the same for everybody. So, it is the best tool. I think part of the value proposition from someone like a Harvey is they'll say, we'll integrate with your per internal information. So [ __ ] picking just as a sample lawyer, it's not just, you know, the fact the case law that they bring to the table, but obviously we rag and we call through all your internal stuff, and we can bring that to the table as well, and... that's so easy.\n\nRory... agreed, but it's... our AI has raged 20 million pieces of SaaS content. It took a day. It literally... it took six hours to to to input 20 mill to rag 20 million words of content. But you... you haven't lived the dream of having sold that software to a law firm where, you know, if you look at their... if you look at the typical document management software that these firms have, it's 20 years old. It's company like I manage. So there just does appear to be a high propensity to stick with even mediocre software. So my guess is getting in the door here, like you're frankly a ruthless try of new software, Jason. You will dump yesterday for today, and you'll dump today for tomorrow in a heartbeat, and you're one person running your own business. If you're selling to a partnership where remember everyone's your boss and no one's your boss, you have 200, you know, high attitude, pain in the ass lawyers. You get them... Imagine a VC firm like that. I can't imagine. Um, you get them up and running on this system. You know, two years later, there's a better product. You don't need the heartache because it takes, you know, you talk to them about their use of West Law. They've been using that thing for 40 years, and they're like, I'm dying with this boolean search here. So I think there's a real institution. I think getting in the door and locking in those customers has value. So it's clearly going to be a valuable company. I think the question to Harry's point earlier, the only question left on Harvey is market size. Market size and market composition shakeout. There's Lorra as well, who's doing phenomenally well. I mean, they're the European counterpart, but I did... I did references on them. They're... they're beating Harvey in a lot of cases. Uh, a lot of cases. And then, you know, we invested in Solve, which is a vertical application for patent uh, creation, editing, submission, I think, and Crosby, which is next on our list. Crosby law firm backed by Sequoia... by Sequoia. Exactly. The ones... the ones who did Harvey... like, yes, the TAM, but the TAM is getting unbundled and unbundled and unbundled that actually it's not the TAM you think it is.\n\nI know you're moving on. I do think the meta question for Harvey, cuz let's... I mean, Harvey is still a B2B application at the end of the day, right? I... I don't mean to roll back Harry, but will there be enough 50 billion to 100 billion plus B2B companies in the age of AI to justify these investments, right? Enough... and... and... and maybe the math ties to it, right? Um, but there aren't enough 50 to 100 billion plus B2B public companies today to justify these deals.\n\nI agree. If it is software, even... I mean, give... let's just go for a simple, humble 3x X 15 billion. If it's just software, it probably doesn't, and you know, and trades it seven times in the end, you know, when things get normalized, it's a $2 billion thing. You don't get there on the TAM, so you...\n\n\n're right. It's if it's all just illegal software, you don't get there on the TAM. If it's legal, eat the work, then you know it's two orders of magnitude larger. So that's the question: does it eat the work, and then do you get paid when it eats the work? Which is actually, we, when we last did this, how we didn't talk about that. There's two separate things: does your software automate what people used to do, and if it does, then at least value is being created. But then the second problem you have is if there's three people competing for the same, making the same kind of software, then the law firm gets the value. Like, we don't get paid. Excel doesn't charge 60 grand a year because they replaced an analyst. It charges 60 bucks because that's what you get for Excel, right? So can they replace labor and keep the value? And that's the question for Jav.\n\nAnd the interesting thing, segueing to Crosby, is obviously just for everyone, that's a company that, as you say, Sequoia, one of the successful backers of Harvey, also backed. That's a company that is effectively using AI to offer, quote, a better, more efficient law firm. They are, as it were, using technology to eat their own work, and obviously the value prop is they'll offer a better product to their customers while at the same time presumably be more efficient. That's the bet, at least. I don't know.\n\nYeah, I already done.\n\nOh, good. Tell me more.\n\nWell, all the legal work I do both for the fund and for SaaS Inc., everything I run through my AI and Claude, and then I run it by my council to see if it's correct.\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, I'll give you an example.\n\nHow many time How many times is it not correct versus correct?\n\nNever. It's always right. It's because the stuff I'm asking. It's not that hard if you've indexed the entire world's internet's knowledge. So, for example, like I never read my LP agreements. I mean, they're like a thousand pages long, right? But for the first time ever, I had an LP that wanted to transfer to a third party. I didn't know how it worked. I had two options. I could send it to my old council who charges $3,000 an hour.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd would give me a grumpy answer in 3 weeks. And then I'd say, \"Well, can we get on a phone and talk about it?\" And he wouldn't get on the phone. Okay. I have new counsel now. Or I just threw it into Claude. And Claude analyzed all the documents and it gave me the all the correct answers. I talked about different scenarios how the LP would want to transfer. I said, \"Write this up in a short memo for me. I shared it with my council.\" A couple days later, he read the docs. He's like, \"That's absolutely correct.\" Right? Again, again, again, all the all the documents. And it's so what I need is a law firm work at the pace of AI today. I'm not working at the 2021 pace where we worked 18 hours a week and had three jobs. I need the answer, my legal answer in seconds. And then my law firm in after that can confirm it. Right? I'm at the bleeding edge. But I just love these are the lawyers I have today. I've rebooted my legal team for folks that can review my AI answers rather than the other way around.\n\nSo I, I, I buy that, right? In the sense of there's a whole bunch of things like vendor management contracts, NDAs where review should be 90% AI, 10% human check if there's exceptions and therefore it can be instantaneous unless there's an exception and therefore and the next sentence is and therefore you'll be damned if you're paying a,000 bucks for it. And I totally think that's a thing, right? And I think there are law and we've seen not just them, Crosby, but other firms specializing in NDA review and you know, very typical documents in a way, interestingly, that wasn't doable to state the obvious 10 years before. We looked at Law Geeks 10 years ago, they were way ahead of their time and you know, the technology didn't support it, so they weren't able to build a compelling business at the time, but today NDA should be at the margin free. Now the interesting question is how does that manifest itself? Because you know, if all the existing law firms are dumb enough not to get with the program, they'll lose Jason's business because he's going to say, \"I want the flat fee 50 buck review and turnaround time of 15 minutes.\" And and if those firms resist that, then you're right. There's going to be maybe Jay will do it himself, but typically they'll be Crosby, you know, firms like Crosby will be wildly successful because they'll take the business away from the older law firms.\n\nI got to believe though enough of them are just going to get with the program because remember they all now in our new world already have Harvey, right? They've got the guns too, they've got the tools. So I think you could, it'll be interesting to see fast forward 5 years where the incumbents have Harvey or um, the Swedish company, I'm sorry, the name escapes me.\n\nLora, it's hard to keep up with these forward um legal names um but they all the incumbents have, you know, brand new technology that could allow them to do things super fast, but they have business model inertia. And all the new Crosbies are competing for Jason's business and they say, \"Dude, it's 10 bucks for an NDA, 20 bucks for a vendor agreement, and we only charge real money when you have to do a complex transfer.\" Right? My gut is some of the old guys will be slow, but enough of them will adapt that. I don't know. It'd be interesting to see how much the new guys can build in this space.\n\nThis is exactly my point, though, which is venture is defined by two types of outcomes: one where you drastically underestimate the size of the market and it's so much bigger than you thought it could be, or two, when you actually overestimate the market size and you see it fragmented and unbundled into so many different composite parts that it's actually not as valuable as you thought it was. And I think that is exactly the case here when you look at the, you know, when I was doing the diligence for solve patent creation, there were like 15 competitors as in patent create patent creation in every different legal adjacent. There is the same, and I think it is as fragmented and unbundled as it is, which will actually make it a smaller market than people give credit.\n\nI think it will. I do think there's about five or six legal kind of process specific processes like patent that and immigration that stand on their own, and then I think there will be the general corporate solution for general corporate law which would be the Harvey and Loras. But yes, that even peeling off, you know, you peel off 50,000 patent lawyers, that's gone. You peel off another 50,000 immigration lawyers and then you have even up, you know, 50,000 personal injury lawyers of whom 40,000 live in Texas and, you know, pretty soon that million-dollar legal market is down to half a million dollar kind of core corporate litigators and contract writers. So, you're right. You start unbundling it. I mean, we did the math on lawyers. And look, the truth is, if you're doing plaintiff law, you don't need Harvey. If you're doing patents, you don't need Harvey. But if you're Wilson Sunscini, you need Harvey. If you're Laam, you need Harvey. If you're a mid-tier law firm in, you know, Phoenix and you're a 400 person local firm, you need it. But, you know, you probably have the market, which is why the math only works if you start to eat that work, baby. Otherwise,\n\nyou know what the triggering thing is about the Crosby thing? This, this is the triggering thing. It's the truth is um, it just exposes like how much how much human how much human labor is going to be replaced by AI. We're still learning. The truth is we're still learning, right? But what things like Crosby show is it, it just highlights the mediocre with like a blinding spotlight because if that associate, forget about the senior partner, I'm willing to pay the senior partner whatever the be because there's only two ways to win in services. You have to be the best of the best or hyper respponsive. Everything else is almost worthless. And when that mid mediocre associate takes a week to get back to me and it's wrong and Claude told me the exact answer from my LPAC, like those folks are all going to be out of a job. Like the mediocre, the mediocre and everything. There's no need. It's not just NDAs, Rory. I mean, just Claude alone can review very detailed commercial agreements like, \"Okay, I want to get out of my Salesforce contract. It's a thousand frigin pages long. What are my options?\" CL can give you that answer in five minutes.\n\nYes. It's just a big no. You cannot get out of your Salesforce contract. It's the rules. Um, but I\n\nWhat? Okay, but then what, what if they will they sue me? What are the odds they'll sue me? What happens if they sue me?\n\nJoking aside, you're exactly right. I mean, I think that AI is just going to pound on the efficiency. I remember 30 years ago someone saying, \"Yeah, the internet, the internet ground out commercial inefficiency. They ground out middlemen like travel agents. You anyone who's connecting buyers and sellers and that was their only thing. The internet exposed that.\" Right? This is going to grind down knowledge work mediocrity. Anyone who's just really recycling stuff that's easily known and is just slow and unresponsive. You're exactly right. And you know, it's pretty impressive. And that's the way capitalism works, Rory. When you ask me next time why I'm responding at 1:30 a.m. within a minute's notice, I'll remind you that that to win, you either have to be the best or hyper respponsive. And I am the last.\n\nYes. And we know you can to the former. So you've got no choice, baby.\n\nListen, humility is crucial to everything.\n\nThey both work. They both work.\n\nI mean, vent, if you think venture is a service business, which most people think it either is between 10 and 99% a service business, it holds true, right? I mean, there's someone in your investor syndicate that like, oh, you know, you know, speaks from the top of Sinai, knows everything, and then there's the one that responds to you in 60 seconds and then I don't care about anyone else on my cap table. Totally.\n\nYes, guys. You know, we there's so much doom and gloom every week. We also have new IPOs this week. Navan filed for their IPO. This is going to be a big one. I mean, I think that last valuation, Jason, you'll be able to tell me, but it was like in the $10 billion range. There will be several venture firms here who make a lot of money from this. How did you guys analyze this one going out and filing now at this time?\n\nI mean, IPOs by number are up 62 and a half% this year apparently based on data I saw today, right? And just about every IPO is up and everyone's ready to go today, right? Even when we did this a couple week, we weren't everyone other than Canva doing its tertiary at 40 billion or or whatever or Stripe, everyone else is now planning their IPO. They are just planning it today. This is just too good a start to the year.\n\nWhy wouldn't they?\n\nYeah. Anyone that's got the numbers, anyone that's got the numbers going to go public, right, in the next 12 months, they're all going to go public. Is there a limit to how much the public markets can take so quickly with the stampede that is coming on the supply side? Is there a limit to how much the demand side can ingest? You know, Jason reminded me a while back and in 2021 there was an IPO a day. I think the ability of the US investment banking business to shovel [ __ ] out the door is unparalleled. Right? And the truth is when stock look when someone does circle, we're all very Pavlovian, right? When you do circle at the IPO, when you buy at 31 and you know three months, three weeks later it's trading at seven times that amount. Let me tell you what your little Pavlovian reptile brain says. Do more of that, right? And the next one won't be quite as good and the one after that won't be quite as good again. But as long as it still feels good, you know, those rats will keep pressing the button, right? So, no. Um, it's going to happen for there's not a practical there's not a cash limit. As long as this stuff keeps working and nothing exogenous happens, they'll be able to get deals done.\n\nNon is clearly a top.1% startup, right? There's no question the metrics will prove it out, right? But even say being objective, is it better than say Ramp, right? I mean, I know not a direct competitor. My my meta point is just this. My only have one question: when you have a 0.1% but it's not it's not uh the point, you know, it's you're not sure it is the generational company, how do you know when you to push all the chips in to Harry's point, right? It's e, it's fun to do it, right? I, I've done it twice and I don't know, it's kind of not to that level. It's fun to push all the chips in, but you got to make sure it's at the edge of generational, don't you? That's the Roblox point that uh uh that Altos always makes, right? You got to wait for that Roblox and then push all your chips.\n\nLike is Nvon as good as Roblox? I mean, it's generational, but I mean it's great. Is it as good as Roblox though?\n\nI mean the fundamental point you're saying is, yeah, concentration without absolute excellence, you know, will be get subpar returns. You, you got to be right relative to price, cuz the trick is not just you got to concentrate, but you got to concentrate while the price is still attractive. Cuz remember the other thing it's just worth stating is on the last, you know, five or six IPOs, there's been at least one round that was in the private side that was clearly priced rock. Now, you know, we've seen a bunch of them. I mean, obviously you, we've seen on Charm, you've seen it on Unhinge. Um, I think I don't, I doubt there was a circle round that was priced as high as it's currently trading. So, everyone is golden there. But in general, you know, it's hard to concentrate and it's even harder to concentrate and get the price right. So yeah.\n\n\nWhen you do it and you pull it off, you obviously get a stellar return and, you know, more power to him. Circle today is a $68 billion business, which makes it more valuable than Robinhood and New Bank, just to set some parameters and even more compellingly, more valuable than Coinbase, to whom it gives half of its gross revenue. Will it survive falling interest rates? And is this peak meme stock? Too extreme on both sides. Of course, it will survive falling interest rates. It won't go bankrupt. But there's no doubt that its current model is all about, as someone succinctly described it, letting people give you their money and getting to keep the interest, right? So, if the interest is less, they keep less. It's a far worse business at a 2% money market fund than a 5% money market fund. So, to the extent rates go down, obviously it won't be as compelling. So, that's but it will survive. And then the second thing is, is a peak meme. So I mean, I think there's definitely some element of right deal, right time with all the crypto reform in the House and Senate. It just feels perfectly on point. There's probably a fairly thinish, probably reasonable float actually, because there was some secondary, but it's the kind of stock that can run. It's an N of one. The story makes sense and yeah, it's obviously gotten carried away. I don't for a second think, I don't think anyone believes who's done any kind of math analysis that it's worth 57 times run rate, 50 times run rate revenue. I don't think anyone thinks that. But here's the question I struggle with. Rory, you've got more experience here than me. Forget it. We could talk about, I do believe it's a meme stock and maybe that's the answer to this question. How do you go from June 5th at $83 a share to $231 a share in, uh, in, in two weeks with no news? I would get it if a quarter or two goes by. I would get it if you have a beat or two. I would get it if something radically changed in the, in the crypto market. This is the same company that IPOed, isn't it? Is there any difference between this company that IPOed just a fortnight or two ago? So, first of all, agreed, it's the same company. So therefore, one mitigation comment to the bankers. I think this is the old Hollywood quote, no one knows nothing. You no one knows anything, right? Is that you know, we get, we give people a lot of grief. Oh my god, you priced it at 31 and it opened at 67. You must be dumb, Mr. Banker. Well, we saw it opened at 67, Jason. You did, I did, and Harry did. And now it's 270. Did any of us buy at the end of that first day? We, we left a 5x on the table. No, we didn't. Right. So I think one of the things you have to conclude is some parts of what happened in this kind of thing are fundamentally fairly unknowable. And so to your point, you're right, Jason, nothing's changed. And you do have to say then at some level you probably have some, I mean, I hate the word bubble because you're, you're making a call, but you're definitely having something where people aren't buying it because they think it's worth 57 times revenues. They're buying it because they think somewhere out there someone else thinks it's worth 58 times revenues and maybe they can flip it to the next guy. And that kind of thing always ends badly. So, do I think there'll be a, yeah, significant correction? Yeah, but it's still a great company and a great win. But forget Okay. So, we could argue whether the IPO is mispriced and someone could play the role of Grouchy Bill Gurley who's definitely smarter and more successful than me. Totally. But the last 5 days, it's up 46.4%. What, Rory? What changed the last 46? Forget about making 5x. Harry and I could have just taken our funds, stuck them all four days, 5 days ago and made 46 point, what's the IRR? I can't do the IRR math good if we did 46.9 in 5 days, what's the IRR annualized for that deal? It's awesome. It's a, no, you're exactly right. There's no, I'm going to wait for my portfolio to appreciate. Yeah, no, there's, look, there's no logic. I mean, you just have to say to yourself, these kind of high, there's no logic to it. It's a trading asset and it's all the, I mean, again, it's all the symptoms of what you see in, you know, speculative bubble behavior, which vast price movements in short periods of time for no information. The efficient market hypothesis, people get all mad and say they're really, I mean, you know, they'll say there are no bubbles and you'll go, hm, this looks pretty bubbly to me. You know, I, I, I think, you know, large numbers of small volume, ill-informed traders in a stock where relative to the float, there's not a lot. And you, I have no doubt in my mind that when the other 80% of the stock comes off in 6 months, I don't think it'll be trading at 57 tons revenues. If you're looking at this as the Canva exact team, can you genuinely help me understand why do you delay an IPO? You're looking at Circle being priced, but everyone else, everyone enjoying the fruits of public markets treating them well. Why do you delay? It's a great question because it's actually the only reason to pose the question. Let me tell you what I mean by that. When you have all these things, should you stay or should you go to coin a music phrase on the IPO and you have all the private is great. The real question is, is the cost of capital cheaper in the public than the privates? And for a long time the private has been cheaper. We've been wonderful cost of capital. We give you money provided you get a preference. We leave you alone. We don't bug you. You don't have to do analyst day. We're not really that mean. I mean, some people think we're mean, but compared to, you know, the guys in New York who run hedge funds and and various kinds of funds like that, activist funds, that's the word I couldn't think of. Yeah, we're nice. So, it's been really nice being private. The only thing that's going to change that is not kind of some kind of, I was thinking about it because you'd asked the question two or three weeks back, you know, what would you change in the public markets? And I hadn't a good answer. You know why I live? It's kind of the wrong question. Price is the lever for 90% of economic transactions. If you can get a stupid price in the public market that's higher than the stupid price you're getting in the private markets, then at the margin most of you should go, right? And I think you're right. Maybe not, maybe people have ideological reasons not to. But let me tell you, if you're owning a Bitcoin trading operation, a stable coin operation, you are typing as fast as your little fingers will let you. And there are bankers locked in rooms as we speak doing that because price is how the public market sends a signal to the private market, hey, come on in. Would you not argue that's a relatively, um, naive way to think about going public based on a transitory moment in time of what public markets will price you at? I was with a dinner with a $10 billion public CEO last night who's a friend of mine and he was just moaning about being public. Very simply, it's a transitory moment in time. You will appreciate, depreciate. Who gives a [ __ ] what you went out at? But look, if it's first of all, I'd say it's less naive than reductionist just at being right. And look, you're right there. All the other negatives and positives of being public that are hard to change. My point was at the margin. If you get all the grief of being public and on top of that you get a lower price than the private side and a consistently lower price, then you never bottle. But if you get all the grief of being public and it's still a pain in the ass, but in return you get a liquid stock and a 50, 80% consistently higher price, then the argument is hard to resist. Now you're right, if it's a flash in the pan and it's gone in 2 months, then yeah, then it, then it would be a naive reason to go public. But if on average the capital is cheaper in the public markets, then over time it'll pan out. But if we just go back to Canva though, I just don't get it. It's a very strong consumer brand, very well known with incredibly strong financials that we know of. It's north of 3 billion in ARR. Why would it not go out? They don't have to sell securities. They, they're kicking off cash, which means that they're net buyers of their security employees, not sellers. So they don't need to raise money. I mean, let me give you if the, what's the guy, the, the day center guys backis, coral reef, you go public. I mean, fundamentally, you go public to raise capital. What's odd about some of these companies, they've been private so long and has done so well that they're post needing capital, like they're just kicking off cash. So it's just not an imperative. If Canvas generated enough cash, like you could imagine Canva generating a billion dollars of free cash flow or more a year, maybe a billion and a half, right? It's easy to see, right? They could have 40% uh, uh, free cash flow margins, right? You could, if you have enough secondary interest too, you could just buy everybody out. There's enough cash at a billion and a half a year, you could buy out even all the grow, just about everybody and no one listens to the guys that bought a few shares at the late rounds anymore. But, but forget about that, the Blackbirds and everybody got as much liquidity as they want, right? Returned the fund. If you generate enough cash, what you, you and and and the founders have given most of their, their shares away to, to, to charity. They're not trying to build the buy the biggest, I don't think they're trying to buy the biggest yachts. If you gen, if you could generate 20, 30 billion of free cash flow the next decade. Why go, maybe you don't need to go public at all. Just buy everybody out and pay dividends as founders. Just pay a billion dollars out as common stock dividends a year if the founders own 80% of the common. You most of us could live on 600, 700 million a year in dividends, couldn't we? I think you, I think even you could manage it, Jason. And you know, look, you're right. Is that seriously, it's not, there hasn't been so much, I'm trying to figure out exactly how much has gone in in real time, but it's not so much they can't buy that. I don't think they could buy it all out, it would take too long, but I, I, I get you. I think they raise less than a billion, I think, well, for what, but they might own, if they own 30%, then they need 10 billion, but yeah, it's not crazy. And when we talk about Oracle, possible, when we talk about, unlike a lot of these startups, it is possible to buy them out right. Yeah, if you've got low capital raised and high cash flow margins, you could. I don't think that's the reason. I think that, I think a lot of what they said is they're really trying to focus technically on the AI development because they got a lot of new stuff to build and they just don't need the grief and the distraction and they don't need to do it, which is a perfectly rational reason. All I'm saying is if I, if we were the three of us were running Canva and let's say we're still growing north of 30% or 40% like they are and we sat around, listen guys, we could buy out our last investors at 3x, it may take a few years to get there. They'll make the 3x. Blackbird made 50,000, 500,000x and friends, right? Or or the others. Let's just chill. Let's just pay ourselves a billion dollars a year in dividends like, like the base camp guys do on steroids and let's buy out our guys at 3x when the time comes. And why, why would we want to deal with, like, I don't know a single public CEO that's happy going to Harry's point. I literally don't know. I mean, even the ones, even, you know, the most successful ones, you know, Palantir and Cloudflare are the two most successful public, I, I mean, they're great, but they don't seem happy, do they? Do Matthew and Alex seem like, I, I, they don't just seem like the happiest people on planet Earth. They're driven. Like, mad respect, but I'm not commenting on Matthew. Why? I would have that discussion with three of us. Why don't we buy them out? We've raised less than a billion, right? We can get to 10 billion generating four to five billion of free cash flow a year. It's a legitimate question. I, I, I think if you are post C, strongly cash flow positive such that you don't need to sell shares, in fact, you're a net buyer, um, as you point out, either because you're doing buyback for employees or because you're doing buybacks of founders, then in fact, you're not trying to optimize valuations, so going public might make sense. I think you end up doing it for other reasons. Mass liquidity, including your own, you know, if you're someone like, I mean, but isn't like Larry Ellison kind of doing that in a way? I mean, they just reported he's, he's at 41% ownership of Oracle now. No, that's really funny. He's buying out his shareholders every year with cash flow like we've never seen before, right? Uh, why don't we learn that lesson and do it before, not even bother to IPO? No, that is true. Probably the beauty of being, I mean, first of all, you're right. That's, I think we're, let's talk about that now. I mean, I think that, cuz it's been interesting, cuz for people for background at IPO, I think Larry Ellison owned something like 23% of Oracle. Typically, that goes down over time. He now owns 41% of Oracle, right? What's he done? Every year, he's run that business superbly. It's got 43% operating margins and he's used that cash to buy back shares. He hasn't sold any. So, his ownership has just gone up over time. It's exactly what Jason said. It's a beautiful thing, right now. Really interestingly, two things happened this year. One is the stock really popped 40%. Right? And he got a lot of cloud credit. But the interesting thing is this is the year he actually abandoned the buyback strategy cuz this is the first year where instead of taking all that cash and buying shares back, he's taken all that money and put it in capex.\n\n\nYou know, Oracle was not free cash flow positive this year. His own money really. Yes. He put his own money and he said, \"No, we're going to we're going to take this lovely mature cash flow positive software business and join the other crazy people in this capex crazy hyperscaler land.\" So I think the capex budget was, I'm winging it here, something like 30 something billion and effectively were free cash flow negative. So the trick that he used to get to this point is now not happening. But luckily, not luckily for him, it's so clever. He bought when it's cheap for 10 or 15 years, then invests in AI and then gets a 40% stock pop from that investment in AI just when he owns most of the company. You know, it's a thing of beauty and puts him firmly number two richest man in the world, I think, for a period of time. You got to love it. What a strategic mind. Also, he looks phenomenal for his age. Totally. I don't know what he's doing, but someone, whoever his people are, I just I need all of them.\n\nI haven't I haven't told you I'm actually his blood boy. That's why I didn't sell the company. He pays me much more. Yeah, there you go. And I think I totally agree with you guys.\n\n30 billion in 2024 into capex alone instead of buybacks, right? Totally agrees. It's just a totally what's fascinating about it is it's such a different bet at a time when most people in the 80s are getting conservative. If it's like he took the Warren Buffett book, Bible for 15 years and did the cash buyback like Buffett did at the Washington Post and then last year he said, \"Fuck it. I'm 80. I'm just going to double down here and just switch strategies.\" It's just fascinating. If it works, it'll be a legend. Plus, once you buy like a couple Hawaiian islands, I mean, honestly, there's really ran out of things to buy, right? You got to buy a planet. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we talk about yachts. I mean, Larry Ellison owns a big chunk of Hawaii. I mean, there's not much left to buy.\n\nActually, a very famous billionaire told me that once you conquer Earth, there's only one place to go, and it's space, and that's why we have Elon and Bezos. Uh, and so I I always think of that. There's always something, right?\n\nJason, you've mentioned Cles. We have to talk about this company. Um, Jason, why are you a fanboy? I have thoughts, but I want to hear yours first.\n\nI'm a fanboy. Um, if we look at AI for coding, okay, if we look at Replit, 10 to 100 million in 5.5 months, right? Announced yesterday, crazy, right? If we look at Lovable, not far behind, you know, on and on and on, right? Cursor, and like what kind of bums me out is that on the GTM side, on the sales side, I know everyone's made investments in there, they're not as good, they're not as good, they're slow to release features, they don't work that well, they're just not like the sales tools for AI are not as good as the the developer tools for AI. So, what I'm looking for is who's approaching this from a consumer level that has a consumer experience that could work for GTM. And I, you know, there's no one, listen, I love my old sales team. Everyone I work with is great, but overall, the sales reps I talk to for all the products I buy, they're terrible. They don't know their product. They know nothing. They add no value. So, they all need to cheat. All sales reps need to cheat because they don't know anything. And they all need something like Cluey. And I've used there's a limited number of tools in that do this in sales, but they're either not real time, right? Like I'm using Cluey right now, right? Or they're they have an enterprise niche or they're glorified notetakers. This is what every sales team needs. And at will it be Cluey? Maybe not. But once in a while like a Slack or something, you need something to come up from the bottom to disrupt a market instead of coming from the enterprise. And I just don't see sales tools, all we can look at crazy things that are crazy successful like Clay and others, but Clay is like a a six, you know, multi-month deployment period with an agency that you pay 50 grand to, right? I want tools that you can use in five minutes and not I I'm not saying Cluey does all of it today, but I can already see hints of like it's like if it could do like two things today, like we could use it, it would be the cheating tool for sales reps. It needs like two features they could build in a month. That's why I may be an intern. I was invited to be an intern this week. I I may take me a week to get up there, but uh, I you think I'm kidding, but um, there's always I I when I joke, there's always seriousness in it, right, Jason?\n\nYou're taking a way too academic approach to this because the right tact or the right tact or the real question is, are they going too far in their bid to get attention? Posting pictures with strippers on sofas, uh, police cars arresting people outside of parties. I, you know, I thought that at first and when that initial stuff went out, right, I didn't even know it clearly was right when that stuff that we would call inappropriate went out, it seemed crazy, right? And if you look at that social network thing he did along with Andre and fundraising that went like the other stuff went to other folks queuing back to the social network went to me, okay, it went to me, it went to maturing the company just slightly because there's a whole generation of us in B2B. Harry, this is where I I'm a couple clicks older than you. I can't tell you what it was like when I took my team to see that movie. It was generational. Okay, this whole You don't know what it was like when everyone was piling on Zuck telling saying this was a terrible company hoping it might be worth $1 billion today. What is it worth? We started this episode 1.8 trillion, right? And and and it was such a and then and then his point is and his point when he did the interview was like, listen, I want to bring like you guys on Twitter and LinkedIn are like two or three years behind what's going on on Tik Tok and Insta. You're in the middle, Harry, and he's like, I'm going to bring some of that knowledge to the Twitter LinkedIn and I thought that was the social network thing you did. I thought it was a 10. You I know you can laugh. I I I want to come in on this cuz I actually read I don't even know who wrote it because I can't because Notion's got such a shitty UI. I can't figure out the read piece, but I got a piece sent around internally called leverage beta is all you need. The LLM business. It was so clever and it gets back to this cuz there's two separate questions at stake here. One is how much should be stake and how much should be sizzle. You know, how much should be core product versus marketing? And then the which is a general question. And then the second question is, are there certain forms of marketing that are just go too far, which is Cluey, right? And you could argue the Harvey comment I made was, you know, they did marketing. This was such a good piece. I'm going to read out a couple of lines from it. The brutal truth about the LLM business. Here's what nobody wants to admit. When LLMs finally work at something, the implementation will be boring as [ __ ]. Harvey isn't some breakthrough in legal AI. It's chat GPT with a law costume. Lovable isn't revolutionizing code. It's clawed with pretty buttons. So, you have two choices. Option one, wait until the LLM actually works, then scramble to build your chat GPT rapper along with everybody else who just relies the same thing. Option two, start now while the tech is garbage. Lie about how good it is. Burn money on marketing. Claim the territory while everyone else is still laughing at you. This is the leverage B. The companies winning at leverage beta aren't the ones building better products. They're the ones who understood this dynamic first. the reader lying about the present 11x or icon are arbitrating the arbit arbitrageing the obvious Harvey or Lovable. It's a great piece. What he's basically saying is the models are getting better so fast that even if you can't do it now, you will be able to do it in a year from now. So your choices are wait for a year and just complete the course along with everyone else or lie, complete the course now, establish this kind of mental perception of the winner and then collect the check when the time comes. And going back to I said Harvey did that in a high class way cuz I don't think you sell to law firms by hiring strippers, right? I don't just right and you could argue, you never know. Actually, I'm not going to speculate. I'm going to keep this thing high flutin, right? I think clearly is doing it in a different kind of way and as I say, we can discuss reputationally, does that kind of marketing work, but the meta comment of claim the ground with marketing and let the product follow on because it's going get there cuz the models always get better. It was a wy insight for piece and point. I I would give him or her credit if I could just figure out in Notion where the wther is. But there you go.\n\nCle might know what. I I'm going to ask like I let's see who wrote. I'm ask, why didn't you invest in this company?\n\nI didn't get a chance. I would have I wouldn't have invested in the company 3 weeks ago like or whenever Susa did, but I would invest in it right now that I get it, right? I'm I'm not always that fast.\n\nSo, actually to be fair, my partner Paul actually picked this guy out when he was like kicked out of Columbia and cold DM'd him. I get it. Um, so Jason, would you do this on Jason? Would you 15 on 100? Would you do it?\n\nClearly says author is not named. Rory doesn't know and he doesn't have enough data in Notion. Right. Show me that. If if you can show your transcript to clearly though, truly clearly can look it up. Jason, would you do Clearly 15 on 100?\n\nI I could do like five. I don't think I could get to the other 15. That's too much risk. But I might do it. Yeah, I might do it. You might D5 from your fund. Yeah. Yeah, I might do it if if Listen, I'm making the problem. Listen, I get excited about companies in general and then sometimes you meet the founders and it's not what you thought, right? We're all on our own journeys and and there's a probably a good chance what I see in Clue League is not what the team wants to build, right? I mean it it it is started off as a cheating app, but if it is, I I've I just think all the B2B people are so I'm not I don't want to be mean sub subcursor grade that I'm looking this is all I want. I I'll I'll take the risk if someone can build can pull together an S tier team in GTM. I'm in on it for real. They all claim they do and they're just pretty good. We we mentioned I'll tell you afterwards. We mentioned like buying islands and uh being in Hawaii. The thing I just can't get and a lot of my companies are really perplexed by it is the Slack lockdown uh cutting access to it. Can can you just help me understand like will it work? How do we think about what this actually means for Slack moving forward?\n\nYou know all the leaders in B2B, I think most of them are going to clo circle the wagons and become more locked down. They have to be. They have to be. And when you're sitting around the table, especially with a CRO and others who are who are under stress, what does the CRO want to do? Lock it down. Move to move to multi-deade contracts and raise prices. Like that's the strategy when things are stressful. And I think we can argue whether this is a mistake, but but um but I think MCP is an existential threat within 12 months to every B2B company. And so folks are going to lock that stuff down more because you you can lock down your API, but when your MCP server is open, man, it's it's rough. It's rough. And I love what like Zapier is running like a thousand times faster now to become like Zapier Prime because of this. They get it. HubSpot is figuring it out, but they were first, right? And Salesforce, I think most people do what Salesforce is, which is lock the lock the S down. Lock this lock this down.\n\nYeah. Know I I I think funny. That was helpful context, Jason, because you know, my instinctive reaction is no, you can't do this. I I I'm a Salforce customer. If you were telling me I can't integrate in and out and you access my data, I'd be miffed. And then what you did nicely, Jason, is remind me of the you the duplicitus and sly ways that especially the closer you are to having a monopoly, the easier it is to start locking stuff down. And you're exactly right, LinkedIn, obviously. I mean the Epic in the medical record space is notoriously difficult to integrate to. You have to pay fees and all that. So it is interesting that as you get defense as you get big and defensive, you're right. There is this instinct to lock it down. I mean part of me says they won't be able to get away with it that the customers will say look if you're going to do that then the value of Slack goes down so much to me that you can't do that. So my gut and I think you said this to me Jason I was talking to someone is that probably this reverses to some kind of feebased thing which is MCP access to my Slack information is an API is a priced API call. I I don't know if you can get away forever in a horizontal app like Salesforce with a comm with a channel like Slack denying access the denying the customer access to their own content over the medium term. I don't think it stands uh intuitively. I could be wrong and I and you and you did well to remind me of other areas where they do it, but I just think it's a sign of a decaying empire. It's a sign that you can compete on the merits and it's I it's a little bit of a dangerous sign. It It's one of the signs that says this would be a good time for you, Mr.\n\n\nCustomer, to consider your options, right?\nIt's like when PE moves in, price rises are coming.\nThat's why I have the most respect for HubSpot and especially Darmesh for being number one here.\nLike launch day MCP, uh, OpenAI partner, Chatb partner launch day because I think it's a threat to HubSpot.\nI think it's an opportunity.\nOf course, it's an opportunity, right?\nWhich is why they're doing it.\nBut to embrace the threat, right?\nI mean, that's badass.\nThat's the way you do it.\nYou don't, but, uh, yeah, it is, it is a, it is a sign of deteriorating, uh, everything, right?\nAnd, uh, you know, and as Slack deteriorates more and more, like, it becomes less and less this, the, our, our, our sort of our, our, our neural network, it's going to get locked down even more, isn't it?\nYeah.\nIt's hard to imagine a world where you say this is, as you said, this is the neural, this is the means by which we all communicate with each other, but no one can access that information for the use of AI.\nThat's just not a thing, in it's not a sentence that survives.\nSo, we'll say final one.\nI have dinner with Benny off in London in a couple of weeks.\nWhat question should I ask him?\nTaking Jason's theme, this idea of agents, I would say kind and trying to get some data and dialogue around it.\nHow do you measure the efficacy of your of Salesforce agents running on the Salesforce stack?\nAnd how does that compare to third-party agents running on the Salforce Slack stack?\nAre you better because you have the data?\nAre you worse because you're a little behind?\nDo you even objectively measure it?\nRight?\nDo you understand, you know, if you're using your sales agent, how you measure success?\nDo you understand, you know, we're all in, we have a wedgie in the AISDR space, there's a bunch of others.\nHow do you compare to them?\nIf you're in service cloud, how do you compare to all, how does your agent compare to all the independent agents?\nBecause to Jason's point, what would make it go faster?\nIt's really simple.\nIf the resolution rate on ServiceCloud was 20%.\nSo you could only, let's be honest, eliminate 20% of your service center personnel and the resolution rate with some third party product like Decagon, Fain, Sierra is 50 or 60%.\nThen you're going to lose business pretty quickly, and are you measuring that?\nThat's the question I'd ask him, and then I'd want to come to dinner.\nDo you want to come to dinner instead, mate?\nI, I'll have dinner with Jason.\nThat's a really interesting question.\nI'd be too scared.\nI'd be too.\nHe might get mad at me, and then he'd, you know, cut off access to my Slack, and then I'd be screwed.\nRight, we're going to do a Koshi quickfire.\nAs you know, this is like a incredible betting platform which does predictive bets on world outcomes.\nSo, we have, will Open AI accuse Microsoft of antitrust violations this year?\nYes or no?\nAnd the odds are 36%.\nYou always have to state the odds.\nOtherwise, it's just a meaningless 36%, which means if you bet only 30% probability, which means if you bet a 100 bucks and it turns out to happen, you get 246 bucks back.\nThat's what it means, right?\nSo, I take that bet.\nYes.\nAccused, by the way, is a wonderfully vague word.\nAnd will they file a lawsuit and prevail?\nMaybe not.\nBut will Sam throw words out?\nYeah, that two and a half x on a yes, I'd take that chance.\nUh, no chance.\nUm, I, I'll tell you in my, my opinion, 0%.\nI'll tell you why.\nI think he already did.\nThey already did.\nSo, we, I win.\nYeah, I think that's right.\nThey already accused Microsoft of antitrust.\nThey floated it internally.\nThey didn't have.\nYeah, Sam.\nEverything Sam, you know, it took me, I'm a little slow, Harry.\nI'm not as quick as you with Cluey and some of the others.\nIt took me a while to figure out that everything Sam says that seems off the cuff or on the side or a little futuristic, he's very clearly telling you what's going, he's very direct.\nAnd when he says, when you hear that they're thinking about it, he's done it.\nOkay?\nIt's the same as filing.\nI'm not saying literally.\nSo, I already think he's threatened it in a, in a pleasant way.\nAnd so, the question is, does he have to go through on this threat which has already been made?\nAnd I think it will.\nI think it's enough to have said it.\nI don't think Microsoft wants to be sued by any trust.\nSo, I think, uh, it's going to get worked out.\nBy the way, I completely agree.\nI think he's one of the most strategic communicators.\nThe interview he did with Jack, who I love, Jack's great, but like what brilliant timing for the message he wanted to land.\nHe knows the message, which is Meta's poaching for 100 million.\nHe's just put a stagger in the heart of the recruiting campaign of Zuck to take from Open AI.\nBrilliant.\nHe makes it feel like he's just sharing things with you, which he is, right?\nBut I didn't get how clever it is.\nI didn't get how clever his communication strategy is, right?\nIt's as good as, it's the best of anybody, isn't it?\nBeautiful.\nBeautiful.\nOkay, so the next one is, will the US government take control of any AI company or project in, in the, is cut off, but it's in the year of 2025.\nAnd so the odds, 100 bucks gets you 297 back if it's a yes, and a 100 bucks only gets you 125 back if it's a no.\nSo, I still think no.\nI think I just think, you know, um, any, I think the, just the, the push from the folks on the tech side has been very much AI for good, not AI to control it.\nI think all the very active tech people from David Saxs to Andre and Hitz, their approach has not been AI is dangerous.\nIt is entirely corrected, by the way, being in my opinion, AI is wonderful and we should make lots of it right here in America.\nAnd while it's pretty clear that the tech bros don't run the administration, it's pretty clear that the big guy runs the administration.\nMy guess is this is just not important enough for the big guy to give a [ __ ].\nSo, thanks for the money, guys.\nIn this, you can do what you want.\nSo, no, I don't think there's any impetus to say let's seize control of Antropic or something like that.\nNo.\nSo, I would, even though I only get 25 bucks more than I put in, I, I, I would, I take a note.\nI, I don't, I don't know, but I haven't seen, watching what David says, which I think is very careful on the government side, right?\nVery, very careful what he, kudos to him, right?\nI, but I haven't even seen a hint of this, right, from our AI cryptos are, uh, now if he knew it, he wouldn't say it, right?\nI mean, here's where having an ex lawyer, uh, very briefly a long time ago in one of these roles instead of Elon probably helps.\nSaxs knows exactly what to say, but I, I feel like there'd be a hint if this, this were true, given that we're halfway through the year.\nUm, but, um, I don't know.\nAgreed.\nIt's far more likely to see some kind of regulation of Chinese AI companies.\nNot obviously taking control, but some kind of push back there.\nI think that's highly likely, but not us.\nBrief, brief, short detour before the final one.\nSaxs had to divest a load of assets including a load of crypto and also latestage companies.\nDo you think he was hurt or helped by divesting?\nHe divested in a pretty good period to divested a pretty buoyant part of the market.\nI, I think it's hard to look, the markets since then have been down, but then back up.\nYou know, the overall, I mean, just facts, the overall S&P roughly flapped, and so no, not a gain or loss, but crypto up.\nSo it probably cost him money, and again, credit to him.\nYou don't have to like a ton about it to say, you know, he's doing public service.\nHe's, you know, he's sold his assets to do that, and, um, there probably has been a cost to it.\nSo, you know, putting his money where he's mouth.\nI mean, there are famous occasions of people having to divest to join public service and then taking part in administrations that totally shank things up, and as a result, the divestment looks like genius.\nUm, but I don't think that's the case here.\nI think it cost him money, cuz look, look at crypto alone.\nI think since the election, we've run up a little bit, then we dip down a lot for Liberation Day, then we're back to roughly flat.\nIt's been kind of a, a no up.\nFinal one, boys.\nTrump mobile smartphone, will it be released before September?\nThe odds are $100 gets you 716 back on a yes.\n100 only gets you 108 on a no.\nThe man moves at speed, boys.\nWhat do we think?\nIt's impossible.\nThere's no, there have, there's no supply chain evidence of any phone in production.\nThere haven't been any leaks of an actual phone in production.\nUm, and there haven't been any leaks to sites of true product development other than a mockup of a golden phone.\nI thought he was doing a product partnership with AT&T, and he was basically just sticking a Trump sticker on top of a different phone.\nIf it, if he wants it, well, listen, maybe I'm dated, right?\nThe idea, the, the press I saw was launching a phone, right?\nUm, so Cluey quickly researched it for me while we're here in terms of all the supply chain evidence.\nThere's no notice of anything happening.\nIf they're going to put a sticker on the phone, they, I'm sure he could do that yesterday.\nBut, uh, that was a pretty good answer though, wasn't it?\nIt's pretty clear that Jason has, I mean, okay, Jason's actually making.\nHe's put money in, Rory.\nHe's put money in.\nHe's got 5 million in.\nHe's talking the stock.\nBut I will say that was pretty impressive cuz, you know, it's sitting there.\nIt's doing its recording.\nNo, no, I, I get you.\nI have to actually understand what's going on.\nJason just has to be able to read.\nUm, you know, it's really lowering the bar for confidence here, people.\nI barely have to read.\nHe just listens.\nClearly, just listens and watches the screen.\nYeah.\nAnd as long as you can read it back.\nNo, I, that was, that was, that was a win.\nThat was a win.\nAs to the phone, look, I, I'm with Jason.\nThere's no, and if it ships, it's meaningless.\nIt's not a thing.\nI mean, you know, I'm not going to dunk on, you know, the attention span.\nI mean, there's a lot of initiatives in the administration that come and go.\nIt's been a while since we've talked about Greenland, for example.\nLook, this is a week when the administration had a big win.\nLet's just take it at that.\nI don't think the phone is going to be the biggest win.\nI'll make a different comment.\nIf I were Tim Cook and Apple, I would move heaven and earth to even make some kind of phone here, even a small, just to do enough to say we're trying, because I do wonder, I mean, that's a company whose business model, the big sh is so exposed to China risk, and if the solution on the making side is we don't make it in China, we do make it in India, that makes logical sense, but I just worry you could find yourself in the political crosshair, so just even trying to make some phones in America, even just one, would in my view, be a shrewd thing.\nI agree with you, make one, get Trump there.\nGet the picture.\nGet the marketing message.\nMade in America.\nTrump did it.\nPlease hit.\nThat's exactly right.\nMake a little lot of 10,000.\nYou'll sell them for twice the normal price, and you'll discover that Americans won't buy them, and you'll have tried.\nMake a good fade effort.\nGet them off your back.\nBoys, thank you so much for doing this.\nThis episode was brought to you by Clo by Jason.\nActually, Harry's house.\nIt's Marley Boneley.\nWhatever.\nActually, let's just do it at the 20 VC office cuz we can spill out onto the streets and then behind it.\nIt's, that's a great place to have a party, isn't it?\nYou got two floors.\nWhat's the rules on spilling the party out into the streets?\nIs that cool?\nIt is a private.\nIt's a private road, baby.\nAnd guys, given the clearly context, clearly party there tomorrow night.\nEnding with a comment that says, \"Clearly party, no rules is not how I would suggest we end this movie here, guys.\"\n",
