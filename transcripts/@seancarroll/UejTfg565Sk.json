  "cleanText": "Hello everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. I don't know if any of you out there are fans of the web comic Girl Genius. I'm a huge fan of Girl Genius. It's a comic by Phil and Katya Folio, the artists. And it tells a story. It's been going on for years now. So, if you want to like take a weekend off and catch up if you haven't read it, uh there's plenty of material there. And very complicated story with a lot of moving parts. But it's a kind of a steampunk almost medieval setting. So there are dragons and there are swords, but there's also science of a sort, but it's kind of fantasy science. So uh rather than just ordinary scientists, they have mad scientists called Sparks in the comic. And there's a lot of jokes. It's it's a mostly humorfilled web comic. One of the characters, a minor character in Girl Genius, is presented as a mad social scientist. Rather than most of the mad scientists who are, you know, building death rays and flying machines, he's experimenting on people. And even within the comic, they say like you don't meet a lot of mad social scientists. But at one point, uh, there's a place where the mad social scientist is explaining what a soft-hearted guy he is. And as evidence, he says, \"You know, on Christmas time, I sometimes like to take the children that I'm experimenting on out of their container tanks and give them presents for Christmas.\"\n\nAnd the other, you know, the mad scientists are portrayed as pretty um devilish people most of the time. Anyway, the other characters look at him in horror at the idea of children in container tanks and he says, \"Oh, don't worry, not the control group.\" So the joke of course is that if you're a mad social scientist, you have to do experiments on human beings. But then there's other people who you don't experiment on. That's the control group and you just leave them in their container tanks even for Christmas. And the reason I'm telling this extended not especially humorous anecdote is because it's not completely divorced from the reality of being a social scientist. The methodologies that are accessible to you are just different than those that are accessible to physicists or biologists or chemists, right? Where you can literally run trials over and over again changing conditions in whatever ways you want because social scientists have to deal with human beings and human beings actually have some rights. That's certainly not an insuperable barrier. You can do things that uh people volunteer for, psychologists do it all the time, but also you can just study what happens in the world, right? And again, many kinds of science need to do that. If you're an archaeologist or you're a cosmologist for that matter, you're not running experiments over and over again. You don't redo the universe. You just look at the universe and try to figure out what is happening. In a social science like economics, that's the traditional way of doing things. Not running an experiment, but rather just seeing what happens in the world and trying to tease out the patterns. But that methodology is changing a little bit. Economists are increasingly trying to do controlled randomized experiments where they sort of do their best not to induce unwanted correlations between people in one condition and people in the other condition of course in ways that treat the dignity of the individual people as well as they can. So today's guest Ted Miguel is uh an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his specialty is development economics. So he thinks about the economies of relatively poorer countries, right, developing countries, specializing in fact in sub-Saharan Africa, which is some of the poorest countries on the globe. And he does his best as as we'll talk about in the podcast to do sort of methodologically careful analyses running randomized control trials um making method methods and data collection strategies as transparent as open as possible. uh ideally making things reproducible. There is not as as Ted he goes by TED um as he says in the discussion economics does not have as bad of a reproducibility crisis as fields like psychology have been struggling with but there is still some there. So you want to make it possible for other people to run your experiments as well. And what's fascinating about this conversation is he makes a very convincing case that we have actually learned an enormous amount about how to help the most poor countries. It's it's not something where you just have to bash your head against the wall. There are clear strategies where you can intervene. Sometimes as simple as just cash transfers, giving people money, but other times um comp slightly more complicated strategies like curing diseases or building roads or whatever. And ironically, of course, we live in a world now which is somewhat pulling back from the idea of foreign aid and helping other countries just as we are getting better at actually knowing what kinds of interventions can help. Um, as we say in the podcast, hopefully the pendulum will swing back once again and we'll put our knowledge to better use. Um, you know, we live in a world where there are wild disparities of wealth and health and education and conditions of all different sorts. Uh, I think that we in the wealthier parts of the country uh parts of the world rather should do some part to help those in lesser off parts of the world. and we know how to do it. There's no excuse for us really. Uh hopefully we can convince some people to get on that bandwagon.\n\nSo, let's go.\n\n[Music]\n\nEdward Miguel, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.\n\nThanks for having me. I wanted to start just by sort of getting a mindset check about being I guess a developmental economist. Is that a good thing to call you?\n\nYeah, we call it development economist but development economist. Yeah. Yeah.\nDevelopmental would be sounds like childhood development or something like that I guess.\n\nSo you know economics obviously is central to many many things but I think a lot of economists associate with studying like you know um rich people stuff finance uh you know shipping and things like that and and here you are choosing of your own free will to think about places in the world that are less well off economically. So sort of what what drives you to that and what's it like to be that kind of economist?\n\nThere's no doubt uh about what you say and you know certainly at family gatherings you know relatives always want stock tips right because they know I'm an economist and it's like well you don't want my stock tips. Uh but yeah early on for me you I came to economics through international development rather than the other way around. So I was always interested in global inequality. Even when I was a teenager, it fascinated me, you know, why do we live in a world with such uh just intense disparities between rich and poor countries. I think it was kind of heightened for me. Both my parents are immigrants. And so when I got to travel to see my cousins in different parts of the world, they were, you know, a lot poorer than we were growing up. I was growing up in the suburbs of New York City. So, um, that just lit something in me and I was trying to figure out how I could help make progress on those issues. How could I study them? Okay. I was a kid who really liked math and science. I was actually an undergrad at MIT. I studied math at MIT.\n\nUm, but then really discovered economics at MIT. So MIT of course is a science and engineering school, math school, but has an amazing economics department and has for like almost 100 years. And uh I decided to you know apply my um analytical abilities to to try to understand global poverty and inequality. So um that's how I came to it. I do love economics and I think for folks who come at things with you know strong interest in math and stats and modeling. It's a great field because we uh are trying to bring structure to the world. We're trying to come up with general insights and we're doing that formally and quantitatively in a way that I think you know is appealing. You're a physicist so you get it and and a lot of economists come from a math or physics you know background.\n\nUm, but the challenges are complex and human beings are complicated. So, you know, it's not an easy task. The spherical cows are hard to come by in in economics. It's hilarious the extent to which, you know, here on the podcast, I try to have people from a wide variety of fields, and I do, but some huge fraction of them always say, \"But as an undergraduate, I studied math or physics.\"\n\nYeah. I mean, uh, it it was interesting, you know, being at MIT because I felt like there were so many different fields we were studying, but like we were all fluent in math, you know what I mean? Like that was kind of the common that's what we do frame for us. And uh, it gives you, you know, a way of thinking about the world and some analytical approaches that are very useful. And you know I think for us in economics we've um looked around other fields whether it's physics for our kind of formal models or whether it's clinical trials for when we do statistical work and we've tried to bring in those best tools from other fields into economics. So economics ends up being a pretty eclectic pretty broad field and a very like practical field. Uh and and that's one of the things that actually appeals to me about it.\n\nWell, that's great because the next question I wanted to ask about being a development economist was unlike being a theoretical physicist that there's some balancing you have to do between purely understanding the world and trying to make it a better place. And you know, you mentioned that the trying to make it a better place was part of your motivation. Is this an ongoing thing you have to keep balancing?\n\nIt definitely is. And within say my department or any department there are folks that really are kind of lined up along that continuum from more of the basic science to more of the applied work. And you know even in my own work I kind of move back and forth you know along that line because some of the work I've done is more conceptual or methodological.\n\nUm but the bulk of what I'm doing really is applied because I'm driven by these these practical questions of how we can learn about how to improve lives for poor people uh around the world. And the idea is to to bring the best tools and the best methods and then apply them to really important problems. So, you know, I've been working since early in my career on poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, the region of the world with the lowest life expectancy, the most armed conflict, the highest rates of HIV. We can kind of go down the list of challenges. Um, so there's no shortage of big topics for me to to study. And you know early in my career I focused a lot on health impacts of of dealing with tropical disease. More recently I've been focusing on impacts of cash transfers. Yeah. And how um you know targeting cash transfers to poor people may or may not improve their lives. And that's a really big question. There's been a big increase in those kinds of programs by government. So part of the reason we focus on it is it's just such a big public policy question right now.\n\nI think that it's might be a little unfair, but there's at least a stereotype that in math and physics there is um sort of prestige hierarchy where the more abstract thing you work on, the more prestigious it is. Is there anything like that in economics?\n\nThere is. And traditionally it lined up exactly the way you said that the folks who were doing the really hard abstract theory and you know complicated modeling of how markets work in general equilibrium were really the high folks on the totem pole and the folks doing applied work in say development economics like myself were farther down and in fact when I was an undergrad at MIT and I was applying I I went straight through to grad school I applied my senior year to grad school and you know I'd gotten good grades and I was, you know, they my professors thought I could go to a good um grad program. And when I told them my main field was going to be development economics, they said, \"No, you can't write that on your application. That doesn't that's not going to track with your math and and stats skills.\" But no, I I wrote it down. I was like, \"That's what I'm going to do.\" Uh and I ended up going to get my PhD at Harvard. And um that at that time at Harvard, there wasn't even a development economics sequence at Harvard. It was just a small field. I had to go back to MIT where I'd done my undergrad to take development economics graduate classes because it was such a small field and the amazing thing is during my career and I've been in the field you know I've been here at Berkeley 25 years things have changed actually so that that traditional prestige structure has changed and it's even reflected in things like Nobel prizes where over the last decade now several groups of applied researchers uh have gotten the Nobel Prize for contributions that really are you know a combination of you know some new method so there's always some methodological development in there for a Nobel Prize but you know uses of new types of data tackling new problems that's being recognized in the field so I think it's a little more even now in terms of the prestige between the theorists and the applied people well okay I I did want to get that that was very very helpful as sort of a backgrounder uh the other big background question which is almost hilariously over broad is so how's the developing world doing these days uh you know is there some sense sense in which development is is really going on or are there places where we just seem to be stuck?\n\nYeah. So, I I think the popular perception if one were to be on social media or just kind of get the, you know, the kind of vibes in the world today, uh it would be pretty negative. People would think, well, you know, we're stagnating, the world isn't doing well. And sure, there's a million challenges in the world. But if we look at data systematically over the last 30 years, 35 years, 40 years, and look at low-income regions of the world, they've really been transformed. Now, everybody knows the China case. Yeah. China 40 years ago was really poor and now they're a middle- inome country. You know, still way poorer than the US. You know, per capita income in China is like 1/5if of the US, right? So, huge gap still, but you know, it used to be 120th or something. Um but even other parts of the world in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have experienced a lot of economic growth um improved living standards big reductions in infant mortality big improvements in health indicators uh reductions in malnutrition etc. So, you know, objectively the last 30 something years have been really great for international development in a way that I I don't think the popular, you know, uh the man on the street or the person on the street really appreciates. And you know, part of what\n\n\nWhat we do in our field is measure these things.\nSo, like the most basic thing we do as development economists is measure hard things.\nIf you're trying to measure living standards for a subsistence farmer in rural Mali, it's kind of hard.\nBut we've developed tools to do that to measure living standards, and those things, you know, tell the same story as the official government statistics: things have gotten better.\nI mean, maybe talking about those tools would be useful.\nI know that there's a, to me as a scientist, a weird discussion in economics about the role of the empirical side of things.\nUh, you know, in physics, like, of course, the empirical side of things is the point.\nWhereas, like, in economics, there's at least a little debate about it.\nOr maybe the debate is just more about how to do it correctly.\n\nYeah, I think it's both.\nI think, again, traditionally, the folks doing theory, um, yeah, kind of were the, the, the had the most prestige and, and the most influence and did look down on folks that got their hands dirty with data.\nUm, but that's less of a majority view now.\nThere really is a debate about how to do empirical work, how to, you know, how to do the science, how to test things, how to test theory.\nThe big debate in our field is how close should those tests be to theory, and should the tests be like really motivated by economic theory, or should they be a little more theory agnostic?\nThat's really the debate.\nAnd I've been in development economics, you know, in my branch of development economics and in my own career, I've been part of the group that's been a little more skeptical of a lot of the accepted theory because in development economics, a lot of the assumptions of those theories about, you know, how markets work and how, you know, how well markets work and how good information is in the world about how markets work, all those things just don't hold as well.\nSo, we've been a little skeptical about just like applying those theories off the shelf.\nThere's also been the whole what's called behavioral economics revolution, which is like the injection of psychology into economic theory, which has proven really valuable in sort of knocking down some traditional theory.\nSo I've been on this more theory agnostic side, and what we've done is brought the tools of medical trials and randomized control trials into development economics.\nI was very lucky as an undergrad at MIT.\nUh, my adviser, the faculty member I worked closely with, Edward Miguel, was one of the first economists who started doing field experiments and RCTs in Africa.\nAnd I was his undergrad RA coding up, you know, the data entry software and working on the statistics.\nAnd then I went to grad school.\nI continued working with Miguel there as well.\nAnd you know, Michael Kramer won the Nobel Prize with colleagues, um, I guess six years ago for that, uh, for that work.\nSo kind of right at the start, I was part of that view that said, \"Hey, theory is really useful, but let's not get so caught up in the theory that we don't see the world as it is.\nLet's run experiments.\nLet's establish some empirical facts that then can drive the next generation of theory.\"\nThat was really the mentality.\nUm, and it's been an exciting thing to be part of.\nNeither physicists nor philosophers really do randomized control trials.\nSo, uh, why don't you tell us about what exactly that means in the economics context?\nI'm actually more familiar with it probably in the medical context.\n\nYeah, the way we do trials in economics, you know, builds on what's been done in medicine.\nAnd in fact, a lot of the early trials, like the first study that I worked on with Michael Kramer, and this was one of the studies that was cited heavily in the Nobel, um, you know, citation in 2019, was a project to um, improve child health in rural Kenyan schools.\nSo there's a lot of health problems faced by East African kids, but one of them that's really widespread is intestinal worm infections, intestinal parasites like hookworm.\nUh, and in our data, you know, 90-something percent of kids had these infections, but they were super cheap to treat.\nAnd I think this is what attracted us to this intervention as economists, that like, basically, for less than a dollar a year, you can really clear these, you know, worm infections out of kids.\nUm, and worm infections can lead to anemia and growth stunting and weakness, fatigue, etc.\nSo, this seemed like potentially very cost-effective.\nUh, and we worked with a nonprofit and the government of Kenya to roll out a randomized control trial.\nNow, the way it worked was, uh, the nonprofit we worked with had a limited budget.\nThey were going to start in a small number of schools and gradually roll out this school health program.\nAnd what we did is we convinced them, in one of these early, you know, earliest experiments in development economics, we said, \"Hey, why don't you randomize the order of that rollout?\"\nSo, it's very much like a medical trial where some schools were getting these drugs earlier, some later.\nThat was what the rollout was going to look like.\nBut now, because it was randomized, there's no reason to think that the early phase in schools should be any different statistically on average compared to those that got it, you know, a few years later as the rollout happened.\nSo, that was the way it, you know, it worked for us, very much like a medical trial.\nYou have something like a treatment group and a control group, and you can compare outcomes across those groups and get unbiased estimates of the effect of the program.\nAnd you know, we found in that case, and again, that was a program that was launched the summer after my first year of grad school.\nI went to Kenya to set it up in the field, and there was very little research infrastructure in place.\nSo it was a lesson for me in persistence because things didn't really work, and you know, it was hard to get, you know, an internet, there were no internet cafes even in 1997, you know, in Kenya at that time.\nIt was very hard to connect.\nSo we got it done, we set it up, we worked with great partners, and found really interesting stuff.\nSo, you know, first of all, the drugs were very effective.\nWe had, you know, collaborations with health authorities to measure the worm infections.\nThey went down a lot, uh, and kids started going to school a lot more.\nSo it really looked like tropical disease was holding kids back from going to school.\nSo there was a big increase in school attendance.\nUm, and that was, you know, sort of a finding of that first paper.\nThe other thing we found, and this really links to, you know, the medical literature and the broader epidemiological literature, is we were collecting these parasitological surveys on worm infections in the local area, and even people that hadn't gotten the drugs who lived within a few miles of these schools showed big reductions in worm infections because we had broken the cycle of transmission.\nIf you mass treat a school, then they're not infecting other people.\nSo we documented the kind of like first-order direct effects and then the spillover effects, and that approach, we had to develop some new econometric approaches to estimate those spillover effects.\nIt went beyond the simple medical trial treatment versus control group comparisons.\nWe had to put a little more statistical structure on the problem.\nUm, and it was super exciting.\nI mean, for me as a young scholar, you can imagine, and I was working on a project that ended up, you know, kind of being a Nobel Prize-winning project, um, you know, with my adviser Michael Kramer.\nSo very exciting stuff.\nWe built on medical trials, um, and tackled this issue and were able to really document a highly cost-effective intervention.\nSo the economists and the policy makers and the finance ministers cared about it too.\nBut, uh, it's a great story, and I love it.\nBut, you know, I did read about it a little bit before we are doing our interview here, and apparently not everyone agrees with all the conclusions, and there is literally something called the worm wars, which I was unfamiliar with.\nSo I don't know how that escaped my attention.\nYeah, the worm wars.\nSo that was about 10 years ago, uh, that that kind of, you know, broke out.\nI, it's a very interesting, um, thing to be part of when academic debates on statistical models and what the right statistical approach kind of, you know, when that goes, you know, into the mainstream media, it's, it's not our, you know, comfort zone as scientists, like we're used to be debating, you know, certain models, and so in some ways it was very, uh, it was very strange.\nUh, you know, there, I think that, you know, the broader debate about worms is for folks in the global health community, um, you know, worms aren't the most important thing, very understandably, right?\nFolks are dying of HIV, folks are dying of malaria and TB, and there's just like, you know, in sub-Saharan Africa, huge health challenges, and if you were looking at just mortality risk, you know, these worm infections aren't a first-order issue, and I, I, you know, I get that.\nAnd I think as a result, some of the work on worms just automatically gets a lot of pushback where people are like, \"Wait, you're focusing all this attention here and advocating for treating, you know, worms?\nWe should be putting whatever scarce resources we have into something else.\"\nAnd I think our perspective as economists is a little bit different in saying, \"Hey, if you can really treat a kid for 30 cents a year, then for like very little money, you could be mass treating a whole county.\"\nUm, and you know, one of the things that we were able to document, not just in that first study, but we've continued following up this population of thousands of kids in rural Kenya from the early experiment over time, we're still following them up.\nSo now it's 27 years later to look at long-run life outcomes is these kids that got additional years of health treatments when they were like 10 years old.\nIf you look at them in their 30s, they're earning more in the labor market.\nLike there's not just like a short-run education return.\nThere's like a real economic labor market return.\nOn average, they're earning like 10% more.\nSo for 30 cents a year, you know, with that investment, people could be earning, you know, $50 more a year as adults, just like a huge rate of return.\nSo, um, we're not just looking at sort of absolute effects, but just also rate of return, like the rate of return on this is super, uh, super high.\nSo, there were debates about the statistical models used in that early study.\nIn the first paper, I, because I was the one doing the statistical coding, made one coding error as we estimated those spillover effects.\nSo the coding was fine for the direct effects, for the effects within 3 km.\nBut then when I was coding up the spillover effects between 3 to 6 km, I made a coding error.\nI basically capped the number of schools I would consider just, you know, in the code.\nAnd so actually, when you go out to 6 km, the kind of corrected code has standard errors on the estimate, sort of like the degree of uncertainty on the estimate that gets really large.\nSo the worse fundamentally was about folks, and I share that code with them.\nI found the error, corrected it, shared it with other scholars, and they said, \"Well, if you go out to 6 km now, you have like really imprecise estimates, so we don't know if we believe anything.\"\nAnd of course, our response was, \"Wait, we have direct effects, we have effects to 3 km, like those are really precisely estimated, those are meaningful, but yes, we can't really say anything with confidence from 3 to 6 km, those estimates are noisy.\"\nSo again, there was kind of a methodological point that I thought was, um, you know, pretty straightforward, and folks who evaluated the statistical side of the worm wars, I think, more or less, you know, sided with our views, although, you know, you can read about it, but I think because worms were controversial, it just got all this attention that like, \"Wait a minute, these economists are saying we should be focusing on worms, and they're, you know, distracting attention from malaria or something else.\"\nSo anyway, it was an interesting experience as a researcher who's not a media person, um, but, uh, but I think at the end of the day, the there was a scientific debate.\nAnd I think, you know, we kept it, you know, both sides kept it largely professional.\nJust some folks in the media, I think, gave it a lot more attention than it maybe should have gotten.\nLook, there were string wars back in the '90s about super string.\nYou can have wars about anything.\nLike, you're actually spending money and saving lives.\nIt's a higher stakes game.\nBut it is part of the media tension because this kind of thing is at least adjacent to effective altruism and other things that get labeled as movements in the popular imagination.\nFor sure.\nAnd I think the whole our early study on deworming and the follow-up studies showing the rate of return, like we were doing these kinds of effective altruism style calculations and creating those estimates before the term had even been coined.\nAnd I think our work was picked up on by that movement.\nTons of funding from effective altruist organizations has gone literally into deworming programs around the world.\nSo first, first of all, in Kenya, and again, it's been a great part of my career just to see how ideas from research can get translated into action.\nBut because we did this work in Kenya and we did the follow-up work, we were very active in disseminating those findings to policy makers and media and whatnot in Kenya, to the World Bank, to the WHO as well, and the government of Kenya in 2009 put in place a national deworming program with a design of the school-based deworming that was like based on what we had done in our earlier study.\nSo that scaled it up to millions, but then, um, really powered, I think, by effective altruist organizations, um, it was scaled up to other countries.\nYou know, India has had mass campaigns with 100 million kids a year getting treated, you know, Vietnam has had campaigns, Nigeria, you know, Ethiopia, etc.\nSo hundreds of millions of kids per year have been getting these treatments at very low cost, uh, in part because of our work and the work of other scholars.\nSo I do think that it, it, it became like the flagship for the movement, and that did increase media attention for sure.\nAnd again, this study, the kind of original study and the follow-ups were, you know, very heavily cited even in the Nobel announcement, you know, in 2019 for Kramer and co-authors.\nUm, so yeah, we've been in the middle of that media attention, and you know, one of the things I tell my students and the folks in my group here because there has been so much attention on it is like, \"Let's make sure we don't get caught up in all that.\nLike, it, whatever we find in the data is what we find.\nSome effects are going to be significant, some are going to be large, some are going to be small.\nAnd yes, our results are going to be used by policy makers, but we just have to stand by them.\nWe have to believe in them and just keep the scientific ethos front and center and not just become policy ad.\n\n\nAdvocates.\nLike, if I just, if I do new research and the new research shows deworming has harms or deworming doesn't do anything good, I'm going to try to put it out there just as strongly as my first results, and if that changes the policy calculation, great.\nActually, that's a good thing.\nSo, you know, we're trying to keep the science front and center.\nUh, here, I did have Joshua Green from Harvard on the podcast a while back, and uh, he's involved with Give Directly, and I'm pretty sure that I've given money to deworming projects because of that uh involvement.\nSo I've done my little bit of part there.\nBut there's another thing you mentioned, which is the long-term follow-up.\nYou know, speaking about this theme of how to be a good empiricist as uh an economist.\nI, I get the feeling that there is some difficulty associated with doing long-term studies.\nLike there's a feeling that if you do, if you try an intervention and it doesn't pan out, then you give up, and you need to like really think very hard about spending resources on doing something longer term.\nYeah, it is very resource intensive uh to follow people up, especially in settings, you know, low-resource settings like Kenya.\nUm, we have been following up the original deworming sample now, a representative subset of them.\nSo, there's around 6,000 folks we've been following up for 27 years.\nUm, we've gotten funding from many different sources to do it because we, we need to like have, we need to maintain a standing team of enumerators, of surveyors who are going and finding respondents wherever they move.\nWe don't only want to look at the people that just stay in the original study area.\nTurns out once you get 10 or 15 years after the original intervention, about half of them have moved to cities.\nSo we need to like go and find them in Nairobi and find them in Mombasa.\nSome of them move to Uganda.\nSome of them have moved even to, you know, the Gulf States, and we do phone surveys with them.\nSo, you know, there's, there's a whole enterprise there to um, keep in touch with them.\nBut we've managed over 27 years to have an effective survey response rate uh of 83, 84%.\nSo we're very happy with that.\nUh, it's balanced between the treatment and control group.\nSo we're actually able to to speak about the central tendency in the data, you know, in a pretty representative way, following the vast majority of respondents.\nAnd as I mentioned, you know, when you invest in child health, we find short-run effects on health and education, and we find these longer run effects on, for instance, likelihood to move to Nairobi, likelihood of moving to a city, it goes up by about 10%.\nUh, earnings go up around 10% uh in that sample, and people move into different types of occupations.\nThey move out of agriculture into various non-agricultural occupations like manufacturing jobs that are better paid, uh, etc.\nSo by tracing the data over a long period of time, we can see how a health investment can transform people's lives in multiple different ways.\nUm, and it's something that that I'm really proud of.\nIt's taken, you know, again, decades of work to build.\nUm, yeah, and it's hard to do.\nSo not that many randomized control trials or any other studies sort of have had that, you know, ability to follow people over time.\nThey either, either haven't been able to raise the resources to do it, or like you said, maybe they were discouraged by initial results.\nUm, which is a bit unfortunate, but but understandable too, because they have limited time, and they're going to kind of focus on on on big questions where they can maybe find, you know, answers that are that are interesting.\nThe idea of the control group obviously is crucial to everything going on here.\nBut much like in medicine, is there some, you know, feeling, I don't know how to describe the feeling that if you really think the intervention is going to help, do you feel bad about not giving it to some random fraction of the people you're studying?\nYeah, definitely.\nAnd, and I think, you know, for us, you know, the the ethics of it, it's not exactly the same with our interventions in economics as it is in health, but a lot of the same considerations apply, certainly with a deworming intervention, which is a health intervention.\nYou know, we had to go through all the same kind of ethical approvals and and whatnot as any medical trial, you know, would have.\nIn our case, I think the ethics were interesting uh in the following sense.\nAgain, we were working with a nonprofit that was sort of like expanding a health program.\nThe government wasn't doing mass deworming.\nIt wasn't kind of a standard program at that time in the late, in the late 90s, and this nonprofit was just scaling up gradually.\nSo like we, no one was being denied treatment.\nIt was really just a question like, hey, they had identified a region with really high infection rates, and actually you could make the case that randomizing was a pretty fair way to do it, rather than just going to politically connected areas or something first.\nSo, um, you know, in that case with resource scarcity, you know, not everybody was going to get treated, and that's true for a lot of the development economics interventions that we study, that like when you're dealing with, you know, governments or programs that have limited resources, they're not going to be able to treat everybody, and you know, I've worked, as I mentioned briefly before, I've been working on cash transfer interventions with, you know, Give Directly and others, and um, they don't have enough cash to like give cash transfers to all the poor people in Kenya or Tanzania or other countries, like it's just limited.\nThey just, they get donations from people like you and others.\nThey have a budget, and um, and so again, you you might think that a lottery is a fair way to allocate resources.\nOnce you've identified poor folks, it's not clear which of them is more or less deserving.\nUm, but yeah, the the ethical issues are very important.\nWe debate them and talk about them a lot.\nAnd um, you know, uh, the resource scarcity in some ways, um, you know, makes it inevitable that not everybody's going to, that someone's going to be in a control group of some kind.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIs there something in economics that is analogous to the replication crisis that we've seen in psychology and other social sciences?\nThere is, and that's something that that we're um, we're working on here.\nIn fact, I, we're having a conference here today at Berkeley on from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences, BITS, which is an effort to kind of bring open science tools into the social sciences.\nWe have had a replicability crisis.\nIt hasn't been as severe in economics as in psychology.\nI think in social psychology in particular, it's been so high-profile.\nThere have been, you know, real kind of bruising battles in that field.\nSo many instances of fraud and and other things.\nUm, there haven't been as many in economics.\nUm, there's been more consensus since early on in the field around issues of data sharing and and the importance of, you know, um, computational reproduction of our work.\nUm, but we've had our own crisis.\nSo I don't know how much you followed the news, but last week there was a kind of scandal coming out of the MIT economics department where a grad student I did has been accused of of fabricating a whole data set, like a massive data set, uh, which I think purportedly was from a biotech company, um, and you know, claiming that the use of AI tools was accelerating discovery in this company, and then, you know, pretty quickly, you know, based on the description of the company, I think people in that field were like, wait, that could only be three or four companies, which one is it?\nAnd, and, and then it became clear that that it was, it was apparently, it's, it's allegedly fabricated.\nUm, so we have our own crises, and um, you know, there are tools to deal with these things, things like data sharing, uh, just allowing other people to scrutinize your work is important, and this is an area where actually economics is is a bit ahead of medical research in that data sharing and sharing of data, you know, of underlying data sets and survey instruments and whatnot has been a lot slower in the health fields.\nI think there's been a lot of concern about sharing personally identifiable information, PII, in the health field, understandably, um, but you know, sometimes it may be a little bit of a pretext in that field for people who have collected data not to share their data with others so they can write papers.\nI think that's at least, you know, a little bit of a concern.\nIn econ journals have been much more aggressive in forcing authors to post their data, to make replication data public, and um, I'm really proud of that in our field because I think we were ahead of the curve on that, and that's central to science.\nWe can't do science if no one else can scrutinize your work and verify your work.\nIt's just like a basic principle.\nThe irony of the MIT paper was it was supposed to show that AI improved productivity, but it actually showed that AI improved the ability to be fraudulent, to to make up data and things like that, because I remember the old days in physics, you know, people would miss, would reuse a graph of one thing for an entirely different uh claimed result, and and you would be able to eventually figure out that must be faked.\nBut with AI, you can, you can uh fabricate data really well.\nYeah.\nApparently not well enough, I guess.\nNot well enough for this person.\nThankfully, hopefully the AIs don't get so good that in a few years we can't even, can't even detect it.\nUm, yeah.\nNo, I mean, I think this, it's just touching on this other open question of the role that AI will play in our work going forward.\nAnd uh, you know, for the kind of work that we do where we're collecting original data in the field, like there's just going to be a lot of machinery and data generation in our field that will not be automated, that that AI can't do.\nWe have to actually talk to people.\nIt's complicated to measure living standards.\nThere's like ways that we do that kind of measurement.\nUm, but other parts of the research process will change, and um, we're already seeing it.\nI mean, even in this, the conference, this BITS, you know, transparency conference that I'm, I'm at today, um, you know, there's a lot more use of AI in extracting estimates from existing studies for use in meta-analysis, and actually that's a pretty good use of AI tools, like if we get the right training data, um, you know, because our papers have a certain format, and and results are being presented in a certain way, but if we can, you know, get the right kind of, you know, high-quality training data, then, then it could be that the LLMs can go pretty far in in certain forms of data extraction and speed up meta research.\nSo I'm optimistic about certain applications.\nUm, but it's not going to take over all of our research.\nThere's still realms of research where we need to generate original data that that at least for us in development economics, the AIs can't do.\nLet's go back to the issue of the um, the cash transfers in Kenya, because I know that that's been a big project, and and I guess is there a distinction between cash transfers and basic income, or is one just a subset of the other?\nThey're very closely related.\nI think the conception of basic income is it's a kind of ongoing, um, income support over, you know, say multiple years, and and, you know, basic income is a form of cash transfer, but there are also one-time cash transfers, where cash transfers given at different frequency or, you know, with different sizes, so that's right.\nI think cash transfers are kind of the catchall, um, frame for us.\nThe work we started working on about 11 years ago in Kenya with Give Directly was a very large RCT of a one-time cash transfer, but a really big cash transfer.\nSo, in US nominal terms, uh, in 2014, it was $1,000 per household.\nAnd, you know, given the difference in prices between the US and Kenya, where prices tend to be lower there, um, that would be the equivalent in real US dollar terms at the time of closer to $2,000.\nUm, which for Kenyan living standards at that time would be something like 75% of average household income.\nSo a really, I mean, a huge transfer, right?\nLike that'd be the equivalent of giving tens of thousands of dollars to a poor household in the US.\nSo we studied that with Give Directly.\nIt was kind of relatively early days in the cash transfer movement.\nAnd um, the way we designed it, and this is actually, you know, going back to your earlier point about theory.\nThis was actually a an intervention that we very much designed with economic theory in mind.\nSo it was an RCT.\nIt was randomized control trial, but we were very interested in not just understanding the effect on the recipients, but a little bit like the deworming study, understanding those second order effects, the spillover effects on the local economy, and there are models in macroeconomics of what are called multipliers.\nSo, you know, if you put, if you inject money into the economy and people spend it in certain ways, if like they have a very high what we call marginal propensity to consume, like for every dollar they get, they spend most of it, it's just going to generate lots of multipliers in the economy, uh, because, hey, local businesses will get more revenue, and then they'll be able to hire more workers, and then those workers will spend more, etc., etc.\nSo you get this, this kind of multiplier effect, which is well modeled in macroeconomic theory.\nSo we were very interested in those models, and we worked with Give Directly to design a large enough experiment so we could understand multipliers and estimate multipliers, and that was novel at the time because most of the macroeconomic estimates and multipliers are not experimental, and they're not based on RCTs.\nThey're just like, well, the government had a stimulus program, and let's kind of do a time series analysis or a pre-post analysis effectively.\nUm, or in some cases more sophisticated designs, but this was, you know, an experimental design, so it has some more validity.\nUm, and, uh, we put in place this, you know, the data collection to to estimate effects on the local economy and found really big multipliers, much bigger multipliers than you would see, uh, in the US.\nAnd you know, there's good reasons why the marginal propensity to consume in rural Kenya is really high.\nIf you target poor households, we find that in the first year after they get the cash, they spend like 90% of it.\nLike almost none of it's being saved.\nIt's just being spent.\nSo local business revenue goes up.\nThey hire more people.\nLike all those hypothesized things in the models come through in our data.\nUm, and that means the dollars you give to poor folks in say a rural African setting, um, you know, generate more than that dollar in local GDP.\nSo uh, it makes cash transfers targeted to the poor look like a very attractive uh policy.\nIt is a more expensive experiment to run than the deworming.\nIt sounds like much more because, you know, like, like I said, if it's 30 cents per kid, you know, for deworming, this was $1,000 per household.\nIt's a very expensive uh experiment for sure.\nUm, but really big\n\n\nEconomic impacts too.\nSo, um, you know, I think that was the flip side because, you know, in many ways, the cash transfer program I've worked on in Kenya follows the model of deworming study because from the start, we were really interested in doing longer-term tracking of this population.\nWe really wanted to understand not just spillovers in the short run but these kind of like broader long-run effects.\nSo, we've continued data collection.\nNow it's been 11 years.\nWe're still in the field collecting lots of data, and we've been able to track economic effects over time as well as health effects.\nSo, kind of things go full circle here in terms of understanding, you know, causal relationships between income and health and health and income.\nIn my own work, um, what we found with cash transfers in Kenya were really big health effects in particular for children.\nSo, we were able to collect data and get a full birth census of this population in Kenya we were working in, and again, the scale of the cash transfer program in Kenya was very large.\nWe're working in an area with 300,000 people.\nWe collected full birth histories for women around the time the cash was going out, and there just tens of thousands of births in the data set.\nAnd we find that in the year the cash transfer, this big thousand cash transfer was received by households, in that year, infant mortality in recipient areas fell by 40%.\nWow.\nJust a huge infant mortality reduction.\nJust like a massive number.\nAnd, um, we're writing that up now.\nWe're about to finish that analysis.\nSo, um, again, it's a gratifying thing about this work.\nAnd it goes back, you know, early in my career, I could only have dreamed that I'd be able to work on big programs where we were like studying how economic interventions like saved lives and affected lives in this profound way.\nUm, and this seems to be an example.\nCash transfers don't just benefit the local economy; they're like literally saving lives.\nI can see how it would be extraordinarily gratifying.\nI wonder if it's also and there's an element of frustration that we live in a world with so much inequality that a relatively tiny amount of money is lifesaving to so many people.\nYeah, there's no doubt about it.\nAnd again, it goes back to sort of, you know, like if you talk to the person on the street here in the US, it's not clear they understand just exactly how much could be done with a few dollars.\nUm, and it's also not clear that they understand how little we've been spending on foreign aid and these forms of redistribution to poor people.\nSo, you know, there there's some surveys out there where they ask Americans, you know, how much how much do you think America is spending on foreign aid as a share of the government budget, you know, and people say, \"Oh, I think it's, you know, 20%.\"\nI think it's 15%.\nOf course, in truth, and this this is even before what just happened with USA ID, the dismantling of USA ID, it was like, you know, .3 of 1% of the budget or .2 of 1% of the budget was going to foreign aid, so like minuscule amounts, but for those really small amounts, we were having big impacts.\nWe were saving lives with HIV treatments and malaria treatments and cash transfers, and um, and now even that like minuscule amount is being slashed uh by the current administ frustration.\nIt's really unclear what the future holds.\nSo, there's this kind of misunderstanding about what we're doing.\nUh, and there's a misunderstanding about what we can do, and and I think it's frustrating, and and maybe it's a I guess ultimately it's a failure of ours as researchers in communicating what we're doing.\nI mean, we're trying.\nYeah.\nBut somehow we're not getting the traction we need to tell people, hey, if you like don't drink that cup of coffee that's $6 now or $5, you could give deworming drugs to 20 kids.\nYeah.\nLike that's pretty powerful, but people don't know it.\nWell, you're on the podcast.\nYou're doing your part.\nI mean, that's hopefully we'll we'll reach some people.\nI hope we're not Thank you for inviting me.\nHopefully we're not only uh reaching the converted already.\nBut uh in terms of understanding why the effect is so big, um I have this vague feeling that I've read people talking about the the cost of being poor, right?\nLike if you're poor, not only do you not have a lot of money, but you're just hit with all of these fines and fees and things that make it impossible to pull yourself out.\nAnd and I'm guessing hypothesizing that the you know a big one-time uh pile of money will just help release you into the world to do your work.\nExactly.\nAnd that's really what we're we're finding even when we look at these folks who receive cash transfers five or seven years later.\nThey're still doing better partially because of this.\nThey're more likely to have invested in certain types of durable assets like livestock that could pay off over time.\nUm, you know, even very basic things, and you alluded to it, like in shops in rural Kenya, if you're if you're only able to buy small amounts of sugar or small amounts of flour or small amounts of other stuff, the per unit cost is higher.\nLike there really just are fixed costs to doing things, and so having more liquidity uh pays off, and you know, it just it it goes on from there.\nThere's also really, you know, great work in the field of development economics that's bringing in insights from psychology.\nAnd this is this really exciting intersection of of, you know, behavioral economics and psychology which shows that even beyond that, there's just psychological implications of poverty that make it harder to break out of poverty.\nSo, you know, people who are poor uh are really worried about their money, and they're really worried about their kids going hungry, and it can affect decision-m and so people who are just super stressed out about money uh systematically make certain types of errors.\nThey're less productive.\nSo, you know, poverty breeds more poverty.\nAnd again, these, you know, large one-time cash transfers or basic income, anything that can just temporarily lift you out of that state can allow you to make investments that improve your uh your life.\nAnd I think that's one of the powerful things about, you know, the cash transfer model.\nIt's so simple, right?\nIt's like this very pure form of redistribution from folks like you or me who have an extra $100 or $1,000 here or there that we may not even think about or notice missing.\nUh, and that's just transformative for somebody in in a rural African setting.\nThere is maybe like a moral aspect on some side of the things uh that that the simplicity of it gets in the way because people are like, well, how do I know we're giving money to deserving people?\nLike shouldn't we test that we're giving it to the right people?\nAnd you know, my feeling is maybe in the in the ideal world you could target it precisely, but in fact, it's just simpler and more effective just to give everyone money.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd that's that's really been the model of Give Directly and several other programs; they do have targeting criteria that are that are pretty rough, you know, so they're they're looking at, you know, in the early days, like in our project, looking at the the the building materials in someone's home.\nAnd it turns out in our data, the people with like rough building materials who have not as nice homes really are poorer than the people with fancy homes, right?\nThat's true everywhere.\nSo, they can use something that's really cheap and very visible, very easy to observe uh for targeting, and um that cuts out a lot of overhead costs because if you really want to go and carefully measure people's living standards, it's pretty expensive.\nWe have tools to do it, but you may need to go through a 2-hour survey to carefully measure their agricultural production and how many assets they own exactly.\nUm, and you still end up with something very highly correlated with like, you know, how rough is the roofing on your house.\nSo, um, I I'm a fan of that approach because it just means more of every dollar actually gets to people.\nAnd um, you know, there's another aspect of the deserving poor is this question which we often get asked of like, well, are people wasting the money?\nAre they like drinking away the money they get or spending it on gambling or and it's it's impossible to know for sure exactly how everybody spends every dollar?\nThat there have been follow-up surveys like in our study and in just dozens of other cash transfer studies at this point that do in careful ways try to get at how much is being spent on what you might call sin goods or temptation goods like alcohol cigarettes, and you know, across these studies, you know, very small shares are being spent on those things.\nA little bit, like people do buy some alcohol with the money, but in our data, it's less than 1%, so you know, it's something that we can live with, um, and you know, the caricature of of poor folks, you know, wasting this windfall on, you know, booze and and cigarettes and drugs or something.\nI'm sure there's cases where that's true, but it's really not the vast majority of households.\nYou said a provocative thing about uh not only is poverty expensive with all these extra costs, per unit cost, etc., but it also drives people towards making worse decisions about things.\nThat's very interesting, and I I'm glad I learned it.\nBut then you've also worked on other things that that hurt decision-m like the temperature outside, like climate change is making us dumber as well as all sorts of other things to to slightly oversimplify.\nYeah.\nI mean, that that's another branch of my research that's that's really not as as grounded in a lot of these field experiments.\nBut I have another line of research that's been really exciting to work on on climate change and what it's going to do to developing countries, especially in Africa.\nUm, and again, it's part of my overall research focus on African development and poverty.\nWe cannot ignore climate change if we're going to understand the evolution of of living standards in poor countries over the next 20, 30, 40 years.\nUh, one of the things we were able to do is some lab experiments, and we did lab experiments both in Berkeley and in Nairobi, Kenya, seeing how people react to higher temperatures.\nAgain, trying to simulate like, okay, you know, if they're in a warmer environment, uh, we manipulated actually the lab to make some rooms hot and some rooms cold, and we randomize that, and then we measured how do people's economic decisions change, and um, it's it's a kind it was a fun thing to work on, and actually it took like months to figure out how we could regulate the temperature.\nWe actually brought some engineers in to like we had to hide the heaters because we didn't necessarily want everybody to know we were doing this experiment in that way, and that like had temperature, you know, sensors all over the room.\nIt was it was an interesting applied engineering problem.\nBut sorry, this was at Berkeley at the university at Berkeley in the experimental lab here and in Nairobi, Kenya in a lab called the Busousara lab, which um, you know, does uh experimental and and sort of behavioral economics research uh there, and you know, some of the work, you know, on both ends is supported, you know, by my center uh here, Center for Effective Global Action, which is kind of a an overall development economic center.\nSo, there were a bunch of different partners uh in this.\nBut yeah, we we set up these labs.\nSome were like normal temperature, you know, 20° C or like 68 Fahrenheit, and some were hot, 30° C, like 86, 87° Fahrenheit.\nIt's like kind of uncomfortable.\nAnd then we saw what happened to people's decision-making.\nIt was pretty interesting.\nLike in Berkeley, um, whether you were in the hot room or the core room, like nothing really changed people's answers, how they solved puzzles, math problems, uh, how impatient they were in the lab.\nLike folks in Berkeley were just kind of chill regardless of the setting.\nSo, it kind of fit the the stereotype.\nBut in the Nairobi lab, we found something pretty interesting.\nThere there's a bunch of different games that experimental economists have developed to try to measure how altruistic people are to others to measure what we call social preferences.\nLike how nice are you to other people?\nAnd one of the games they've developed um is a a game called the joy of destruction game, which is really it's the game is exactly what you would think.\nWhen you're in a lab with a bunch of other people, you can costlessly to yourself just destroy some of their payoff.\nYou don't even get anything out of it.\nIt isn't like, oh, I'm stealing it from them.\nThere's other games like that.\nThis is just called the joy of destruction.\nIt's purely measuring whether I will choose to like destroy other people's um payoffs.\nAnd in general, you know, both in Berkeley and in the the Nairobi lab, most people don't do this.\nSo, I think actually the Berkeley rate back to the the stereotypes of our our you know West Coast folks, like I think of the dozens of studies out there, the the rate in Berkeley of people destroying other people's payoffs was like the lowest ever observed.\nIt was like only 2% of people did it.\nEverybody was just chill, like, hey, you keep your money, I'll keep mine.\nThey would like to destroy their own if they had the chance.\nThat was an opportunity.\nExactly.\nThat would be the caricature.\nBut uh in the Nairobi lab, it was like 15%, which is pretty similar to what you see in some European studies, some US studies.\nUm, but what was very interesting in the Kenyon setting was in the hot room, it went up a lot.\nSo, in the hot room, it was like another 50% higher, you know, on top of that.\nSo, there was something about being in this uncomfortable environment where people were kind of agitated, like when we asked them how they felt, they didn't feel that good in the hot room, etc., that made them kind of antisocial, and uh it's something this is paper that was recently published.\nUm, I think it's important to do this kind of work, try to understand the underlying psychology of heat, how it can affect our behavior, how it affects how we treat others, um, because, you know, one of the things that's been seen in the overall climate economics literature and climate literature is a lot of social processes break down at very high temperatures.\nThe economy doesn't work as well.\nIf you look at an African country in a anomalously hot year versus a normal year, in that hot year, there's more political instability.\nIt's more likely to have an outbreak of civil conflict.\nSo, there's a link between extreme temperature and social breakdown.\nAnd what we were able to do in the lab is start pinpointing that, like, you know, even if I'm just in a hot room for a couple hours, that process kind of gets started in a in a troubling way.\nIs there a psychological or even neuroscientific theoretical understanding of what's going on here?\nThere are claims about it.\n\n\nAnd you know, we we we read through that literature. It's a little bit above our pay grade to fully understand it, but I don't think it's fully understood. Um, there are, you know, some changes in neurotransmitters at high temperatures. Uh, you know, we know there are physiological changes, right? We all experience them at high at high temperatures. Um, but I don't think it's very well understood, at least that was our take on the literature. So, I think there's more work to be done. I'd be fascinated about a version of the study done in like Phoenix or El Paso, where you're in the United States, but in a very hot environment, or Atlanta, like the South, where it's humid also. Is it, is it like people are more willing to put up with it in Berkeley because they almost never experience it? So, they're, you know, it's not as frustrating for them. Yeah, that that question of adaptation, I think, is really important. Um, and yeah, I think it would be it would be a great uh, you know, extension of the study. Maybe over time people just get used to it and they deal with it and they have different ways of of dealing with it. Of course, you know, one of the ways people adapt to high temperatures is they avoid it. They like put crank up the AC and you know, uh, and deal with it that way. But uh, I think that, you know, that's one of the big open questions in the climate literature in general, like, you know, adaptation writ large is something we need to understand to to understand how an increase of 2 or 3 degrees C is going to affect us, um, you know, how quickly can we adapt either physiologically or in terms of our institutions? That's a big open question, I think, for social scientists studying climate, I guess.\nThere might, this might be the result of some stereotype buried in my mind, but I, if I'm honest, I would have guessed that in in Nairobi, they would have bore the heat better. Like, aren't they used to it? Yeah. You know, it's interesting, like Nairobi was chosen as the capital of Kenya because it's in the highlands and it's actually pretty cool. So, um, the kind of mean temperature in Nairobi and Berkeley isn't that different, and people aren't really used to very high temperatures. So, I think it it kind of still fits the story that um, you know, they're they're not used to, you know, say 90° Fahrenheit days or, you know, 20° C days that often. Um, it's a little more of a puzzle, you know, why it differs so much between Berkeley and Nairobi, and that's something we can only, you know, hypothesize uh, about. Um, yeah, people were just very chill in Berkeley. There's a kind of wrinkle of that finding in Nairobi that I'll just briefly mention, which is we also have data on the ethnicity of our participants, and actually we were carrying out this experiment in Kenya during a general election season. Um, that was very heated politically, um, and um, some ethnic groups are very much aligned with the government, which won that election. Others were aligned with the opposition, which felt very hard done by and and kind of felt like the election wasn't being conducted fairly. This response to the high temperature was concentrated among people who belong to ethnic groups aligned with the opposition, actually. So it was actually like kind of a marginalized group in this stressful high temperature condition that started destroying other people's payouts.\nFolks aligned with the kind of progovernment groups, the kind of dominant group in Kenya, didn't respond that much to temperature. So there could even be a subrinkle to this that like if I have some like underlying latent, you know, anger or feeling of marginalization, then I get triggered uh, by the environmental stressor. Uh, so I think that's an even more kind of complex story, but one that I think resonates with with our intuition about how people respond in society. I mean, it makes perfect sense to me and is and is yet another example of the uh, not assuming that people are perfectly rational actors as economists sometimes like to do. Uh, in in the pandemic, when people were locked down, there was certainly anecdotally a fraying of the social fabric, and I can imagine that being on the losing side of election, being in a country that has a lot of poverty and disease, um, all these feed in, and the causality can be hard to tease out sometimes.\nYeah, I know for sure. And you know, it's been a very big challenge for those of us studying the impacts of climate on on economic outcomes or political outcomes that, you know, we can't just compare hot countries to poor countries, right? Like they just differ in so many different ways. Um, people may adapt in certain ways. Um, uh, and the way we've actually dealt with it, and just getting into the statistics a little bit, because I know the audience is is more sophisticated.\nUh, a lot of the, even though we're interested in long-run effects of climate change, a lot of the statistical analysis among social scientists trying to understand the effect of climate has focused on shorter-term climatic shocks, like an anomalously hot year or month or maybe two years, rather than like a multi-deal scale analysis, because we just haven't had, you know, the data and the variation over, say, 40 years. Like we care about the next 40 years, but um, you know, we're we're forced statistically to look at shorter-term variation. Um, and that's where there's kind of a gap between what we estimate from short-term variation and the possibility that maybe over the long run we can adapt, adapt to, you know, longer-term variation. So that's again one of these big open questions in terms of the empirical analysis of climate among social scientists like me, like economists or political scientists. I forget. Were you part of the research on the parking tickets and corruptions and the United Nations? I was. That was one of the funnest projects I've I've worked on. That was with Ray Fistman, my colleague who's now at um, at BEu.\nAnd um, you know, that was something that, you know, it's just one of those things, you you get an idea and it's it's a little bit wacky, but uh, it turned out it had, you know, a lot of uh, legs. And just to summarize it briefly for for the audience, sorry. Uh, you know, we thought of ways to understand how country institutions and country characteristics, how persistent they are. You know, this was the case of of corruption, um, you know, in particular, and our insight was, you know, maybe we can get insight into the behavior of government officials by looking at them all in the same place. How do they behave in the same environment? And this was UN diplomats in New York. So, um, you know, how often do they abuse their diplomatic immunity to rack up parking tickets? And that's a pretty good, uh, you know, you could definitely think of that as corruption. You're abusing your official position, so you don't have to pay something. You kind of gain monetarily. You don't have to pay for parking, and you can kind of get away with it. Um, basically, you know, do diplomats from some countries abuse their position and others don't? And does that correlate with how much corruption there is in the home country? That was the question we wanted to ask.\nAnd um, it turns out home country corruption very strongly predicts which diplomats abuse their position in New York City by racking up unpaid parking tickets. So, you know, folks from countries with very high corruption indices, like Nigeria, uh, their diplomats in New York were getting parket ticket parking tickets all the time, and you know, diplomats from Japan or Norway, which have very low corruption indicators, uh, basically almost never rack up an unpaid parking ticket. So, um, that was that was a study that got a lot of attention in the popular media just because it's a fun thing to to kind of like, you know, imagine diplomats choosing to double park on some narrow street in New York City. And yeah, but it does seem to feed into this, you know, wider thing that culture matters. Like everything feeds back on everything else. I mean, it is a it's a fun thing, but corruption in a society, if that's what you expect to come across, might be kind of friction in the economic gear wheels on a much larger scale.\nYeah, for sure. And um, political scientists and economists have written about how persistent corruption is partially because it's a it's a culture. It's self-reinforcing. If I expect you to behave a certain way and you expect me to behave a certain way and we all feel that way in society, it's very hard to break out of that uh, that equilibrium uh, unless something really radical uh, changes. And again, even if you fly diplomats all the way around the world to New York City, they kind of keep acting the same way as they did in the, you know, in the home country. You know, we're often asked in that study, you know, how did the US perform? You know, was the, you know, how did US diplomats diplomats do in terms of racking up unpaid parking tickets in New York City? And unfortunately, we can't measure it because US diplomats in New York City don't have diplomatic immunity. They're in their home country. So, we can't observe it. And people always want to know, oh, how did the US diplomats do? How corrupt are we? Um, but yeah, with that research, we can't uh, shed light on that issue. Probably. Yeah. Okay. I I I I don't want to guess. It's just going to get me in trouble about how corrupt the United States is. But um, and the other thing that it actually is fed into by this stuff on climate change, etc., that that you've worked on that is fascinating is uh, conflicts, you know, big large-scale conflicts, civil wars and things like that in a country or external wars and how they affect uh, what's going on economically or for that matter, how what's going on economically leads to a conflict, and especially if the whole world is getting warmer, um, and that slows down our economic engines. Is that going to start increases in violence in a lot of places? Yeah, some of my early, really my earliest work on on climate was related to exactly that question, focusing on African societies. Is it the case that when you have a bad rainfall year or you have an especially warm year, uh, we do get uh, you know, more risk of civil conflict? And we find very strong uh, relationships there. You know, these anomalously warm years, anomalously dry years tend to be associated with more conflict risk, and in a lot of that work, we do interpret it through an economic lens. So we do know in say a poor African society that the agricultural sector is a huge part of the economy, and when there is a drought, incomes fall for a lot of citizens. It's just uh, you know, a major economic shock. And so, um, those climate shocks turn into economic shocks that are destabilizing because when people are poor, they have much less to lose. They may be more willing to fight, you know, fight the government, join an insurgency. Um, and that comes through very clearly in data over, you know, many decades, and it's been replicated in a lot of other countries and a lot of other settings.\nIt turns out that in years with um, climate shocks of various sorts, high temperatures, bad rainfall, there's more crime. Uh, there's more Hindu Muslim riots in India, there's uh, more land invasions in Brazil. There's just a whole literature that's developed around around those ideas. Uh, which is very troubling because, you know, at this point the world is warming. It's going to continue warming. Um, I think even the most optimistic assessments are we're going to warm by a couple degrees Celsius in the coming decades. Um, and so if we take the existing estimates seriously, there could be far more civil conflict risk and and crime in the coming decades. Our best guess from some meta-analysis work that we've done is with the warming we'd expect around the world in the next 30 or 40 years, the risk of armed conflict could go up by something like 40%.\nUnless we can adapt in some effective way. Yeah. And we already have a lot of violence in this world. So a 40% increase on top of what we have is um, is scary. Uh, is there, I mean, since you've been there and and been thinking about it, like what are the, how much of the challenge of helping the poor nations of sub-Saharan Africa is a cultural shift kind of thing? You know, I guess let's put it in terms of a coordination problem. Like if everyone worked together, it could obviously be much better. But if when the system isn't either working or established, people are going to try to take advantage, and that does get in the way.\nYeah. You know, I would say speaking scientifically, I don't think we have very high-quality evidence about the best ways to carry out that kind of cultural shift or shift in in in social norms. It's a very hard thing to study. We do have some case studies that are interesting. There are, you know, particular African societies where governments have carried out large-scale reforms that have had social impact. So, one that I've worked on and that's gotten quite a bit of attention is the case of Tanzania. So, you know, not a country maybe a lot of readers are super familiar with, but you know, Kenya's neighbor in in East Africa. And right after independence in the 60s and really for the next, you know, 15, 20 years, it was really a concerted effort to build up a Tanzanian identity that was very different than most of its neighbors. There was a a big emphasis on building up uh, the national language of Swahili rather than regional languages or English to to kind of bind people together with an African language. There was a big reform of the school curriculum with a very kind of nationalistic focus and pan-African focus, um, that was unusual among African countries. Um, and there were also attempts to to diminish ethnic divides, for instance, by abolishing traditional chiefs in the country. So, a bunch of these reforms were meant to build up a new identity that could kind of bring people together, kind of along the lines that you're saying, Sean, of like, are there ways we can bridge these gaps and get everybody kind of pulling in the same direction as a country? Uh, and really all the the kind of historical evidence and survey evidence since then points to the fact that it was pretty successful. Like Tanzanians feel very proud of being Tanzanian. Um, ethnic identities have kind of fallen in importance relative to this national identity. Um, Swahili is very widely spoken. People are very proud of it as their national language. So, there are ways that large-scale reforms can transform social identities and social norms in African settings. Um, but I think we need to do a lot more work to understand how and how these ideas can be applied, you know, in other countries. Thank goodness. Like halfway through, I wasn't sure which way that was going to go. I really I was not familiar enough with the with the current state, and I was I was really worried you were going to say and it all failed dramatically. But uh, apparently there is some, well, we could talk about all the nuances of it, but but in many ways there have been positive outcomes. Another country I'll mention, and this is\n\n\nReally, a country that's seen as a model economic and political country in Africa is Botswana, which again, some readers may be familiar with, but a country with a very visionary leader that promoted a kind of coherent national identity, and also this was set, Kama, the independence leader of Botswana, but also really promoted democratic institutions.\n\nYeah. And even today, Botswana has had just continuous democracy since independence, alternation of power in the last election, uh, free press. Not that it's, you know, not without its problems. And they've also had very good economic performance. So, we can we can point to particular country cases in sub-Saharan Africa where the right types of political and social reforms have really brought people together in a common identity. Um, and governments, you know, have promoted economic development. So, it's not hopeless. And I and that's something that I I definitely want readers to take away. And it goes back to your first question. What does development look like? There are success stories, and a lot of the aggregate trends are good. Uh, and that's something that I really hope, you know, the listeners here can can take away from the podcast.\n\nI do think that maybe I'm being overly optimistic or or simplistic, but one message I'm getting is that sometimes the best thing to do is just to throw money at a problem. Like if you just flooded certain places with money, I guess that people would worry, be worried that, you know, the oligarchs or the monarchs would just take it all and it wouldn't help anything. But I don't know. I'm kind of getting the message that at least in some cases it would help a lot just throwing money at the problem.\n\nYeah, I think so. And I I think I would add the caveat that throwing money um in ways where there's an evidence base to support how to do it. So you know, I would say like just, you know, indiscriminately transferring foreign aid to governments that are very corrupt, that may not yield huge development impacts, but say the Give Directly approach of literally person-to-person transfers, like literally putting money in the pockets of real people. Yeah, the research literature on that is just overwhelmingly positive at this point. It improves living standards. I mentioned how it, you know, it saves children's lives. It improves health. It has these spillover effects on local businesses and the private sector. Like that's something that a large body of randomized control trials with good scientific evidence has shown is very effective, and that would be something that I would strongly advocate for. Yeah, throwing money at the problem in that way could be very uh, you know, very effective, and that's why like, again, some of the cuts in foreign aid in the US, but not even just the US cuts, there's big cuts in foreign aid in Europe are discouraging because finally, after the last 20 or 30 years, we have a scientific evidence base in development economics. We really know certain things based on multiple experimental studies with good measurement have been shown to improve living standards, have been shown to improve health. We have that evidence base now. Like now is not the time to be cutting funding. Now is the time where we know what to do, and it's been very frustrating to see governments in the US and the UK and France and and China, too. China has pulled back a lot from foreign aid in the la, you know, since the pandemic and even a little bit before. So we're at a moment where we know what to do and the money isn't there, and that's something that's been discouraging. I'm hopeful the pendulum will swing swing back. I'm hopeful that communicating the scientific evidence will at least mean that private citizens in the US and other rich countries will privately give to organizations that are doing um good work. So that's my hope.\n\nIt it's a particular kind of discouragement when you know what it would, what the right thing to do would be, and you and you see people choosing not to do it. Like there's a different kind of discouragement when you're at a loss, right? But but this must be frustrating. But okay, we're reaching the end.\n\nIt is frustrating. I wanted to give you a chance just to chime in on a couple of other things that I that I saw somewhere on the internet that you were interested in, but weren't the one the things you've been doing a lot of already. One is tax policy, and the other is the economics of aging. Uh, what is it that is pulling you in these particular directions?\n\nYeah, let me let me focus more on the economics of aging because it's something that I'm, you know, working on very actively now. So, um, traditionally in development economics, we didn't focus much on aging because countries' age structures are just very young. And so, you know, because of disease and and and basically bad health care combined with high fertility, like, you know, the population pyramid was just pointing towards folks being very young. But things are changing, and so in a lot of low- and middle-income countries now, from Latin America to China, kind of famously, people know China's aging very quickly, India, and now increasingly in sub-Saharan Africa, they're just growing shares of old people in the population. Um, and in a lot of poor societies, the institutions and policies really aren't set up to deal with aging populations. They don't have in most countries pensions for old people. So very few African countries have an old-age pension that covers more than a few percent of the workers. You know, maybe government employees get a pension, but you know, nobody else. Um, health care systems aren't set up to deal with the problems that old people have. There aren't sort of long-term care solutions set up for for older people. Uh, and on and on. And so, a lot of poor countries are reaching this point where they're going to have to start making big policy choices. is they're going to have to design systems, health systems and pension systems. And it's kind of an exciting time because they can design them from scratch in many cases, and they can learn from the research on on these issues in the rest of the world. And so part of what we want to do is help translate those lessons so that African countries that are starting to move in this direction towards health insurance and uh, elder care and pensions do so with the best evidence base. Um, so I've mainly focused on this in African settings. We're starting to collect some new data on middle-aged populations and older populations. Um, you know, systematic data on their cognition and on their health and what their needs are. So, I see this as a really exciting new area. Um, that again is a big problem. It's a big policy problem, but this is one where the scientific evidence base is really limited. So, it's a little bit like when we were tackling cash transfers 10 or 15 years ago, we didn't know much about them. I hope in the next 10 or 15 years we can make a lot of progress on these economics of aging issues so governments can make good choices um in the coming years.\n\nIt's impossible not to think though, um, when we're talking about topics like corruption and the existence of poverty and an inability to take care of older citizens, that all of these are right here in our country very, very strongly and not obviously getting better. Not not to pull it back to the discouraging side of things, but uh, we we'll have to take some lessons ourselves.\n\nI guess I agree with that. And I think, you know, for those of us that study low- and middle-income countries, we've always look to the US and Canada and the UK and, you know, Japan and rich countries as models and and and rightfully so, right? The US is the richest, most prosperous society in the history of human civilization. We shouldn't forget that. Like we've done a lot of things really, really well. And so we, you know, there's a lot other countries can learn, but my fear right now is it feels like we're kind of unlearning some of our own lessons. Like there's a lot of things that have powered our prosperity. Um, big social investments in in old folks uh, are are being threatened politically, obviously, uh, big investments in scientific research. I mean that and healthcare and NIH and NSF and um, the last few months have seen just, you know, slashing of budgets there. Um, but we wouldn't know how to design policies, and we wouldn't know how to, you know, carry out social programs or health programs or public health programs if we didn't have the evidence base. So, you know, again, I'm hoping the pendulum will swing back. I'm hoping that we can convince folks who who are skeptical about scientific research and health spending. I hope we can find a way to convince them um and show them the benefits of all these investments. They really are investments, um, so that we don't um become poorer and and less healthy. I think it's it really comes down to that, like we wouldn't have uh, the life expectancy we do. We wouldn't have the prosperity we do. We wouldn't have our iPhones, we wouldn't have airplanes, whatever, if we hadn't been investing in in scientific research for generations now. And and and the I'm so proud that the US since World War II has been the focal point for global science. And um, you know, hopefully we don't we don't lose that. I don't think that quite counts as an optimistic place to end, but we can at least aspire to the pendulum swinging back. I think that's, you know, a good thing to cross our fingers for.\n\nSo Ted Miguel, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape podcast.\n\nThanks Sean. It's really fun to talk to you. Thanks.\n\n[Music]\nYeah,\n[Music]\nwow.\n",
