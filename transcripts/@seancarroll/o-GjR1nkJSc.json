  "cleanText": "Hello everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. A couple years ago, uh, 2023, I did a holiday message entitled Reflections on Immortality. This was in response or at least inspired by a workshop we had at the Santa Fe Institute on immortality. What would it mean, how you might get there? And I mentioned there that a lot of the people at the workshop basically said they don't want immortality. Like that's too much. Either personally they couldn't imagine what to do for all that time or socially they think that society would stagnate if people just live forever rather than being replaced. That's fine. You can argue whether or not you'd want to live forever or not. Most people though would want to live a little longer at least than they probably will live. We're very interested in longevity and aging and not only living but living in healthier ways. Uh, I just now for this intro looked up the graph of life expectancy in the United States for the last 150 years or so and it's been going up. That's the good news. It went down once in this particular graph um shows five-year bins, right? So only once in the 20th century did the life expectancy decrease from one 5-year bin to another between 1915 and 1920. I'm not exactly sure why that was. The flu, the Spanish flu maybe until um 2015 to 2020. It also decreased. It also only decreased a little amount. Okay. In 1920 it was 53 years old, the life expectancy from birth in the US. In 2020 it was 78.8. So it's gone up quite a bit. That's impressive. But in 2015 it was 78.9. It was a little bit bigger. And we can talk about why that's true. The health care system, nutrition, whatever. That is the kind of thing we're going to talk about on today's podcast. Eric Topol is a leading medical researcher. Um, cardiovascular system is his specialty, but he's a broad thinker uh who's done a lot of work and has been thinking for a while now about medicine in a very broad way and been writing books about it. Uh, we will actually take a little bit more than a little bit of a detour to talk about his previous book which was called Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again. He has this fascinating point of view that not only can AI be super duper useful in recognizing uh diagnosing some medical conditions that human beings are not very good at, but in fact um it can be better than human beings in some very, very important ways. And you know, we think about how to make an ideal system where there would be both humans and AI there. But one of the steps there is making the humans understand that the AI can actually be pretty good at some things. It's not about AGI or super intelligence. It's about pattern recognition, which is what AIs are very good at. But mostly in today's podcast, we're going to talk about Eric's new book called Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity. And here we're not talking about modifying the human genome to live for centuries or anything like that. We're just talking about living a healthier life and preventing disease in ways that are very plausible, very down to earth, very tangible uh and can actually add several years maybe a decade to an ordinary human healthy life expectancy. This is something which uh most people would sign up for if they had that option. And it's a combination of understanding the diseases that tend to end our lives at some point. In particular, the fascinating thing that we learn is that many different sounding diseases are all related to the immune system and inflammation which might be promising for sort of treating or preventing them. And then of course the other thing is that things that we individually can do, things that have to do with diet and exercise as you might expect, but also mental health, mental acuity, social activity. These are all turn out to be really, really important for not only living a long time, but living a long time in a healthy way. So maybe this is a podcast which unlike many Mindscape episodes has a really tangible effect on how people live their lives. I hope it does. So let's go.\n\n[Music]\n\nEric Topol, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.\n\nGreat to be with you, Sean. Thank you. So, we're going to talk about a lot of things with medicine, aging, AI, things like that. But one thing, there's a little news item that struck me and I thought I don't want to forget asking you about it while I have you here, which is as a person of a certain age, I recently got the shingles vaccine and now I'm told that this might even have a positive effect on preventing dementia in the future. That doesn't seem what it's there for. Is this something that is completely weird and surprising or true and understandable?\n\nWell, it's a mixture of your um questions about surprising and understandable. Um it's really fascinating because um there are these two so-called natural experiments whereby you know huge numbers of people uh got the vaccine uh just because of a a policy change or a date change. So it's like a randomized trial. In fact, it's even better because there's no selection criteria. And whether it was comparing the new Shingrix vaccine versus the old live attenuated virus vaccine called Zostavax or the the vaccine the old vaccine versus no vaccine everything pointed to this about 20% reduction of dementia. Uh and this is fascinating because while other studies had suggested this they weren't like this ideal natural experiment. Yeah. So, it does look like there's a twofer. Uh, it helped me decide to get the shingles vaccine because I don't do well with these vaccines in terms of acute reaction. It's unpleasant. Yeah. But, and I was lucky because of the of all things, this vaccine didn't knock me out like like some others do. But, yeah, I think for people over 50 uh in the US, uh it's wise to get this uh because there really is an appears to be an added bonus. It doesn't mean for sure that the virus herpes causes Alzheimer's, but it could be that just revving up your immune system with this vaccine um helps. Uh so it isn't unequivocal proof that there's a root cause of a virus for uh Alzheimer's or dementia, but it does certainly suggest the immune system plays a role.\n\nSo we're still pretty unsure of what the root causes are for dementia, for Alzheimer's.\n\nYes. I mean the theory of a virus like for multiple sclerosis, Epstein-Barr virus which is unequivocal is very soft here. Uh we don't have anything like the multiple sclerosis story but there's still people who believe the virus plays an important role and perhaps in a subset of people and even other viruses besides uh the herpes varicella virus may be invoked. So there's still work to be done on that one.\n\nYeah. Okay. I mean there there there usually is especially in medicine it's very hard. Okay. Thank you for indulging me with that. Now we can get on to uh the you know the the the work you've done the books etc. Um you know part two of the podcast uh is going to be about your most recent book on aging which is something everyone cares about. Uh but previously you've talked a lot about the potential impact that AI can have on medicine. And I think this is perfect for this podcast because um I I love the idea of AI. I'm very skeptical about some overblown claims about artificial general intelligence, but here is an actual use case where you don't need to worry that the AI is conscious or intelligent or anything. You can just use it. So why don't you give us the like the big picture overview of why AI might be helpful in medicine?\n\nYeah, I mean in some ways it's uh stunning. uh Sean I mean we're going to get into some of the concerns of course but some of the things that uh AI is bringing to us uh we couldn't even have conceived frankly so perhaps the one that is just kind of knocks you out in terms of wow factor is the so-called machine or digital eyes the vision that um AI has which is so it makes our vision as physicians experts in certain domains look weak. Okay? Because it turns out that the accuracy once you train an AI um to see things, if you will, is so much better, not just for the things that you're supposed to be looking at, but for finding things that you can't even see. M so for example uh you know the retina is a perfect uh example because it turns out even ophthalmologists the the retina specialists they can't see things that the AI can so not just about retina disease but about every system in our body essentially not just the brain but about risk for heart attacks and strokes and kidney disease and liver disease and I mean the list goes on and on. So the point being is that there's this opportunistic aspect because the supervision of AI Yeah. Uh is just extraordinary. And so that is something that I think we're just starting to get in touch with. No one had anticipated the the richness of ability to interpret medical images which is a big part of practice of medicine. But then we're also seeing some things that also are surprising. That is one of the most important parts of medicine is making the diagnosis. You know the the the things that were listed as the three most important things. Diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis. Turns out we have 12 million serious diagnostic errors a year. In the United States, we see 800,000 Americans either disabled or dead from these serious diagnostic errors. So, it's hard to make things worse. Well, it turns out, you know, even though the medical community doesn't like to fess up to these problem of errors, these errors, the AI is making a big difference because it is so good at coming up with a differential diagnosis from a person's data. much better than we expected. So the chance of it being as good as one of the experts for coming up with the diagnosis like we see with the um storyried case presentations at the New England Journal of Medicine sort of thing. It's amazing. So this is another way accuracy not just medical images but also for helping making the diagnosis through what's really fascinating now Sean is this we're not just seeing large language models we're seeing large reasoning models and so this is really helping that reasoning and following the chain of thought so you can just say how did you get there how did you come up with these diagnosis and get the details of how the AI is thinking if you\n\nNow the other thing that uh I think we wouldn't have expected and again some of these are really outgrowths of the transformer architecture of AI um but now when you go with a patient in a clinic visit or even at the bedside that interaction can not only be transcribed that's that's nothing but what it can do is do all the downstream tasks. So, it would do like if you need prescriptions, follow-up appointments, uh procedures, labs, uh pres um setting up followup uh appointments for um and nudges for things that were discussed during the interaction like did you check your blood pressure? What are the values? Can and you get it back to the doctor and and even pre-authorization to deal with the darn insurance companies. So what we're seeing is average for those who are adopting these two to three hours less data clerk work for doctors and then the other thing that's I think very refreshing is to see the patients getting empowered to make their own diagnosis uh through these tools. So whether that's for a heart rhythm or skin lesion or ear infections in a child or urinary tract infection. So all around they're seeing effects and they're just really starting to take hold.\n\nI love the example that you you already mentioned it briefly, but I saw it you give it in a talk and it was it really stuck with me of this retinal scan. So you're literally looking at a picture of someone's retina and you ask human doctors, okay, is this a man or a woman? And they have no idea. It's 50-50. They're just they're just guessing. And the AI gets it right 99% of the time.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's amazing. And we still don't really know why the AI is so good. But it just that is perhaps the best single example of the gap between human eye um discrimination and what an AI when it's seen train u with hundreds of thousands of images. It just it's actually pretty mind-boggling to me. And you know, I've known about it for years and there's just now so many other examples, whether it's a cardiogram or a path slide, an X-ray. I mean, who would have thought you could diagnose diabetes from a chest X-ray? I mean, these are crazy things, you know? So, um, it's it's wild, but it kind of makes sense, you know, because you're kind of using the AI for what it seems like it should be good at. It's pattern recognition, right? and it's it's looking for differences and human beings are okay at that, but they're not perfect. But you're not trying to shoehorn the AI into something that being something that is not.\n\nThat's right. I mean, and and what's really interesting is that capability was just an outgrowth of deep learning without the extra uh turbocharged capability of of the newer models. So yeah, I mean just think of where we're going to go with the models that continue to get refined and improved on a weekly basis. It's just crazy right now. And uh it's a reminder I guess probably as a medical doctor you don't need to be reminded of this, but the human body is very interrelated. I mean the fact that there is some subtle difference even if human beings don't know what it is between a male retina and a female retina you know maybe makes sense if you if you tell it to me but I wouldn't have been surprised if it hadn't been there but you know yeah the body is is all the different parts are talking to each other all the time\n\nthat's right absolutely and this is something where again you know AI is it is the AI able to tell us why it thinks that a certain retinal scan is man or woman? Well, this explainable AI is kind of a overarching goal and sometimes we do get a pretty good explanation, but in the case of the retina, it's still elusive. There's these things called salency maps and masking and all these techniques that you can use to try to kind of reverse engineer what is this neural network doing you know but uh it hasn't been as u u a good an explanation yet provided for the retina as it has for many other capabilities that were not anticipated.\n\nOkay, perfectly fair. I I guess on the flip side there going to be people who worry that their medical care is going to be handed over to computers rather than human beings. And I suppose ideally it should be both, right? There should be both in the loop and there should be interactions but but like you said with the paperwork at least in principle the existence of AI could give us more interactions with human beings.\n\nThat's right. And there was something other another thing that\n\n\nCaught us by a big surprise recently, and, uh, my colleague Pranov Raj Perker and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about it. Six studies now, there's seven, um, where the AI was compared to a doctor with AI for various tasks, whether it's a diagnosis or, uh, images, and the AI was better than the doctor with the AI. Okay, we would not have expected that. Okay, everyone, including us, all anticipated that the AI and the doctor is the best winning combination. Now, what is the reason for this? Well, it could be because the AI right now isn't in high regard for doctors, and so they don't really take it seriously, or they could just have a bias against it, and or they're not grounded yet on how to use it. But it's a little concerning that the AI could have this superior performance in various medical tasks that, you know, important tasks. We're going to have to see how this plays out. But one thing for sure is, um, I think it's going to be imperative that all physicians learn the nuances of AI. Don't not to immediately reject it, but to actually consider embracing it because it can help. Yeah. But when AI beats out the doctors, that's a flag right there. Yeah. Right. Okay. Good. That is absolutely food for thought. But I would imagine that in some circumstances, like, you know, looking for polyp or, uh, nodules in some scan, if the AI could say, \"Look here, it looks like there's something like that,\" could that just sounds unambiguously helpful to the doctor. Yeah, the biggest study yet, um, you touched on one, which is the second biggest, which is colonoscopy, cumulatively, but the biggest single study, over a 100,000 women in Sweden, had either the doctors, rad, the radiologists with AI interpret the mamograms or doctors without the AI, randomized, and what was amazing, of course, is that there was this 20-something percent better detection of important cancers with the doctors who had the AI. So you would say now, in addition to other studies, that why are we doing mamograms in women without AI? Uh, because now that's missing, you know, one out of five, that's a lot of potential cancers, and we've known for years that mimography has lots of inaccuracies with false positives and false negatives. So, you know, there we're seeing a that should probably be universally adopted. The problem in the United States is that the company, the big radiology company that's got scans all over the country, they're charging the women extra if they want to have the AI reading, $35 or something like that. That's crazy. That should be part of a normal, and someday I guess it will, but we're in a transition zone right now. We are. Is are the AIs that are being used are like off-the-shelf GPT kind of things, or do you need like a specially tuned medical AI? Yeah, it's the these are commercially available, uh, software packages, you know, that have been, uh, FDA approved now. Okay. The ones that are here in the US, particularly the one that Radnet uses, is different than the one that was in the randomized trial in Sweden, but they're pretty similar. The point being is they, they, they, the good ones have all validated this 20% improvement of of making the diagnosis. And so for polyps, it's similar too. The gastroenterologists miss a lots of polyps, you know, like about 20%. So the fact that AI can, you know, give us this boost of accuracy, who wants to go through a colonoscopy and have a tired gastronurologist who's been working all day doing this stuff? Particularly that's when it happens is later in the day, human eyes start to, you know, lose some of their, and you know, who wants to go through all that and have a missed important Apollo. Yeah, I got that from your talk that, uh, you should always have your colonoscopy in the morning. The doctors are fresher. I, I would plus it avoids you having a fast, you know, after having gone through everything another another day. So yeah, and maybe other than, uh, diagnostics, are there other promising uses of AI?\nYeah, I mean, I think it's across the board. I mean, it's just, um, you name it. There's, uh, like, you know, for years as a cardiologist, uh, we had the electroc cardiogram had an overread or what they call it, underread by the machine, and it was stupid. The readings were terrible. The error rate was really high. Well, now not only is the error rate really impress low, impressively low, but also what we're seeing is it's making diagnoses that were the cardiologists might not have come up with accurately. So, uh, for example, it can say there's a low ejection fraction, and you say, \"What?\" In fact, Mayo Clinic has already made that routine for all of their, uh, ECG AI interpretation. But also things like, uh, there's a risk of developing atrial fibrillation, even though there's no atrial fibrillation in this person. Okay. Uh, and there's a risk of stroke or this or that. Kind of like the retina. So, not only have we got rid of the error rate that was kind of a major deal, but we're getting all this opportunistic readings that, um, we never had before. Just a pretty, again, you know, I just don't see, don't expect this kind of thing, and it's just happening. And how prevalent is it right now for these kinds of, um, things? Is it yet to ask special and pay, or is it already there? The ECG is not anywhere else that I know of yet, except for Mayo Clinic. I hope it will be universally used because it's a sense that, Sean, that we're just leaving all this stuff on the table. You know, that all these extra bonus interpretations that could be useful for a patient. They should be of no charge. It's there, you know, it's it's in the it's in the data. I just we need the AI to extract it. Well, well, tell me, as a someone who's been around for a while, do you get the feeling that practicing clinical doctors are open to these kinds of changes in general? Are they, are they looking to be on the cutting edge, or is it that they have a way that works and are kind of happy with that? Well, the older ones like me are usually not too receptive. Um, younger digital docs, you know, they kind of grew up, uh, in this environment. They're apt to be a little more willing, but overall there's not, um, an embracement, uh, eager to adopt AI, uh, and it's because of the other concerns like the what is this going to do with errors, hallucinations, and privacy and security and biases, which we know exist, you know, there's many things that are that are deterrence. Perhaps the one that I think that didn't get enough, um, emphasis is you really have to have compelling data to get the medical community to move. And the only compelling data we have that I mean, really compelling is what we're seeing with the mimography, uh, colonoscopy, perhaps, you know, certain things where you know that it's just unequivocal benefit. Okay. But but a lot of the things that we're seeing evidence of, they're still looking for the the proof points that are just so clear-cut that it would be considered below the standard of care, which is kind of a bit nebulous term, but it's changed when the the needle is moved when the stuff the data evidence is just overpowering.\nWell, it does seem to me like having better diagnoses of, um, cancer or heart disease would help me live longer, which provides a natural segue into our next big topic, which is your new book on aging. And again, let me just start at the very highest level. Uh, aging and especially extending human lifespans. This is a topic that gets a lot of talk. A lot of the talk is maybe not reliable. Uh, I mean, how do you feel waiting in to this area?\nYeah, I felt, Sean, I had to weigh in because the pseudocience, right, and the false claims are totally out of control, and basically it's kind of predatory, all these anti-aging supplements and, you know, stem cell clinics and, you know, peptides and I mean, you name it. It's just so much malarkey, so much, uh, hype of false. You know, you could say some of this is is fraudulent. Um, it's it's a shame, and it basically, uh, it's playing into the interest that people not just want to live longer, but live longer, healthier health span. Uh, and that's why I decided it was time for me to go deep on this and write a book, which is Super Agers, which is trying to set the record straight, to really put the excitement in context, and it isn't about reversing aging, amazingly, it's it's about extending health span, uh, to quash age-related diseases. So basically what this is doing is taking the science of aging, which is formidable, big advances, um, and using that not to come up with some magical potion, which doesn't exist for people, but rather to use those, um, advances so that we can, uh, take the big three, uh, heart, cancer, and neurogenerative, mainly Alzheimer's, how we can apply these advances in science of aging to prevent these three major killers and major causes of losing one's health span. And just to be super clear, you know, on the podcast sometimes we talk about very science fictiony topics. So your focus is not on genetically engineering human beings so they live for 10,000 years. You're really thinking about, you know, how we can just live a few more years in a more healthy way.\nYeah. I mean, uh, as I go through in the book, uh, if you were to really work on this, you could ek out seven, perhaps even 10 years of health span. Health span meaning freedom from these three major, um, diseases, age-related diseases. So, yeah, that's exciting to me. It's not, we're not talking about a few weeks or months, we're talking about years. Yeah. And the fact is that we don't need a magic potion to do this. Um, as we'll get into, we need lots of data on a person, and we need AI, and we need to use the advances, which are basically these clocks, molecular clocks, that's perhaps the biggest thing that's, uh, a shakeup in medicine that people don't realize right now, biomarkers and clocks, and that's what's given us this newfound potential. Well, let's get into that right away. I mean, where does human lifespan come from? Um, it seems, seems clear from even the most obvious data that people tend to live a certain amount, and if they don't have something terrible happen to them, then they're going to die. It's not an exponential fall-off, right? It's not like the same fraction of people die every day. Our, our biology gives out after a point. Um, probably we can guess at evolutionary explanations for that, but maybe give us a clue as to what's going on. Well, everybody used to think it was the genes, and that was deterministic, and that turns out to be completely wrong. While it may be an issue in a very limited number of people, it's not really about our genes. Um, and so a lot of this is, um, a, it turns out it's a multi-dimensional, complex story about why we, we don't just, um, have this what's called compression of morbidity, where you live perfectly healthy and then you just fall off a cliff. You know, that's just it doesn't work that way. Yeah. Uh, the way it works is, you know, at some point you're going to start to see some frailty, some decline in capabilities, like whether it's cognitive or or other. And so the point being is how can we extend that, you know, intactness, lack of this, uh, compromise or frailty. Uh, and so what is the determin of that? Well, we studied 1,400 people, uh, who we call the elderly, and they had been over 85 and never been sick. They had none of these diseases. And, uh, what was interesting, we sequenced all their genomes, whole genomes. We found almost nothing from that. That is the genes were from the story. And the, the, um, the protagonist patient of mine in the book, um, Mrs. LR, she's 98, and she has never been sick. I mean, I saw her for a trivial thing as a, as a for as a patient, but what's fascinating is all her relatives, her brothers and sisters, her parents, they all died in their 60s, 50s, she's 98. Okay, so that's basically the story. It's not the gene. So like for me, I have terrible family history, right? But when I, as the more I've learned about this, the less worried I've been about the most of us have this overhang throughout our lives, like my, my father had this, my mother had that, whatever, that we don't need to succumb to those thoughts because there's so much we can do now to find out our risk individual at the individual level, and that's what's a a sharp contrast to the way we used to think about this in the f in the past. So specifically in this study, you had these people who were living long and they were healthy, and I presume that you were hoping to see, \"Oh, they all share this gene,\" or at least many of them do, but in in fact, essentially no connection whatsoever. Just about no connection. I mean, certainly nothing that was had had a lot of weight. Uh, so we were surprised. We were very disappointed at the time. But now in context, uh, it's it's starting to come together that we have to have a rethink about the gene story because it just doesn't really, uh, click. Um, there may be something to it if you're over 110, but there's not too many people. I'll get to that point.\nYeah. Yeah. They're called super centinarians, but there's so few of those that Yeah. And and even that's questionable. But is there something to the idea that, you know, once we're past our reproductive age, um, evolution is done with us and it sort of lets us decay?\nYeah. We're in steady decay mode, sadly.\nYeah. So what happens is for these three diseases in particular, uh, it takes 20 years for them to take hold, incubate, if you will. So you don't have a heart attack without having your arteries getting clogged up with aoscerosis for two decades or more, cancer. You don't just all of a sudden show up with pancreatic cancer. This has been developing over more than two decades, these clones and their ability to, um, eventually proliferate and spread throughout the body. And the same thing is for Alzheimer's. We now know it's 20, 30 years you could predict ahead of time if that is going to be a risk. So these processes of our deterioration, the good thing is they're really slow. It gives us a great opportunity to get ahead of them. Imagine if they, you know, took a place over months or or a year, and then of course we wouldn't have that anticipatory runway to work with. So we're really lucky in that respect, and it's that combination of these long lag time periods and the tools that we have today that's making this exciting opportunity, uh, going forward. So you mentioned the big three. Let's let's dig into them a little bit more. Um, probably if you asked people on the street what are the three big diseases that will end your life, they probably would have come pretty close to saying like cancer, heart disease, brain\n\n\ndiseases.\nUm, are they related?\nAre they all completely different causes?\nWhat do we know about why these things start kicking in at a certain age?\nGreat question.\nThere is a common thread besides the fact that they each take 20 plus years, and that thread is the immune system and inflammation.\nSo our immune cells can secrete all these, uh, what's called cytokines, chemokines that are inflammatory mediators.\nAnd so what's the problem with the three diseases?\nThey all have, um, a marked unourred inflammation.\nSo inflammation in our artery wall or in our brain or, um, the immune system not responding to the appearance of a tumor cell or tumor clone.\nSo it's our immune system is the, is the real, um, problem for the three diseases, and that's one of the big deficiencies we have right now.\nWe don't have a way, like you can go to the lab and get a blood count kind of thing.\nYou can't get an essay to tell you what is the status of your immune system.\nAnd we really, we really desperately need that.\nThat's like the next frontier.\nAnd people say the brain is really complex.\nWell, I got to tell you the immune system is right up there.\nIt's, it's very, you know, I have a whole chapter about that in the book.\nAnd what's exciting, of course, there is we're learning about how to rev it up and and tone it down, suppress it like never before.\nSo, if we can start to get a routine way people can get their immune system and inflammation markers assessed, that's going to give us even better ways to, um, prevent these diseases.\nWe did recently do a podcast with, uh, James Allison about using the immune system to fight off cancer.\nSo, this, this fits in very well.\nWell, let's assume that some of our listeners didn't listen to that episode yet and maybe explain more of the details about how our immune system is supposed to work when everything's going well.\nWell, you know, that breakthrough that Allison had for immunotherapy was just the beginning of now a chain of many discoveries.\nAnd the point is is that it's pretty hard to get cancer spread around the body if your immune system is completely intact.\nM, uh, cancer tries to hijack cells and suppress your immune system, but it's hard to get it rooted if, if your immune system is, is really, um, high integrity.\nBut the other thing we've learned is that as we keep adding more different ways of revving up the immune system in people with cancer that aren't responding to the current therapies, we keep getting more successful of getting cures.\nSo it's almost like we can't do enough with personalized neo antigen vaccines and, uh, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and I conjugate drugs.\nAll these things are basically trying to get the immune system to go into high power mode, you know, and that's a, a big learning.\nAnd the point being is if, if I could say, well, let's say you, Sean, you have this significant risk of cancer in your lifetime, what I'd be doing is maybe every year assessing your immune system, and when was showing signs of showing a bit of, we call imosiness, you know, iminoaging, we, we would give you something like a vaccine, like we were talking about at the, you know, the, the, um, shingles type vaccine, but we might give you a vaccine just to give you a higher, um, gear of your immune system so that you are, uh, in defense mode.\nYes.\nAnd of course, we don't want to go too exuberant because we don't want you to go into self-attack mode either and develop an autoimmune component at all.\nBut that's where this is the, the, the cancer story that's unraveled since the great work of Allison and others is really built on the fact that it's really an immune system, um, defect that's allowing cancer, um, to, to, to take hold and spread in our body.\nAnd we have got to prevail over cancer.\nThis is a fundamental goal.\nWe've been talking about this moonshot and, you know, for years, for decades, uh, but now there's a, there's a way to see through it.\nSo tell me more about the cellular biology here.\nI understand that there's like T cells involved.\nWhat is supposed to be happening in my bloodstream when I'm, when my immune system is going great guns?\nWell, there's a lot of different components.\nUm, the B cells that are known, of course, they're, they're making the antibodies and the T cells that are kind of a primary way that we can kill cells that are, that are troublesome, that are foreign, have foreign proteins, uh, on their surface.\nAnd of course, there's so many other aspects of, you know, interferons and there's, um, regular neutrfll white cells and there's natural killer cells, and there's all this, it's a big system.\nBut okay, it comes down to, um, when you, when you're trying to deal with cancer as an example, you really want to have the ability, uh, to recognize these foreign antigens on surface of cells or cancer cells, and that's where the T cells really kick in.\nAnd so what you can do now, which is really quite extraordinary, we've seen like we've never seen before, small numbers of patients, but refractory cancer, they failed in every therapy, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer.\nThey had the kitchen sink of everything we got, and they couldn't respond.\nAnd then they got a so-called neo antigen personalized vaccine for their cancer.\nThat is, they were the, the cancer cells.\nThey looked at these antigens, um, taken out of the body and then engineered T-C cells to fight them for that person's specific cancer.\nAnd guess what happened?\nI mean, that was like melted away.\nI mean, just now the problem, of course, is it's not something that you could scale in millions of people who have cancer each year around the world.\nBut on the other hand, um, if we can get off-the-shelf ways to do this, that's where the prospects lie today is that we don't want to have to necessarily make T cells that are individualized, but, you know, rather if we can come up with the common antigens or proteins that are the responsible that that can stimulate our immune system, that's what we want to do.\nAnd well, I don't know.\nI mean, can we imagine, um, some combination of AI and DNA robots and I don't know, uh, that will sort of fix up our immune system in a kind of bespoke way for whatever it is that we're most in danger of?\nI wouldn't rule it out.\nCertainly possible.\nI like your thinking because it's, you know, very, it's futuristic and starting to bring all this stuff together.\nI'm more kind of looking at the here and now potential, but you're right.\nUh, already AI is being used to determine, um, the, uh, matchup of a person's, uh, antigens of their tumor cells and the T cells.\nWe're already starting to, uh, rely on AI because in any given cancer there's hundreds and hundreds of these particular proteins, and so the finding the ones that are to develop a vaccine against is, is you, you don't, you can't do it against hundreds.\nYou got to pick the, the most important ones, and AI is helping to do that.\nOkay, good.\nAnd, um, I, I think I do see what we're talking about here visa v cancer, especially because we did talk to Jim Allison before.\nSo what's the analogous story for cardiovascular disease, uh, neurodegeneration?\nYeah.\nSo the Alzheimer's story is a lot of people don't realize this, how extraordinary change there is.\nSo there's a blood biomarker called PTA 217, and there's a couple others like it, and basically what they are is as good as a PET scan for the brain.\nOkay.\nSo you just a simple blood test, it's available.\nIt tells you your risk of Alzheimer's.\nAnd by the way, if you're, if that marker is high, abnormal, and you get another one in six months or a year, then you can say exactly when you might get mild cognitive, uh, deficit.\nYeah.\nSo that it stages the disease no less, makes the diagnosis of risk.\nNow, uh, and G, so it used to be we have a genetic test and we'd say, oh, well, you have a higher risk of Alzheimer's, and we didn't know if it was at age 98 or 68.\nNow we know, you know, right, very precise timing, not just the extent of the risk.\nNow what's amazing here is that you can do all these things that reduce inflammation in the brain, which we didn't know before.\nSo like, for example, diet and exercise, the right kind of diet and the right kind of exercise, um, can really help reduce inflammation in the body and the brain, lifestyle factors.\nOkay.\nBut also what's really intriguing right now is, you know, these glip one drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro, they reduce inflammation in the brain.\nIt's one of the most important ways that they work.\nSo that they're being tested now to reduce Alzheimer's in big trials that are due out, um, in, in less than a year.\nUm, so there are other ways to reduce inflammation.\nThe, the point being is that you might have some amyloid plaque in your brain, but if you are, if your brain is reacting to it and it's inflamed, that's how that's the ticket to developing, okay, Alzheimer's.\nSo knowing your risk and getting all over it with the lifestyle of preventable factors and likely drugs in the future, not the kind of drugs we have right now, uh, that are used for people already have, uh, Alzheimer's that are dangerous drugs and don't work very well.\nBut this is the ability to prevent Alzheimer's in the future, which is really quite remarkable.\nI don't know a lot about Ozempic, the weight loss drug, or it's usually marketed as a weight loss drug, but I, I keep hearing how, oh, it has this extra unanticipated good side effect, which is kind of the opposite of what I'm used to hearing about all the deleterious side effects.\nUh, are we learning more about why this is so awesome?\nDoes it have something to do with the immune system?\nYeah.\nI mean, I think what's fascinating here, uh, that if you take these drugs, the so-called glip one drugs, they don't get into the brain very well.\nSo, people started to wonder, how do you see such great reduction of brain inflammation?\nNo less, you know, how do you see the reduction in appetite and desire for healthier foods and, you know, basically completely rewiring your reward circuits?\nYeah.\nAnd it turns out the gut brain axis.\nSo basically it's affecting the gut.\nUh, there's a veagal nerve that connects the, uh, the gut to the brain.\nAnd it's through this circuitry that basically the brain is kind of the master regulator of our inflammation both in the brain and throughout the body.\nOkay, which we, we only learned about that in the last couple years.\nYou know, we thought it was just the blood, but no, the brain's talking to the blood and the gut's talking to the brain.\nAnd so, this is what is we're learning about these glip one drugs that have had more impact across more diseases, some of which have nothing to do with weight loss.\nThe inflammation is reduced before anyone loses weight.\nOkay.\nSo, um, this is this is a whole new day for, uh, understanding these interorgan connections.\nAnd okay, and then heart disease, this is your thing, right?\nI mean, does it sound different than the other two?\nLike heart disease seems more sudden, or maybe that's just my misimpression?\nYeah, people think, oh, I had a heart attack and this was sudden.\nNo, it's been brewing for at least 20 years.\nWe have seen autopsies from 20 year olds, 30 year olds that they already have plaque building up in their arteries in the heart arteries, car, the so-called coronaries.\nSo no, this is something the only sudden event is that finally there's a crack in the plaque, but that plaque has been growing and kind of inflamed.\nAnd but here's another point is that if it wasn't that the plaque got inflamed, you wouldn't have a heart attack, and that's in part why statins work.\nThey not only lower the LDL, but they reduce inflammation.\nThey're not as powerful as glip one drugs, but statins and anything that reduces your LDL cholesterol will also reduce some inflammation for those for the arteries because those are those are a species of the the fatty proteins in our in our blood that it the artery does not like that having it in their wall.\nIt just reacts to it.\nAnd so years and years of accumulation of bathing your arteries in bad cholesterol, LDL, and now there's another one that will become routinely, uh, measured and, uh, new drugs to fight against called LP little A, which we never had anything for it, but now we are seeing five different drugs that are emerging to to tackle that one.\nSo this is exciting too that, you know, we're, we're coming up with new ways to prevent the the toll of heart disease.\nPeople don't die of a plaque, they die of a heart attack or a stroke for the arteries that go up into the brain.\nSometimes informally people talk about dying of old age.\nIs that a thing, or is that just like a catch-all term for your immune system not doing what it's supposed to be doing?\nUh, you don't die just of old age.\nYou got to die of something, right?\nBecause age itself isn't the killer.\nSo, there's got to be something else like explaining it.\nCould it be heart rhythm problem?\nCould it be, you know, um, you know, something that doesn't get diagnosed, an indolent infection?\nYou know, many, many possible things.\nBut you don't die just of old age.\nThere is the idea that one's tieumirs decay, right?\nAs you know, cells divide, our genetic code is sort of being eaten away from the ends.\nIs is how relevant is that?\nWell, there's a lot of things happening as we age.\nOur telomeres, which the end of our chromosomes, they get shorter and shorter, but there isn't any good way of lengthening them or lengthening them safely because, um, they are also connected to your propensity to develop cancer.\nYou don't want to muck around with them.\nAnd they're not nearly as good as the new clocks for telling you about your aging.\nSo, the new clocks, um, they include organ clocks.\nSo, what's amazing here is I could get a blood tube of blood from you and I could check, it's kind of like going to your car for every system, right?\nUm, it would tell me about your aging, uh, of your brain, your heart, your kidneys, your liver, your immune system, eight systems of your body from a tumor of blood to say is that organ in you aging faster than your chronological age, your actual age.\nOkay?\nAnd then I say, you know what, Sean, I got to get all over this risk for your heart, and I'm going to check these other things.\nI'm gonna, you know, confirm that this is it.\nAnd now this is what we're going to do for you.\nSo you never, first of all, we're going to slow your heart aging.\nWe're going to slow it.\nHere's how we're going to slow it.\nAnd we're going to measure it again to prove that we slowed it.\nOkay.\nThat's what's so different today.\nWe didn't have organ clocks.\nYeah.\nWe didn't have epigenetic, uh, clocks that tell us our bodywide\n\n\nUm, aging relative to our actual aging. If we have all these ways to detect whether someone is not just the person, but the organ is off track, and it's this is the science of aging crystallized to make a difference. That's great. Yeah. And I, I do want to get into sort of the nitty-gritty of what an individual can do to, you know, live longer and and more healthy, but maybe we can sweep the deck of some of the crazier ideas out there first. I mean, if I got a blood transfusion from, you know, children's blood or something like that, would that clean out my system and help me live longer? Yeah, there's a lot of these things that are out there. Um, certainly in mice and and animals that if you take old young blood plasma and put it in old, you can see some improvements in metrics in people. It's never been established that it's safe or effective with any durable impact, and it's a very expensive procedure called plasma feresis that these clinics, particularly out here in California, which California, exactly, yes, horrible, but they're around the country too. They're even in other countries. It's shameful because there's no data, and you know, very ch, this is not covered by any insurance. This is really expensive, and this is for the likes of these PE extremists like Brian Johnson, the guy who had the Netflix special who takes hundreds of supplements a day and has, you know, a penile sensor and night, and I mean this guy, and he had his blood transfused from his son, you know. Oh yeah, this is crazy stuff. And he's kind of the one, this don't die. He's promoting this stuff, and people believe it, which is a which is a shame. When a 200-year-old person starts promoting that, I'm going to start believing them. But until then, I'm going to be skeptical. But I was, I was shocked to learn recently that the supplement industry in the United States is several times larger than the entire prescription drug industry. You know, that's a really sad fact. As far as I know, it's true. And a lot of it is anti-aging. Yeah. You know, I, I the other day I was in the airport, uh, in Oakland, and there was a vending machine of anti-aging supplements. Wow. You said, \"Wow.\" I mean, wow. What are we doing here? Right. Well, I happen to know that the anti-aging supplement industry is very fond of advertising on podcasts. So, I, I don't do that. I don't actually, I, I turn those down. But, uh, the sad truth about that is that these longevity, so-called longevity doctors and scientists, they're the ones that are hawking the supplement. Horrible. None of them are proven, and they're not, you know, they're not only u lack of efficacy, but they're also questionable safety. And of course, they're a big dent in your finances. Everything bad about it. Everything. Okay, good. We So, we've gotten that off the deck a little bit. Um, uh, I guess there's things we can do individually and things we can do as a society. I mean, let's talk about as a society first. Um, one cause of death is just, you know, a pandemic or an infectious disease or something like that. I mean, how, how good are we at, I know this is a politically charged question right now, but how good are we these days at protecting against future pandemics?\nNot good.\nAnd the problem here is, you know, obviously we didn't do well for the COVID, uh, pandemic, but, um, we haven't learned the lesson. So instead of, you know, taking advantage of the things we learned, we're seeing gutting of our resources in the United States. I mean, unbelievable takedowns of the, um, programs at CDC, NIH, FDA. So this antivaccine, anti-science culture. So we're, we're actually in much worse position than we were for COVID because of this movement against science. And, uh, it's a shame because we learned a lot of what it takes to be ready. And now even with threats that are out there, whether it's u avian flu, um, or or, um, you know, others that we know are potential, uh, pandemic threats, uh, there's, there's reluctance, there's denialism to confront what we should be doing, and it's really sad. Do you find yourself personally involved in political discussions or strategic discussions, or is it something where, you know, the all the scientists are already on one side? We sort of don't have to talk to them. Yeah. No. And then the problem is that the people who are running the show now, um, you, they, you can't reason with them. Yeah. Because they were now empowered to take apart the systems that we had. And so we're kind of in this autodestruct mode, and, uh, you're trying to, whether you're dealing with measles and you say you got to get everybody vaccinated, and you know, this is our best protection, and what you're hearing is take cod liver oil and vitamin A, vitamin A, yes, you have children in the hospital because of liver toxicity that has nothing, there's no data to support that for preventing measles, but there are data obviously for the toxicity of taking, um, these, uh, at at high doses is really, this is a sad state. We're going backwards. It's almost like we're going in the dark ages here. Yeah, I figured that was true. I figured it was never less important to get it on the record there. So, thanks for that update. Um, let's instead ask questions about what you and I can do a little bit. I mean, you have a really interesting section of the book where you talk about lifestyle plus. Explain what that is. Yeah. So, we used to think lifestyle was all about diet, exercise, and in more recent years, sleep, health. Turns out there's missing about 10 other layers of lifestyle. Um, they extend through things like, uh, ultrarocessed foods as a component of diet. Uh, no less the protein component and all the details of not just food, but also beverages, you know, alcohol and all that caffeine. But then as you get into other layers like exposure to air pollution, microlastics, forever chemicals, social isolation, um, time in nature, I mean, it's a long list of what we would, what we would consider lifestyle plus. You could say lifestyle, environmental, socioeconomic, you know, all these other factors, but it's hard to, it's too many syllables and words, so I just call it plus, you know. So, okay, I mean, let's just, I know that some of these are kind of cliched and everyone is supposed to know them. Uh, what is a healthy diet and if for specifically aimed at the goal of being healthy and active for more years? Yeah. So this is, uh, really topical because very recently there was a study, 30 years of followup of over 105,000 people, and only 9% lived, uh, to age 70 without the chronic diseases we've been talking about, age-related chronic diseases, the big three. And so they could, they could zoom in on what did they eat? What were these 90% was different than the rest of the folks, and what was fascinating is it just confirmed everything we knew, uh, at this powerful study, fruit, vegetables, the Mediterranean-like diet, reduction in, you know, red meat, animal fat, ultrarocessed foods. So it was confirming everything we've known, but now in a whole new study, and it's called the optimal diet for healthy aging. So I, that's one thing. The other point about it is, um, we don't, as we get older, we don't want to be light on our protein intake, but we don't want to be too heavy either. You take too much protein, which you got to work at getting, but there's at least some people out there advocating these super high protein diets, wrong, because that promotes inflammation and promotes aththeroscerosis. So, um, you, you, you don't necessarily want to be at the the recommended dietary allowance of 8 grams per kilogram. You want to be maybe around 1.2, but you sure don't want to go to, you know, 2.0 or higher, which is what, um, some of the people out there have been without data, you know, to to preserve your muscle mass as you age. But then you go into other things like, you know, what type of exercise, resistance training is really important, and it doesn't mean there's no such thing as 10,000 steps, you know, it's like, no, no one ever, there's, you even less than that, you even weekend warrior exercise is great, and then sleep, the sleep thing is wild because we used to always think that, you know, how many hours did you sleep? No, it's about how much deep sleep you got, which we, which is reduced with aging, and also people take drugs like ambient. Uhhuh. which backfires. Okay. They, they sleep, but turns out that sleep is how you get rid of all your toxic waste products in your brain that promote inflammation. So if you take ambient, it, what's amazing is you sleep more, but it blocks the elux of these toxic, um, uh, chemicals from your brain. It's like the worst thing you could do. I didn't know that. It probably extends to all the other drugs because that's the only one that's been carefully studied. So, I knew that, I knew that sleep helped sort of rewire the connections in our brain a little bit, but I didn't know that it was literally cleaning out toxic chemicals. Cleaning out. That's what it's all about. And so, you don't get deep sleep. Um, it's actually extraordinary. Uh, and there's interactions with our heart rhythm and and the elux of these waste, but drugs don't help at all. They, they seem to make things worse, especially the one that's most commonly used. So you can learn how to get better deep sleep. You know, you can, you a smartwatch or a fitness band or, um, you know, the aura and other rings, and you can, you can train yourself to be okay. So that's, that's crucially important. So say more about that. So like, uh, because everyone says sleep is good. I like sleep. It sounds good to me. But this, the fact that the drugs are counterproductive and nevertheless I can train myself in in what sounds like a more natural way actually, and that the smart watches are actually helpful, that that sounds important. Yeah. Because turns out if you start tracking it like I've done, um, what you can see is h, I had terrible, you know, amount of deep sleep, and of course it does reduce as you age, and men are generally less than women. So I was kind of in a high-risisk group to start. But what was interesting is by trying different things, uh, I could see, oh wow, I'm getting more and more and more deep sleep. So for example, I never was trying to go very precise about, you know, when I was going to go to bed each night, and you know, try to get into as close to a ritual as possible. That makes a difference, you know, your clock, your biologic clock. Other things like, you know, attending what what exercise you're doing, what what you're eating, how late in the day you're eating, and so, you know, so many things, interactions that you can start to see the pattern without AI, and with AI, of course, it even be better, uh, we don't have that yet, but we will anyway, um, each person can learn about, um, getting better deep sleep, and it's really important. And, um, I, I don't want to skip over something you mentioned already, but it's worth emphasizing, which is the ultrarocessed foods. Like, that's something that's hard to avoid in the United States of America in the year 2025. Hard to avoid, but easy to reduce. Okay. What, what counts as ultra processed?\nOh gosh. Anything that you don't have in your kitchen that's nor, you know, normal ingredients for, you know, good home food. Um, so you can tell pretty, you, you kind of do a smell test or a sight test. If you look at a package and you see lots of ingredients, that's a bad sign. Okay. Okay. Um, and there's different types of ultrarocessed bad things. There's some of these are emulsifiers like, you know, zantham gum, and but if you don't recognize this stuff, Yeah. it's bad. It's bad. And what again, it goes back to that theme we've been talking about is promoting inflammation in our body. No less our brain and putting us at risk there. It's like the opposite of what we've been talking about is increasing the risk of the big three age-related diseases. Yeah. Now, the average American takes in 60% of their food is ultrarocessed, which is the highest in the world, I'm sure. And, um, a friend of mine who wrote a book, Ultrarocessed People, Chris Vantelin, who's a UK physician, uh, scientist, he, he did a 30-day test of maximizing ultrarocessed food intake and a brain scan before and all these inflammation markers. And what happened was, you know, he gained, uh, 20 pounds. He had big time inflammation in his brain in 30 days of this, and he had all these off the charts inflammation blood tests. So the point being is that it makes you eat more. It creates much more inflammation, and if you just are careful about what you know, the food that you intake and includes beverages that they have added stuff in them, particularly, um, then you can reduce this. It's not hard to get it down to 20 or 30% instead of 60 or 70%. Do you have a feeling kids eat it that gets up to 70 or 80% of their diet? Yeah. Do you have strong feelings about what are marketed as nutrition bars? Like, you know, these little bars that have everything good for you in them, but it seems like they're probably pretty processed. Most of them are horrible. Okay. Horrible. You look at them in the greens. The other day, um, person gave me one that I said, \"Oh, wow. This one's pretty good.\" It was, you know, just truly natural. Nothing added. But you have to really read the labels, and some of them that are widely used, uh, uh, marketed, uh, that you think, \"Oh, these are great.\" Just, just be open-minded because you'll find that those labels are The good thing is that labels exist. Yeah. And the bad thing is they got lots of ingredients that you don't recognize. Okay. All right. Eat a carrot. I suppose I guess I'm not going to be surprised. Carrots are great. Yeah. um and the so okay, I mean, even though it is obvious, this is very, very good to be reminded. It's not obvious, but it's it should be well known that eating better, uh, alcohol not actually good in anything other than the tiniest doses, right? Yeah, I think there's a lot of debate about that. Um, the question is what is a moderate, um, a dose, right? You know, I recently had a patient and his wife, I was seeing them, and just before we were wrapping up, the wife said to me, \"Is it okay if he has continues his moderate drinking?\" And I said, \"Well, what is the moderate drinking?\" And he and she said, \"Well, he has two tequilas and six beers each night.\" I thought she was joking with me. I thought she\n\n\nwas joking with me. Well, that's a lot. Uh, yeah. So, the question is, uh, what is moderate? And you know, if it's two drinks uh on each of a weekend day, you know, because it's help social interactions and it's enjoyable, there's probably little data to show that that's harmful. Sure. Okay. On the other hand, if you're drinking every day and you're having, you know, a fair amount of intake and, you know, usually it's more than people like to admit or think. Um, anyway, that that when you start getting to high doses as you've point as you pointed to, that's a problem. And I guess the other thing to sort of wrap things up, um, the other thing that struck me in the book was your talk about uh, mental health and social interactions. You have a very vivid graph, um, that you reproduce that basically, if I read it correctly, says after age 60, people are either alone or they're with their partner and they don't interact with other people that much, and that's the contributor. Absolutely. And it got worse during the pandemic. People just living in a cave, especially the older, the more likely, but it's still the a big problem that annated the pandemic. And this is really bad for your health. Really, as it turns out, the connection of that with bad outcomes is striking. So, um, for mental health, but obviously, as you well know, everyone knows, um, there's a lot of interactions between our mental health, our stress, and our physical health. And, um, for mental health, but the more social interaction, less isolation, the aversion, uh, um, to uh, loneliness, these are really important things to strive against that again going back to that um, feature patient of mine. She has, you know, she plays Rummy Cube for every every week with eight of her friends. There you go. All in their 90s, you know, and that's a good thing. And she, you know, frequently interacts with other people in her um, retirement uh, community building. So, these are things that are really much more, they seem like social science, but the data are striking, and so we really should pay attention to it. Is there any truth to the idea that if I just if I solve puzzles, if I do the cross word puzzle, if I keep my brain active in that way, play video games, uh, read novels, does that help at all with aging?\nWell, that's an interesting question. You know, the studies are mixed. There's a new one coming out that says the more you work as you get older with um, technology like iPads and computers, that's it's actually better, you know, which is interesting. Okay, good. I believe, but uh, brains just like humans are meant to be interactive, um, as a social as we are really a social animal, even though people like to not be that way. The same thing is stimulating the brain has got to be good for you. M, uh, proving it is tricky because, um, you know, the we didn't have the right tests, like for example, what I'd want to know is that biioarker we had for Alzheimer's, which is can it be improved by exercise and diet? I want to see that biioarker go down with um, this brain stimulation, but no, no studies like that have yet been done. Interesting. Okay. It seems like an obvious thing to do. Why haven't they done that one yet?\nbecause these are new. You know, we didn't have a brain organ clock until like the end of 2023. I see. Okay. So, it's these are studies are going to be, and then we can ice it and we can say, \"Hey, you know what? These things are really good for you.\" And you know the other thing, Sean, it might be really good for you, but not for another person. Of course, it it none of this stuff is like all one one size fits all. And we have to keep that in mind, too. And to bring it home, uh, that's another place where AI might be useful, right? In personalizing your regimen, whether it's diet or exercise or mental activity. That's exactly right. So that you we would know in general the things that would help, but then by tracking these different metrics over time in people who are at high risk, the AI can say, well, this is what's working and this is what you know the gaps and this is what's going to change. I call it precision medical forecasting.\nWe it you you may know this, but AI has radically changed weather forecasting. It hasn't been implemented, but now you can have 99.99% accuracy in weather forecasting like we've never had before. I mean, most of the time it seems like the weather forecasting is, you know, pretty far off, but that's going to be changed quickly because multiple groups have shown that now with these large language models, multimodal data, you can get such remarkably accurate uh, weather forecasting. Well, we're about to do that for people for their health. And that to me is even more important than the weather. Recognizing patterns, that's what they're very, very good at. And I'm sure so we can finally all agree that listening to the right podcasts is probably the best thing that can help you live healthier, longer life, right? Uh, you got it. No, this this has got to be the one. This is definitely stimulating the mind. So that's good. That's all we can ask for. Eric Topol, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape podcast. Thanks for having me, Sean.\n[Music]\nHeat. Heat.\n[Music]\n",
