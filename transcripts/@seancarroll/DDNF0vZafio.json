  "cleanText": "Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape podcast.\nI'm your host Sean Carroll.\nSpecial treat for Mindscape listeners.\nToday we're going to finally figure out this consciousness thing once and for all.\nNo, we're not actually.\nSorry about that.\nThat was false advertising.\nWe're going to talk about consciousness yet again.\nUh, it's not something that we're going to ever in the course of a one-hour long conversation quite agree that people who have different opinions about this are going to see the light, but we're going to come closer and closer with every episode.\nThat's all I can actually promise.\nYou know, it wasn't that long ago we had Kristoff Cook, famous neuroscientist on the show, and we talked a lot about consciousness, in particular, uh, the neural coralates of consciousness and integrated information theory.\nWe touched on the idea of pansychism, which we've talked about before on the podcast.\nUm, the idea that consciousness is everywhere.\nUh, but we didn't really give it a full airing out.\nSo I wanted to kind of give that idea, maybe not pansychism per se, but the idea that consciousness is a fundamental ingredient of reality rather than just an emergent level.\nUm, something that we use to describe the collective behavior of matter when it becomes sufficiently complex and self-referential and so forth.\nRather than that, what if consciousness is the starting point for thinking about the fundamental nature of reality?\nI'm very, very honest that I don't think that that is the right idea, but I do think that it's useful to think about that kind of idea and I wanted to sort of give it a fair hearing.\nSo today's guest, Annaka Harris, uh, is the author of New York Times bestseller Consciousness: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind.\nAnd more recently, she's done, you know, in the sort of exploratory fashion.\nShe came up with an audio series, aka a podcast, called Lights On: How Understanding Consciousness Helps Us Understand the Universe, where she talks to a bunch of people.\nI'm included.\nUh, actually there's a bunch of people who are former Mindscape guests who are included and she gets a lot of different opinions from physicists, from neuroscientists, from psychologists um about what consciousness really is.\nAnd she talks about how she has made the journey from someone who was closer to my own point of view about these things with consciousness being emergent to someone who is very sympathetic to the idea of consciousness being fundamental.\nAnd we talk about why anyone would believe such a thing and what is the benefit of doing it, what is the motivation for doing it, um, from both thought experiments and real experiments and things like that.\nSo, we had fun with it in the sense that we knew we weren't going to convince each other either way, but that's okay.\nWe can still talk about it.\nWe can discuss the ideas.\nThat's what we're all about here.\nSo, as usual, I want you to listen uh and decide for yourself what it is that you think, which perspective you think is the most convincing, the way forward, never ever putting a credence of 100% or 0% on anything, but keeping an open mind.\nAnd with that, let's go.\n[Music]\nAnnaka Harris, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.\nThank you so much for having me.\nI'm I'm honored.\nTruly.\nWell, especially thank you because you know that you're, you know, walking into enemy territory here, right?\nLike we all know that uh we've talked about these things before.\nWe come out opposite sides, but I really um uh appreciated your new series and how you try to talk to a whole bunch of different people with different points of view.\nSo, why don't you just before we forget mention the series and and what caused you to think of this particular medium?\nAh, yeah.\nUm so, it's called Lights On: How Understanding Consciousness Helps Us Understand the Universe.\nUm, and you know, I didn't even know what I was making when I started out creating this project.\nUm, I had finished um, publishing and promoting my book called Consciousness that came out in 2019.\nUm, and I just realized that I was left with so many questions and I wasn't quite ready to move on to a new topic yet.\nUm, and actually a film producer friend of mine came to me with this idea, loose idea for a film.\nAnd I suddenly, it's like all I needed was permission to start recording the interviews I wanted to record.\nI had no um faith really that a movie would ever get made.\nI mean, I don't know that world, but I know it takes forever to to do those things.\nBut I thought, \"Oh, he just gave me my dream project, which is talk to all the scientists and philosophers I want to talk to, ask all these questions, keep thinking about um uh you know, the these things that that I can't stop thinking about.\"\nAnd the idea was to record the conversations and then use the transcripts as um templates for dialogue for for this, you know, potential film.\nAnd what he realized when I was a few weeks into this process was that we would have all this audio and it's much easier to make a podcast than a film.\nSo, you know, maybe we'll make the film down the line, but I I'm creating a podcast.\nAnd so, then it became clear that I was kind of on this journey and I was narrating my own story of my process of thinking and my evolving thoughts.\nUm, and so I realized it was more like a documentary of kind of my story of trying to understand these concepts.\nUm, and so we were calling it a podcast documentary.\nBut then lo and behold, McMillan, um, the publisher from my publishing world that I that I'm so comfortable in and and understand were interested in in doing this as as an audio book.\nUm, so yeah, I mean, the format doesn't really matter.\nIt could it could have really been called any anything.\nUm or it could have been called, you know, a lot of different things, but I knew I was making an audio documentary.\nAnd so, yeah, the the the content didn't change over time, but the the format that we put it in did.\nWell, it's interesting because people have different ways of communicating their ideas.\nAnd there are books, there's writing where we're very careful.\nI just got an interesting question, my own AMA.\nYeah.\nUm the other day about why does your voice or at least your way of talking sound different in the AMAs than when you're reading your own audio books.\nAh, interesting.\nAnd of course, I I I attribute it to the writing being different, right?\nBut but I think this is, you know, this is one of the nice thing about podcasts, uh, you know, my form of interview podcast, but also you have a much more polished production here, but you're you're getting people's viewpoints, you know, a little bit more viscerally, right?\nA little bit closer to\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nAnd actually, you know, it's funny because I'm much more comfortable writing.\nI I'm a nervous wreck right now because I don't trust myself to communicate my ideas well in the moment um through speech um you know I I end up doing an an okay enough job of it but I'm really comfortable writing and so but I wanted to have these conversations and I was recording them and so I ended up being able to write the narration which kind of explains um you know more in book form where I you know what what thoughts I was having what questions I was having, where the answers were leading me.\nUm, and then use this audio that\nYes, it does.\nIt's interesting because there were times when we needed to re-record things.\nUm, and I really had a hard time re-recording something that had happened in real time because it's not my reading voice.\nAnd yeah, it's it is different.\nAnd did you find through the course of talking to various people with different attitudes like do you think that are we making progress on this whole consciousness thing?\nDo you do you do do you see consensus coming or\nI would say I would say yes.\nUm I I think so you know I think there's a lot more progress to be made and I think it's one of those topics that is really hard to say whether we can ever make the kind of progress we want to make.\nUm but I mean there's progress just in the sense that when I started writing my book Consciousness um I was afraid to share my questions with other scientists.\nThat's where we were.\nUm, so we're definitely at a place now where um, many scientists are open to having this conversation, realize that even if it doesn't seem as mysterious to them as it does to some other philosophers, that there really is there really is something here that we haven't explained that that would be nice to explain.\nUm, and yeah, and I would say, you know, and it's true for myself.\nSo, I've been in the sciences for over 20 years now.\nI did not start out with the view that I have now.\nIt really um transformed a lot over the last 20 years and and more.\nUm and I'm now meeting other scientists.\nBrian Green was one, a total surprise actually, who you know, I think he he basically feels the same way you do about it, but he's able to appreciate the mysterious nature of consciousness in a way that he wasn't earlier in his career.\nAnd so I think um that that is huge progress just um those of us who wouldn't have even considered it really something interesting to think about or ask about um noticing that there's science has some work to do here.\nYes.\nUm and it's an interesting problem that's different from every other scientific problem we have faced.\nSo what is your favorite definition of consciousness?\nYou knew that.\nIt's actually I was thinking about this with you because I was going over some of the um I was going to say arguments but they're they're fun always our debates um and I realized that we might be defining it differently and that may might be part of where we have um diverged in the past and so yeah so when I talk about consciousness and and and the truth is you know we could even change the terminology because the way some people use consciousness is not the way I'm using it.\nSo, um, most people when they use the word consciousness, they're thinking about, um, complex thought, complex life, self-awareness, often an ability to self-reflect.\nUm, I think part of that may be, well, we'll get into it, but I I I'm was thinking about some of our conversations, I'm wondering if when you were saying consciousness, you were pointing more to those features.\nUm, and the thing that I think is really mysterious and that most of the time when I'm talking about consciousness, I'm using this other um, definition or more basic definition which is just the fact of felt experience.\nUm, so it could be something that is not self-aware that is not a complex thought.\nIt could be you know if we imagine I often give worms or snails or some type of simple insect as an example you know if there is consciousness there this neuroscientists are kind of split on this but if a bee is conscious or a fly is conscious you know they have a brain and a central nervous system um I would not imagine that that a fly is self-aware or has thoughts or language um but could maybe you know even I think simpler than than a fly would be something like a worm where maybe you know if I had to guess what the conscious experience is it would be of pressure, maybe of temperature change, um maybe even of something more complex like like hunger or fear, you know, depending on the circumstance if it needs to, you know, look for food or get away from something that could cause it harm.\nUm but yeah, so so so my definition and the thing I'm interested in, whatever we call it, is really just the fact of felt experience.\nWhy is it that some systems in nature feel like something from the inside?\nKind of have this perspective um where the feeling itself cannot be directly observed apart from the feeling itself.\nSo I think I would have said if you just give me that definition I would have said sure I understand at least you know we can debate oh what what's the best definition but I think I understand what you mean but somewhere in there you're drawing a distinction between that and awareness like how can I be the worm feeling pressure or fear without being aware of it.\nYeah.\nUm well I guess it I mean awareness is a tricky term also.\nSo you can mean different things by being aware.\nYou could, you know, I tend to use it um synonymous with consciousness.\nI when I say awareness, I'm usually meaning a felt experience of awareness.\nSo I could talk about my computer being aware of the audio input and the visual input and you know whatever processing is taking place, but I'm not imagining that there's a conscious experience associated with with that processing in the computer.\nSo awareness, you know, could be talked about in non-concious processing where, you know, it's just a a um combining of information or a form of digital memory or something like that.\nUm I feel like now I'm not answering your question.\nYou were saying how could how could a worm be conscious without being aware?\nYeah.\nWell, it sounded like you were trying to put awareness at like a slightly higher level of complexity or sophistication than mere self.\nI may have said self-awareness.\nSo being aware of oneself um which is usually how people think about consciousness you know consciousness happens in very you know complex life forms like human beings um there's even this test that we do with with other mammals you know are they aware of themselves can they see themselves in the mirror that that sort of thing um but I'm talking about something much more basic than that got it that's very very helpful okay thanks and we do like you say we feel it from the inside um\nso you you You mentioned how science is making progress and we're going to get to some scientific progress but is there are there whole bunches of progress to be made kind of without doing neuroscience you know can we can we make progress so I mean I think I think it it really as far as my imagination can go it has to be informed by neuroscience um but no I think if we are led to believe that consciousness felt experience um if it goes much deeper in nature than even insects and worms um or to plants or even you know deeper than that um we start crossing over into other realms of science and I and it's why I talked to so many physicists for for my audio documentary because I wanted to know where this might be headed if we actually start to think it makes sense to assume that consciousness goes kind of beyond what we categorize as life.\nAnd what would that mean for physics?\nAnd and how would what would physicists have to say about that?\nAnd is there any way in which this can actually affect the physics we do or are we kind of just always um going to be limited by observation and experiment the way we traditionally have?\nBut I do I I try to let my imagination go wild in the very last chapter of my my documentary and it's called the future of science.\nUm, and I suggest some ways this this might go if we're convinced again that um that it\n\n\nIt's rational to, well, let me, let me take one step back because I think, um, kind of where my starting point is, um, is realizing with, uh, working with neuroscientists over the course of about 20 years, um, realizing that we have actually assumed that consciousness arises, um, in complex life forms, and that we don't have as good evidence for that as we think we do, and kind of pulling apart those intuitions that lead us to assume that.\nNow, as I've said, I also made those assumptions.\nI still think it may be correct.\nUm, but we're not really on as solid ground as I thought we were in making that assumption, and that I realized we kind of are forced, because we don't know our starting point, we're really forced to either assume that it arises at some point, it emerges, um, at some point in nature, um, or it's fundamental to nature.\nIt's either in all systems or some, because we know the answer isn't none, right?\nAnd so, because we have, we have evidence of at least our own conscious experiences.\nUm, and so the more convinced I became that we could be very wrong in this starting assumption we've used so far, that it arises out of complexity, um, what would happen if we, you know, still we could say we don't know, we don't have to believe that it's fundamental, but what if we just assumed, how, how would that shape, uh, the phenomena we observe, the phenomenon we observe, um, how would that shape science going forward?\nAnd so I just kind of let my imagination run wild and then started to come up with new questions, um, for neuroscience and neuroscientists and physicists, which is, you know, what, what my documentary is about.\nBut it kind of became this question for me, if consciousness is fundamental, and then, you know, dot, dot, dot, so how might we interpret this phenomenon in nature, right?\nSo in this picture, which, you know, offends me to the very core, but that's okay, I'm sorry, very, that's cool, but I, I will say, I will say that I was completely with you for most of my life, and yeah, there's a way, there's a way to see this, I believe there's a way to see this that's not offensive, even though it still sounds crazy to me coming out of my own mouth.\nYou're more advanced than I am.\nI'm still trying to catch up, and that, but that's okay.\nBut, but I still, you know, am very interested in understanding it.\nSo I think that the interesting thing you're saying here is that if we take, you know, forget about whether we should, but if we take the view that consciousness is fundamental, then rather it being an outgrowth of some complex information processing system, blah, blah, blah, it manifests itself in certain ways when the complexity is there to let that happen, but it's kind of always there.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, which again, I know that sounds crazy, and I kind of can't believe I'm even suggesting it, but the deeper you get into the neuroscience and what we've learned about the brain so far, the more you realize our intuitions for that starting assumption really break apart pretty quickly.\nSo, one thing that that is, you know, kind of obvious, but we don't really think about, and I think is interesting in the context of all of these other intuitions shattering, um, I think results of modern neuroscience is that we are the most complex systems we know of in the universe, right?\nAnd we also know that we can't tell the difference between loss of memory and loss of consciousness, that we're completely dependent on this stream of memories, um, you know, to think all the thoughts we think, to be human beings, right?\nAnd so we have this sense that because we are conscious, and we're the most complex systems we know of in the universe, and you know, let's say if there's a felt experience associated with my, the processing in my liver, let's say, but that never enters my stream of memory, um, I'll never be able to report on it.\nIt's not part of the I, I'm referring to as I, right?\nAnd so we're kind of left in this situation where it makes sense that we would assume, um, that consciousness is part of this, um, complex processing.\nBut the truth is, we have, it's the only thing we have access to, and the only thing we can communicate to other systems like us about.\nWe have no way of getting information from a system that is too different from us, because the communication completely breaks down, and so there's no, there's no way to report.\nUm, this is even true in a single brain, which I was one of the pieces of neuroscience that I found most interesting and most intuition shattering was the split brain research.\nAnd so you can even have a circumstance, I don't know how familiar you are with, with this research.\nLet's assume the audience is not, okay.\nOkay.\nSo, um, do you want me to kind of explain from, from the beginning?\nYeah, because this, this to me is where my intuitions started to really break down, and I started having interesting thoughts about where, where else in nature we might find consciousness.\nUm, so split brain patients, um, it's less used now, I don't think there are very many of them now.\nUm, but a few decades ago, it was a wonderful, actually, treatment for epilepsy, for people who were experiencing, um, ground mouth seizure, seizures that would, um, sorry, would spread from one hemisphere of the brain to the other.\nAnd if they can be contained, if the seizure can be contained to one hemisphere, um, it's much less dangerous, much less life-threatening.\nAnd so they develop this procedure, um, by which they would actually disconnect the left and right hemispheres.\nUm, they would, they would sever the corpus callosum, the, um, the center where the information between the left and right hemispheres, um, is shared.\nAnd what they discovered, um, through a series of experiments, and I can describe one or two if you'd like, but what they discovered was that, um, it seems as if when those connections are completely severed, there are now two islands of consciousness, two kind of centers of processing that seem to feel like a self.\nAnd so there's kind of, it's almost like the person is split into, um, conjoined twins or something, where the left hemisphere is one person and the right hemisphere is another.\nWhat's interesting is that in most people, the left hemisphere is where the language center is, where this, where is responsible for speech.\nAnd so it's interesting, these patients after the surgery seem actually to be very normal.\nIt's why it was, um, so successful and such a wonderful, um, tool for people who, who, um, were being threatened by, by these seizures.\nUm, when you talk to the person, they can speak normally.\nThey can have a conversation with you.\nThey can tell you how they feel, what they want for lunch.\nUm, what's interesting is when they figured out they were able to actually interrogate the right, right hemisphere by other means, using Q cards, having the person point with their left hand, because the left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere, they discovered that the right hemisphere had different answers, different opinions, different tastes than the right hemisphere.\nNow, we can't know for sure whether there was consciousness associated with that.\nBut the truth is, in the same way that I can't know whether there's conscious experience associated with you, you know, I mean, I assume there are enough arrows pointing in the right direction for me to assume that's the case.\nAnd so, even in a single human body and brain, you can have a circumstance where, um, you're talking to someone, they're telling you, \"Oh, yes, I feel that.\nNo, I don't feel that.\nYes, I saw that.\nI did not see that.\nUm, I want granola for breakfast,\" and all the rest.\nAnd there's actually another part of that body, of that brain that is seeing things the left hemisphere isn't seeing, that is, you know, having thoughts, having opinions, all of that.\nUm, but never can get communicated to the outside world except through these experiments.\nThey were able to figure out ways to interrogate.\nUm, but again, if we wanted to understand if, you know, there's any felt experience at all associated with the Venus fly trap, um, we have yet to, um, find ways to communicate anything sufficient to even, you know, be able to guess whether something like that is conscious.\nAnd so, so if there was some, I've been rambling, you go ahead.\nIf there's a tribe of human beings that only ever heard music come out of stereo speakers, they might naturally think that music was a feature of stereo speakers, not that it was just, uh, the medium by which it was being communicated.\nSure.\nSure.\nYeah.\nI never thought about that.\nOkay.\nSo, um, I mean, I'd have to think about that more.\nIt's probably not such a direct analogy, but, but yes, it's, it's, you know, consciousness is something different from everything else that we study in science, you know, as I said, because it can only be known from the experience itself.\nSo, we're completely reliant on, um, report, an ability to report, but then also an ability to communicate.\nAnd the split brain patients, yeah, didn't even themselves know that there was another conscious creature.\nWell, I mean, they, they became aware of it when they were part of these studies and they could see internal dialogue.\nIt was, yeah.\nI mean, they could see that their, you know, left hand was answering questions correctly.\nUm, yeah, but no, in terms of their conscious awareness, it does not enter that hemisphere of the brain.\nAnd so it's just not part of that stream of memory.\nAnd so for them, you know, if you ask them, are you conscious of, you know, I just flashed a picture of a card, are you conscious of it?\nThey would say, I didn't see any, any right, any card.\nThere's no, there's no picture at all, yet there is another part of their brain that what was that did see it.\nAnd so it's tricky when we try to interrogate even different systems in the body, you know, when, when we say, you know, or when we undergo anesthesia, when we go to sleep, you know, I'll say I, I wasn't conscious, um, but was there consciousness present that just didn't enter my stream of memory that enables me, me, you know, the, the I call me to report on it.\nOkay, so anyway, that was the big, that was the beginning of my starting, starting to wonder if our intuitions about what consciousness is and, and where we'd find it are, are maybe throwing us off.\nRight.\nGood.\nYeah, that's very helpful in make helping me make those connections there.\nSo, because ordinarily we would use people who were under an anesthetic, a general anesthetic as an example of not being conscious.\nYes.\nAnd you're saying, well, how do you know?\nRight.\nThis is the problem with consciousness is we just can't really ever know.\nNo, I mean, we can, we can make better and worse guesses, I think, but even with anesthesia, you know, there's this fascinating phenomenon that I talk about in my book and in my audio documentary, um, something called anesthesia awareness, where the, um, uh, the paralyzing drugs take effect, but the drugs that are meant to make the person unconscious, um, do not.\nAnd so the, the person is completely paralyzed.\nThey have no way to communicate that they're fully conscious.\nThis is, you know, my worst, everyone's worst nightmare.\nUm, many people come out of this situation, um, with severe PTSD for understandable reasons.\nUm, because they then experience the operation or, you know, whatever they've, they've been given anesthesia for, they have the full experience, um, the pain, the sights, the sounds.\nWell, if usually their eyes would not be open, but yes, they're just as, as awake as you or I are right now, but completely paralyzed and unable to communicate.\nAnd so, you know, that, that's another good example.\nThey're also examples of something called locked in patients, um, where they have certain brain damage.\nThe, the same, um, same situation they're in, where they are completely paralyzed, there's no way for them to report on these conscious exper, this combination of communication and report that we really rely on, and noticing becoming like coming face to face with these circumstances where there's a human mind that I can relate to that is just like me, but on the outside, you know, there's zero behavior, if there's any behavior, you know, we could put them in an fMRI machine, we could see you electricity essentially, and which reminded me of plant biology, and you know, I do not have an intuition that that plants are conscious.\nIt does actually sound crazy to me, but I had to let myself challenge my intuitions and say, okay, um, you know, essentially what's happening in the brain is similar to what's happening in a plant, and it is the transfer of information, um, through electrical signals, and is it possible that consciousness, the felt experience, is associated with that rather than the more, the more complex?\nSo where did you come down, where do you currently come down on the plant question?\nIt's a provocative one, obviously.\nYou know, I will, I will just say I don't know about all of it, honestly.\nI am continuing to, um, ask these questions and investigate.\nI am open to everything, every system being conscious all the way down to the most fundamental.\nAnd so that's kind of where I let myself go in this documentary until the last two chapters, where I just really go with it and say, \"Okay, if consciousness truly goes all the way down, what does this mean for, for the future of science and how might we be able to get, yeah, more clarity on this?\"\nWe've gotten this far in the podcast without using the P word, panpsychism, but that is, that is, that's where you're, I know I never use it anymore.\nPeople have been, I never use it anymore because I don't like it and I don't think it's useful.\nI see.\nOkay.\nActually, I don't even know if you remember, but it's probably something that didn't catch your eye, but other philos, but philosophers in the room caught it, which was, um, at that conference that you and I attended together, I, I gave a talk and one of the slides was actually panpsychism with the word crossed out.\nYou know, it was like a panpsychism circle sign with, right.\nOkay.\nGood to know.\nAnd I try, I tried to convince them, I'm sure I didn't convince a single person, but that it's not, so it's not such a useful framework, um, for thinking about these things.\nBut I mean, I guess we'll get, we can still talk about it.\nWe'll get to there later.\nBut you do.\nSo panpsychism literally means consciousness is everywhere or mind is everywhere, I suppose.\nYes.\nAnd that does sound pretty close to what you were, it does, and I'm not, I'm not really opposed to it.\nAnd yeah, and the truth is, you know, I think idealism, panpsychism, you know, technically my view certainly has crossover, if not, you know, falls into, um, part of my issue with these frameworks is they were developed so long ago before we understood anything about how the universe works.\nUm, and so the types of conclusions they tend to draw just don't sound realistic and scientific to me.\nAnd I'm, I'm very much a science-minded person, and I would like this topic to stay within the sciences.\nAnd I'd like, you know, if, if it's possible that consciousness goes deeper in nature, I would like to have our best tools and our best minds, you know, trying to\n\n\nI think this will affect the future of science.\n\nAnd so it's something we need to keep in that realm.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo, some of the conclusions that are drawn in those domains sound too new-age to me.\nI don't, I wouldn't, you know, make those assumptions about how the universe is structured.\nUm, I also honestly just have an issue aesthetically with the word panpsychism because it sounds like a new age word.\nIt does.\nUm, and it's also a word that was developed, I think, with the 16th century.\nYou know, it's just, yeah.\nUm, I also think that if, no, if those views had never existed, if no one had ever had this thought before, I truly believe that many people in neuroscience and physics at this point in history would be asking this question.\nAnd so I always just try to make the case that it's a legitimate question to ask.\nIs consciousness, um, does consciousness go deeper in nature than we've assumed?\nAnd is consciousness fundamental?\nAnd those can be scientific questions.\nAnd I think we'd be running up against them anyway, and we clearly don't know.\nUm, so something like panpsychism also, it kind of suggests that there's already a solution figured out, and I think we so clearly don't know that I wouldn't like to use an ism to explain this line of questioning.\nI think they're questions.\nGot it.\nThat that makes perfect sense.\nSo the plants you're not sure about.\nWhat about computers?\nUm, yeah.\nCould they be conscious, or is there going to be some point at which they can report the consciousness that they may or may not be experiencing?\nI know this, I mean, this is a really bizarre situation.\nWe are very likely going to be in soon, you know, however far down consciousness goes.\nUm, we're going to be very confused when the behavior of a system matches our behavior or the behavior of a dog or some living system that we believe is conscious, and how, how we will know.\nI mean, I, that's, that's a big question mark for me.\nI don't, I don't know.\nBut the truth is, I've really kind of crossed over into believing that if consciousness goes deeper in nature, it actually makes the most sense for it to go all the way down.\nSo I have kind of, you know, my, my list of questions quickly became about what, how do we interpret the, the physics we have, the science we have, if consciousness actually goes all the way down is the most fundamental feature.\nAnd so that's where all of my thought experiments and, and kind of where I've been living.\nAnd so I would ask, so I ask myself this question: if consciousness is fundamental, if every matter that we perceive, you know, everything that we perceive, all the light and the, you know, every and all the things we don't perceive, if, um, our perceptions are really a representation or a mapping of essentially other conscious experiences coming in and out of existence in the universe, um, my guess is that, you know, what the, what we deem the matter to be made of matters.\nAnd so the, the structure, we're getting some clues about the structure of things in our perceptions of them and in our mappings of them with the tools that the scientific tools we have.\nAnd so I think our conscious experiences are dictated by the structure of the matter, and computers are made of very different matter than we are.\nAnd so my guess would be, if consciousness is fundamental, yes.\nI mean, that, that would mean that there are conscious experiences, however minimal, um, coming into and out of being, you know, all around this room, throughout my body, you know, in my clothing, the, all, it's all, you know, at bottom, what we're describing is conscious experiences.\nUm, and so yes, that means that computers and AI and more complex systems would also entail conscious experiences.\nThe question is, you know, how similar to our own would they be?\nIn my guess is, they'd be so different, they would be unrecognizable to us.\nAnd so the weird, so the thing that kind of disturbs me most about AI when I think about consciousness being fundamental is that we will be building these systems that the behavior of which we usually take to be evidence of our own conscious experiences.\nWhen I talk to you about green and about the sound of a symphony and about my thoughts, I can, you know, I think it's, it's safe, it's a safe guess that you are mapping that onto a very similar conscious experience on your side.\nAnd so we've learned, and our intuitions have evolved to map those things.\nBut if we create systems that actually feel very, very different on the inside but behave the same way we do, I mean, we will just have no intuitions for navigating this situation that we're in.\nI mean, I, I, yeah.\nNo, I think it, that does follow.\nI mean, the question about whether a computer is conscious, yeah, is very different if you think that an abacus is conscious or a stick is conscious, or at least, well, and I think it's not quite right to think of those things as single things the way we think of a human mind as a single thing, right?\nUm, you know, there, there are reasons that we can kind of talk about a human mind and a brain as a system that, you know, experiences things, although, you know, ultimately, I think that's not quite the right way to think about it, but, you know, in abacus, we, we notice that as a single, um, object, but in reality, if, you know, if consciousness is fundamental, and you know, and even so, an abacus itself is really not an integrated system the way that a brain is an integrated system, and so I wouldn't expect the abacus to have an experience, but I would expect there to be, you know, countless thousands, millions of experiences coming into and out of being in the point in space and time that that abacus inhabits, you know.\nSo I want to ask about some of the implications of the idea that consciousness is fundamental.\nBut, but first, let me make sure that you, you have said what you want to say about the motivation for thinking that the split brains is definitely a part of it.\nBut, you know, what is your best argument for thinking that consciousness is fundamental?\nYeah.\nWell, I take 11 hours to make that argument in my documentary series, but I'll try to give a briefer one.\nActually, that, that reminds me of a couple of, um, neuroscientific discoveries, and actually one just anecdotal story, um, that were part of the reason I felt it was really important to question our intuitions about what consciousness is.\nAnd so I would say I haven't become convinced that consciousness is fundamental, but what I've been definitely convinced of is that our intuitions about what consciousness is, what causal function it serves in the universe, those intuitions come out of illusions.\nAnd we're relying on things that we actually, in modern neuroscience, understand to be illusions already.\nAnd those have not quite been integrated in, not only into the culture, but into the philosophy of the scientists doing this work.\nIt's very hard for us to integrate the things we have discovered about how the brain works into our, um, the way that we think about how the world works.\nUm, so one, one example, um, David Eagleman is a scientist I've spent a lot of time talking to, and he's also in my documentary series.\nFormer Mindscape guest.\nOh, okay.\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, I'm sure you talked about all the fascinating things he works on.\nUm, you know, there, there are lots of areas I could go in.\nIn the documentary, we talk about his work on, um, sensory substitution and sensory addition.\nUm, the, the story that he shared with me in the documentary is actually a little piece of research that I didn't even realize had been done.\nUm, and this goes way back to his early work.\nSo this is just, so he talks a lot about binding processes, and binding processes in the brain, um, connect the different inputs, the sounds, the sights, um, the sensations that all kind of come to the brain at different times, then get processed in different parts of the brain at different times, and then kind of get delivered to our conscious experience, um, as a single present moment event.\nUm, and even just these processes, the fact that this type of thing happens before we're conscious of them is something we haven't quite really grappled with properly, I think.\nSo, um, so he talks about the ability to kind of hack some of these systems.\nSo, um, they did this very simple experiment where you, the, um, participant pushes a button, and when they push a button, it makes, um, a beeping sound.\nSo their brain, you know, very quickly, it's a simple, um, exercise, learns that when they push the button, the beep happens then.\nAnd I think that actual, that processing actually takes something like 500 milliseconds for the brain to coordinate those two things and then give you the experience that, okay, I push the button and the beep happens because out in the world, those things are actually not happening at the same time.\nUm, and so, so his team, David Eagleman's team, started, um, inserting very brief pauses, um, that were too brief for the brain to recognize, and it just kept making adjustments, which is what the brain does all the time to help us integrate all these different, um, signals that are coming in.\nSo it started entering a delay, so that you push the button and there's actually a delay between the time you push the button and the sound happens, and then they introduce more and more and more of a delay.\nYour brain has adjusted for this.\nSo you still have the experience.\nYou push the button and the sound, um, the sound is created.\nSo then if they remove the delay, they go all the way back, but they don't do it gradually.\nThe brain doesn't have time to adjust, and the person has the experience that the sound, the sound was made before they pushed the button, which it wasn't, but their brain tells them that it was, but that's exactly your experience, and you can't change your experience because your brain is just generating it based on its best guess.\nAnd so they created, I love this, they created, um, an unbeatable rock paper scissors game where they gradually introduce, you know, a pause, then they take it away, and, and so the computer actually knows what your hand is, um, before, so it has time to make, to make the right guess.\nYou get the idea.\nUm, but this exposes, you know, just a, just a small, um, window onto how our conscious experience of the way things are happening, um, is not a direct perception.\nAnd it exposes how so many of our intuitions about consciousness, um, come from these limitations, um, of what we're consciously experiencing.\nAnd so, um, conscious will is another area that I spend a lot of time talking about in the docu series because we tend to have this intuition there.\nThere are many illusions that are kind of wrapped up into one, and, and to my mind, they are all related to how we view consciousness.\nSo the idea of conscious will, the idea of being a self, um, that is solid across time, which is also another thing that is, that is basically generated by the brain.\nThere's a change blindness that happens across time.\nYeah, that causes us to feel like we're this stable entity that's kind of, um, you know, consuming our conscious experiences over time, rather than them being generated a new in each moment.\nUm, and again, because it's the thing we are conscious of and the only thing we can talk about or think about because it's the only part that enters this stream of memory that we have access to, we're kind of led to believe that all of that is what consciousness is.\nAnd so my first question was really, is it possible that consciousness is much more simple than all of this?\nUm, and because there are all these, um, neuroscientific studies that that show us that what we experience to be our conscious experience is really at the tail end of most of this brain processing.\nUm, it's not causal in the way we feel it is.\nUm, we think we've evolved consciousness be based on the behavior we think it's associated with, when in reality, it's possible, um, that it's simply how these processes feel, but the processes are just playing out, and the conscious experience of them is not necessarily the thing that that's driving them.\nOkay, so I want to, I, I get all that.\nI think it's super important, and it is probably, like you say, underappreciated.\nUm, I want to hear, therefore, we should take consciousness as fundamental.\nAh, okay.\nSo again, I mean, takes, takes longer than a podcast interview to get all the way there.\nBut once you've realized the ways in which we could be wrong about our assumptions about what consciousness is, and you start asking where does it make sense for it to emerge in nature, um, what I discovered was that you run into paradoxes wherever you try to place that emergence, and that you run into the same arguments for why it doesn't make sense to assume there.\nAnd so it's kind of like it just by necessity goes all the way to the bottom.\nThere's, there's no place at which it makes sense to put it.\nAnd so I became convinced that the most rational answer was all the way down.\nAnd I, and I became convinced of that really against, against my will, as it were.\nUm, and it's only after kind of marinating in this for the last 5 years that I've kind of started to develop an intuition for it and can feel how it makes sense.\nBut yeah, it was really just logical thought experiments that brought me there that I had to kind of fight my, my rational mind and my intuitions on.\nUm, and that actually, you know, I think I could be wrong about it.\nAnd it was, I'm, I'm sure I mentioned to you when I called you up to, to record a conversation for my docu series.\nUm, I don't want to waste time.\nSo, I'd like to be talked out of this, you know, and so I, you know, I've been attempting also to talk to people who disagree with me, um, so that I can see if there's an error in my thinking.\nSo I can see if, you know, it actually, there's, there's a good reason to not actually follow these questions any further.\nSo if so, good.\nSo that, I think you, you've motivated it very, very well.\nUm, then the question is, can we build up a sensible understanding of what it implies to say this?\nSo, of course, my, the, the constant thing that I've talked about, and, and you've heard me talk about is, look, we understand how atoms behave.\nWe, we understand those laws of physics very well.\nAnd part of that is, part of that behavior of atoms is that I'm made of atoms.\nAnd when I'm talking to you here, when I'm reporting my conscious experiences, I am a collection of atoms obeying the laws of physics.\nSo absolutely.\nHow in this understanding do my conscious experiences affect my behavior, my reporting, my, my physical moving around in the world?\nHow, how do your conscious experiences affect those?\nYeah.\nIf, if consciousness is fundamental, and you think that, you know, consciousness, I don't know, I think consciousness might actually not be causal, but I don't know, this is one of the questions I have, and this is something I spend a lot of time thinking about and talking about.\nUm, you know, if consciousness is fundamental, it clearly has a structure for all, all of the reasons you just described, like we've, we've discovered a lot of the structure already.\nUm, it clearly is not just a free-for-all.\nUm, but if what all the physics and mathematics describes at\n\n\nAt the bottom are this range of conscious experiences that arise in the universe.\nUm, yes, it has this structure.\nAnd one question, um, I have when I really get into the weeds on this is, is it possible to have conscious experience with no content?\nIs there something that, you know, that consciousness, you know, that that thing is that has, you know, a structure to it, or, you know, the equation in in many worlds for the Schrodinger, the Schrodinger equation.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThe for the what is it of the universe, the the wave function of the universe.\nThe wave function of the universe.\nThank you.\nSo if the wave function of the universe, um, is not just a mathematical term and an idea and kind of a a force that that is kind of moving things, but is actually in actuality felt experience, um, and then it generates all of these different forms and things that come into being, um, that in actuality are just different types of conscious experiences coming in and out of being.\nUm, I, I'm not sure.\nI imagine that thinking about things in those terms might change the way theoretical physicists think about things moving forward.\nAnd I think that will have to be in combination with experimental results.\nI think we'll have to start doing some very new and interesting science to at least make us as confident as we've been in in neuroscience that that consciousness arises out of complexity.\nUm, to, you know, to take it seriously and see.\nBut I, it's interesting to me because I actually think it generates a lot of creative thinking.\nIt, it does kind of open up new avenues for thinking about things at the fundamental level.\nUm, I have no idea where they will go.\nI do not claim to have the kind of mind we'll figure any of this out.\nBut I think it's kind of a paradigm shifting, um, it's a paradigm shifting framework that could inspire new ways of thinking about, uh, quantum mechanics, the the findings of quantum mechanics.\nI don't, I don't know if you, if you listen to the whole thing or have heard me say that actually many worlds to me is the best way to describe, um, is the best interpretation of quantum mechanics if consciousness is fundamental, that it actually resolves a lot of issues that that you run into.\nJust trying to, you probably don't like that, you're like, leave my, leave many worlds out of it.\nShameless pandering, but we know we encourage that here on the podcast.\nAgain, against my will because many worlds was not something that that naturally resonated with me.\nYou know, I, I followed string theory for a long time.\nI, I like, you know, aesthetically, I like string theory better, but I had to admit that many worlds actually fit better with my view of the universe if consciousness is fundamental.\nSo, let me, let me ask it this way.\nUm, as I said in my talk at that conference that you, um, talked about, organized by Philip Goff, another previous Mindscape guest, um, to me, the very first question that has to be answered by anyone who wants to talk about the fundamentality of consciousness is, do they think that it will manifest in some change of what we understand as the fundamental laws of physics for the just the behavior of stuff, or does it leave the behavior, behavior of physical stuff completely as we currently understand it?\nOh no, I think it absolutely leaves the behavior of physical stuff the way we understand it.\nI think, I mean, my, the way I'm approaching this and the way I think about this is completely from a physicalist perspective.\nIt, it is, um, and deferring to the science we have already.\nSo, you know, in, in my mind, if I run some thought experiment, or if, you know, we go down this path and it, it's kind of counter to things that are already well established in physics, we rule it out.\nUm, whether it can actually help move physics along, I really don't know.\nI can imagine ways that it might, um, but I don't know.\nSo then the worry I have is simply, not, not the worry, but the question I have is simply, um, if I didn't think that consciousness was fundamental.\nYeah.\nBut I had the same idea of the laws of physics and that I am made of atoms.\nYeah.\nEverything I do would be exactly the same, including all the reports I have about how I feel and how I'm experiencing things and and love and pain and all those completely unaltered by whether or not this picture is true or false.\nWell, yes and no.\nI mean, mostly yes.\nI think to, um, physicists who are trying to reach a deeper understanding, I think there are possibly places to take this that could take the many worlds interpretation in in new directions, um, and and potentially give us, um, a better sense of what it's telling us about the structure of the universe.\nBut I also just think as human beings, you know, it's like every time there's a paradigm shift, I actually think it inevitably changes everything, including science in ways that we can't even predict ahead of time.\nSo, you know, I, I often will give the analogy of, you know, our intuition that the earth is flat, you know, and then celestial observations give us a clue that maybe this isn't flat, and eventually we have all the evidence we need.\nUm, and while it doesn't necessarily affect my day-to-day activities, um, and the truth is most of the time it's not relevant.\nUm, I do think there's kind of this background feeling of our place in the universe and how we navigate the universe to know that outer space is out there and we're orbiting the sun and we have a deeper, better understanding of the way the universe is structured with all of these unanswered questions.\nBut at least, um, I feel myself to be living in a different universe than someone lived in when they believed the earth was flat, right?\nAnd so I think these things, um, have a way of, I don't know, affecting our future thoughts and creativity and help progress science even when we're not necessarily paying attention to them in every moment.\nYeah.\nNo, actually that, that part of it I like that very much what you just said, because I've said many times on the podcast that there can be with just within physics, two different ways of talking about or mathematically formulating exactly the same theory with all the same predictions, etc.\nBut by taking one perspective versus another, extensions or modifications of those theories are naturally suggested to themselves.\nSo, so what you're saying, so I think that's very clarifying because certain other panpsychists, whose names I won't mention, uh, refused to answer this question that I asked.\nBut you, you answer, I'm not, I'm not a panpsychist.\nYou answered me very nicely.\nI mean, yeah.\nWell, and I also think it actually makes a difference, you know, if we, if we at some point down the line have more reason to believe it's fundamental, the consciousness is fundamental than it is emerging in complex life forms.\nUm, I don't know what kinds of questions that will provoke in the next generation of scientists, but my goodness, that's a very different world, right?\nAnd yeah, I mean, I'd like to know which one is more likely, and it will affect my, my questions going forward.\nAnd so yeah, no, so I get the argument that the, the reason to sort of take this perspective seriously is that it opens up and suggests new research avenues going forward.\nSure.\nEven new moral questions, you know, it's, I think it's just there's a, there's a world of unanswered questions.\nIf it's in fact true that consciousness goes very deep in nature, right?\nThen suddenly there's a new dimension to things that we haven't really thought about.\nYeah.\nI don't know if you know the work of Jonathan Birch.\nHe was a recent, um, guest that we had.\nHe's a philosopher.\nListen to that episode.\nHe is, uh, the world's leader in animal sentience.\nM.\nSo he intentionally doesn't use the word consciousness just because it's fraught, right?\nAnd he says, you know, there are people who won't believe that, like you say, an earthworm is conscious or whatever, but sentience is maybe a little more sciency sounding, and you can, yeah, that is that is always the word I, I choose to use also, yeah.\nAnd so, and he tries to make an argument that again, even if you, I, I like the idea, I think I don't know where he comes down personally, but his philosophical argument is, even if you think it's okay to kill animals and eat them, that doesn't mean it's okay to hurt them.\nYes.\nTo cause them pain.\nAnd I think that's, you know, again, people can agree or disagree.\nHave to listen to that interview.\nThat sounds right up my alley.\nLogically coherent perspective, which is I really liked.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, it's similar to, um, the plant biologist I spoke with, Daniel Chamovitz.\nUm, that's I believe chapter 4.\nUm, you know, he also really struggled with this because he is, he is a well-respected scientist who, you know, does good science, um, and as he discovered these similarities, um, in the types of proc, you know, when plants are processing light waves or, um, sound waves in the form of like a, you know, mechanical stimulus, and he was finding it, he was finding himself using terms, terms like hearing and seeing, but not wanting to confuse them with human hearing and seeing, but the truth is there, there are these sense modalities that, um, you know, again, at the molecular level, he actually, it's funny, he talked about, I don't think this made it into the documentary, but he and I were talking about how his, he comes from a family of doctors and how he was the rebel and he went out to to become a plant biologist, and he realized, you know, it's, it's all part of the same thing.\nHe ended up kind of doing the same science in a way because, um, you know, you can, you can give anesthesia to a Venus fly trap and it blocks the information flow in the same way that it does in a human brain.\nAnd yeah.\nUm, so yes, he, but he and he had a hard time knowing how to talk about those things.\nAnd I think he really was wondering whether there were, there was sentience or felt experience, um, not consciousness in the way we usually think about it, but the way I talk about it, he, he really thinks it's, it's likely that plants have some form of that.\nUm, you know, again, they don't have the same systems that we have.\nThey probably don't have me, they have some memory, but not the type of memory we have.\nSo if there is felt sensation, it probably comes in and out of existence very quickly.\nUm, but yes, yeah, I think this, this leads directly into this question of what, what would be the new research questions and directions that get opened up by this perspective.\nI mean, if you go back to the abacus, you said, you said something very provocative that the abacus sort of isn't a coherent self, right?\nThe abacus, you might have pieces that are made of fundamental consciousness stuff or whatever, but the abacus doesn't cohere into a self.\nSo, yeah.\nYeah.\nWhat does, what you do?\nDo you have opinions about this?\nLike, when do we have a self?\nYeah.\nUm, I don't know.\nI thought a lot about this.\nI've written a lot about it.\nI think it's, um, uh, related to memory.\nI think highly dependent on memory, although not completely dependent on it.\nUm, I think, you know, if consciousness, uh, is fundamental, I think there's something, um, you know, Adam Frank, the, the physicist and I had this conversation about the cell, when a cell comes into being, a single cell, um, that essentially the cell and the bath of chemicals it's in come into being in the same moment because they're in relationship to run.\nThere's no bath of chemicals if there's no cell, you know, and vice versa.\nAnd that in order to keep this the, the borders that it has and to let in the things it needs to let in and maintain itself as a system, um, that that's kind of the beginning of self, and I would say that's self without memory.\nSo just distinguishing, you know, the system from the the bath of chemicals or, you know, the outside world.\nUm, I'm forgetting your specific question.\nI feel like I, at what point does the coherence of the system qualify as being a, Yeah.\nYeah.\nNo, so I think, I mean, I think it largely has to do with memory and distinguishing a system from, you know, the thing that is keeping the system going.\nUm, I also think though that at most levels, even the idea of self is an illusion.\nUm, at the level of the human mind, too.\nSo, um, I've talked about this a bit in my work where you, you know, our present moment experience is is based on this neuronal firing that's happening in every moment.\nUm, I have this sense that there's kind of this solid me that moves through time.\nUm, but the truth is this new experience is being generated a fresh, a new now that is obviously influenced by previous moments.\nUm, but it still has to be brought into being in each moment.\nAnd so I, I make this analogy to an ocean wave that, you know, we, we call ocean waves waves as if, you know, it's a single thing.\nUm, a friend of mine actually just said something very sweet that he was at the beach with his daughter and his, they were looking at the waves and his daughter said, \"I wish we could take one home.\"\nUm, and he joked and he was like, \"Let's get a bucket.\nLet's bring one home.\"\nAnd and that kind of, you know, um, shows the illusion there, which is that we call it a wave, but it's a system in nature.\nIt's an ever, it's a ne everchanging, never- ending system in nature.\nUm, and that is true of the electrical firing of the neurons as well.\nAnd so I'm not sure that self, and and I actually think that the, the concept of a self, the fact that we feel ourselves to be selves is one of the things that get in the way of our being able to think clearly about consciousness because I think we often equate consciousness with self.\nUm, so yeah, I don't know, that was a weird answer to your question, but I'm basically saying I'm not sure there are selves to begin with.\nDo we get or that the, that the illusion of self is created by, um, a system that carries memory across time?\nYeah.\nDo we get insight into these questions by some combination of meditation, um, psychedelics, things like that?\nThings that give us a different perspective on our inner workings.\nUh, I think so.\nI mean, maybe not as directly as as other people might suggest.\nUm, I think meditation absolutely because it does something very interesting, which is expose a lot of these illusions, you know, in the same way that David Eagleman's work, you know, you can run these experiments and expose the way the brain works, um, meditation is an interesting thing to do, it's very, um, counter to the way the brain normally is is operating, um, and so I think it has a similar effect of kind of c, you able to catch these illusions in the act of being creative.\nAnd so the illusion of self is something that that regularly drops out for people when they've been practicing meditation for a while.\nUm, and you know, that I think that's that's the most important one.\nBut there, there are others as well.\nAnd it just, I think it changes our normal everyday experience of being a human being so much that it enables us to be more creative in in our thinking.\n\n\nAnd and to notice when we've made assumptions that we consider to be fact that are that are actually assumptions.\nUm, and psychedelics is a very interesting one too.\nI have a lot of questions about those experiences.\nI really don't know.\nUm, I think the most useful thing about them for myself and people I know who've taken them is again a similar thing to meditation but on a much more um impactful scale I think is having an experience that is so different from your typical human everyday experience causes you to realize the range of possible experiences even for a human brain that are far beyond anything I had ever known, possible and are very hard to describe and so what experiences might be possible in other systems.\nI think it enables you to be um yeah to to think differently and more creatively.\nWell, I I kind of like that in the sense that you know it's not suggesting that psychedelics or for that matter meditation somehow give us some closer data about the fundamental workings of reality so much as they they nudge us out of our dogmatic slumbers a little bit.\nYes, you said it so much more eloquently than I did.\nBut yes, I stole it from a money con.\nSo, uh, so that that I that I would say yes to the to the first piece to the second piece maybe and I don't know and I have questions about that.\nAnd so, you know, I think it's interesting that on psychedelics, people have experiences of a spaceless, timeless kind of consciousness, which I think is more in line with what physics is revealing to us than um, you know, than our typical everyday experience of space and time.\nAnd so maybe, you know, maybe we kind of generate over time as our brains evolve.\nWell, our brains don't evolve, but as they develop um to operate in our in our circumstance where we need to survive and survival is the the main focus.\nUm that it's possible we there there is a more direct line to the outside world that kind of gets pruned away into a more useful line into the outside world and that psychedelics help us kind of access something that is more direct.\nBut that is all those are like big question marks I don't know but these are things I wonder about and think are are possible.\nI mean maybe then as a last thing to ask um do you have much of a suggested future research program for how we should be thinking about these things?\nIf if it's true that this perspective suggests different questions, how do we go about answering them?\nUh experiments.\nSo I do I do go into this in the in the final chapter of my docky series.\nI think um I really think the first place to start is kind of where David Eagleman has headed um with sensory edition.\nUm, and I talked to a participant in a study where they were given an experience of magnetic north.\nUm, so you know, Eagleman's work has largely been about helping blind people and deaf people find other ways for their brains to process light waves and sound waves.\nUm, but this is bringing in a new um, perception altogether.\nI think I also like the idea of scientific endeavors which whether consciousness is fundamental or not will be useful.\nOf course, that'd be nice.\nUm, but I think these all kind of will help us get better intuitions for answering questions about how how deep in nature consciousness goes.\nSo, I think, you know, ultimately we only have our intuitions for determining where consciousness is to begin with.\nYou know, I can communicate with you and we can talk about our shared experiences.\nSo, one is was having shared experiences.\nI can't talk to a person who was born blind about the color red.\nI mean, there's just no way we're, you know, we're not going to get anywhere.\nUm, and so having a shared experience is important and then having the language to be able to to talk about those experiences.\nSo, I think the more things more human beings are able to perceive and get intuitions for, I think that could be useful to science anyway.\nYou know, we all of our perceptions give us some clue about the physics of things and then we we go on from there.\nBut the more things we can actually process directly, the more intuitions we can develop for them.\nUm, and I'm hopeful that we might be able to um, experience systems in nature that give us more of a clue one way or the other if they're conscious.\nAnd so, you know, we have limited ability to communicate with our pets, but there's enough crossover that we we make the assumption that there is consciousness there.\nAnd so, I think if there would be some way for us to um experience and therefore communicate with plant systems um or you know, other systems like that.\nI don't think I can't imagine how we could ever know conclusively because the truth is I can't even know conclusively that you're conscious and so we're kind of limited.\nWe seem to always be limited in that sense.\nBut if we could um produce tools that give us new intuitions that make me feel as confident that um you know an insect or a a a much simpler system in nature is conscious in to the extent that I believe you are conscious.\nI think that would be very interesting.\nCould virtual reality be any help?\nProbably.\nI haven't thought much about it but yes.\nAnd and Annel Seth is actually working on um some things that I think yeah are are related.\nUm yes, absolutely.\nAll right.\nWell, I'm looking forward to understanding all this consciousness stuff.\nWe have to get the next generation on this because this is going to take a while.\nI mean, I've had several podcasts and we still don't agree on exactly what consciousness is is is doing to us.\nBut Annaka Harris, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast.\nI really appreciate your interest in this, especially since you're you're allergic to my conclusions.\nIt's something I really appreciate and respect about you.\nIt's about the journey.\nAll right.\nThanks very much.\nThank you.\n[Music]\n",
