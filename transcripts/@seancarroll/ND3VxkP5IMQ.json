  "cleanText": "Hello everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. One of the things that we've talked about many times here on the podcast is the idea of looking for life elsewhere in the universe, on other planets or moons here in the solar system, like Mars, Europa, Titan, maybe on exoplanets further away. And there's a bunch of obstacles to finding life elsewhere. We haven't found any yet. We've had some hints of clues of things that might be life-related, but certainly nothing directly that could be characterized as life. Partly because it's hard, right? Because you have to either fly far away or look very indirectly using some kind of signal spectra or even sample returns from some nearby planet. But the other thing that is making it hard is that we're not sure what to look for.\n\nThere are characteristics that life has here on Earth that you can hope to find somewhere else. But maybe life somewhere else is still life, but nevertheless is very, very different, and therefore its characteristics or its signatures might be completely different. So you would think that one super obvious strategy would be to make sure that we understand life here on Earth really, really well. If we're trying to understand the entire space of possibilities for what life could be, and to a certain extent, we know a lot about life on Earth, right? We have whole departments of biology and so forth in our universities, all devoted to studying life on Earth because we don't have any examples of life elsewhere. But it turns out that there's still lots of life here on Earth that we don't know a lot about. And today's episode is about one kind of life here on Earth that we don't know that much about compared to what we really would like to know.\n\nToday's guest is Karen Lloyd, who is described as a microbial biogeochemist at USC. And just that description should tell you that there's clearly a lot going on here. She has a new book coming out called Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth. And the basic idea is that Karen studies life that exists underneath the surface of the earth. So not just in the oceans or water or whatever, which counts as underneath the sea level, but there's still a surface below that. This is below the surface of either land or sea, okay? Literally in the crust of the earth, sometimes kilometers deep. It turns out that as far deeply as we can dig into the earth, we can find life. We can find little microbes, little bacteria and archaea. Uh, two different kingdoms of microbes, as Mindscape listeners have heard before. They're there. They're there. They apparently live longer and move more slowly. They're a little bit more scesscent than life here on the surface of the Earth, but they're there. Their biochemistry is a little bit different. They can take advantage of different kinds of food and fuel sources.\n\nUm, they move at different rates, and they're very clever about using the resources that they have access to. So the fact that those things can exist here on Earth certainly informs both questions about how life formed here on Earth, the origin of life, but also what life might be like somewhere else. And it turns out, to nobody's surprise, that these terrestrials are they're related to the organisms that we know. Don't get me wrong, as far as we can tell, we've not yet found an intraterrestrial or a little microbe beneath the surface of the Earth that is completely separate from the rest of life on Earth. But you're also not surprised that they're different, right? They've discovered different strategies, different evolutionary pathways that they've taken. So, we're just beginning to study these little critters, and we're learning a lot. And I think that that's going to teach us a lot about what life is like now here on Earth, what life was back when it started, and what life might be like elsewhere in the universe. These are all very exciting questions, and you're getting in on the ground floor here in this episode. So, let's go.\n\n[Music]\n\nLloyd, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Thank you so much for having me. So, you're telling me there are whole species of life forms dwelling deep beneath the surface of the Earth. That sounds a little scary. I know. And but it's not just like a couple species. It's a lot of species, like billions of species. And furthermore, it's not just, you know, a couple of extra types of things that are related to E. coli. It's deep branches on the tree of life. Whole phyla that are not found elsewhere. Phyla being the plural of phylum.\n\nYes. And think about a phylum. I know this isn't something that I know everybody like had to learn it in biology classes. I always learned King Phillip came over from Great Spain. So it's kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, species. Um, so if you go up that chain up to phylum, that's sort of like a very deep evolutionary branch. And so things that are in different phyla have very different ways of living. So, um, I think I always get confused about the animals, but I think that inverte or all vertebrates are a phylum. That's that's our phylum. So basically us and turtles and everything with a backbone, we're the same phylum. So it's like we're discovering these new phyla, um, you know, tens of them. I like that you that you always get confused about animals, but you're you're up on the little microbes that we have deep beneath the surface. I know it's hard to make it all match. I mean, like humans just showed up like five minutes ago, right?\n\nYeah. So, before you even get to the little microbes down there, you know, how deep are we talking? What What is it like down there? Yeah. So, we can talk about different levels of deep because in some places what I consider to be the subsurface starts pretty shallow. You know, if you if you're at like a mud flat, you know, the stinky backside of a barrier island or something, and you like dig your toes down a little bit, I think you're already there. Um, because the question is, are you in a stable enough environment that's sufficiently remote from steady inputs of oxygen and light? And if you are, then you're in the subsurface. So, I think it starts like a couple centimeters down or even millimeters in some places, but then as far as it goes, we don't super know. Um, we found life many kilometers deep down, but we don't have a lot of samples from things that deep. When you say we found life, is this literally from drilling and and looking, or is there some other way?\n\nYeah. So, we've got sort of two main ways we can get at the deep subsurface life. We can drill down to it, which, as you can imagine, is incredibly expensive. And one of the best ways to get down there is to sort of have it be run by profit. So, um, if you can connect yourself up with a mining company, that's a good way to get deep subsurface samples. Um, but another way is to wait for it to come back to you. So, I do a lot of work where we use hot springs as like it's real gross, but kind of like squeezing a pimple, you know, like when you when you run two continents against each other, which is what happens in all of our subduction zones along a lot of our coastlines, you get things like earthquakes, you get things like volcanoes, and you also get things like hot springs because you create all this pressure, and with this fluid comes up the deep subsurface microbiome. Okay.\n\nBut so again, what I, as a non-geo person, like anything smaller than a galaxy, I think is kind of kind of weird for me to think about. So when we're kilometers, like number one, how many kilometers deep do we know about? And number two, that's still the crust of the earth, or are we down at a lower level? Yeah. So it's we're talking about the crust. Um, so the crust is somewhere 20 kilometers to 200 kilometers deep. Um, and we, you know, we can make the sort of M&M candy, uh, cutaway pictures of Earth that I'm sure everybody's seen, with the core is on the inside, and then there's that big mantle, and then there's that thin crust around the outside, which is actually quite deep if you think about it from biological terms. You know, uh, hundreds of kilometers is actually a lot of depth. Um, but we've never actually drilled, like humans have never drilled below maybe 10 kilometers.\n\nOkay, good. Never, like, for any reason, not just for biology. Um, and that's something that I think hasn't really, it's it's maybe something you wouldn't realize because, like, oh, well, we know so much about the mantle, and we know so much about the core, certainly someone has sampled it, like, no, no one's ever been there. So it's all indirect through earthquakes, seismology, things like that. Yeah. Which is, I mean, not to put those down. They've created a beautiful image of what's down there. Okay. But you need to actually dig down there, and and have you ever, has any drilling ever reached a point where we can look at there and say there's nothing living there, or do we keep finding life forms along all along the way? Yeah, it's always hard to conclude there's nothing living in a place. Okay. Including Mars. You know, as far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out. Um, I I don't think that we have found life on Mars, but I don't think that we have not, we have found definitive proof there's not life on Mars. So it would be the same thing for the subsurface. Okay. We will, we will get to Mars definitely over the course of the podcast. But here on Earth, so it's entirely dark, obviously, down there where we're talking. Is there any uh, flow of either water, or are the sort of rocks kind of on super long time scales moving around in some way?\n\nUh, yes to all of that, depending on where you're looking, because it, you know, what's underneath our feet is actually quite varied and kind of an interesting place. Um, it's not a place that it's easy for humans to go, but if you're tiny, there's a lot of options. So on continents, there's aquifers, um, which we use for drinking water. Um, there's even deeper aqua aquifers that we would not use for drinking water because they're full of nasty chemicals and stuff that we don't want to use. But those things can be useful for microbes. So some of these aquifers, like for the ones that are um, capped by the Canadian shield, have been isolated. That water is like billions of years old. That the water itself, which is crazy to think that liquid water has just hung out liquid for that long. So that that's one possibility. Um, there's other places where you get an influx of lots of energy. Um, like these continental collision zones, so subduction zones or continental margins, like, for instance, the the Andes, that great, beautiful, super tall mountain chain that runs pretty much the whole way down um, South America on the west side is driven by the Pacific plate going underneath that continent. And that pressure sort of basically makes the volcanoes happen. And so in the process of two continents colliding, there's a lot of activity, and there's a lot of chemical reactions. There's uh, tectonic reactions. Um, there can be a lot of uh, hydrogen produced through a process called serpentinization, depending on what type of rocks are being subducted. And that's a that's a great reaction because just rocks and water, and it makes everything you need to run life, which is kind of amazing. I But then there's also the boring places, too, where nothing happens. Nothing happens. Oh, okay. Good. That that's something. Um, but I got to ask about the billion-year-old water. I mean, the idea of water being billions of years old actually isn't shocking to me in terms of the water molecule could be billions of years old. But you're saying that it has been preserved in liquid form, basically untouched for billions of years, which probably is shocking. It never became rain. It never became ice. It was never snow. It was never a cloud. And why, always in my simple-minded way, like, why isn't this water all been squeezed out by now? Like, why is it still hanging kilometers below the surface of the earth?\n\nUh, that's more of a ge, I don't, I don't know. I don't want to venture too hard and like you, that's fine. I'm Yeah, I I want to, I want to not veer too far. I sort of have to work, I collaborate a lot with geologists who provide the context for this stuff for the most part for me. Okay, good. But we can, we can think Oh, I understand there's a big Canadian shield sitting on it. It's hard to get out. Yeah, that that Yeah, that's perfectly plausible. So, um, are there temperature gradients from place to place, or is it more or less uniform everywhere?\n\nYeah, there's huge temperature gradients, and temperature is something that ultimately will limit life as we know it, because at some, you know, everything we know about so far is carbon-based life, and at some high temperature, you're not going to get carbon molecules holding together in the way that we know that they need to to to have life function. So that is going to be a limiter at some point. Um, we just, you know, sometimes that gradient happens really shallow, like if you're standing in a volcano, it happens at your feet, right? So, we we do want temperature gradients, but we don't want the temperature to be too high. And and you're saying that lots of the Earth's lithosphere, I guess, uh, qualifies for that. Yeah, it's probably just too hot. It's probably just too hot. And Okay, so what kind of coverage do we have in terms of digging deeply and looking for life forms? Have we sampled the whole surface of the earth, or is there still a great uncharted territory? It's a massive uncharted territory. I mean, it's just if you, I think people, um, wonderfully, are getting a good feel for how unknown the oceans are. And that that is absolutely the case. Um, we just don't know a lot about what's in the deep sea. And I I work in the deep sea, and that's that's one of the mysterious places that I that I try to crack into. But when you study the deep sea, you can toss a bucket off the back of a ship and take a sample. And you can do that all day long, or you can do that for weeks on end and get lots and lots of samples of deep deep waters. I mean, it's hard to work in. Um, but it's possible. We can't do that on in the crust. We can't just like throw something over the side and like have it drop down because it's ground. So getting those samples is always going to be slower and more laborious than working in the ocean. And so we I I think it is just a fascinating frontier. And\n\n\nWhen you go to different places and dig and find some little microbe, do you find different kinds of microbes in different places, or is there kind of a uniform population spread over the Earth's surface?\nYes to both. Like all your options, you're giving me, like, for all these questions, are like, yes to everything. The thing is, is like, it's this whole world down there. It's like a second Earth buried underneath our Earth. So there are places where we see different types of microbes in different places. That is definitely true. There does seem to be some, like, endemic populations that are only found in the place that we find them. But we have a couple of weird instances, and I still have trouble wrapping my brain around this, but there are some deeply buried aquifer microbes that seem to have an unchanged genome all around the world. Called the Sulfurox vi. And I don't know why I didn't do this work. This is my colleagues, but I've I've talked to them about it, and they're like, \"Yeah, we don't know why either. We find it very unsettling.\" We're going to get the podcast transcribed. So, could you say that name again more slowly?\nThe sulfur rutus adoxiator. Wow. Okay. It means, um, it means bold traveler. Bold traveler. Well, because presumably the resources are very different down there, right? I mean, they're going to be optimized for a very different environment than the bugs we have up here on Earth. Yeah. Yeah. There's not a lot of oxygen. Um, there could be some oxygen, but for the most part, there's not much oxygen. And you know, if you think about what drives the powers life up at the surface, it's the sun. I mean, pretty much everything flows from that. Even though we're not photosynthetic, we're absolutely dependent upon plants. But in the subsurface, there's no photosynthesis. There's no sunlight. And so all of that activity has to be fueled by chemical reactions. But the nice thing about the chemical reactions is that there's a just a gigantic variety of them. There's just a ton of options because if there's one thing they're rich in, it's minerals and metals and things that have a lot of redox power. So, they can be oxidized and reduced chemically. Okay. So, yeah. So, tell us about what we know about the life forms. I mean, I guess, uh, you said already there's a lot of them. I mean, I don't know whether it's better to go by mass or by number of cells, but tell us how much life is down there.\nWell, we, we, um, estimates, of course, these are any of these big numbers would be estimates, um, are about 10 to the 29, uh, living microbial cells in the subsurface, and they're small. So biomass-wise, they're not going to beat, you know, the total number of plants up at the surface, um, because plants are plants are big, but, um, but really, it's a gigantic ecosystem, and to be as undescribed as it is, um, you know, it's, it's a lot of cells. I, I usually say it's 10,000 times more than the estimated number of stars in the universe. What do you think? Okay, that's good. I, uh, that sounds right. Yes, that definitely does sound right. I think maybe 10 the 23, 10 the 24 is the number of stars, but I would have to look it up. So I think, I think you're on the right track. But then you have to say, like, what's a star versus one microbial cell? That's right. Equivalency is kind of interesting. And are we, you know, when we, when we pull them up? I mean, sorry, let me, let's just be like very down and dirty about what you do. Do you go to a oil well or something, and you like put a little claw on it the bottom of it? Like, how do we get a sample from down there?\nThere's a bunch of different ways. Um, one is to take a drilling ship and go out in the ocean, and basically this drill string, it's like, um, it's just a big pipe. It's like a big metal pipe with a really, really angry, angry-looking drill bit on the front of it. And you put that thing down there, and you basically, like, drill through whatever you need to drill through, and then you send down pipe after pipe. And if, if it, if the drilling is going well, you can actually do advanced piston coring, which is where you make a, you detonate a little explosion at the seafloor, and it forces, um, like a big stroke, and it forces this pipe down further, and you can get, like, 9 meters in just, like, a couple seconds. And so that's, that's the cleanest sample because you don't need to actually drill and provide fluid and stuff like that. So that's, that's one way we get samples. And this is done specifically for scientists like you. This isn't, you're not parasitic on something else.\nUh, again, yes to both. Okay. Yes. I mean, we do everything we can to get these samples. Um, I, I, I will say, I don't know how much you sort of want to talk about current current events, but we, we have, um, the Joy Day's Resolution is the name of the ship that we use to do this drilling in the ocean, and it has sunset. It was time for it to to go, and the US was, uh, supporting that ship, and the United States does not have plans to replace it. Um, so China has built one. Um, but we don't have one in the States anymore. That just isn't, it's a capability that we no longer have in the United States. And we've always been a leader in deep sea drilling, but it's gone. There you go. Okay. For someone picks it up and saves us. Well, you know, maybe this is send the podcast out there, and who knows what will happen. Um, and then so when you pull the sample up, what do you do? You bring it back to the lab.\nYeah, you, well, usually if you're talking about at sea, you know, we have these labs on ships, basically, and so we, um, for these deep drilling operations, we split the core in half, and then you go down the length of it, and you take subsamples. So it takes these processing these samples is always slow and laborious and takes a lot of people, and you just kind of everybody comes in with their different sampling equipment and takes their piece, and they measure chemicals of all different sorts. They measure gases, and then they take a microbial sample to grow things, a microbial sample to look at their DNA, their RNA, things like that. So, we just try to, we try to measure everything we can when we get these precious samples. And when you find little microbes from deep below the surface, are they, how related are they to the ones up here on on the surface? Are they recognizable, or are they something completely alien looking?\nSo, at first, now they're recognizable because we have been digging there enough that we can compare them to each other. But when we first started getting them, um, you know, I, the, the ability to use DNA from the environment to infer what's living there is something that only came into popular usage in the early 2000s. So, this was when I was a graduate student. And I got my first samples from, uh, deep sea mud from the Gulf of Mexico. There was a methane seep. I thought I was going to be studying the organisms that use the methane because that's that's the biggest signal that we see there. And I, I looked at the DNA sequences that I had, and they, they didn't look like anything at the surface. They didn't, I, I thought I was a terrible scientist. Like, I really was like, \"Oh my god, I'm never going to get a Ph.D. because I can't even do the simple task of figuring out who these, these organisms are.\" And then it turns out it wasn't my problem at all. It wasn't me. It was that we were all collectively discovering new stuff, and, and nobody had ever seen it before. So we actually have complete DNA sequences of these little critters.\nYeah. So fast forward to now, technology has really moved. I mean, we, our field has been moving really, really fast. Um, it's very, I think it's very impressive. Um, we can now pull out whole genomes from these little critters without having to grow them. So we can look not just at their entire genome. We can also pull out all of their messenger RNA molecules, which that is the molecule that basically says, okay, what proteins are going to get made? We can pull out their actual proteins and see what they're doing. So we can infer their lifestyles from all of these biomolecules that we can pull out from, from, you know, deep sea muck. And do they fall into the traditional categories? Bacteria, Archaea, maybe viruses, I don't know. Uh, kind of. Yes, definitely viruses. Um, which are weird and hard to characterize. Um, but they are definitely fall into bacteria. Um, there are some that fall into eukaryotes. That's our branch. Definitely fall into the Archaea. Um, but there is a branch of them that, um, has really upended our understanding of what things are. And this is, we've been calling it the Asgard archota. Um, this is one of the groups that I was finding as a Yeah, it was one of the groups that I was finding as a graduate student, and just like, oh god, I don't know what this thing is. Um, it has now been grown in culture by two labs so far, maybe more labs, and I just don't know about them, but, um, Chris Schleer's lab in Austria and Hiroyuki Yamachi's lab at Jamstack in in Japan have managed to grow this thing. And so it's really amazing to have hypothesized of the existence of these strange primordial weirdos, and then it's like, am I doing this right? Is my inference right? And now they're actually growing them, and yeah, they, they are strange and weird, and they're a little bit between the Archaea and the eukaryotes. So that's why that's my answer to your question. They're kind of making us question our our divisions.\nWell, I, I was going to ask, uh, in what way are they strange and weird? So, like, what does it mean to say they're halfway in between bacteria and Archaea?\nOkay. So, um, well, they're halfway in between Archaea and eukaryotes. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Good. So, if you back to, like, intro bio classes, we all had to learn the difference between a prokaryote and a eukaryote. Let's, let's imagine we forgot that. Yeah.\nLet's imagine that we've forgotten that since then. Yeah. No. No. I mean, I, I might have had that lecture, but I'm also old, so fill me in. Yeah. So eukaryotes have a well-defined nucleus. So they have all their DNA that sits inside an organelle. They have, well, we, sorry, we are eukaryotes. We have well-defined organelles, one of which is a mitochondria, which is the powerhouse of the cell. So if you look at, we tend to be bigger. Our cells tend to be bigger. And so if you look at a eukaryotic cell under the microscope, you'll see all of these little organelles within it that do different functions, and it's a very complex cell, and it always breathes oxygen because we're all dependent on oxygen. Although we can also do some fermentation. Um, we need oxygen or we die. All eukaryotes, that's, that's true. Well, there's some protests that are exceptions. But, um, then you compare it to the bacteria in the Archaea, and they don't have the the structures. They are sort of like little bags of goo. That's sort of how they're characterized in our textbooks. Um, they have nuclear condensation, like their, their genomes are in a specific region, but they don't have a a house around them. They don't have organelles. They're just, they're simpler. They kind of everything is out and floating around, and they're not as organized. Okay, that's, that's like where we were until we discovered these ones, these Asgards that we s first saw this in the DNA. They have the DNA for the cytoskeletal elements that we use as eukaryotes to make all these organelles. So just just with bioinformatics with the DNA, we all started saying, \"Hey, it looks like these things actually could have organelles in the same way that eukaryotes do.\" But they're not. They're Archaea. And one of the, one of the things that we know about how we got these organelles as eukaryotes, these mitochondria that we have that help us to breathe oxygen, is that we definitely got those, some ancestor of ours picked those up by taking in an alpha proteobacteria. Um, they, that we know for sure. Um,\nso the question is, who ate the alpha proteobacteria and became a eukaryote? And to all appearances, these are the direct descendants of that ancestor before it picked up the alpha proteioacteria that turned into mitochondria and became a eukaryote. And so they retain a lot of these features that we thought were only in eukaryotes, but now we're finding them in in Archaea.\nSo the Archaea, the sort of standard Archaea are like the bags of goo, but these Asgardians have the DNA to make compartments, uh, substructures within themselves, but they haven't yet gotten to the point where they have the mitochondria and are full-blown, full-blown eukaryotes.\nExactly. Exactly. And so since they have these elements that we thought were only present in full-blown eukaryotes, the question is, well, what in the hell are they doing with them? Why, why do they have them? You know, we, we know about them, like, running an endopplasmic reticulum and a Golgi apparatus and a mitochondria. What are they doing with them? And so figuring that out has been fascinating. We still don't really know, but now the first images are coming out from these cultures, and they are using them. They have structure. They, they're tiny. They're like, they're the width of visible light. Like, they're the amplitude of visible light. That's the size of their cell. Yeah. And, and they've got arms. So, and, and they're only so far found beneath the surface. Uh, they are There's one report that's out that someone found them up in the surface waters. Okay. So, what I've learned is anytime you think you've nailed down where something is and isn't on Earth, it's going to screw you. Yes. I don't care. I'm nature. I'm going to do what I want to do. Okay. Uh, but they are not for the most part. I, if you, if you, if you look at somebody's gut microbiome, you will never find this one. I don't think that they've colonized us. You will find, sorry, will you find both bacteria and Archaea in our gut microbiome? Okay. Absolutely. All the, all the methane that comes out of cows, that's all produced by Archaea.\nOkay. So, I mean, naively, since I can be naive, this is not my job. So, um, it sounds like this is a step along the way\n\n\nFrom archaea to eukaryotes.\nYeah, I would say it absolutely is.\nYeah.\nOkay, good.\nAnd and I love the mystery now that they because because biology, you know, evolution doesn't let you carry along all this extra equipment that you don't use, right?\nAnd so we're looking for the usefulness of it.\nUh I mean one obvious usefulness might be it's hard to live down there.\nYou know, tell us about the the sort of uh ecosystem that you have like what what do you what do you eat?\nWhat do you drink?\nWhere do you go for fun if you're um a couple of kilometers below the surface?\nThat's great.\nSo these guys um for the most part or the places where we find them in highest abundance tend to be um marine sediments that got buried thousands of years ago or longer where nothing much has happened at all.\nSo like if you can think about your your life what it would be like if you're on a particle you fall to the seafloor other things fall around you and then nothing really changes.\nYou get diffusion.\nDiffusion is where you go for fun.\nIt's like, hey, we got a hydrogen molecule this century.\nThat was exciting.\nSlow paced.\nIt's a, you know, it's a sleepy town.\nIt's a very sleepy town, but it's a huge ecosystem.\nSo, it's like, well, what are they all doing?\nWhy are they all sitting there doing nothing?\nSo, where do they get their nutrition from?\nSo, well, we're not totally sure, but the biggest form of nutrition would be what got buried with them.\nSo, the organic matter, the dead plants and dead phytolanton that got buried with them, they just basically eat it super super slowly.\nSo, it's like if you got given a pizza and then said, \"This is all you're getting for the rest of your life.\nMake it last.\"\nSo, that's that's kind of how they live.\nAnd there's definitely an idea that all of the time scales are much slower, right?\nUm, you know, there's there's no rush when you're down there.\nAnd I guess that makes sense because your resources are stretched a little thin.\nYou don't want to use them up too quickly.\nYeah.\nYou can't you can't rush.\nYou know, if you if you're late for a meeting and you want to run to that meeting, you may not run as quickly if you didn't eat breakfast, right?\nYou know, these guys have have never had breakfast.\nThey can't they can't speed up.\nSo they're just kind of chill.\nSo how how quickly do they reproduce for example?\nWe don't know.\nWell, okay, we know about the cultures.\nSo in the cultures, they will divide.\nEvery cell will divide every couple of weeks.\nAnd how does that compare to things we see up here on the surface?\nInsanely slow.\nLike every all the bacteria like normal microbiology like when you talk to a microbiologist and say like oh you've got a culture how long does your your culture what's the cell division rate of your culture they'll usually say something like oh it's really fast it divides every half hour like ecoli or they'll be like it's such a pain in the butt it takes two hours to divide but you still it means that you can start a cell culture at the end of the day go home go to bed and come back the next day and then you'll have a nice fully grown sample waiting for you to work on.\nUm, and that's true for the vast majority of things that we study in lab, including the archaea.\nYou know, I used to work with a a methanogen that grew at 100 degrees Celsius.\nSo, extremophile, tough place to live.\nIt ate um hydrogen and breathe CO2 and made methane from it.\nAnd so, I would make this culture that was perfectly clear.\nIt looked like a terrible place to live.\nAnd I would throw it in a ba vat of boiling water.\nAnd then the next morning I would have this like happy growing culture so fast.\nSo it's not it's not that archaea can't be fast or obviously we know bacteria are fast because that's where all the pathogens are.\nThese guys they're never going to get to that big turbid culture and they're only going to divide once every couple of weeks.\nSo the idea of performing experiments on their physiology in the way that we would for something that we can grow quickly in lab is is a is a non-starter.\nAnd this once every couple weeks is in what is presumably ideal circumstances for them.\nYou're giving them food and whatever.\nSo maybe underneath the surface, they're actually waiting even longer.\nThat's right.\nThat's the That's what we think.\nAnd so we're we're trying to get out how quickly they grow under, you know, in these natural systems.\nAnd we can get at it in a couple ways.\nWe can look at how much energy they have available because we can measure all the chemicals around them.\nAnd we can measure how quickly those chemicals go away because we can see that the sediments are layered.\nSo the sediments like act like a recorder tape, like a time time recorder tape of how these things are used.\nAnd so we can basically through differential equations figure out the rate at which this food is being used by the whole community.\nAnd then when we run those numbers and calculate exactly how much energy everyone has to go and rush to their meeting or whatever they've got to do, um it is a thousand to a 10,000 times less than anything that's grown in lab would be able to survive on.\nSo it's like there there's probably lots of errors and there are definitely errors in our calculations because you know we're inferring things.\nBut when your when your conclusion is, you know, 10 is like three, four orders of magnitude off from from, you know, what you know, then you can be off by two orders of magnitude and you're still right.\nSo basically what all this means is that they're not growing.\nThey're not growing at all.\nThey're very slow.\nI mean, which is crazy.\nDo I remember correctly that when a bacterium divides, maybe this is true for archaea as well, uh they're not exact exact duplicates, the two offspring, but one is like the older one and one is brand new.\nIs that correct?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBecause the a lot of bacteria will make an old pole.\nSo that's a polar um cell division and you put all the old um proteins and stuff on the old pole and so you end up um you don't have to spread that stuff to a daughter cell.\nyou can make a fresh daughter cell with younger proteins and that's a that's a good strategy.\nUm, so in principle I don't know if they do that or not.\nA bacterium could die of old age.\nYeah, they should if you just keep accumulating all the old stuff on one side and making everything new.\nSo, so some of these um is it is it mostly bacteria that you're getting up from down there or mostly archaea?\nUm, we used to debate a lot about that and then I basically we never settled it and we just kind of got bored of the debate and stopped doing it.\nThat used to be a really hot topic, but it's funny how like everybody runs after something.\nI think it's it's pretty clear that there's a lot of both of them.\nThere's a lot of both.\nOkay.\nBut we can imagine that some of them are, you know, in this sense that bacteria could die of old age or whatever.\nUh, some of these critters are very, very old.\nYou know, maybe they haven't been dividing every week, they've been dividing every year or whatever.\nYeah, it's I mean, that's or not dividing at all.\nI mean, they have to replace broken parts.\nLike, you can't you can't maintain a cell for thousands of years without any effort into keeping it put together.\nAnd one of the things that we measure to to actually make measurements of this is um do you know about the chirality of amino acids?\nI do, but let's imagine that not everyone else does.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, um so chirality is basically just handedness.\nSo, you can have the same molecule, but you turn around sort of what what face uh different um parts of the chemical are sticking out of.\nSo, it it function chemically it's the same.\nIt doesn't have any different chemical function, but it can be distinguished by something that can recognize the handedness.\nAnd and chirality is handedness because our our two hands are chiral.\nThey all have the same fingers, but you can't perfectly overlay them um because the front and the back are different.\nOkay, so that is also true for amino acids, which are what make up proteins.\nFor some reason, this is still one of the big mysteries of life.\nAll of our proteins and all the proteins and all life as we know it has onehandedness.\nIt's one type of chirality.\nSo if you take a living organism like a person or a cell and you kill it so that it can't do any maintenance to itself, it will naturally revert to a random mixture of the two types of chirality of its amino acids just from the background.\nYes, just from the background.\nIt's a great little um time recorder of how long it's been since something has died.\nUm of course this process is super slow, so you need something.\nThis is not useful in forensics.\nThis is useful for things that have been dead for, you know, millennia.\nWe can measure the ratio of the two-handedness of the amino acids in these sediments.\nAnd we can see they're keeping them alive.\nThey are not letting everything go to this random mixture of the two hands.\nSo it means that they are maintaining themselves.\nBut to maintain chirality, to maintain membrane integrity, to keep your DNA intact, to do all these these maintenance things to make your body whole, you don't necessarily need to actually undergo cell division.\nOkay, good.\nSo, go ahead.\nSo, well, when we make estimates of uh growth rate, it's not necessarily making new cells.\nIt's the amount of time we estimate it takes to make to recreate your body so that you are intact.\nSo for at least some of these microbes, they're basically sitting there doing what to a person would look like almost nothing.\nThey're just sitting there.\nThey're not even dividing.\nThey're not moving.\nThey're not going anywhere.\nBut you're telling me that at the micro level, they're still engaging in self-rep.\nYeah.\nAnd you know, and sometimes I'll I'll have, you know, when I explain this to people, sometimes people will say, \"Well, why study them?\nThey're just dying.\nThey're not.\"\nBut, you know, I mean, we are too.\nWe're all dying.\nThat's no reason.\nYeah.\nEverybody's on their way, you know.\nSo, what is happening in their lives?\nIt's just their lives are potentially lasting for millennia, right?\nSo, so what does that life look like?\nIs there some possibility that these are the longest lived organisms on Earth?\nI would say there's a good chance they are the longest lived organisms on Earth.\nIf only they could talk.\nI know.\nWhat stories they could tell?\nWell, they were probably underground the whole time.\nSo, if you can teach them sign language.\nSo, you you say that some of them um survive off of the detritus that sort of seeped down from the surface world.\nUm but maybe others don't.\nAre there, you know, clever little um microbes that have that are just like living off of the chemicals?\nYeah, for sure.\nSo, there's a really cool background thing that happens everywhere in Earth's crust for free, which is radioactive decay.\nAnd so, there's, you know, tons of when when Earth accreted, we ended up with a lot of radioactive elements.\nAnd I'll say this for your listeners because I'm sure you know this, John, but radioactive elements are ones that spontaneously fall apart.\nAnd when they do that, they release a little bolus of energy of different sorts.\nAnd so no matter whether it's alpha, beta, or gamma type of radiation, when that interacts with pure water, it will some of it will split apart the water into hydrogen and oxygen.\nAnd this is not by and large a very exciting process that's going to make us a lot of hydrogen that we can pull out of the ground because it's, you know, for for our own energy just simply because it is um a slow process that's happening in the background all the time.\nBut if you're already a slow microbe, you can actually live off of the radioactive decay of water, which is kind of cool.\nI mean, you're telling me there's a race of subterranean uh dwellers in the dark that live off of radiation.\nSo, this sounds like a movie.\nYeah, I'm telling you that.\nHappily, they move very slow, so they will not be invading the surface world anytime soon.\nUm, and I I think I remember reading that you said that some of them go so far as to basically live off of electrons.\nYeah, for sure.\nBecause that's what a chemical reaction is.\nYou know, if you had to take organic chemistry, which I bet you loved because everybody loves organic chemistry, then you always pushed electrons.\nYou draw those little arrows to move electrons onto something and then, you know, pop the next electrons onto something else until they can be stable on oxygen or something like that.\nUm, so chemistry that changes the the redox or even non-redox chemistry often involves the movement of electrons.\nUm, certainly in a in a redox reaction, it's a movement of electrons.\nSo there are organisms that just cut to the chase and don't deal with the diffusion of chemicals.\nThey just literally move electrons through appendages that are basically tiny little wires.\nIn the sense that they're like conductive materials and you know that electrons can flow through.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nAnd they're made of proteins that have um basically conjugated area.\nSo metals work by moving electrons through a a conduit where uh it can move it can flow and biological material can also be put together in such a way that electrons can flow through it as well.\nAnd so these these cells do it that yeah that is it's impressive that they can do that and it's a reminder that it's not the energy that matters it's the free energy right it's the it's the gradient from place to place like just being in a hot environment is not enough but these little critters are clever enough to take advantage of disequilibria somehow.\nYeah.\nI and I think that's that's one of the the things that I'm personally have gotten out of all of these things is that a lot of the specifics that we attribute to being necessary for life, oxygen, light, you know, space to move around, fast growth, dying after a hundred years or a thousand years, like none of that is necessary for life.\nWhat's necessary for life is what you just said.\nYou got to have gradients, right, of free energy that you can exploit.\nAnd they're all over the place.\nI mean, and maybe you\n\n\nNeed water also.\nWater seems pretty important.\nYeah, it seems pretty important.\nYeah, I think you need water.\nI would, I definitely wouldn't say that you don't need water.\nOkay.\nBut you don't, you don't need nearly as much of it as we normally think.\nUm, you know, we're finding life in ancient perafrost that doesn't have a lot of liquid water because it's mostly in the form of ice.\nUm, but they still seem to maintain their cell integrity there.\nOkay.\nSo maybe we can go back to this question of how they fit into the tree of life.\nI mean, there's this fun possibility that they, that we, we've discovered a stepping stone, a missing link between archa and ukarotes, but uh, is there more to say about the origin of life or at least like less universal common ancestor kinds of questions?\nYeah, I mean, one thing that we're finding with all these things is that they are made up of the same stuff that the rest of us are.\nSo, we still haven't removed ourselves from the world of DNA, for instance.\nUm, which is kind of interesting.\nYou know, we're finding all these extra branches on the tree of life, but they're still using DNA.\nSo, at least for life as we know it, DNA seems to be primordial, the last universal common ancestor.\nUm, they, it's hard to say where life started from these.\nUm, but I think they definitely tell us how life has differentiated in a way that we haven't seen before.\nUm, just how you could, how you can end up with a ukareotic branch.\nSo okay.\nSo that's like something that happens after you've already uh differentiated into bacteria and archa and and other things.\nYeah.\nOh, you want me to go back to like non-life to there is life?\nWhy not?\nWhere it's getting late in the podcast?\nWhy not?\nI know.\nI talk about it in the book.\nI, it's something that absolutely fascinates me and I can't stop thinking about it, but at the same time, it's hard to really pick a hypothesis that I like because I wasn't there, you know, and we don't, we don't know.\nUm, but one thing that I find helpful is to think about thermodynamics just simply because, you know, water for sure.\nUm, but but these gradients, um, seem like there's something that is, that is so important, but you, it's not just having the free energy.\nIt's also about how quickly that free energy can be released through abiotic processes because if, if it's going to go like, if that chemical reaction, it may yield you tons of energy and you have a beautiful gradient set up and your free energy is great, but if that, if somebody lights a match and the activation energy is is overcome abiotically, that reaction is just going to go and that's not what life is good at.\nLife is better at slowing down the, oh sorry, speeding up uh reactions that are blocked for some kinetically blocked, so they're going a little bit too slow.\nLife can speed up those reactions.\nBut it's, there's something interesting about how life does this and it gets to the second law of thermodynamics, which means that entropy has to increase in an open system.\nAnd so life, it seems, is super, super good at making entropy just really, really good and like better than, so if, if you use the burning match example of like methane and oxygen, like we use methane to heat our houses and that creates a ton of heat, that creates a ton of entropy, but if you take that same, you know, squirt of methane and same amount of oxygen and you feed it to a growing culture of a methan anatroof, they're going to make this structure and they're going to um, make a society.\nThey're going to support other organisms.\nThey're going to, the total amount of entropy that gets produced by these organisms is going to be so much more than you get from just that flash of heat when you, when you light a match.\nAnd so I, that is that, I don't have an answer for how life started.\nOkay.\nI wish I did, but, but when I think about it, I just think about this fundamental quality of life in that it stretches out the um, the free energy acquisition from reactions in ways that do a better job of creating opportunities for entropy production than without life, which is not exactly like a pathy little um, definition for life that you could like put on a bumper sticker, but, but I think it explains a lot of why life is so complex.\nI, I think it's actually a super important point because we said life is not just about having energy.\nIt's about having free energy or gradients or something like that.\nAnd now you're saying and furthermore, it's about, it's kind of about having batteries, right?\nIt's, it's about having energy that doesn't just get released and burned too quickly.\nLife is sort of making use of the slowness to fuel itself.\nI don't know if, if life is keeping it slow or speeding it up, but it is certainly generating entropy.\nYeah.\nAnd it speeds up individual reactions, you know, like just something that does have a big activation energy like methane and oxygen.\nYou would need to light a match, you know, to have that reaction happen.\nUm, so it's, it's kind of like it's a catalyst that will make those two things react, but they react much more slowly with more entropy production than it would if you got over that activation energy with just a flame.\nI often hear people say, you know, life is working against the direction of entropy increasing by making things organized.\nAnd I try to tell them, no, no, no.\nIt's, it's parasitic upon entropy increasing.\nWe need entropy to increase.\nThat's what life is.\nParasitic.\nMaybe we're collaborative though.\nBut that's it.\nIt's, it's basically like we need, we need that entropy, you know?\nWe need, I, I think that it's the opposite of, I know that argument that you're talking about because I've heard people make it as well, that we're somehow swimming upstream and we break the laws of thermodynamics and like no, that's, that's ignoring heat.\nYou're ignoring heat.\nIt's kind of important.\nYes.\nSo yeah, I mean, there's also, go ahead.\nWell, I, I think that there's sort of like a different um, definition for entropy in the informatics versus in thermodynamics.\nAnd so in informatics, it's often used as a measure of just disorder.\nWhereas in thermodynamics, disorder is just a subset of entropy and it can mean other things as well.\nYeah, it's complicated because there's that factor of temperature that comes in there when you try to um, relate entropy to heat and it's confusing and people will write books on it and I'm sure they do.\nUh, but okay, does that, that's an insight on what life is and what it does and it's certainly borne out by the experience of uh, I can't believe we didn't use the word yet.\nIntraterrestrials.\nThat's the title of your book.\nYes.\nThe little critters under underground.\nDoes it affect your pre-existing credences on different theories about the origin of life?\nI mean, there's metabolism first and replication first and all these things.\nYeah.\nOr RNA first.\nYou know, that it started with information.\nThat's another idea.\nAnd the idea that it's RNA first is based on the fact that our RNA as a molecule kind of does all the different things that we need to in a in a cell.\nIt's, it's sort of like the pre-ifferiated um, molecule.\nSo I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of um, good, good possibilities in RNA as the as the beginning factor.\nBut I, I think that um, if you look, if you think about life as this entropy producing phenomenon, then you can, you can see the continuum with lawn life a little more easily because we have organized structures.\nYou know, if you're going to make the our straw man argument that I think we both disagree with that life beats, beats entropy, um, beats the law of thermodynamics because it's organized.\nYou know, look at a whirlpool as a river moves down a, you know, a moving river.\nIf there's a rock, it's going to create this eddy and it's a structure.\nYou can see it.\nThere's um, there's boundaries to it.\nYou can say what's in the eddy and what's not out, not not in the eddi.\nUm, but none of those water molecules are alive and they're not talking to each other.\nThey're just obeying the second law of thermodynamics.\nThey're just like increasing entropy in a way that they have to.\nAnd so life is kind of doing that too.\nIt's just we are, you know, the example that I write in my book is that we do the same thing.\nWe're, we're making eddies in the um, in the stream except we realize that we can make a white water rafting company based on those eddies.\nAnd so we work within the, the, we dam the stream up upstream of it and work with the people controlling the spillover to make sure we have just the right eddy.\nAnd then we build ourselves a boat so we can have a great time like flipping in and out of the whirlpool.\nSo, you know, think of all the entropy that's produced there when you buy the photo that they shoot of your family going through this whirlpool.\nYou know, just we, we are so good at creating opportunities for further entropy production that are so much bigger than what was there.\nAnd that to me defines the cut off between life and non-life because when is it an RNA molecule is not alive.\nAn RNA world wouldn't have really been life.\nYou know, people can replicate um, nucleic acids in a laboratory bench and nobody says that they're God and created life.\nBut to me, it's got to have that feature of making extra opportunities for for entropy.\nI, I don't have any dog in the fight about the origin of life, but I know that you know there are those who are the metabolism first folks who say that yeah, this sort of complicated network of chemical reactions that is increasing entropy came first and later it figured out how to replicate itself using RNA and that sounds like that's, that's quite a miracle occurring there.\nBut then the RNA folks say well there's RNA and they figured out how to put themselves in a compartment and build an engine and repair themselves.\nI'm like, that's also kind of a miracle occurring.\nSo, I don't actually know what to think.\nYeah.\nI mean, I in some ways I think it's a little bit of a philosophy question.\nWhat do you consider to be alive?\nYou know, I think we can all agree that a whirlpool's not alive, but I think we can also see that thermodynamically it's on the continuum with life.\nYeah.\nSo, where do we draw that that line?\nAnd that's just, that's for our own hearts to decide.\nI don't know.\nThat's perfectly fair.\nBut there is an, once we draw that line, there's an answer to the question literally where did life start.\nDo you think that there's some chance that life started deep below the surface or is that just life is so good at taking advantage of opportunities that it eventually drifted down there?\nYeah.\nSo either one is possible.\nWell, I, I want to say clearly like I don't know.\nObviously, no one really knows, but and I know this sounds a little on the nose because I'm a deep subsurface researcher, but I think the deep subsurface is a great place to form life.\nI mean, if you think about energy gradients at the surface, they're really harsh.\nThey're really extreme.\nI mean, we have found all sorts of ways to mitigate the damaging effects of our energy gradients up at the surface.\nUm, we, our skin makes um, uh, protectants.\nWe put sunscreen on, you know, we need to protect ourselves from, from this high blast of of energy we get from the sun.\nAnd oxygen, the same thing.\nIf we didn't have enzymes running around detoxifying the oxygen that we're dependent upon, we wouldn't be able to live in this high oxygen environment that we, that we do.\nBut in the subsurface, things are slower, the gradients are more varied.\nYou do have some high energy gradients, but they're never going to be like sunlight high energy.\nAnd so you do, I mean, I guess maybe this is an argument for the metabolism first camp.\nYou get all of these overlapping energy gradients.\nAnd so you can imagine these networks sort of forming in a way that they would just get um, blasted out energetically and possibly physically by um, impacts from um, other celestial objects.\nI actually, I, I like this.\nI don't think I've ever um, thought of it this way before that here on the surface there's a lot of resources for life, but there's also a lot of dangers and so you might think that all the resources are so abundant that maybe this is where life began, but you got to, when you're a primitive life form and you haven't uh, accumulated all those defense mechanisms that the dangers are really important.\nSo maybe like the slow world down beneath the surface where you have time to develop some structure would be a good place to look for the origin of life.\nYeah.\nIt's like a nursery.\nYou know, you can take somebody who's going to be like a fantastic leader of a nation, but they can't, they're not going to do it when they're three months old, right?\nThey gota, got to figure out how to like eat first.\nDoes that have implications for looking for life elsewhere?\nI know that you've already, you've already mentioned Mars.\nI told you we would get back to Mars.\nSo, Mars, Titan, Europa, um, wherever.\nLike, is this opening up possibilities that the astronomers or the NASA folks haven't really, uh, taken seriously yet?\nUh, I wouldn't say they're not taking it seriously.\nUm, I think people are, well, I hope people are pretty well aware that even though we don't see evidence for a lot of abundant life at the surfaces of these extraterrestrial bodies, planetary type bodies, um, their subsurfaces are definitely fair game.\nUm, especially Europa.\nUm, well, actually, I, I wouldn't put any one over the other because Europa has um, liquid oceans underneath the ice cap.\nThis is very well known.\nThis is um, very, very well established.\nAnd so when I hear liquid ocean, I just think there's got to be energy gradients that are exploitable by something.\nSo I would be shocked if we didn't find life on Europa.\nAnd Mars, too, doesn't have these modern liquid oceans, but it does have these really evocative whiffs of methane that show up every now and then.\nThat used to be very controversial, but now that we have better monitoring, like they're, they're real.\nLike there are methane whiffs that appear every now and then.\nIt doesn't mean that there's life, but if there was life underground, that is absolutely what I would expect to see in their atmosphere.\nMay, maybe say more about the methane whiffs.\nIs this like a sort of volcanic kind of thing?\nCould be.\nUm, their volcanoes have been dead for a while and they're really just in one place.\nThe really big difference between the subsurface of Mars and Earth\n\n\nIs that we have plate tectonics, and as far as we can tell, they never really did. That's why they have the biggest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, on the Tharsus Plateau. And that's just because it's so big because nothing ever moved across it. It's just been blebing up for a long time. Um, but I don't see why that couldn't support subsurface life just the same way that our volcanoes do on Earth. Um, you don't necessarily need plate tectonics, I think, to support subsurface life. Um, the fact that, you know, methane is so great because so many of the reactions that we know about that happen on their own without sunlight on Earth create hydrogen and carbon dioxide and formate. And these are the chemicals that are pretty much all these methanogens need to make energy. Of course, then they need things like metals and nitrogen and oxygen to like put their bodies together, but that stuff is all on Mars. That stuff is not as hard of a question to answer. I mean, there's still the huge question of how difficult is it to make that first leap into life? I mean, you're making a persuasive case that the conditions on Mars or Europa allow for life to exist, but it had to start somewhere that I have no opinion about whether or not that's easy or hard.\n\nWell, it could have started in one of our two planets between Mars and Earth and transferred. You know, we get rocks from Mars all the time, and they could have life on them that seeded Earth. So, that's definitely a possibility. Is there any chance in...\n\nWell, there's this idea that has been floated of a shadow biosphere, that there's some, um, there could be at least living organisms that are not related to all the other living organisms. It sounds like that's not what you're seeing.\n\nNo, that's absolutely possible. Okay. But you haven't seen any yet. Do you don't have any evidence? I haven't seen any, but the methods that I use to look for life would miss them. Okay. So, when I go looking for life in weird places, I use DNA. So, if you have a shadowed biosphere that doesn't use DNA, I would miss it with my methods. Okay. But if that's still on the table, would you be able to find something that had the wrong chirality of amino acids?\n\nUm, I yes, I would, yes, if I'm using the right... I mean, that's not a technique that I do all the time, you know, it's only to ask a specific question, but yeah, we could, we could see, we can detect, um, proteins that are made from amino acids that would have the wrong chirality. Okay, and we haven't found any yet, or you would have told me.\n\nRight, but like I said, you know, in terms of like the real exploration, like discovering new things, that tends to happen through DNA. It tends not to happen through looking at other molecules. Okay, that's so, so it might be there, is what you're saying.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAll right. I will uh, look out for the... I think it's fascinating. I mean, I think, I think it's, if there's one thing I've learned from this career adventure that I've been on is that there can be stuff out in nature that you never would have imagined existed, and you have to be open to finding it. Yeah. No, no, no. And, and you made a good case also that we haven't explored much of what is down there yet. That's right. Yeah. There's a...\n\nYeah, it's all on the table. Uh, in the, in the theme that everything is connected and all life is connected, is there, you know, um, traffic between the subsurface life and the surface world? Like, do they rely on each other or notice each other at all?\n\nSometimes the answer is always yes to all the possibilities that you just presented.\n\nUm, some of them, you know, like these ones that are buried in marine sediments, as far as we know, they're totally dependent on the stuff that we that we produced in our rivers and, you know, ran off and, um, or fell down from the phytoplankton in the open ocean. Um, we think that that is what's supporting those communities. And so they are, they are dependent on our detritus. They're dependent on our leftovers and our trash. Um, but the ones that are using the energy gradients that happen whether we influence it or not would not be dependent on any of that stuff coming down. Okay. And there's probably a mixture of both types in almost every ecosystem. We do have an effect on the world, you know, in various ways, trash included. We definitely matter. We defin...\n\nYeah, sometimes our trash is good. They like our trash. Um, and they, they come back up to us, too. I mean, they're, they're basically like determining what's happening with our redox state of our crust. And the redox state of our crust determines our mineral deposits. It determines, um, how much oxygen is available in the atmosphere. So, in terms of how they affect us, you can't underestimate the importance of these organisms on us over, over the course of Earth's history. They, they have made the world that we now use. Is there any chance we could put them to work further? Uh, I know that we have, uh, we're messing with our climate in sort of dangerous ways. Is that something that people have wondered we could, you know, eat up the extra CO2 in the atmosphere or something?\n\nYeah, it sounds kind of crazy, but they could actually do that for us. Um, you know, if you think about, if you really take our climate problem down to like its sort of dumbest explanation. There was a lot of carbon in Earth's crust. Humans, because we're great at producing entropy, took all that carbon from fossil fuels and natural gas, and we are putting it into the atmosphere, and that is causing an imbalance that is causing problems for us. Um, so putting that carbon back down underground makes a lot of sense. That's just in some ways reversing what we've done. Um, we can't just like make fossil fuels out of it, but we could maybe stick it underground. And so that is happening. Um, Iceland has a, um, company that is doing this. They're capturing CO2 out of a, um, energy production plant and piping it underground, and it seems to be working a little bit. Um, they also did this in Louisiana on one of these test wells, and that caused some problems because it's not just like an empty Tupperware container that they're sticking this carbon down into. There's things living down there. That's what we're learning about the extraterrestrials. And some of the ones, um, in some of these wells are producing methane out of it, which is not, not what we want, because that's not actually going to sequester the carbon.\n\nYeah. It doesn't help. Yeah. Okay. So, we don't know. Um, we're, we're working on that. That is something that I think that our field can be very helpful for going forward is if for any technology that is trying to sequester carbon and draw down CO2 in the atmosphere by sticking it underground, call up a microbiologist before you do that and make sure that it's actually going to stay there. Very good point. Call up your local microbiologist. Call your... yeah, I can start doing extension work in...\n\nSo, for the final question, let, let's imagine that we're in a happy world where science is extraordinarily well supported by society, and you can imagine the experiment or experiments you want to do. I mean, again, I think you have a compelling case. There's a whole bunch of living critters under the ground that we don't know anything about. That's something we can go look for. What would we do? What would, what, how would we actually experimentally or observationally, uh, learn more about these things that we're not doing now?\n\nI think we need to attach ourselves to a lot more drilling. Um, you know, that is the most expensive way that we have of getting down. And so we, you know, we do talk to companies, you know, there's a lot of different companies in oil and gas and in mining who are excited to have scientists learn what they can, and that's been incredibly helpful to our field. Um, but just being able to direct the drilling ourselves. Um, drilling a bore hole costs a million to 10 million dollars. And so that's something that needs an actual investment. It's often an international investment, but that's, that is absolutely the thing I would say is we need to go down. We need to be able to control the places that we drill and the things we drill into. Um, which, you know, we have been able to in the past. And, and I don't, I don't want to be flippant about this. Getting these drilling proposals funded is highly competitive. You have to be really good and really know what you're doing to get one of these projects. So, it's not like we were being willy-nilly, but now that that program is over in the United States, we don't do that anymore. Is there at least a feeling in the field that things are taking off, that, you know, this is a new exciting area? Do people recognize this?\n\nYeah. Okay. Absolutely. Like, within those of us who are studying this. I mean, I, I cannot overemphasize the majesty of these two groups who have managed to culture these guys. I really didn't think it was possible. I mean, not that I would say that. I really didn't know if it was possible, but the fact that they've managed to do it has really changed my view of how the, how we can interact with these organisms. And it turns out we can actually do more with them than than I ever would have thought possible. And we need more of that. So, we just need to replicate what they're doing and get the rest of these things in culture and start studying all of these things. That's going to take a huge effort. And, and you promise along the way not to release a new pathogen that will wipe out all eukaryotic life on Earth.\n\nPromise is a big word. Um, plan. There's an interesting, in, in terms of like fears on that, that notion. I don't know if you know this about Archaea, but that entire domain of life has no pathogens. It's one of the greatest mysteries of Archaea. They're commensal. They live in our guts. They're with us all the time. And for whatever reason, they've never decided to take advantage of us. So, viruses and bacteria obviously like super pathogenic when they're in the wrong forms, but Archaea just like right along in their chill. Yeah. They just, you know, they're lovers, not fighters.\n\nUh, all right. Don't let them know that they're, they're gonna start exploiting this loophole that they didn't look into before. But yeah, exactly. Karen Lloyd, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape podcast.\n\nYeah, thank you so much for having me. Interesting conversation.\n[Music]\n",
