from just interview shows on radio or TV, but they're a little bit more ubiquitous now.\nSo they provide a glimpse into things almost as they happen, right?\nRight.\nI mean, obviously news events can happen very rapidly, but the increase in knowledge that we get through scholarship and research happens on a relatively more leisurely time scale.\nAnd by talking to the kinds of people that we get as guests here on Mindscape, you can see science and research more broadly as it is being done.\nYou get some interesting results, but you also get some insight into the messiness of we don't know the answer yet.\nWe're still thinking about this.\nThere's still some controversy.\nLet's see where we go.\nAnd it becomes pretty obvious that of course we're all Humans.\nWe have our favorite ideas, favorite ways of thinking and so forth.\nUh, it's a human endeavor, science and scholarship more broadly.\nSo it can be possible to forget that it has always been that way because the science that was done in the past we receive as students and readers and listeners in kind of a finished polished form, right?\nWe're given Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws in notation that is much easier to understand than what they actually used, and we're given the final result after they had to go back and forth and think about lots of different things.\nSo things we take for granted now, the earth is round, species evolved from previous species due to natural selection.\nThe germ theory of disease, for example, of course diseases are carried by Germs.\nThat's very natural.\nDiseases can be contagious.\nOne person talks to another one, they carry the disease.\nNow it makes sense that some little agent was carrying the disease from person to person.\nBut it took a long time, as it turns out, for the germ theory of disease to catch on.\nAnd it's worth revisiting that history, both because the science is fascinating, but also the twists and turns in the human side of the story are fascinating as well.\nSo today's guest is Thomas Levenson, a longtime friend of mine.\nHe is a Professor of Science Writing at MIT and an active science writer, uh, author of a number of books that I can highly recommend.\nThe Hunt for Vulcan, about looking for that little planet that was hypothesized to exist between the sun and Mercury back in the day.\nEinstein in Berlin about some of Einstein's uh formative years.\nAnd my favorite, which is Newton and the Counterfeiter, about Isaac Newton's life after doing science when he became uh the boss of the Mint and hunted down counterfeits in London.\nIt was these are human stories.\nWhat can I tell you?\nUh, Newton was a pretty bloodthirsty guy to be perfectly honest.\nAnyway, Tom's most recent book is called So Very Small: How Humans Discovered the Microcosmos, Defeated Germs--and May Still Lose the War Against Infectious Disease.\nUh, it's a history book, a science book, a storytelling book about the various ways that we got from then Anton van Leeuwenhoek looking through a little microscope and seeing that there were critters moving around to Louis Pasteur saying, \"I can figure out how to defeat these guys,\" and not everyone agreeing with them along the way.\nIn fact, some people fighting hard against them.\nAnd at some point, you have to say a lot of lives could have been saved if people had just faced up to the scientific reality.\nLessons for contemporary issues left for you to decide.\nSo, with that, let's go.\n[Music]\nTom Levenson, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.\nThank you for having me, Sean.\nThis is great.\nUh, it is great, but nevertheless, the very first page of your new book kind of uh frightened me a little bit.\nYou start talking about the bubonic plague in Oregon in 2024.\nI mean, you rush to say, \"Don't worry, they, you know, they they tamped it down because we have modern medicine now.\"\nBut it did raise the question like how many of these oldtimey terrible sounding diseases are still lurking around out there?\nWe we'll get we'll be more systematic later in the podcast, but I I just had to ask that one right away.\nOh, um all of them are out there except smallpox.\nSmallpox is the only disease, I love this this factoid.\nUm the only um human infectious disease that has been rendered extinct in the wild.\nThere is no more virus out there except in a couple of uh of freezer lockers.\nUh which is kind of nervous making that they're there, but you know, essentially there's no smallpox circulating.\nHasn't been since at least uh 1980.\nAnd um and that's a remarkable thing because it used to be the leading killer and and you know one in three of people who caught it would die most often.\nUm terrible disease, but the rest of them, you know, tuberculosis, uh you know, consumption, the the you know, the the disease that took uh you know, all those figures, you know, the poet Keats and and and you know, Henry David Thoreau and you know, everybody else, um that's still causing a million deaths a year worldwide.\nIt's not prevalent in the developed world, but it's still very much out there and it's it's actually becoming an increasingly deadly threat.\nWe can go into why later on.\nUh, cholera still pops up.\nUm, and in fact, I saw a recent report that there's some cholera.\nClearly we know about measles.\nYou know, there's a as we talk there is an still uncontained outbreak in Texas.\nUh, and I understand now it's in measles cases have been identified in in something, you know, 20 or something uh additional states.\nThree people have died so far in that one.\nUh, and you can keep going on down the list.\nUh, polio has been on the very teetering edge of um of eradication uh for decades now.\nUm, but it's not quite extinct and um there are cases that pop up including in the United States uh you know, as recently as 2022, 2023, uh and if we aren't careful, that could also break its current very narrow bounds uh and become a major problem again.\nSo yeah, they're all still out there.\nWell, it's interesting because your book is about the historical context.\nYou know, we have a lot of fascinating stories about how we got to germ theory and and vaccines and and fighting it and so forth, but constantly there's a refrain of it wasn't easy.\nLike the scientist invented some stuff and then there was politics and there was like establishment pride and and all those things and and you can't help but read it and go yeah I guess those things are still around a little bit.\nVery much so.\nI mean, the book So Very Small uh began as a a question from an editor like, can you think of decisive moments in science?\nThere were these uh this my my UK editor um uh came to me and you more than a decade ago and said, \"I'm doing this series on decisive moments.\nWe're, you know, we're doing things like, you know, Picasso's Guernica or Handel's Messiah, the first performance, that kind of thing.\"\nHe says, \"But we have no science.\nWhat would be a good idea?\nWhat would be good break points in science and and you know, so or coffee?\"\nAnd I thought of a couple and I said, \"Well, Einstein going up the mountain in Mount Wilson and seeing the evidence that the universe is not static is a break point.\"\nYou know, there's the world is different or the the cosmos is different before and after that moment.\nUm, and I said, you know, I could do that, but I don't want to do that because I've written about Einstein a lot.\nYeah.\nAnd enough.\nUm, and I said, you know, I don't know anything about it, but germ theory strikes me as as this, you know, really striking moment.\nAnd germ theory, you know, is this this idea that was definitively established in the 1870s and 80s.\nUh, and it basically says um that infectious disease is not caused by some derangement of the body or environmental disturbance, a miasma or what have you, bad air, bad water, whatever.\nUm, in a sort of general sense, it's caused by microbes.\nAnd crucially each different disease, cholera, you know, um, typhoid, whatever it might be, battlefield infections, all these kinds of things, um, each specific condition was caused by a single specific microbe.\nThat was an essential element of the idea.\nUm and you know I said you know before that you have uh you know an a much looser and vagger understanding of disease and after it you have this very precise definition of what's involved in infectious disease.\nThere are you know it it gets very pricey.\nThere are these things called Koch's postulates which are uh a list of rules about how to make sure that you have identified the correct sequence from pathogen to disease.\nIt involves you know isolating the bacterium as you know viruses at as these were being worked out viruses had not yet been observed.\nUm that you know the first ones were observe the first one was observed in the 1890s.\nUm and uh you know so you identify the the bacterium uh in a diseased you know in a diseased organism um you isolate it you culture it you give it to another healthy organism and you reproduce the same disease um you know there are these rules that sort of how you establish that this is in fact the um uh the pathogen um that all happens you know at this in this last quarter of the 19th century.\nUm and you know there's a before and after and with that knowledge there are all kinds of things you can do that that are you know also part of the the story I tell in the book.\nYou know you have ideas about public health were already advancing in this period that I call germ theory without germs when it's recognized that there are pathogens but it's not of some sort but it's not understood what they are and how they you know how how the dynamic happens.\nUh, but even that lets you do some very important things.\nThat's the cholera story, right?\nWith you know, you know, and all that.\nUm, but afterwards you can do you know targeted public health, you understand why you're doing like clean water systems and so forth.\nUh, and making sure the sewage system doesn't interact with the water supply, all these kinds of like basic really good things.\nUm, you develop vaccines.\nUm, there was one vaccine that existed, Jenner's cowpox vaccine to prevent small pox that was discovered essentially empirically or developed empirically in the late 19 late 18th century, 1790s.\nUm, but there were no other vaccines.\nUm, and then with germ theory uh particularly uh pushed by Louis Pasteur in that early period uh but you know as with anything in science lots and lots of other people are involved um but that's when you start getting vaccines against uh a much wider range of diseases and of course finally u third in the sequence uh historically uh you get chemical compounds that are discovered or developed that can attack an infection that's already lodged in the body.\nI mean, vaccines are sort of like the the the wall around the castle, right?\nUm if something gets through the wall, whether it's your skin or a vaccination or what have you.\nUm then you've got an infection and you need to do something about it, you want to do something about it.\nUm and that's where antibiotics come in.\nUm and we got all those things out of germ theory.\nBut what really struck me as I first sort of I said, you know, oh, germ theory, there's a before and an after and it's great and there's a decisive moment and everything's grand.\nUm, and that's all true, but you know, you and I both know that that science is not usually simply a case of a eureka moment that changes everything, right?\nAnd so, you know, I started looking into it a little bit more.\nI mean, I told my editor that he should find somebody who actually knew about medicine and the history of bi microbiology and all that sort of stuff to write it.\nAnd, you know, I had I wrote two other books while this idea was still, you know, bouncing between us.\nAnd finally, he said, \"You better write it.\"\nAnd I said, \"Okay, I better write it.\"\nUm, and you know, along the way, I discovered something that turned it into a book that really sort of spoke to the way I think about the world.\nUm, and that was, you know, it should have been obvious at the time, I guess, but it took me a while.\nI'm slow.\nIt took me a while to get there.\nThe microbial world, there is actually a decisive singular moment when it was discovered.\nUm, you know, uh, microbes are not visible with a naked eye.\nYou needed to develop instruments.\nThe instrument in question is the microscope.\nUm, that comes about early in the 17th century.\nUm, and people look at all kinds of things with it.\nUh, but they don't, you know, partly because the early microscopes weren't that powerful and partly because, um, you know, it just it takes a while to realize that, you know, with this instrument, it's not just that you can see more detail on things you already know are there, right?\nYou look at a bee's wing and so forth.\nUh, one of the very famous early books is on you know is uh uh micros you know sort of reports on microscopy is this uh on the life of bees that was that was written by two Italians um and there these beautiful drawings of these magnified insects and it's really cool um but uh that really took a step forward when uh Anton van Leeuwenhoek, and I hope I apologize to my Dutch friends for my butchering that, but Um he was a Dutch cloth merchant, a draper in um in Delft, uh and you know uh cloth merchants of time use lenses to you know inspect the fabric for flaws or whatever uh and he became interested in that ma you know that magnified world and he almost certainly saw a copy of Robert Hook's Micrographia, which was in some ways the first great popular science text, this book of of magnificent uh microscopic microscope studies of both, you know, materials, you know, points of needles and so forth, but lots of living things.\nUm, but again, you know, he he had pictures of a flea and the compound eye of insects and so forth.\nHe saw in greater detail things that were again, you know, perceivable by, you know, in some ways by human eyes um and didn't penetrate deeper into into the invisible realm, the you know, invisible to us.\nUm and uh and that seems to have inspired Leeuwenhoek and he uh he became he it turned out he was an you know meticulous craftsman.\nHe made these great single lens microscopes, these these little drops of of glass that were incredibly powerful for the day.\nHe was you know almost certainly making the most powerful instruments in Europe at the time.\nAnd you know this work of his started 1673 or so and by 1676, um he was really sort of feeling his oats and and pointing this his instrument or you know using his instrument on on a wide r wider and wider range of\n\n\nOf subjects, and he looked at a drop of pond water, and in that pond water, he saw what he called animalcules.\nAnimalcules, little animals.\nI love the name.\nYeah, it's great.\nAnd, uh, and he saw some things that are, uh, probably pleneria or other, you know, fairly large multicellular microscopic organisms.\nBut then he, you know, looked long enough and hard enough, and he had, and his microscopes were good enough that he actually saw single-celled bacteria.\nAnd we know he did not just because he reported it and described it, and you know, you can see descriptions, but, uh, I think the earliest surviving of his drawings, he was a meticulous draftsman.\nHe drew pictures of lots of stuff that he studied.\nUh, comes from 1682, and there are four or five bacteria drawings on it, and they are, you know, present-day identifiable as at least, you know, to families of bacteria, if not the specific strain.\nUh, and those experiments have been replicated.\nUm, historian of science, you know, got, you know, made a single-lens, uh, microscope and did it again and said, \"Yes, he could have seen what he said he saw.\"\nSo, yeah, he really saw bacteria.\nUm, and again, he saw them for the first time in 1676, and then he kept observing them.\nUh, and one of the really interesting things to me is, um, within a very few years, you know, he looked at it in pond water, he looked at it in other, uh, you know, liquid sources.\nHe infused peppercorns in water, and they, you know, because he was interested to see what would happen with the peppercorns, but he also saw microbes there.\nBut at some point, he took gunk from between his own teeth and looked at that through the microscope and saw more bacteria.\nAnd why is that significant?\nAt least it's significant to me.\nAnd the answer is because that's when, you know, that's the first, uh, recorded example of recognizing that microbes live inside us.\nYeah.\nNo teeth, you know, gunk between teeth is not very far inside us, but still, you know, it's there, and we can, we can, um, you know, uh, cohabit in, in the literal sense of the word with this whole microbial universe.\nThat might have been a Eureka moment, but it was certainly also a very creepy moment, don't you think?\nOh, yeah.\nI mean, it's, it's, but what's interesting is, um, so, so the question for the book was, all right, that's 1676, and the, uh, Robert Koch's demonstration that anthrax is caused by, um, a bacillus ban anthraasis, uh, single microbe, which was the first, you know, end-to-end account of, uh, you know, demonstration that, you know, anthrax is caused by a pathogen, it's this pathogen, and you can replicate it, and it's a living, you know, microbial, you know, it's a bacterium.\nUm, all that was set, you know, Koch did that from 2 or 3 days before Christmas in 1876 to, you know, two or three, you know, two or three weeks into January.\nHe'd created a chain of infection with these, you know, he take some bananthrasis, give it to a rabbit.\nUm, then when that rabbit got sick, he'd harvest blood and isolate the bacteria again and give it to the next rabbit.\nAnd he created this chain of infection, and he isolated the bug and did all those good, and he even also traced the, um, life cycle of anthrax, which, you know, he caught them in their spore stage, and he was able to activate, um, you know, motile bacteria from the spores.\nHe nailed it all in the space of three to four weeks, but that's 200 years after van Leeuwenhoek.\nUm, and while it is, I think, formally impossible to say with certainty why something doesn't happen, that's still a long time.\nAnd I wondered why it was so long.\nWhat were the impediments to figuring that out?\nAnd that's really where the book got started.\nAnd what became exciting as I wrote the book is it became clear to me, at least, and I hope I persuade readers, is that the broad outlines of why it was difficult to go from the first observation of microbes to recognizing that they actually matter to us in really important ways, um, helps that lens helps us understand why we're currently in trouble with infectious disease, why many of the advances of the last century and a half are now at least at risk, if not, you know, already really compromised.\nMaybe you can help us understand what would have been the mindset of the people in the pre-germ theory era.\nYou've already mentioned miasma theory, but we knew that disease was infectious, or at least infectious diseases are infectious.\nUm, I'm guessing that people had ideas about how diseases were spread, either by touch or breathing or whatever.\nUm, was there some consensus as to what they thought happened before they said it was little microbes?\nWell, that's, I mean, for, for, you know, sort of for the philosophy of science, that's what's so interesting about this case, right?\nUm, how does a theory get replaced?\nWell, there, you know, there's the big, broad outlines, and there's, you know, you can turn to Thomas or you can turn to people who've argued with, or whatever.\nUm, but something that I've, I really think, uh, is true in a bunch of different, um, domains is that the easy, conventional sort of high school version that that theories change when a fact comes along that the theory can't accommodate.\nYou know, that's that's tricky on so many levels, and we can talk, we could talk a lot about that if you wanted.\nUm, but the problem for, make one of the problems for making the connection between microbes and disease is, um, that there was already a pretty, um, coherent theory of disease that des, that that didn't, you know, particularly predict things, but it accurately or it adequately described what was observed.\nSo when you have something like the plague, um, you know, there sort of, there were two questions: what is a disease, you know, what's happening when you get sick, um, and how does a disease move from one person to the next?\nThose are, those are obviously related questions, but there, but they're, you can, you can distinguish between them.\nUm, and there were, um, a variety of detailed accounts of disease, and certainly the more people observed different conditions, people recognized the plague as something other than, um, other fevers that that that that you might, uh, that you might encounter.\nUh, and in part, they recognized it because the plague has some characteristic, um, you know, uh, markers like, like the boss of the, of the boss of bubonic plague, these lesions that that burst on your skin and so forth.\nUm, and even though they, you know, that's not a universal symptom of the plague, it's common enough that it, it, you know, there are ways to recognize it as the plague and not as, you know, what we would now call typhoid or something else.\nUm, now recognized as typhoid.\nUm, but the, you know, so there was, there was some, you know, I mean, people, people in the past are not dumber than we are.\nThey have less information or different information, but they're not, you know, stupid.\nUm, and so there were detailed observations, and people obviously wanted to know what was going on when you had a terrible event like the plague.\nUh, but the, uh, the basic idea is that there is, you know, that healthy bodies are in a form of balance.\nYou know, there was humoral theory, the four humors that have to be in balance, but there were, you know, sort of other broader, you know, you could, you could sort of generalize that.\nYou didn't have to be a Galinist, uh, and say, \"No, it's, it's, it's the humors.\"\nThere were, there were, you know, what were called, uh, chemical physicians, uh, which were people who were looking at at more detailed accounts of, um, you know, the substances that make us up.\nUh, and people were beginning to be aware of bodily systems.\nI mean, this was, you know, William Harvey working out the system of blood circulation is not just important for that one story.\nIt, it sort of gives you a way to think about how the body works that that, um, that was distinct from what went before.\nBut overall, the idea is, you know, when you're healthy, your body's in balance, and and ill health is some derangement of that balance.\nAnd if you think about it, you know, as a sort of broad statement, you know, that's it's still true, right?\nIt's a metaphorical way of talking about what's going on.\nYeah.\nLook, you know, think about diabetes.\nIt's a problem.\nInsulin regulation.\nWell, when you're, when your insulin regulatory system is working as it should, you know, you don't have diabetes, and when it isn't, you do.\nThat's a form of imbalance.\nIt's still a, you know, it's not a, it's not a crazy concept.\nIt's a perfectly understandable one.\nAnd, um, and it adequately described what was observed with the naked eye.\nUm, and similarly with the spread, the origins, you know, where does the first case come from, and then how does it spread?\nUm, there were, uh, you know, a range of possible sources.\nI mean, ultimately, the source was God.\nGod, you know, had, was expressing judgment on individuals or societies, and this judgment, you know, the, the, you know, the judgment was expressed through the events that happened to you in life, including illness.\nUm, but, you know, uh, it was well established that, um, people live in the material world, and divine judgments and the devil's blandishments, etc., occur through natural means.\nThere was a scientistic approach to understanding both, you know, satanic and and divine regulation of the world or interaction with the world.\nAnd so you look for things like, and, and you know, that's where miasmas come in.\nIt's, it's, uh, you know, literally bad air.\nUh, it could come from an emanation from the earth.\nIt could be, you know, the foulness of, uh, of, you know, in a, you know, as you, as you move forward in time, the idea is that the bad city conditions, unhygienic conditions produce these miasmas that are deranging.\nYou don't need to have some sort of supernatural or origin for these things.\nThey can be perfectly straightforward.\nAnd again, you know, when you think about it, and this is, this is sort of skipping ahead in the book, this is where some of the critical ideas of the 19th century came in.\nUm, you don't need to know about germs specifically to recognize the correlation between, you know, feted odors and decaying flesh and so forth as not great things to, you know, raise your kids immersed in.\nUm, so you have all this knowledge, and you have a persuasive, and the great thing about miasmas is, uh, you don't have to invent, um, a mechanism for carrying them from place to place, because if it's in the air, or if it's, you know, somehow in the environment, uh, it can move from person to person.\nUm, and you know, there was the idea of contagion, which, you know, comes from the root to touch.\nUh, you know, so obviously handling somebody diseased was understood as a risk, uh, uh, for the person doing the doing the work.\nUh, but also contagion as a concept sort of grew more indirect.\nI mean, I, I, I had the image in my head of the old 1950s early slushbox automatic transmissions.\nYou know, the hydroatic, where the gear changes are carried through water.\nYou know, you don't actually have a direct mechanical connection between bits of metal.\nYou know, the idea of early disease contagion being kind of hydramatic, um, contagion, uh, sorry, struck me as, um, as a sort of plausible metaphor.\nUm, but all that, you know, you can, you can look at the Great Plague of London, which is sort of where the book proper starts, and you've got a sufficient explanation.\nNow, you did have people who were looking both for specific treatments that might actually help with the plague, and they had, you know, no idea, and the things that were proposed were ineffective, though in some cases may have made people more comfortable when they were asked to drink more alcohol or something.\nUm, but you also had, uh, you know, some attempt to think about what kind of substance, what seeds of disease, in the language of the time, uh, might be going from, you know, what was in the miasma, what was the, you know, the active ingredient, as it were.\nUm, and again, you know, all of that is fully plausible, and you can, you can squint just right and see in this concept of seeds of disease, seeds of disease, a, uh, a precursor, uh, something, an idea that could lead you to microbes.\nUm, but there was nothing in the thinking of the time that required them, right?\nAnd there was no indication that whatever these seeds might be, you know, they could be inert, they could be, um, you know, uh, they could be sort of gaseous, they could be almost anything, right?\nUh, there's no, no pointer to towards, uh, you know, the some specific identifiable, you know, living element.\nAnd of course, during the Great Plague of London, this was, you know, 10 years before Leven Hook first saw microbes, but, you know, there were diseases that went, you know, diseases didn't stop in 1676, obviously, but this is something that's interesting that comes out in the book.\nIt is quite a span of time in between van Levenhook and then the acceptance of the germ theory of disease, but not only were people fighting disease at the time, they were doing so at least sometimes, uh, in ways that, in retrospect, make perfect sense if you believe the germ theory of disease.\nSo in the book, you talk about, uh, Jon Snow is a famous guy, Florence Nightingale as the nurse, and a lot of, uh, modern methods of, uh, being clean and well-behaved.\nBut the one I have to ask about, since we don't have infinite time, is Cotton Mather, who is more famous for other reasons, but apparently he was quite the experimental medical doctor.\nWell, I wouldn't, he's more of an eager magpie than an actual rigorous experiment.\nI mean, he, he, um, so Cotton Mather, of course, is, is, um, a Puritan minister.\nHe's most famous for his role, uh, in the Salem witch trials, in which he, um, deeply believed in the truth of the testimony of those who were accusing people of being witches and believed in, in sort of dream evidence.\nI dreamed this happened, and you know, thought that that was how Satan, uh, would, would communicate, um, and was thus directly implicated in the deaths of a lot of people who were clearly, you know, shouldn't have been killed.\nUm, and, uh, at the same time, you know, and he was part of this, he was not just a Puritan minister, he was, you know, if there can be such a thing, he was part of the Puritan aristocracy.\nHis father and uncles and, I mean, his whole family was basically in the business of being Puritan leaders.\nUm, and, and you know, he's a very funny character.\nHe, he apparently, when he was a student at Harvard back in the day.\n\n\nUh, he apparently had some inclination to become a doctor to study medicine, but of course the pull of the family business was too strong. The family business being a minister. Yeah, exactly. Uh, he was, you know, he was ordained and gave his first sermon at his father's church, which was the leading church in Boston. When he was ordained, something like um, 20% of the population of Boston was in the audience. I mean, he was like, you know, he was a big deal. His family was a big deal uh, in that line of work. Um, but he was also, he was clearly also um, both intellectually ambitious and um, and interested in the natural world. And so start, you know, 20, 30 years after the witch trials, he started writing to the Royal Society in London with these sort of American curiosities. And some of these things were just bonkers. You remember the Royal Society early on was was was itself uh, you know, ranged from this incredibly serious, important stuff to, you know, you look at it and you laugh. I mean, Robert Boyle, the great, you know, sort of uh, patron saint of chemistry, very early on in the Royal Society history, read a paper to the um, to the assembled fellows about a monstrous calf. You know, I mean, it ranged, you know, truly their interests ranged all over the map. And and and Mather presented these sort of American wonders. Some of them very um, you know, very real, interesting bits of natural history, some of them these sort of legends that he seems to have accepted credulously. Um, and uh, the Royal Society loved him and published him and made him a fellow of the Royal Society. Um, and he was also really as part of his ministry as much as as as and his intellectual life, very interested in all things related to medicine and health, and he collected anecdotes, collected recipes that people, you know, had for cures or nostrums. Um, and uh, and he really, I think, had a sense that it was sort of his duty as a minister and essentially a representative of God on earth, um, to do what he could for, you know, the health and well-being of both his community, but sort of, you know, by communicating with the Royal Society or whatever, the world at large. And um, and he was in fact genuinely one of the pioneers of vaccination, um, being uh, being uh, one of the earliest proponents of smallpox inoculation or varilation, as it's sometimes called, where you take smallpox material from somebody who's suffering from a hopefully mild case of the disease and you scratch, you know, scratch marks into a healthy person's arm or arms. They often did it in multiple limbs. Uh, and you mix this stuff in, and the idea is to give the person a mild case, a very, hopefully very mild case of smallpox, and thus confer on them what had already been observed to be the result of a smallpox infection if you survived, which was lifelong immunity to any further uh, cases of the disease. And it, it's not literally vaccination. You've not, you know, developed a vaccine, but inoculation is sort of the broader category of which vaccines are an example, right? And it's, it's, it's this is the uh, earliest attempts in Western Europe and the Americas to engineer immunity to a naturally occurring disease, and that's that to me is the distinction that's key. Yeah, because vaccines are a particular way to engineer that that immunity. Um, Mather learned about this technique first from his slave, uh, an African man who had been gifted to him by members of his congregation, who uh, who to who told him about undergoing this procedure in Africa. Um, and then when in the mid-1710s, the Royal Society published two papers uh, from doctors working in the um, in the near east, uh, in Turkey, and one was from definitely in Turkey. I'm trying to remember where the other one was working. I can't, can't off the top of my head. Um, anyway, that also described the use of this uh, you know, inoculation, smallpox inoculation in Turkish medicine. Mhm. Um, Mather wrote to the secretary of the Royal Society, having seen this paper and said, \"You know, I can attest that my servant, as he called him, his slave, um, had uh, had already told him about this and that he'd followed this up with conversations from other people with knowledge of Africa. Um, and that this seemed to him such a promising uh, uh, promising um, uh, preventative for this, you know, really deadly, horrible scourge of a disease, uh, that he that should smallpox visit Boston again, he said, uh, I will attempt to, you know, get this method used.\" And sure enough, a few years later, in 1721, smallpox comes back to Boston, and Mather um, tries to persuade Boston's medical community to do inoculation. Only one member of that community agrees to do so. Others vehemently oppose him. Um, a common theme in the book, like we said. Right. Well, and the interesting is they oppose him for multiple reasons. One, there is, you know, certainly there's risk and there are dangers involved. You're doing, sure, you know, the human subjects committee might have had some words to say. Right. Right. Um, but the other reason is, is, you know, this was a proxy for a battle over power. You know, you know, sort of professional power, who who had the right to do med, do medicine, you know, not Puritan ministers, goddamn it. Um, you know, there was a one European-trained MD in Boston at the time who bitterly resent, clearly bitterly resented the uh, incursion into his prerogatives, but also was more broadly part of a broader power struggle in Boston where a number of people um, up to and including, you know, James Franklin, Ben Franklin's brother, who was the publisher of the first independent, non-censored newspaper in the U, in the colony, were saying, you know, we got to reduce the influence of Puritan ministers, and this is a, this is a club to beat, you know, Mather with, and by extension uh, the Puritan uh, establishment. Um, and so there was this significant resistance up to the point of a direct attack, you know, on Matthew's life. Somebody threw a bomb through his window, which fortunately didn't explode. Um, but, you know, no joke. Yeah. Uh, and so uh, ultimately they were able to um, inoculate a few hundred Bostonians with uh, with almost entirely good results, while um, uh, several thousand Bostonians got sick, and something like 14% of them died. Um, and you know, the question was, those were lives that could have been saved, right? So the inoculated people essentially all survived essentially. There's there's a bit of controversy because um, a few died, and the question was, were they already ill or had they died of something else? Sure. And the person who was doing the inoculation said, yes, they were all, you know, wasn't me. Um, and uh, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to say exactly, but the proportion of people who suffered serious, you know, a huge proportion of Boston got sick. Um, a substantial chunk of them, and it was a relatively mild strain of smallpox, clearly, because a 14% death rate was below the average. Uh, but still, that's, you know, a lot of people. Yeah, it was uh, you know, Boston was under 10,000 people, and I think, again, I'm pulling, I should look at the book right now. Something like 900 people died. So it's, you know, that's a big chunk of Boston, right? Yeah. Um, and uh, you know, and and the the objections to this inoculation uh, campaign were sort of the prototype for what would come after, some legitimate medical concerns and a lot of other stuff going on at the same time. Political issues, cultural reluctance to, you know, attempt whatever was going on. Um, specific social enmity, right? You know, uh, all those things mix in, and that's not what you think of usually as an explanation for why some scientific event doesn't happen. You do if you've read some science. You do if you know a little bit about the history. So that that's not surprising to me. Speaking of um, personalities and conflicts and things like that, let's leap forward to the real germs, and Louis Pasteur, I guess, is the first person to talk about. Uh, obviously from your book, I get the impression that on the one hand, he deserves as much credit as he gets. He really did do a lot of other things. On the other hand, just like the more um, familiar examples to me of Newton and Linets, there were rivalries and jealousies and bitter priority disputes going on. Absolutely. Um, just to put a mark in, I hope we can cycle back to the story of childbed fever because that's a really classic and important um, case in this, you know, I think it sets up some of what we're seeing now. Oh, we can talk about childbed fever. Let's do it. Yeah, we're not going to run out of electrons. Okay. Um, so childbed fever, puerperal fever, um, is a is an infection. There are actually a number of different bacteria that can produce um, its symptoms. Um, and it happens to um, women who have just given birth. Um, and it can be devastating. I mean, it's, it's, it's very frequently fatal. And um, what's interesting is there's a whole sort of social history dimension to it. Um, puerperal fever is is described in in um, uh, you know, ancient Pythagorean texts even. Um, so it, people knew about it in antiquity, and it, you know, clearly is a disease that didn't just pop up in Europe in uh, the 16th, 17th century. Um, but there was a change that happened. Um, up until, you know, sometime in the 16th or 17th century, childbirth had been largely the province of women. You know, it's handled by midwives or, you know, um, and um, you know, it's very local. So if, you know, you wouldn't have um, in a village, 12 women giving birth in the same week, right? You know, that's not usually how it worked. Um, and reports of puerperal fever are sparse from that that period. And partly they're sparse because, you know, this was not, you know, that community was not a writing community. There weren't journals of midwives and so forth and so on. Um, but in the um, as you know, European cities grow and power centralizes, and you have things like um, increasingly formal uh, associations of medical, you know, of of experts in some sense, doctors. Childbirth becomes increasingly sort of overtaken by male doctors, and um, at least in the cities, happens in hospitals where you get uh, you know, you do get a lot of women um, in the room at the same time giving birth. Um, and that's when you start to see not just individual cases of puerperal fever popping up from time to time. You know, bad luck, there's, you know, some the wrong bacteria happen to be in the lying-in chamber. You know, that could happen. Um, but when it happens in a in a lying-in hospital, um, you have uh, you know, you have the perfect conditions for the bacteria, the pathogens, to move from patient to patient. Um, and that's what happened. You, you know, as very early on in the history of the hospital, you have uh, you have stories, you have reports of of essentially epidemic puerperal fever. The problem with hospitals is they're full of sick people. It's a terrible place to go. They're full of sick people. And um, you, you know, if you have a person, you know, delivering, you know, attending a delivery, uh, and then, you know, wiping their hands off and moving on to the next person, uh, you can see where the problem might arise, right? So you um, uh, so over the course of the 17th and 18th century, there are repeated reports of outbreaks, you know, of puerperal fever, where where dozens or more women will will uh, suffer, and many die uh, from this condition. Um, and you know, you start seeing like conditions, you know, you might have sort of a two or three-year run where there's just this, you know, ongoing transmission of puerperal fever, and again, up there were a whole bunch of different theories adduced as to how this might happen. Didn't appear to be a contagious disease, right? Because, you know, if if if a woman in a in a hospital falls sick, and then, you know, a woman in a in a in a home falls sick, um, unless you notice that the same person attended both births, it doesn't appear that there's any connection. Right. Right. The two people don't touch each other, all that sort of stuff. So there was there was no urgent need to try and identify a um, a sort of course of causation, right? Um, but uh, you know, people did notice that these were that that that the sort of explanations for how um, some derangement of how the milk was being expressed or other other issues that might attend a difficult childbirth, um, you know, that that was that didn't really explain why you'd get clusters of cases in a place and time. And so in 1795, you know, well before, you know, the conventional story is this is all worked out in the 1840s in Austria, but no, in 1795, this doctor in that, you know, um, you know, well-known center of medical research, Aberdeen, Scotland, um, in 1795, uh, a local doctor uh, started delivering babies, um, and uh, and took uh, notes on the midwives who were who were delivering babies, and there was this ongoing um, chain of infections and people suffering and dying of parable fever. And uh, you know, he he tried a couple of different explanations. He he looked at weather reports to see if there was a correlation with weather conditions. I mean, again, there was no, you know, base of knowledge or theoretical insight that drove this, purely empirical, what's going on. So he looked for correlations, and eventually he started noticing that there was not, it didn't take him that long. He started noticing that there were sequences of infection. Both he and the midwives would go from patient to patient to patient, and those patients would in sequence uh, come down with with this, you know, terrible, debilitating, uh, too often fatal condition. And um, he wrote it up, and he said, basically, you know, we're the cause, and he, he, he didn't say it basically, he said it explicitly, he said, you know, it shocked him to realize that he had been the source of his patient suffering, and you know, he he wrote this and published it in 1795. Um, and nothing happened. Nothing happened. Yeah. Uh, he was basically driven out of town. The midwives were furious at him for suggesting that they might be killing their patients. Um, it didn't get picked up in London. So, something happened, but not not uh, acceptance of his ideas. Yeah. And and you know, a few years later, he died of, I think, tuberculosis and was basically lost to history. And you know, there's no uh, you know, but the idea was there, and the know, you know, if you looked at that and you could say, okay, there is something that is moving from patient to patient on the doctor's hands or on the midwife's hands, um, and we need to interrupt that, you can, you can, you could, that was not a difficult leap to make, but it didn't get made, and science didn't know about microbes at that era. They did not, they knew about microbes existing, yeah, they did not connect them with disease. Right. Just I know we\n\n\nWe're sort of looping and looping.\nOne of the most interesting things in the book, one of the things I found most surprising was that Cotton Mather in the 1720s, you know, Cotton Mather, uh, witch burner, um, actually wrote down a suggestion that Thomas Levenson's animalcules, anamaculi, anamacules, um, might be the cause of diseases.\nAnd he even says, you know, different anacules could cause different diseases.\nThis was, you know, he wrote it down.\nThe book he wrote it down in was a manuscript at his death and wasn't actually published until the 1970s.\nUm, but there, and he almost certainly derived the idea from somebody else, a doctor who wrote in this one brief mention in a British paper.\nAnd again, these ideas were thinkable.\nPeople could imagine it clearly.\nWe have, you know, we have that absolute existence proof, right?\nUm, but it, it struck no chord, and the idea essentially disappeared for well over a hundred years, which is still to me, I mean, I, I, I, I have, I try to explain it.\nI think I do explain it.\nUm, but when you just stop and think about it for a minute, it's, it's mystifying and incredibly saddening when you think about how much loss and pain and suffering derive from the fact that nobody picked up on that.\nWell, there's a lot of ideas in the history of science that nobody picks up on.\nBut here is something where it's kind of obviously important to make progress on this.\nAnd you might hope that people are responsibly searching around for every possible hypothesis to go test.\nYou would.\nAnd I mean, one of the things to, to, if people listening to this take one thing out of it, um, the truly remarkable thing that Leven Hook did is he revealed not just more information about something, but a whole new realm of, you know, material existence that no one had suspected existed before, you know.\nUm, up until that moment, we didn't know about the microbial world, the microcosmos.\nUm, and it's there, and we now know how incredibly rich and important it is and how, you know, deeply embedded in the history of life on Earth and, you know, all the different things we can now say about microbes.\nBut, uh, it seems to me analogous to the impact that we would feel if we got definitive proof of life on another planet, right?\nYou know, it's that revoly.\nUm, and, uh, and you would have thought that that would have led to more speculation.\nI mean, again, to, to sort of push the analogy, think of all the writing from people, you know, um, in the 19th century and on about life on other planets.\nUm, you, the very, you know, that very early movie of the Lumiere brothers, Journey to the Moon.\nI mean, the idea of, you know, clearly the existence of other worlds beyond our own is enormously stimulating the imagination.\nWell, here was a whole another world, wholly unsuspected, teeming with creatures that are unlike the creatures we see with our naked eye, that have different shapes and different means of locomotion, that have, you know, apparently whole, you know, societies, ecosystems, interactions going on that have been there all along beyond the limits of our, of our senses, and now they're there.\nI am a little perplexed why that wasn't crazier, right?\nYou know, why that didn't, why that didn't, yeah, make people jump more.\nYeah.\nBut just to, I mean, I, I, I know I rabbit on too long about such stuff, but just to sort of round off the parable fever story, flash forward to Boston in the 1840s.\nOliver Wendell Holmes Sr., um, mediocre poet, Boston Brahman, um, and medical doctor at that point, a young medical doctor.\nAnd, um, he, at a meeting of a local medical society, somebody raised the question about, uh, how you can explain a, a then ongoing, uh, purple fever outbreak.\nAnd, and, um, Holmes took it on himself to try and study it.\nUnlike this doctor in, in, um, uh, in Scotland, uh, Holmes was not an OB, you know, he didn't have an OB practice.\nHe wasn't delivering babies.\nUm, he was a young and relatively inexperienced doctor at that point.\nAnd he just did this from the records, you know, case records.\nAnd he, you know, tracked this, tracked the, um, births, cases of prayerful fever, deaths, and attendance.\nAnd he, you know, in a relatively short period of time, he reported back to the medical society that, yeah, in fact, um, there are patterns of infection, and the common element is the doctor.\nAnd, you know, what needs to happen is the doctor has to make sure, or the midwife, I mean, the medical person attending the birth needs to make sure that they are, um, you know, fully cleansed of, you know, whatever is going on between births.\nUm, and he published this as well as giving it as a society talk.\nAnd again, not only did sort of nothing deeply change, he got a severe and, and, and, you know, actually contemptuous pushback from established, uh, you know, senior American, uh, OBGYN practitioners.\nUh, and the one that really stuck in mind was this, you know, perhaps the top such doctor in the US at the time, a Philadelphia doctor named Migs, or Meigs, MEIGS.\nAgain, I'm not sure how it, how it was pronounced.\nUm, responded that it was, you know, that, that, you know, um, that Holm's writing was the manderings of a sophomore and that what he concluded couldn't be true because, and I quote, \"A gentleman's hands are clean.\"\nThere you go.\nQED, right?\nUm, and then, you know, the story sort of concludes with a, with the most well-known one, which is Ignaz Semmelweis working in the Vienna General Hospital with the two wards where there's one ward handled by midwives who do not do pathology, do not dissect, um, the bodies of women who have died of purple fever, and the other ward run by doctors and male medical students who do.\nIn fact, you know, this is part of the great, um, transformation of medicine into a science.\nYou do pathology.\nYou study the diseases in the body by dissecting and analyzing the corpses.\nAnd, you know, mostly this was this enormously rigorous and productive advance in the way you teach and think about medicine.\nIt leads to all kinds of good stuff.\nBut not here.\nAnd so, you know, you, you, you dissect somebody who dies of parable fever, and guess what you have on your hands and body and clothes if you're not, uh, if you don't sterilize yourself.\nAnd so lots and twists and turns in the story, but Semmelweis figures out that this is the meaningful distinction between the two outcomes.\nThe midwives ward has a very, very low rate of purple fever.\nUm, and as many as 10% of the patients in the other ward, um, fall victim to it.\nSo it's a, you know, it's a big deal.\nUm, and he says, \"Okay, we're gonna stop this.\"\nHe puts a chlorine solution, um, that, you know, next to the autopsy room and says, you can't go back to the ward until you wash your hands thoroughly until there's no smell left.\nYou know, again, didn't know about germs.\nHe didn't know what it was.\nHe just said there's these, you know, cadaverous particles, and you got to, you know, they're associated with death, so you've got to wash the stink of death off you.\nAnd that turned out to be enough, you know, long enough, enough sterilization so that the, you know, when, when that was done, um, uh, the doctor's ward, uh, very rapidly approached the same levels of, uh, of infection that the midwives had already achieved.\nSo it was, you know, again, he had no idea what just cadaver particles, he had no idea what was causing the disease, what the pathology of the disease was, how it developed, what the, you know, chemical, biochemical mechanism, none of that.\nAll he knew is that when medical students and doctors walked from cutting up a corpse to delivering a baby, bad things happened.\nLet's stop those bad things, right?\nLet's just put a wall between them.\nAnd, um, again, you know, the tragedy is he was not.\nThough, though he got his ideas, got some traction in some places, broadly his conclusions were rejected both within the German-speaking world, um, and, uh, and beyond.\nAnd it took, you know, several more decades before the idea of proper sterile, um, conditions, uh, really took hold.\nWell, and when Pasteur does eventually come along and sort of put things together and, and put the germ theory on a proper footing, um, his inspiration or his route into it was not through trying to cure diseases, right?\nThat was a clear, clear thing to try to do, but he was just trying to make sure that you made wine correctly and reliably.\nWell, he did refer to, and it was sort of a term at the time, diseases of beer and wine.\nOkay, good.\nBut there was this metaphor clearly in his mind.\nBut yeah, his, his, you know, the first real, um, demonstration of a, you know, of a bad thing happening because of the metabolic, you, the metabolic work of a, uh, of a bacterium was Pasteur's study of making beet juice.\nUm, so he had, when this was in the 1860s, he had a, maybe it might have been late 1850s, excuse me, I misspoke.\nUm, uh, he had a student, he, he was a young professor of chemistry.\nHe was not a biologist, and he was certainly not a physician.\nUm, he was teaching chemistry at the University of Lille, and one of his students was the son of a local, um, manufacturer who made beet alcohol among other products.\nAnd they were having a bad run at the time where, you know, instead of producing alcohol, they produced this foul-smelling, useless substance, and, you know, they wanted to know why.\nAnd Pasteur agreed to take a look, and, uh, eventually identified a lactic acid bacterium.\nSo instead of, you know, yeast metabolizing sugar and water into alcohol, you had lactic acid bacteria metabolizing, um, their inputs into this foul-smelling, nasty, industrially useless lactic acid, hence the name, uh, within the beet juice.\nAnd, um, he was able to say, basically, uh, you want to make sure your, your, your vats of beet juice are free of these bacteria before you go in, and, you know, gave them some insight into industrial processes.\nBut that was the first insight where he saw that two things really, that bacteria free-floating in the atmosphere, microbes free-floating in the atmosphere could reach and, you know, affect substances like beer, wine, beet juice, soup, whatever.\nUm, so there, there's this notion that there is this, you know, uh, you know, potential pathogens that we are surrounded by all the time, um, and that these microbes actually do have meaningful, large-scale physical effects on, you know, the scale that human beings occupy.\nAnd, uh, there are a whole series, I mean, he did, there was that insight took him in a bunch of different directions.\nIt included, um, you know, finally, uh, you know, his, his often regarded as the definitive and final, uh, destruction of the concept of the spontaneous generation of life, right?\nUm, and, uh, but it also took them through, uh, into a bunch of different, uh, aspects of, um, uh, of infection and the sort of just microbial role in biochemical processes more generally.\nWell, that, that's what I learned from that part of the book was that, you know, an important aspect of it, because it's always hard when we know, or we think we know now what is going on.\nLike, why didn't they know?\nIt's not that hard.\nBut the existence of the microbes was known, but the idea that they could have an effect was less clear, right?\nLike, you know, people thought that for the wine thing, they were chemical reactions, sure.\nBut the idea that these little beasties are contributing to those chemical reactions was apparently a little bit of a barrier.\nIt was.\nYeah.\nIt, it took a long time.\nI mean, it took a long time even to associate yeast with, with the fermentation.\nUm, and then the idea that you have yeast that are doing fermentation, but these bacteria, which are, you know, yet smaller and simpler organisms, um, can muck it up, can produce different fermentations that, that lead to results we don't want, uh, that was, you know, another big step.\nBut the, you know, I think this is where one of the themes, you know, this is where I argue something that I think is, is, I hope, one of the, you know, one of the, the bits in the book, uh, that people engage with.\nI mean, they feel free to disagree, but, but, you know, asking the question, why did it take so long, you are ultimately asking for, you know, cultural and social reasons.\nAnd they, you know, a gentleman's hands are clean is one example of essentially hierarchical thinking.\nThere is a social order, and people at the top of the order are not capable of, and certainly not responsible for, bad things happening lower down.\nWell, there's a broader sense of that, and I think it starts in religion, but certainly doesn't just stay there.\nThis notion, you know, the, the, the skyli nature in Latin, scale of nature, and often referred to as the great chain of being, um, which was the title of one of the classic books in cultural history, Lovejoy's, The Great Chain of Being, um, but, you know, it's this notion, and you see it in the first chapter of Genesis, that, you know, there is God, there are heavenly creatures, and then there's humankind, and all the rest of creation is given into our dominion explicitly in the text of the, you know, that first chapter of Genesis.\nAnd this gets elaborated in a bunch of different ways.\nAnd you get, you know, by the Middle Ages and later, you get these, you know, beautiful, elaborate drawings showing you, you know, an old white-haired gentle gentleman sitting on a throne at the top, and angels with their wings, and then people, and then all the way down to rocks and dirt, you know, through all through the ranges, you know, some hierarchically organized, uh, view of, of the kingdom of life and so forth.\nUm, and one of the things that that structure, I think, makes it easy to believe and hard to disbelieve is that, um, authority goes from the top down and not the authority and agency and not the other way, right?\nEffect.\nSo, uh, I think, and again, you, you see those ideas, it doesn't have to be divinely, you know, or the, the divinity and the, the explicitly religious framing of it can become, can drift very far into the background.\nUm, the idea that, you know, humankind is superior to the animals is one that you can believe without needing to have, you know, the authority of Genesis.\nUh, the idea of white people are, are entitled to rule, um, others is certainly one that was persuasive to an awful lot of people for a long, long time, and perhaps to some of, some folks still, you know, the, the hier, the, the idea that there is a hierarchy of agency and authority, right, is one that persists in lots of different domains, and I think it mattered here.\nI think it was very, very hard to imagine that microbes, which were delightful to look at, and it's wonderful to like be a tourist in the microcosmos.\nUm, the idea that they could turn around and have, you know, agency or, or impact on, you know, us, crowns of creation.\nIt's a very hard, hard thought to think.\nYou need to, I think, and, and, and that.\n\n\nIt's one of the things I think I chronicle in the book. You need to accumulate a lot of, um, you know, ideas and, um, and specific instances where you see something is going on in the disease process that needs explanation, um, to really kind of let go of the idea that, um, that in some sense the bad things that happen to humans, humans do to each other. Yeah, that's an easy idea, easy idea to master, you know, but, uh, but to extend that and say, well, you know, despite our big brains and our, you know, opposable thumbs and our tool using, um, these, you know, single-celled, simple creatures can really mess us up. That takes some thinking.\n\nOkay. And do we properly give Pasteur credit for finally saying that out loud clearly for everyone to see? I know there was some controversy. Uh, I mean, yes, I think Pasteur and Robert Koch are the two people who are, who are most associated as the the the major founding figures in germ theory. Um, and yes, they did, they were enormously, um, uh, you know, they had enormous impact. They made major discoveries. Um, they were rivals. Um, I, Pasteur really did try to undermine, um, Koch's, uh, sort of claim of unique discovery with, with the anthrax, uh, bacterium. Um, probably, you know, he, uh, Pasteur did important stuff with anthrax, including coming up with an anthrax vaccine. Um, but, uh, but, uh, he certainly over stated, and, you know, he, he, he, he did mess with Koch. Koch did not take that well and and responded, you know, really in, in very hostile and even more belittling terms to Pasteur. Most of that just doesn't matter. I mean, it didn't matter at the time. Both people, you know, went on and had had the careers they had without really impediment. Um, it, it just clearly pissed them both off. And there was an enormous, at that point also remember, there's an enormous Franco-German rivalry. German stomped France in the in the war of 1870. Um, so there was that nationalistic animus as well.\n\nUm, but again, it's important to realize that, that, um, I think, you know, one of the Pasteur seeded some of the first major, uh, you know, derivatives of, of germ theory. Uh, news of his work on yeast and fermentation, uh, reached, um, Joseph Lister, a doctor practicing in Scotland, and Lister realized that if these bacteria lurking in in the air could contaminate beet juice or beer or what have you, um, then they could also perhaps explain the terrible problem of surgical wound site infections, which were basically made, you know, much surgery impossible to do and many surgeries, uh, very dangerous, and you know, you would have a compound fracture of a of a limb, and more often than not, surgeons would amputate rather than treat because the likelihood of infection was so high, that kind of thing. Uh, and Lister invented essentially sterile surgery, uh, and showed that you could, in fact, if you did, you know, originally very elaborate work to try and, you know, wall off the wound site from bacteria, you could in fact perform surgeries that had, you know, previously been fraught with danger or simply unthinkable. I do want to go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was just saying that happened in the 1860s. Yeah. Tragically, it happened just after the Civil War. So, you have this Civil War was tough. Yeah. And and, you know, you got hurt. Yeah. More people died of disease and wound infections than died of, you know, immediate battlefield trauma, right? By like two to one. Well, the chronology is is definitely interesting. So I wanted to, you know, again, skip to the highlights here, but vaccination, uh, now real vaccination becomes a real thing, but it did predate again, uh, Pasteur, but he, but he had a famous experiment with the sheep that I really loved, even though I mean, it's famous in some circles, but let's pretend that not everyone listening has heard about it.\n\nOkay, so as I said, Pasteur invented an anthrax vaccine. Um, again, there had, one of the reasons why it's always fraught to say, well, Pasteur was this great giant colossus stride, you know, so people had identified a bacterium with anthrax cases. Before that, these, uh, you know, these rod-shaped bacteria were showing up. Um, and you know, people actually explicitly wondered if they were simply a correlate. You know, you get sick with anthrax and that makes your bo your body less, you know, able to defend itself against, you know, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and these bacteria are opportunistically, you know, making their home in your bloodstream, that kind of thing. Um, nobody actually sort of definitively established these bacteria were the pathogen until Koch did it. Um, but there was, you know, there was this, uh, you know, it was certainly known that this bacterium was present in essentially all cases of anthrax, uh, by, you know, a decade or more before Pasteur started work and two or three decades before Koch, uh, got, got his, uh, got his interest going. So, um, Koch identifies and establishes, and nobody, you know, it's, it's, it's now, you know, clearly the correct answer that this one particular bacterium, uh, is in fact the source of the symptoms of the disease, uh, when they infect, uh, an animal or a person. And, um, uh, Pasteur works to, um, his basic method was to try and, you know, pass the bacteria through, uh, repeated animals until it was, um, attenuated. Keep, you know, recycling it. Um, and you know, he tried different aging them in cultures, and there are lots of different ways that he worked to try and create less pathogenic versions, um, of, of the micro, uh, and he eventually got it. Um, again, there's a little controversy. Did he in fact have, um, a live attenuated, uh, uh, vaccine, uh, by the time he did this famous experiment, or had somebody worked on, um, actually a killed version where they actually fix the bacteria in some chemical? There's, you know, the notebooks are a little funky there, and there's been some studies, but, um, and he announced that he had a vaccine, and some anti-germ theory, an anti-germ theory doctor said, prove it, and challenged him to this test where he was going to take, um, uh, there would be two groups of sheep, and there were, I think there were a couple of goats involved as well, um, and they're going to separate them up, and half of them, all of them were going to get injected with anthrax. Um, so, you know, given the disease, and then half would be, uh, but half would have been previously injected with the vaccine, and half would not.\n\nAnd, um, Pasteur said, okay, and took his vaccine to this, uh, to this, you know, farm not that far out of Paris, and, uh, did the test, and, um, it was one of those, you know, like they draw it up kind of experiences, uh, where basically all the control group that went unvaccinated died, and all the vaccinated animals were, you know, happily gamboling around the fields. Um, and it was regarded and presented certainly in the popular press, which Pasteur was really good at representing himself in, as this sort of clear triumph and clear demonstration of the truth of germ theory. You know, it's, it's one of the things we, we didn't. Yeah, you wrote a long book. I'm sorry, Tom, but we didn't get to talk about all the cool stuff. People should buy the book. But one of the themes that comes through aside from the sort of establishments always resisting you is the effectiveness of good science communication and in particular graphic design. You know, Florence Nightingale, Jon Snow, and and certainly Pasteur was a was a master of publicity. They, they, they got their points across not always by just having the better data or theory, but by being, you know, a little, uh, there's, there's some showmanship involved as well.\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, and and you know, that's no surprise. No surprise at all when you say it that way. Yeah. It's just, I mean, I guess what's surprising to us with our present, presentist bias is that they figured that out, you know, back then. But you know, again, Robert Hooke, you know, that book, Micrographia, he, oh yeah, you know, he, he wanted, he wrote that book to sell, and it did. Um, uh, but yes, uh, it is interesting to me that, um, as you say, Nightingale with her essentially the invention of polar diagrams, Nightingale was a formidably intelligent and gifted person. Um, she had, she had, uh, an unusual education for aristocratic young women or, you know, elite women of her time. Um, she did have some training in mathematics. Um, and she really, uh, had a gift for data representation that, um, you know, Tufte would have been proud of. I think, you know, you don't think Florence Nightingale graphic designer, but very much that was in her wheelhouse. And and she was able to, you know, these, these lovely circular, she called them coxcomb, because it was supposed to supposedly vaguely like that, you know, thing on top of a rooster's head. Um, but, uh, you know, you could really see the change in death rates from before and after introducing, you know, proper hospital hygiene in the Crimea Crimean War. Um, and similarly, um, Jon Snow's, uh, uh, sort of gift for for graphical representation, you know, map-based geographical, I'm sorry, not graphical, geographical representation of data, uh, again, made his case that small, uh, not smallpox, cholera was a disease of some specific contaminant in water. I mean, very, very difficult to to argue with. I mean, people did, but still, it was a very persuasive case. Yeah. Just so people know, like, these are maps of, you know, block by block, house by house in London. These people got it, these people didn't. Here's the water supply. Draw your own conclusions. Right. And it was, you know, it was even, you know, it even sort of accommodated the fact that London's streets are this ridiculous tangle. Exactly. Uh, because that, you know, Snow was able to show that even though some of the cases of cholera that were centered on this one bad, you know, source of water, the Broad Street pump, um, that some of those seemed to be, you know, quite far away, and there were other, you know, houses nearer that weren't affected, but he was able to show that that even though the crows, you know, the the crow's flight, uh, bird's flight distance was greater to those places, the actual distance through the streets to the water supply, right? All the cases were in in in houses where the closest water supply was that one pump on this, you know, street in Soho. I mean, he was he was good. And and and despite all of this human genius, I, I, we can wind it up by coming to the present day. Uh, not everyone is convinced. I mean, maybe before explaining that not everyone even in the present day is convinced of not just the effect efficacy of vaccines, but even, I, I hesitate to say it, but some people are a little skeptical of the germ theory of disease right now. Um, but let, let's just remind ourselves how effective vaccines have been in making the world a better place. I mean, you paint a vivid picture, not just you say you cure disease, that sounds good, but a wholesale change in life expectancy and demographics more generally that that we kind of take for granted now. Yeah. I mean, the the one message I'd like to leave with anyone listening to this is our release from the fear of infectious disease is in historical terms incredibly recent.\n\nUm, you know, people are familiar with the story of, of, of, you know, public health infrastructure. You, you know, you create clean water, you create, uh, you know, you get clean air, you reduce the incidences of all kinds of diseases enormously. If you just did that, it would be a huge change. But the combination of vaccines and antibiotics means that for at least people in the developed world and increasingly in in in, um, the rest of the world, uh, diseases that were once inescapable are now, you know, preventable or curable really readily. Um, and you know, in London, you know, as as late as 1900, there was still a significant rate of infant and child mortality, and that basically is not a problem. The fact that the US child mortality, infant mortality is worse than the rest of the developing world is a fact and a serious problem, uh, and has social and, um, and political roots, not medical ones. We know we can prevent these these maternal and child deaths, and, uh, the fact that we don't is in fact a a social choice, even if we're not conscious of making it. But broadly speaking, you know, in 1952, there was a terrible polio outbreak in the United States, and thousands died and more were, um, affected with, you know, lifelong, um, consequences. Uh, and two or three years later, the first polio vaccine came out. And that threat, you know, our parents or our grandparents were terrified to let their kids go to the swimming pool in the summertime in the 40s and 50s, you know, that's no longer an issue. Yeah. Uh, the vaccines against common childhood illnesses. Um, there were a few couple done before the war, uh, before the Second World War, but most of them emerged between 1950 and the end of the 1960s. That's not very long ago. It's, it's, it's recent enough so that I am, though I'm sure you wouldn't think to look at me, old enough so that I was a kid before the rubella vaccine, which was the last in the list to show up, uh, was available, and I caught a case, German measles, it was also called, um, and, uh, it was really unpleasant, and I was lucky because there are possible lifelong consequences for rubella, and I didn't get them, so that's great. Um, but, uh, you know, this is living memory. Uh, and now, however, uh, or up until very recently, those things were, I mean, measles was declared eradicated in the US, uh, around 2000. It's back. Um, the, uh, you know, up until very recently, no one, no parent had to, had to seriously worry that their child would be killed or damaged by diseases that for almost all of human history were devastating companions, just things that you had to deal live with.\n\nUm, so, uh, and again, I think there there are a lot of different reasons for this. There are explicit political reasons. There are, um, you know, just the fact that amnesia, you know, this sort of this, this, uh, lack of experience means it's very hard to credit that the threat exists. That's a a human, um, you know, perfectly normal human reaction to things. If, if you've never seen it, it's hard to believe it's real, right? Um, but the anti-vaccine movement and more broadly, um, the sense that public health in general, not just vaccine regulations, but the other things we might do, like, you know, wear masks and and physically separate during COVID. These are are seen by, I think, too many as, um, unwarranted intrusions into the individual liberties of, you know, of, of everyone. And that's not precisely the same as the kind of hierarchical, you know, chain of being kind of stuff I associate with with the difficulty of getting to germ theory, but it's clearly a kissing cousin. You know, there is a sense that there is a a, you know, still a hierarchy of agency. My choice is inviolate, right? And you know, you know, it's, uh, and you see that, you know, you see that happening in our politics right now. RFK Jr. is is, um, his HHS is rewriting vaccine guidelines to emphasize that vaccines are an\n\n\nIndividual choice and that there are complications and all that sort of stuff.\nThere are risks to vaccines, etc., etc.\nUm, and this is very much locating the um the choice and decision-making power over the, you know, sort of creation of these ecological niches for for uh infectious disease.\nUh, it's locating that in in um, you know, your choice and my choice and everybody else's choice.\nAnd um, you know, if the consequences of those choices were confined to the individual, that would be one thing, but one of the things about infectious disease is it is, wait for it, infectious.\nIt moves from person to person.\nSo those choices have impacts beyond the individual.\nAnd that's something that we find in our society right now and in our politics right now, something that's very, very difficult to accommodate.\nAnd it's also a case where, you know, you can believe whatever you want, but at some point, as a scientist, I do believe there are objective facts out there about how the world operates, but there are crucial differences in the time scales and tangibility of those facts.\nYou can think you can walk through a door, but if you try it, you will instantly figure out you don't.\nUh, you can think that vaccines um cause more harm than good.\nAnd you can get away with it for a while, right?\nYou know, for months, years, whatever.\nOther people are being affected.\nI'm not being affected.\nAnd so it's just so much harder to, you know, overcome all of the human foibles in the equation when there's that much wiggle room in something a complex system like uh society, politics, medicine.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd you know, I should emphasize, you know, the one of the things that's happened, you know, there was vaccine hesitancy from the very beginning.\nUh, and in earlier times, there was generally more reason behind it.\nThere was, you know, the vaccine, like any other techni technology, has advanced and improved over time.\nUm, but you know, one thing that's really different in 2025 than was true in 1970 or 1920 or 1850, um, is, you know, an understanding of um sort of disease and immunity down to the molecule or atomic level, right?\nUm, these are extremely well characterized.\nUh, you know, it's not that you know everything.\nThere's lots and lots of stuff that is not known about specific mechanisms and pathways and all kinds of stuff.\nBut an enormous amount is known and the the the mechanism by which vaccines have their impact.\nUm, the reasons why some vaccines are like confer lifelong or or extremely long-lasting protection and others do not is part of the, you know, interaction between um vaccine and pathogen.\nAll these kinds of things, these are understood.\nThey've been well characterized and um and there's, you know, there's no room for doubt anymore about the fact that a vaccines work, b how they work, and c what their limitations are, and d what the consequences of rejecting all that can be.\nIt can be, you know, one of the things that happens is is is, you know, if polio were to escape, uh, I've seen I've seen model studies that show that it could very, very rapidly produce extremely large-scale outbreaks because the, you know, the global um the global state of of polio vaccination has been waning since polio has been eradicated.\nWhy do you need everywhere?\nRight.\nWell, you know, it's it's it's gone everywhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan.\nAnd the only reason you'd vaccinate now is if a is if a you know a case showed up.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, so the uh, you know, the risks are real and growing, and one of the things you'll see is as as I suggested earlier in the book that some of the issues in thinking about microbes were unrelated to anything to do with the science of microbes or the natural history of microbes at that time, but you know, well-established social and cultural um predispositions.\nWell, similarly right now, a lot of the antivaccine stuff is now has sort of leapt the bounds of say the autism community, where they were terribly mis misled by that, you know, early paper that suggested um falsely that there was a connection between autism vaccines and autism.\nNow, it's left the bounds, but I think for an awful lot of people, um, being antivaccine is not actually a statement about what you know or believe about how the immune system works.\nIt's a it's a an affinity marker of I'm with this group, and this group has included as part of its, you know, political catechism um that vaccines are are are a bad thing.\nYeah, we just talked about that literally with um recently with a political scientist, Liliana Mason.\nAnd I mean, you and I both know that 10 years ago, if you said uh it's so annoying that conservatives are denying science like climate change or whatever, you would get the response, but you know, the liberals deny vaccines or or modern medicine and so forth.\nAnd it's it's shifted quite a bit for obvious reasons.\nIt has.\nAnd you know, I mean, and again, it's not surprising.\nUm, you know, all of us offload some of our knowledge and judgments to, you know, we don't have time to become masters of many things, much less everything, right?\nSo if people we admire and respect say, you know, the sun rises in the east, we don't actually need to go out there with a compass and make sure of it ourselves, and that's true for all kinds of things.\nUm, so when, you know, too many political leaders um, you know, make uh make political hay out of um, you know, opposing vaccines or what have you.\nUh, it's not surprising that large sections of their, you know, of their followers would say, okay, well, that, you know, I don't need to go study that myself.\nYou know, Joe Rogan or whoever says this and uh and you know, he wouldn't lie to me on the radio, whatever.\nUh, Robert F. Kennedy says that, you know, he's the secretary of health, you know, health and human services.\nHe's not going to lie to me, etc., etc.\nAnd you just go on about your business.\nUm, and again, it's not surprising.\nIt's very human.\nWe all do some variation of that, but in this case, it has tragic and fatal consequences.\nSo, don't take it personally, Tom, but after the podcast is over, I'm going to go wash my hands.\nYou put the cleanliness into our heads.\nBut Tom Levenson, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape podcast.\nThank you so much for having me, Sean.\n[Music]\n",
