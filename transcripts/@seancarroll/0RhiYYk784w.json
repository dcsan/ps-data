  "cleanText": "Hello everyone. Welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Uh, in the last AMA, the last Ask Me Anything episode, we touched on an issue that is talked about a lot in the set of online discourse involving, um, people who care about physics and people who care about science, which is the rate of progress in physics. Are we making progress as fast as we should or in science more generally? Personally, I think that in science more generally or even in physics outside fundamental theoretical physics, the rate of progress is really, really good, and we have nothing to complain about. Although people will complain just because they don't have their flying cars. There is something to be said about the rate of progress in modern fundamental physics. From the inside, it just makes perfect sense that the rate of progress is not as big now as it was in the 1920s, a 100 years ago, or even in the 1960s because you have to deal with the hand nature deals you, right? You have to play with the hand nature deals you. You don't get to pick your cards. Um, we don't have as much experimental input and puzzles to solve, and we have a really mature theory that works too well, etc., etc. There's a whole bunch of things to say about why we're not having earthshattering discoveries in particle physics and gravity as frequently now as we did a 100 years ago. There's a counter way of thinking about it that it's all because of sociology and group think and there are powerful personalities who are keeping good ideas down, which is, I mean, I want to say it's nonsense, but it's not 100% nonsense. It's like 98% nonsense. You know, physicists are people. Some of them do have strong personalities and strong opinions, and others will say like, \"Yeah, if that person thinks it's a good idea, maybe it is a good idea.\" But it's really hard sometimes to explain what theoretical physicists are spending their time doing in this world where we have a pretty good theory already. So today's podcast in part addresses that question. David Tong is a very distinguished theoretical physicist, quantum field theorist in particular, uh, at Cambridge University. And we're actually talking about two separate things. One is that David has launched on an incredibly ambitious effort to write a series of textbooks that basically explains everything that a young theoretical physicist needs to learn. It's sort of the successor to the famous Landau and Lifshits series of books from the 1950s. So David is doing, starting with classical mechanics and then going through electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, fluid mechanics, you know, all of the things you need to know. Hopefully eventually he'll get to general relativity and quantum field theory. So why would you do that as a working theoretical physicist? Why would you write so many books? What is the need for them? We'll talk about all that stuff. But then moving on specifically to quantum field theory, which is David's stock and trade. What's going on? You know, what does it mean to do research in quantum field theory when you don't have an experiment to explain? Well, the answer is there are little things going on in quantum field theory that remain mysterious to us. And how can you say that you don't have a good idea of where to go next if there are still things in the theory you don't completely understand? So, it's a little bit technical from point to point in the discussion. I thought we could indulge ourselves, uh, in this particular case because I really wanted to give a feeling for, you know, all the exciting stuff. There's more than one topic that is going on in theoretical quantum field theory right now. Um, if anything, I just hope that people can get a flavor for how the working physicist thinks about these things, and David is a wonderful, wonderful explainer of difficult ideas. So, I think even if not every bit of jargon makes perfect sense, uh, the spirit comes through very vividly, and hopefully we'll all enjoy it. Let's go.\n\n[Music]\n\nDavid, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.\n\nThank you very much. Pleasure to be here. So obviously the immediate impulse for impetus, I suppose, for inviting you on the podcast is that you're publishing a billion books at the same time, and uh, that's that's both scary and impressive that you're doing that. Tell us about the book series. I know that it's obviously textbooks, not trade books, but uh, still of interest to the audience.\n\nThat's right. So there is, uh, a little less than a billion, uh, that there were four that that came out two weeks ago. Um, plan is, do you know, I, I, I put in a proposal to do 10. That that was my original plan. I said to the publisher, I wanted to do 10 covering most of theoretical physics. I, I didn't quite have the heart to commit to that in the books. In the books, it says, it says this is a series of n, where n is much bigger than one. We will decide in the future what what N is. Um, so the the the plan was an ambitious one that the plan was to write a series of textbooks, um, covering and all all of theoretical physics is a silly thing to say. There's no way I could cover all all of theoretical physics, but but to cover the parts of theoretical physics maybe that I, I understand or I would like to understand. Um, and to to just tell the story from really the beginning, F=MA and Newton all the way through to our modern understanding of quantum field theory, that that was the small goal that, uh, that I set myself. Um, and it's it's not quite as crazy as it sounds. So for 20 years, I guess now, I've been writing lecture notes. I, I do a slightly weird thing where I teach a new course every single year. Um, I, I think that's a little unusual, but I just really enjoy learning physics. Uh, best way to learn physics. Best way to learn physics is to do research on it, but I'm not that good. So the second best way to learn physics is to, uh, is to teach a course on it. So I teach a course, new course every single year. I've been writing up lecture notes, uh, for 20 years now. And the plan was to to somehow bring those together and and start filling in the gaps that that are obviously there, improve them. Um, and yeah, just formalize them a little bit.\n\nI, I found that the best way other than doing research to learn physics is to write the book about it because in teaching you can still kind of cheat sometimes or Yeah, you can kind of leave things for the students to fill in or whatever, but in the book you kind of got to get it exactly right.\n\nI guess I guess that's true. I, I like cheating. I think that that's that's an important part of teaching is is figuring out what what details you, you know, it's important to get right and which ones you, you can wishy-washy a little bit. It's why teaching physics is much easier than teaching mathematics. I have taught mathematics courses. You know when we teach general relativity in Cambridge, we, we do it properly. We do differential geometry. We do it, we do it very, very rigorously. It's very hard to hide when you're teaching that. Very hard. It's very hard, very hard to lie. Very hard to to, you know, argue by force of personality alone.\n\nIn physics, that's very easy. Oh, yeah. You just sort of push through. There's a bit of bombast. Um, and so I'm not afraid to do that when when necessary.\n\nOkay. So, what are the books? What are the titles?\n\nSo, uh, first one is classical mechanics. Uh, starts at the beginning, as I said, starts with, uh, with with Newton. Newton, um, was, uh, in the the college in in, uh, in Cambridge where where I'm based, Trinity College. He, he, his presence looms very large. Uh, so start starts with Newton, but but then move through the the plan with all the books is that they start basic. Basic means first kind of course you're going to see at undergraduate level, but but then they really move through, uh, to teach you what I would say you would need to know as a practicing physicist. They don't do all the details, but but really what you know, a working knowledge of of theoretical physics, and for classical mechanics that that means topics such as Lagrangians and and and Hamiltonian. There was this in interesting developments where in the centuries after Newton, uh, other mathematician stroke physicists reinterpreted what what he did, and it's actually those reinterpretations, different ways of looking at things, focusing on things like energy rather than rather than forces, uh, which is the, uh, the important way moving forwards.\n\nAnd book two,\n\nbook two is electromagnetism. Uh, basically the story of, uh, electricity, magnetism, and and light, how they all fit together. There is an amazing set of equations called the Maxwell equations that govern everything. So, uh, the, I, I like the way this this one works. Actually, the book starts with the Maxwell equations. I think page six or something has the Maxwell equation.\n\nWow. Okay. Because usually like you, you move up toward that carefully because the notation is not necessarily familiar, right?\n\nAh, good. So the last, uh, there's appendices. There's a 100 pages of appendices where I do all of vector calculus. So if you if you want to start, you start on page 300, not page one, and you learn vector calculus. But then but then for electromagnetism, it's not the way it's usually taught. You usually, you know, you end with the Maxwell equations.\n\nbuilt up how electric charges work, how magnetic charges work. I, I like doing it backwards. You know, if you've got the maths, you write down the Maxwell equations, everything else is commentary. That that's literally everything you need to know about everything to do with electricity and and and magnetism. I, I like that way of doing things of teaching physics of of of having the fundamentals there and then and then working, working somehow, I don't want to say backwards backwards compared to everybody else, but but forwards in in some sense.\n\nWell, you know, we're competitors because, uh, one of your books is quantum mechanics, and I do, I'm in the midst of writing my own, uh, quantum mechanics textbook.\n\nI, I beat you to it. Okay. you did, and uh, we, we'll spare the audience, but there's a tremendous amount of thinking that just goes into what order you present things in a quantum mechanics textbook, where the Schrodinger equation goes, where cubits go, all that stuff.\n\nthat that that precise one is as as you know is I'd be interested to know what what you did is is a big one because you've got these these two different ways to approach it. One is mathematically more complic licated, the Schrodinger equation. All sorts of horrible mathematical subtleties you have to either deal with or sweep under a rug.\n\nUm, but but of course it's much more in contact with things that that you know already with with just ideas of how particles move.\n\nOther one is mathematically trivial, but but you ask this is to do with cubits and\n\nright\n\nyou ask why why on earth are you doing that mathematics? Why why is that the thing that connects to anything else in, uh, that I've ever seen? So which did you take?\n\nWell, you tell me first because yours's coming out first.\n\nOkay. Uh, I greatly value the connection between different ideas in physics. It's why I'm writing the the series precisely. So you you can see how different ideas in physics connect to other ideas. Some of it very obvious, some of it much less obvious. So for me it had to be the Schroinger equation. Had to be shredding equation where you can see how it's really connected to volume one classical mechanics. How one goes into the other. So,\n\nbut then I felt guilty.\n\nOf course. I mean, you feel guilty no matter what though is the is the is the problem.\n\nThat that is right. So then then I jump and do the cubit very early, like chapter 4 or something. But uh\n\nwell that's that's close to what I do because, um, in order to be a little bit different, there's there's cubit books out there and there's Schroinger equation books out there, and I figured just do both right away. Just uh, I think that it makes sense to say the Schwinger equation for a point particle, right? Because like you say, the the students know what a point particle is classically, and now you're telling them what is quantum mechanically. That's something they can wrap their minds around. But oh my goodness, you have to hide so much math under the rug. So I very quickly say the states are vectors. They're in an infinite dimensional space. Maybe it'd be easier if we thought about the two-dimensional case and really worked on that.\n\nYeah, that that's right. That that infinity right there. Even for just a free particle that's got no force acting on it, just a free particle of light, unbelievably complicated. Really annoyingly complicated.\n\nI'm trying to teach myself the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Are you uh into that?\n\nQuantum mechanics. Yes. But quantum field theory, that that's operator algebras, things like this.\n\nWell, thinking of states as this is going to be fun for the audience as linear functionals on operators, namely the expectation value. You can express a state by saying what the expectation value of every possible operator is. And that gets you like algebraic quantum field theories where the mathematicians prove theorems.\n\nI, I can see that. I, I'm going to duck that.\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nDuck that as much as I possibly can.\n\nYeah.\n\nAll right. So,\n\nis this going in your book?\n\nUh oh. No, certainly not. No, that's just for research purposes, but uh, yeah, I've reached the point in my life where, you know, I'm like it's I guess I've cycled back around to the graduate student phase of my life where I'm looking for new reasons to learn new things, and this is a great excuse.\n\nYeah, that that that I empathize with, which again is large part why I'm writing the books, and it's it's entirely selfish endeavor. So I get to teach myself. Uh,\n\nokay, so we mentioned classical mechanics, ENM, quantum mechanics,\n\nAnd the the last one is um interesting. At least for me, it's it's fluid mechanics.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd um I, I'll admit I I have sort of inappropriately grandiose plans for my fluid mechanics textbook. Uh, which of course will will crash. Um, I I don't think fluid mechanics gets the respect it deserves in physics departments.\n\nI I'm on your side.\n\nYou are?\n\nYeah.\n\nI, I, I don't think it's taught often in physics departments. I don't know about you, but I got shoved over to an engineering department to learn fluid mechanics. And so immediately, because you know, I'm I'm a little bit arrogant, I thought, well, you know, these engineers can't possibly have anything to to to teach me. And somehow that sort of seeps through the whole subject. If you open any fluid mechanics textbook, it'll tell\n\n\nYou, why is fluid mechanics important? It's because we can understand how planes fly, and we can understand how you push oil through pipes to minimize the energy loss. You can understand how the climate works and uh, how the climate manifests itself in weather, and why pushing oil down pipes screwed up the climate so badly. And all of these things are true, but it's never been the kind of argument that really excites me as a physicist, theoretical physicist, yeah.\n\nUm, exactly. And so I wanted to get across the theoretical physicist perspective, which is very straightforward. It's that you take anything in the universe, it doesn't matter what it is, you throw a bunch of it in a box, you heat it up, and no matter what you started with, that stuff is described by the Navier-Stokes equation of fluid mechanics. And that's an amazing statement. There are billions of things in the universe, and we go to enormous lengths to try and study them, and yet, somehow, in a particular regime, if things are hot enough, all of those differences just literally evaporate, and what you're left with is essentially the same. And so I wanted to get across why is that universality true? Where does that come from? Um, that's sort of why fluids are interesting from a physics perspective. And of course, I do all the exciting things like why planes fly, and uh, why stuff goes turbulent when you push it fast enough down a pipe, because it's all beautiful as well. But the emphasis, I think, is a bit different from most fluids textbooks.\n\nAnd for the audience, fluids in this case includes gases as well as liquids.\n\nThat's right. Even speaking now, having written the book, whenever you say fluids, you sort of think liquids in your head. Of course, uh, it's anything that flows, and so a gas or a liquid. And in many ways, gases are the things we understand very well. When the particles are far separated, we've got all sorts of control over this. You can start with 10 to the 23 particles in a box and just derive the Navier-Stokes equations if they're far separated. It's a beautiful calculation, which is chapter something of the book. Um, but you can't do that for a liquid. Liquids are much more complicated.\n\nDo you talk about the famous outstanding math problem? Um, there's a millennium problem about like proving the existence of solutions to these equations.\n\nI talk a little bit about it. I certainly point out that it's there. Um, the problem is in the full, what's called the Navier-Stokes equation. The Navier-Stokes equation has one really annoying term, which is the viscosity term. It's the term that captures the friction between uh, um, between fluid as one bit rubs against the other. If you get rid of that, oh, and then you have to add an ingredient, you have to allow the fluid to be more like a gas, so that it's compressible. And in that context, you can show that shock waves emerge, that if you are, uh, if you start with certain initial conditions, then you will find a singularity. That's exactly what we would like to prove or disprove in the Navier-Stokes equation. So, um, I talk quite a lot about shock waves. I dug into a lot of the history of this. The paper that first discovered shock waves is rather wonderful because the guy did the calculation and then didn't believe it, and then checked it, checked it over and over again. It kept finding this infinity, this singularity, and so finally wrote a paper saying, \"I know I've done something wrong. I know this can't be right, but I can't figure out my mistake. Hopefully, somebody else can.\" Um, so I go through that, and then I talk about the singularity problem, the millennium problem, but also compare it to the issue in general relativity as well. In general relativity, there's also a question of, uh, um, you know, when do singularities form? We know they do form, but there's a conjecture which seems even harder than the millennium prize problem of Navier-Stokes. The conjecture is that when singularities form, they appear inside black holes. They're shrouded by event horizons, and so you never get to see them. Um, so the fact that the two preeminent equations of classical physics, Navier-Stokes and Einstein's equations of GR, both have very subtle things that, after at least a century, mathematicians have still not gotten on top of, strikes as curious. Uh, so that's sort of the take I make on that. I don't talk about all the details, but just the conceptual idea that singularities are important, um, and poorly understood.\n\nSo, these are the four books that are coming out or will be out, I don't know, by the time the episode gets released. Uh, how close are we to some of the rest of the 10?\n\nOh, I don't know. Volume five is statistical mechanics. Volume six is condensed matter. They're both about 400 pages each at the moment. They're probably going to get to 700. So, I'll be honest. I feel a bit knackered. I feel a bit tired after getting these through.\n\nYeah, you know better than me. I, everybody tells you, \"Don't write a book. It's stupid. It takes up way too much time.\"\n\nYou, I remember long ago when you had the Blog, this is maybe 20 years ago. You had some very thoughtful, honest blog posts about how you felt about writing your great textbook, about writing popular books. Um, and it, you know, it's a lot of work, and the horrible thing is, it's not the writing. You know, you think you're done. You, you know, finally close down the lid of your laptop and say, \"Yeah, I finished it with all that work.\" And at that point, I think you're less than halfway there, you know, because you send it off to the publisher, and then there's copy editing, and they get these professional, you know, grammar Nazis, basically, who tell you you have to change this and you have to change that. I, I had, I say, I don't want to call them Nazis. They were lovely people, and they helped me greatly. But they all had very insistent opinions on where commas should go, and they all had completely different ideas of where commas should go.\n\nMhm.\n\nSo I was sort of fighting with this, and in some sense, I've always thought a comma is a gauge choice. You know, you get to put a comma anywhere you like, and this has reinforced that. But yeah, the work was pretty tremendous.\n\nSo, I'm trying to take some time off. It might be a couple of years until the next ones come out, but surely at least quantum field theory and general relativity have to be books, right?\n\nThat's right. Um, I think, where was I? Five and six. Yeah, volume seven and eight are going to be QFT and standard model, a combination of those two. I'm going to do GR later, actually. Um, because it's a classical field theory, and logically, it could have come, could have been volume three. You know, famously, Landau and Lifshitz, that amazing Russian collection of textbooks has Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and general relativity all thrown in together, classical theory of fields. It's just one, but you know, I've sort of noticed there are some pretty good books on general relativity out there already.\n\nIt's a tough market.\n\nWell, yeah, that's right. I wasn't really sure I had too much to add if I just did a standard GR book, but I thought it would be nice to do GR plus quantum field theory. So that the latter part of the book would involve, you know, the wonderful discoveries of Hawking, for example, of what happens during expanding space-times. There's all sorts of amazing physics when those two get combined together. So, for that reason, I thought I'd push it towards later in the series.\n\nAnd for the non-physicists out there, um, maybe say a bit about the folks in whose shadows you are walking, namely Landau and Lifshitz. They're the other people who did this marvelous attempt to write down all of theoretical physics as it was understood at the time for students.\n\nThat's right. And I'm reluctant to go there. It's the obvious comparison because no one else, no one else has been this stupid to try and write down all of theoretical physics. So, in the 1950s, uh, these two great Russian physicists, Landau is one of the giants of 20th-century physics, just so much named after him. Um, the story goes that he was imprisoned by Stalin at some point, and it was when he was in the prison cell that he envisaged writing down 10 volumes covering all of theoretical physics. And then the later story goes that, um, he would just dictate, that he would stand in front of Lifshitz, and I don't know how true this is, but that he would dictate, and Lifshitz was apparently the perfect scribe because he couldn't write anything down that he didn't understand. So, between the two of them, they would carve out this, what is an incredible achievement. It's fair to say it's not easy going.\n\nNot easy going. No.\n\nIt's, you know, if you understand the subject well, that's the place to go and look and hone your understanding. If you're a struggling student, that is not the place to go. So, I don't have the ambition of Landau and Lifshitz. I don't go into as much detail as they do. I think it's fair to say the books are maybe more human than Landau and Lifshitz. They're, you know, they're more fun than Landau and Lifshitz. You know, I'm excited about physics, and I want to convey that excitement, and I hope that comes across.\n\nWell, I'm looking forward to the whole series being done. I'll tell you one selfish reason why. I often get people emailing me basically saying, \"What do I need to know to do theoretical physics?\" And I usually point them toward Gerard 't Hooft's web page. Have you seen that? 'T Hooft has this web page, uh, called \"How to be a good theoretical physicist,\" and he lists every subject you need to know, and he points to both textbooks and online resources. The problem is that to be a good theoretical physicist by its standards is just too high. Like, there's just too much. Like, he lists the foreign languages you need to know, and you know, all the math, like a crazy amount of stuff.\n\nYou have to read those papers in the original French. I think you do. So when your books are all out, I'll just say, \"Read David's series. That's all. That's what you need to know.\"\n\nPerfect. Yeah.\n\nAnd the quantum field theory book is interesting because, of course, that's another subject where there's a lot of textbooks on the market. They're all different. Uh, they're all remarkably different. Like, if an alien came down and didn't know quantum field theory is trying to learn it from these books, they'd be like, \"Why are the books on the same subject so different?\" So, did you have an angle on that?\n\nI have, maybe not for the early parts, but I have an angle for the later parts. I think they just all stop way too early. I think they stop before you get to the really wonderful things about quantum field theory, the things we learned in the '70s, the things where quantum field theory links with ideas of topology in mathematics, the, the fact where, or the point where the interactions become between quantum fields become so strong that you can't use the techniques that you've been learning for the last 500 pages. You can't use Feynman diagrams anymore. So questions like confinement in QCD, the quarks in a proton that's stuck in a proton. You can't get them out. They've been stuck there for 13 and a half billion years. That force is so strong, you can't get a quark out on it. So, how is that possible? In some sense, it's another one of the Millennium Prize problems.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, at least closely related to it. Um, and we have ideas. We can't prove it, but we have ideas that have been extremely useful. Ideas like putting the theory on a spatial lattice where you can, uh, for a large part, make space discrete, in other words, rather than continuous. It's useful for simulating on a computer, but it's also useful conceptually to address these problems. So, I think when I get there, when it's going to be a more modern take on quantum field theory, where modern really only means '70s and '80s. It's not like it was yesterday, but very few, I don't think there's any real textbooks that cover that later material.\n\nNo, I think everyone uses Sydney Coleman's lectures, right, in Aspects of Symmetry for a lot of that stuff, but it's not systematic in any way.\n\nThat's right. That's one place where, um, where it's done beautifully. And he's one of the great pedagogues of our subject, one of the great explainers. But this is a wonderful segue because I did want to actually talk about what you're doing when you're not writing 10 books in all of theoretical physics. You're still cranking out the research papers, and quantum field theory is your expertise. So let's take a breath and step back. What is this quantum field theory thing that people need to know about? I mean, if they've heard about quantum mechanics, why are fields such a big deal?\n\nAll right. So this is the framework in which all the laws of physics are written. All the fundamental laws of physics are written. And the deep idea, which goes back to the 1930s, 1940s, soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics, is that what we call particles, lumps of energy that we call particles, are ripples of an underlying field, waves of some underlying field. That this field is a fluid-like substance that's spread throughout all of space, a substance that permeates the universe, not something you can remove from space. And that field has a wave in it, a little ripple, and because of the laws of quantum mechanics, that ripple gets molded into a lump of energy. And those lumps of energy are what we call particles. And so there's one aspect of this that I think is more familiar than most. Everywhere in the universe, there are two fields called the electric field and the magnetic field. And so everywhere in the universe, there's a little, at every point, there's a little arrow that tells you the strength and direction of the electric field and another one for the magnetic field. Uh, rather famously, when the electric and magnetic fields oscillate, when they ripple, you get what we call light.\n\nMhm. And then it was realized, uh, after the discovery of quantum\n\n\nMechanics that if you look closely at those ripples of light, uh, they're made of particles, and we call those particles photons.\nSo all of that, I think, is reasonably familiar to people who have an interest in science.\nUm, the amazing story that I think is not told as much as it should be is that that same story holds for all other particles in the universe.\nSo there is in our universe something called an electron field.\nAnd when the electron field ripples, they're the particles that we call, uh, that we call electrons.\nThere is a quark field and a neutrino field and a W boson field and a Higgs boson field.\nAnd all of the fundamental particles in the universe are not really the ultimate building blocks.\nIt's the underlying fields which are the fundamental things from which we're made that the laws of physics are built on, as far as our current best understanding goes.\nAt least, that's right.\nAlthough it's also clear that I don't think we're going to get beyond that in our lifetimes.\nYou know, there's speculative things like string theory.\nYeah.\nVery, very hard to test them.\nSo this idea that quantum fields is the fundamental fundamental is a time-dependent concept.\nOf course, we all know that what, right, but it's going to, it's not going away anytime soon.\nThis is the framework that we have to work with for now.\nSo, this is way out of sort of logical order, but I can't help but asking, do you personally think as a working theoretical physicist that gravity will ultimately be described by some kind of quantum field theory?\nOr do you think that the fact that we have things like black hole entropy, the holographic principle, blah, blah, blah?\nIs that evidence that we need to go beyond quantum field theory?\nI, I think at the moment gravity is described by quantum field theory, but we have spacetime is the field in question.\nEinstein gave us the classical, uh, field theory that the idea that quantum gravity is this big mystery that we've got no idea what's going on.\nThat's totally oversold.\nThe truth is you can quantize the gravitational field.\nYou can quantize it and explain any experiment we've ever done.\nRight?\nAnd it's true that we can't, we don't understand everything.\nIt's true you run into difficulties, but those difficulties arise only in the most extreme situations in our universe.\nWhat happens in the center of a black hole?\nWhat happened in the big bang?\nAlso, there are subtleties like the fact black holes have entropy, which, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's one of often in physics when a theory doesn't tell you when a theory will tell you when it's giving the wrong answer.\nA theory will give infinity in physics, and that's the way of the theory putting up its hands and say, yeah, I know what's going on here.\nAnd occasionally there are things where the theory tries to lie to you and, uh, doesn't quite give you the right answer and so doesn't admit its own failings.\nAnd so I would, I would say that that entropy of a black hole is closer to, uh, to that.\nUm, all of which is to say that for everything we're going to do in our lifetimes, quantum field theory of gravity that we have is perfectly adequate, but you, you wanted more, you wanted to know what's going to happen after we die?\nWhat?\nWhat are people going to discover after we die?\nThe point you made is a very good one and one that I've made many, many times.\nThat of course we understand quantum gravity in a certain regime as an effective field theory.\nIt explains why apples fall from trees, why the earth goes around the sun.\nThere you go.\nAll of those are quantum phenomenon.\nIt's quantum matter interacting.\n100%.\nOkay.\nBut then yeah, we do think that there is an ambition to get a full theory of quantum gravity that will account for black holes in the big bang.\nAnd I'm persuaded at least, you know, we have to make these conjectures because like you say, we might not be alive to hear them resolved.\nBut I'm persuaded that, you know, there's enough reason to that gravity is the one reason we have to suspect that quantum field theory is not the be-all and end-all of the full theory of everything.\nThat that might be true.\nI'll say two things.\nOne of which I think agrees with you and one, one maybe differs.\nThe, um, the thing that agrees with you is that this was one reason, in fact, I spent so long learning fluid mechanics that there is a sense in which Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Einstein equations feel more like the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid mechanics, and the entropy is really the big clue there.\nAnd of course, Navier-Stokes equations aren't fundamental; you derive them from underlying atoms moving around.\nAnd so it similarly feels that the Einstein equations might not be fundamental for the same reason.\nSo that, that I think is the big clue that maybe something more fundamental is going on.\nThe other thing to say is that we do have one theory of quantum gravity that works.\nUh, I don't know if it's the right theory, but string theory, absolutely, but whatever you think about it, whatever the baggage it comes with, it's a theory that shows you that you get Einstein's theory of general relativity compatible with quantum mechanics, and you, I can absolutely see how the two fit together.\nAnd every way we know to understand string theory, it's actually just a quantum field theory.\nIt's weirdly a quantum field theory that doesn't live in our 3 + 1 dimensional world, three space at one time.\nIt's one that lives in 1 + 1 dimension.\nIt's the theory that lives on a string, but all the techniques you use to solve string theory is quantum field theory.\nMaybe that's our limitation.\nMaybe it's something else, and we just, you know, everything looks like quantum field theory because that's the only thing we can do.\nBut, but you know, when you get to what the microscopic degrees of freedom are of quantum gravity, it was QFT.\nYou're just trying to convince us that your quantum field theory book is still going to be worth buying even once we quantize gravity.\nIt's still going to be an important part of how we think about these things.\nYeah, that one and the fluids book.\nAnd the fluids book.\nGood.\nUm, let's dig a little bit more deeply though into, uh, the working physicists, uh, ideas about quantum field theory.\nThere's this big idea called gauge invariance, gauge symmetry, gauge theories.\nUm, it's famously sort of, I don't know, people struggle, people sort of on the street who are not physicists.\nUh, it sounds spooky and a little bit intimidating.\nI don't think it's that hard, but maybe I'm oversimplifying it in my mind.\nSo, uh, what is your way of, uh, explaining the person sitting next to you on the bus what gauge theories are all about?\nNo one on a bus has ever asked that, but I will, I will try.\nI, I think there's something deep and surprising here actually in gauge symmetry.\nSo, what, what's the essence of it?\nIt's the fact that all the laws of physics that we currently have, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, Einstein's theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, every single one of them, it is built on objects that we could not measure even in principle.\nAnd that's the essence of what we call gauge symmetry.\nWell, the simplest example we learned about at school when we were in school and taking those very early physics classes, we were told that, uh, voltage isn't important.\nVoltage differences are important.\nYou can touch two things of different voltages.\nThat's bad if the voltage difference is big enough.\nBut the overall voltage is not important at all.\nIt's why birds can sit on these high voltage wires and not get fright.\nIt's the difference in the voltage between the earth and the, um, uh, and the wire that that's important.\nSo all voltages could just be shifted by an overall, let's call everything a thousand volts bigger, wouldn't change anything.\nSo of all the things we learn in school, most of them sort of evaporate later in life.\nYou know, you learn that force is important.\nForce is a very 17th-century concept.\nIt's not something that really survives as we learn later laws of physics.\nBut that lesson, that lesson about the stupid birds on the wire and the fact that potential differences are important, that's the lesson that miraculously blossoms into this idea of gauge invariance, that there is a redundancy in the way we describe the laws of physics.\nSo for example, you have to introduce voltage in the laws of physics even though the overall value of the voltage is not important at all.\nUh, you have to introduce in Einstein's theory of general relativity something called a metric.\nYou can't possibly measure the value of the metric.\nIt doesn't make any difference.\nIf you pick Cartesian coordinates versus polar coordinates, it takes completely different values, but nonetheless you have to introduce that object.\nThe wave function in quantum mechanics is importantly a complex number.\nIt's the key feature of quantum mechanics.\nComplex numbers have a magnitude and a phase.\nSo you should ask what's the overall phase of the wave function?\nGot to be a complex number.\nOverall phase doesn't matter in the slightest.\nSo it's just weird, you know, you're obliged when you write down the laws of physics to introduce things that somehow are unphysical.\nAnd that, that's the gauge principle.\nWe elevated to this fancy name.\nWe call it gauge symmetry.\nIt's, it's a terrible name.\nIt's gauge redundancy.\nIt's a redundancy in our description of the laws of physics.\nI, I don't really understand why the laws of physics are like this.\nAnd I like that it is because it allows loopholes to appear.\nYou know, you there are things in the laws of physics that might, you might think were mutually incompatible, but with this gauge redundancy, you look at something one way and you see that one feature appears.\nIn quantum field theory, for example, you want physics to be local.\nYou want that if you do something here, it doesn't affect what's going on on the far side of the universe.\nAnd so you know there's one way of writing down the laws of physics where you make use of this redundancy where you can see things are local, but then it doesn't appear that it's unitary.\nUnitary is the statement that all the probabilities in quantum mechanics have to add up to a number that's equal to one.\nThat's quite important as well.\nSo there are these two crucial features of the laws of physics, and you can see one of them or you can see the other one, but somehow it's very hard to see both at the same time, and it's this redundancy that allows you to see, to see both.\nSo I, it's a very deep principle.\nIt's what all of our laws of physics are based on.\nI think we don't really understand why it's the case.\nI've never heard anybody say, \"Oh, it's, it's got to be like this for some reason.\"\nI have an anthropic argument.\nI'm not sure if I want to hear it.\nGo ahead.\nSo, uh, if you think that living conscious creatures are complex systems made out of little tiny constituents, uh, and they're sort of like a fitness landscape where a certain arrangement of things, uh, can survive and be complex and metabolize, etc.\nUm, how do you find yourself at the, what, what we physicists would call the minimum of that landscape?\nLike, how do you settle down into it?\nYou need to give off energy, right?\nYou need to dissipate energy to sort of lower your energy down to where it needs to be.\nSo your stuff needs to be coupled to an essentially massless particle that interacts noticeably with you because you need to be able to give off arbitrary amounts of energy.\nYou need to be able to give it off pretty efficiently.\nAnd in quantum field theory, generically, if you have a massless particle, it's not going to couple to anything.\nThe one exception are gauge bosons, and therefore gauge bosons are necessary for complex life to exist.\nI, I'll grant that.\nBut that, that's a statement about why there are massless particles and in particular things like the photon in our universe.\nIt's not quite answering the question of why our description of the photon requires us to introduce things that are unphysical, which really is what gauge invariance is about.\nYou know, how can I, can I say equations or is that, you can, you know, like, look, the audience is going to have to go along with the ride.\nYou know, the basics, the basic field of Maxwell's equation is called a mu.\nIt's a, and it's got a little, little index mu, which takes values zero, one, two, and three, where the zero is time and one, two, and three is space, so it's, uh, those things aren't physical.\nYou can't describe electromagnetism without it, but you can never say what's a Z.\nA Z actually is the voltage.\nIt's the same thing.\nBut all, none of those things are physical.\nSo I agree that we need a massless spin one boson for anthropic reasons.\nIt's not the same as saying why we need gauge symmetry.\nThat, that's a choice of the way we've come up to describe the theory.\nI don't understand why we need to introduce that redundancy.\nFair enough.\nWe could wonder about these things we don't know the answer to.\nBut I think it's an important thing point you made that, uh, you think that even though we've been talking about it for n on 100 years, we don't fully understand this idea of cage symmetry.\nMy impression is, and this is beyond what I'm an expert in, physicists are still kind of thinking about new generalizations of symmetry and how that can play out in quantum field theory.\nThat, that, that's right.\nSo there, there's, uh, all sorts of new symmetries in the past few years that, uh, that have sprung up.\nSo, so to set, set the scene, uh, I think it's about a hundred years that we've understood symmetries.\nEmmy Noether's work re put that on firm footing.\nEmmy Noether told us that there is a close relationship between symmetries and conservation laws.\nAnd so anything in our universe that is conserved, electric charge, uh, what's called baryon number, that basically means number of protons and, uh, and neutrons, uh, all of these things that are conserved are conserved because there's an underlying symmetry, momentum and energy, another but very obvious, uh, examples.\nSo we, we've learned, we've learned that symmetry is important.\nIt's also the thing that allows us to make progress in finding patterns in nature.\nAnd so it's been important for the simple reason that it's allowed us to figure out what's going on with the laws of physics.\nUm, and so symmetry has been unbelievably important.\nAnd then rather surprisingly in the\n\n\nLast, uh, 10 years or so, um, quantum field theorists have realized that there's much more to symmetry than we appreciated before.\nI have to say there's been a lot of work on this.\nMhm.\nThe mathematics is lovely.\nIt would be nice to have a real smoking gun.\nThis is something we could not have understood without these new developments.\nA lot, a lot of what's been going on is we've understood more deeply things that we knew already.\nSubtle things to do with nature, that there's a fact that the pion decays to two photons, which is has long been understood to be curious.\nThe first thing is it shouldn't decay at all.\nThe next thing is, uh, it should decay, but the decay rate should be faster.\nAnd so there's been all sorts of subtleties.\nIt was figured out in the 1950s.\nI think we've sort of understood that these new kind of symmetries gives us an explanation for it.\nBut at the end of the day, we did know in the 1950s that the pion decayed and why it decayed.\nI'm not yet sure that we've, we've, it feels good.\nIt feels like it's progress.\nI'm not yet sure there's something we should be shouting about on a podcast.\nLet, let me say about it.\nWell, I think it gives a little bit of an insight, um, into what is going on in physics departments, theoretical physics departments.\nI mean, we have this, like you say, super successful framework of quantum field theory.\nAnd yet, despite all of its many successes, there's not a feeling that we get it perfectly, right?\nThere's still a lot to learn.\nAnd it maybe if you're a cynic, it's a fishing expedition, right?\nWe're like trying to learn more in hopes that it will pay off, but still learning more is important.\nI, I think that's right.\nAnd I think it doesn't have to be a cynic.\nIt is a fishing expedition.\nThere's lots we don't understand about quantum field theory.\nUm, you know what?\nOne way of saying this is you can teach a mathematician general relativity, and the mathematicians contribute enormously to our study of Einstein's theory of general relativity because they're better at maths than we are.\nYou can't teach a mathematician quantum field theory because they don't like, because it's not, it's not, it's not well-defined.\nYou know, we're doing, we're using mathematics that mathematicians haven't yet invented.\nYeah.\nAnd when they try to use it, you know, they, they, I think they, they call it rigor.\nI would call it pedantry, but, but you know, they, they struggled to get beyond the fact that the math isn't been invented yet.\nUm, and so that, but I have to say for decades I thought, yeah, these stupid mathematicians, you know, they should just get up to speed.\nWe're clearly doing it right.\nThat my mindset has changed a little bit.\nI, I don't, if we can't tell mathematicians, and mathematicians are not stupid people, it's because there's things we're not understanding.\nYeah.\nUm, and, and so, you know, there's various ways you proceed.\nWhat one is that you try to make it more rigorous in a way that a mathematician, uh, um, would understand.\nI, I think it's important.\nIt's not my style of doing physics, but, but I, I think it's important.\nUh, another is that you, you look in the places in quantum field theory where, um, you know, you, our understanding is limited, uh, you can sort of tell there's something we're not, not quite getting, something not quite there, and, and you just push, and it, it might be that, that you know, you push and you push, and, and okay, you understand a little bit, but there's nothing of great significance.\nThe hope is that you push and you push and suddenly it opens up new vistas.\nIt opens up a new way of thinking about things and, and a new way to, to understand the world.\nBut that, that, that's just research.\nI think that more research to some extent, at least the kind that you and I do, where it's really pushing the laws of physics beyond what we know, it must, must be, it must have been like that for, for centuries.\nAnd that's a very interesting discourse that you just went into because I, I see resonances, maybe you're not going to agree here, with the foundations of quantum mechanics, right?\nWhere we have something that works fine.\nWe can make predictions with quantum mechanics, but there's little hints that we don't really understand what's going on.\nAnd then there's an ongoing debate.\nHow much time should you spend trying to figure out what's really going on?\nI, I, I'll agree to some extent.\nI'm not a fan of foundations of quantum.\nI, I bit the bullet in my quantum mechanics textbook, um, and, uh, had a discussion about how unsatisfactory Copenhagen interpretation was.\nYou'd like that?\nAnd a discussion about how unsatisfactory many worlds interpretation was.\nYou might like that less.\nUh, and basically settle down on shut up and calculate, that, uh, there are, there is so many amazing things that you can discover if you just use quantum mechanics to understand the world, and that, that's the right thing to do.\nI think, I think I had a phrase that if, if you pause at the starting point, having deep thoughts and saying words like epistemic, uh, and ontological, that you are in danger of missing the quantum vistas that await just around the corn.\nOkay, but you could have said exactly the same thing about the mathematicians five minutes ago.\nI mean, I think, I think it's very, very parallel.\nI, I think you, you might be right.\nAnd the point is, you know, none of us know what right, quite what the right question to ask is, or what, what the right experiment.\nSo, we all have our own tastes, and I think that's important that people go in different, different directions.\nWell, speaking of the making it rigorous thing, you, you, quantum field theory in particular, it is in this weird world where it works.\nSometimes we're just sort of happy that it works without fully understanding why.\nOne of the techniques people use is to replace the smooth continuum of spacetime with some sort of discrete lattice.\nYou mentioned this possibility before.\nUh, this is something that has pros and cons, right?\nAnd, and you've been thinking about this, like in some ways, yes, it helps you like get some infinities to go away, and, and that's good.\nIn other ways, it brings up new problems that weren't there before.\nSo, uh, this is what I have been obsessed with for the past few years.\nUm, let, let me say that lots of people do this, huge communities of people that, that do this, and they do this for a very good reason, which is once you replace the continuum of space with, with a discrete set of points, uh, and think about quantum field theory in that way, uh, you're, um, in place to start to simulate quantum field theory on a computer.\nAnd, uh, if you know one thing about quantum field theory, it's that quantum field theory is unbelievably hard.\nUh, we're not very good at solving it.\nIn particular, there are situations where, uh, interactions become very strong.\nThings like interactions of quarks binding into a, uh, to form a proton.\nUm, if we just sit there with pen and paper, we're simply not smart enough to, to understand how that happens.\nUm, but we have these enormous computers.\nWe can simulate quantum field theory on these computers, uh, and it, and it tells us what happens, and it agrees perfectly with experiments.\nSo, so it's at a practical level, maybe practical is not quite the right word to use if we're talking about how quarks bind together to form protons, but, but at a level of, of just doing physics, comparing to experiments, it's extremely important.\nUm, however, uh, there is a problem with discretizing, uh, and I, I think it's one of the, the, the most underappreciated problems in theoretical physics.\nWhat long ago, when, when I was a postdoc, I, I, um, I went to a conference, and a very famous theoretical physicist gave an after dinner speech and said, um, here's my advice on how you choose a problem in theoretical physics.\nFirstly, you, you pick the problem, and you try to think, you try to add a, put a value on how important that problem is.\nHe didn't explain how you do that, but that was his first step.\nThen, then he said, then you divide by the number of people that are already working on, uh, and so you shouldn't, you know, honestly, I think it's terrible advice for a graduate student.\nIt's probably terrible advice for a postdoc, but, but once you, you know, you're settled in a nice, nice job, like, like you and me, this, this is exactly the way that we should pick at our problems.\nAnd so, so for me, the, I think the problem that scores highest by this ranking is the following.\nIt is that, um, it is not possible to simulate the laws of physics on a computer.\nUh, it's certainly true that no one knows how to do it.\nUm, but in addition, there is a mathematical theorem.\nIt's a theorem that was, uh, written down in the 1980s.\nIt's called the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, and it says, uh, you simply cannot do it.\nAnd the, the problem, uh, is, is not with the strong nuclear force, the thing that binds quarks together into protons.\nIf it was, we'd be screwed, we wouldn't be able to understand quarks, but it's with the weak nuclear force, and, uh, the weak nuclear force has a particular property that, that I'll tell you about shortly, uh, but it means that it's not possible to write down a discrete version, the weak nuclear force, that you can't put it on a lattice, make space, uh, a discrete lattice, uh, the theory as we currently understand it can only be formulated in the continuum.\nJust to interrupt the trouble very quickly, the idea behind putting on a lattice is not to say that space is discrete, but as a calculational tool, you imagine it's discreet, and then you take the limit as the distance between the points gets smaller and smaller.\nWell, so there's two ways to do it.\nIf you want to simulate, you're exactly right.\nIt's, it's just a tool, and just like you could, you know, simulate the weather, you do exactly the same thing.\nYou think of the atmosphere as being, being many, many, uh, discreet points.\nUm, the weak nuclear force, it's, it's a slight quirk, we don't actually need to simulate on a computer, that, that's what we can just do with pen and paper.\nSo that's somehow that practical impetus to, to try and put this on a lattice has not been there, and I think that's largely why, um, uh, why this problem hasn't been, uh, addressed.\nBut, but for me, it's, it's, I'm not someone that does simulations, I, I don't really know anything about computers, if I'm honest, um, but it's a bit weird, weird that there's a theorem that says spacetime cannot be discreet, and I have no reason to think it is, but isn't it odd?\nAnd it's sort of, it should be above our pay grade, which we, we don't have that information, that's right, this should be something at the Planck scale, we should, you know, have to build a, um, a particle collider that's 15 orders of magnitude more powerful than the LHC before we get to answer that question.\nSo how can there be a mathematical theorem that tells us this?\nAnd so I don't believe the conclusion of the mathematical theorem is right.\nI think there must be a way to evade it.\nNice thing about theorems is they come with certain assumptions.\nSure.\nThese are famously these no-go theorems in physics have certain assumptions, and you find which one you're willing to discard, even though they all seem very reasonable, uh, in, in, in order to, to make progress.\nUm, so this is what I've been struggling with for the last, uh, three or four years.\nI, I would say I, I'll also say I was, um, I'm doing this because I, I was inspired by the results from the LHC.\nResults from the LHC down to the Higgs boson.\nAbsolutely spectacular.\nAnd yet many in the community, and, and I was one of them, thought that when we found the Higgs boson, it would be a portal to the next layer of reality, if you like, that there would be accompanying the Higgs boson.\nYou wrote a whole book on this, uh, uh, that there would be something else, and I didn't have any skin in the game, and I didn't know what the something else would be, but there was an argument called the naturalist naturalness argument or the hierarchy problem.\nUh, it's an argument that I entirely subscribe to.\nI've spent 20 years thinking about quantum field theory.\nIt seems right to me, and yet nature is telling us it's wrong, that, that the hierarchy is not natural, that the hierarchy problem does not have a solution.\nI, I'm shocked by this.\nI don't know what to do with it because the LHC is working beyond our wildest dreams as a, as a machine, and yet, uh, uh, those particles are not there where we thought they would be.\nSo what I decided to do was just go back to basics, go back to the standard model that we know is correct, and as we said before, find what you think is the weak point, find the thing that just doesn't quite sit right with you and push and see if somehow we can make progress.\nSo that, that's what I've been trying to do.\nSo you did promise to tell us what is it about the weak nuclear force that makes it harder to put on a lattice than the other forces.\nVery good.\nUm, the technical name is parity violation.\nThe non-technical way of saying it is that nature has, uh, an astonishing property, which is that, uh, things can happen in the mirror that cannot happen in our world, that the laws of physics look different when viewed in a mirror, uh, compared to what's sitting in front of you.\nSo it's, you know, if you do see something in our world reflected in the mirror, I, I know your, the listeners can't see this, but I can see your books behind you.\nI can see that your, your books are the right way round because your general relativity textbook is sitting there prominently, and I can, I can read the words.\nOkay.\nUh, and you know, if this, uh, screen was flipped, actually for you, it probably is flipped because we're, we're doing this on Zoom, and Zoom does that.\nUm, you, you wouldn't be able to read it.\nSo you can tell whether you're looking at the real world or looking at something in a mirror.\nUm, that's true in our world because our world is complex, and there's things like writing that we've developed.\nThe astonishing fact that was discovered by Chien-Shiung Wu in the 1950s, uh, is that the same is true on the most fundamental level.\nThere are interactions that happen on the most fundamental level where they look different.\nThey're reflected in a mirror.\nAnd if you saw a movie of, uh, such an interaction, you could take a movie of such a small interaction, you would be able to tell whether you were looking at the original or you were looking at the reflection in a mirror.\nUh, this is, I think this might, I might be, I might be stretching the, might be a bit, bit too much to say.\nI, I think that this is the single most important experiment in particle physics of the 20th century.\n\n\nIt's a bold claim. I might row back on it if you give me some other examples. But it was understanding this that basically lays the structure for the standard model, for the theory that best describes our world. And the reason is because of very subtle mathematical properties. If you try to write down a law of physics where it's different when reflected in the mirror, that these have a name. These are called chiral gauge theories, a technical name that's given to them. Chances are that that theory will make no sense whatsoever.\n\nThere are these very subtle mathematical consistency conditions that chiral gauge theorists have to obey. And it's the reason why the standard model is a thing of beauty. You know, you look at the standard model, it looks horribly complicated. There are quarks and there are leptons, and the electrons are electrons and neutrinos, and they have these weird charges and these weird interactions with the different forces, and it's only when you appreciate that there's a consistency condition that suddenly the whole thing just fits together like the most perfect, beautiful jigsaw, and it could not be any other way. I mean, it really is stunning. Let me say this. I believe that theoretically inclined physicists like me would have stumbled upon the standard model and studied it even if it was not the theory of our world because it really is a thing of beauty. Moreover, it's, I don't know how you quantify simple in theoretical physics, but if you write down the simplest chiral gauge theories, the simplest theories that have this property that they're different when reflected in the mirror, I think standard model is number two, maybe number three. I'm not quite right.\n\nSo it's this stunning thing, and a large part of the structure of the standard model is forced upon you by this observation of Kenshin Woo. People might have heard the word chiral in the context of molecules before, right? There's certain biological molecules that look like right-handed screws versus left-handed screws. And that makes sense because the world of biology is messy. But the fact that we live in a world of particles that are all left-handed screws and none of them are right-handed screws is a little bit weird. That's exactly the right analogy that the electron has a left-handed part and a right-handed part, and the left-handed part knows about the weak force and the right-handed part that does not. Yeah, that's exactly the right analogy. Um, so it's this very subtle property of the standard model that cannot be discretized. That's what the mathematical theorem says that theories that where left and right-handed are different, where they're different when viewed in a mirror, cannot be put on a spatial lattice. Just feels odd to me. I can tell you I can sort of try to give a sense of how deep this is. I wrote a paper a few years ago with my great student called Nakarin Lohitsi. We did the following. You take all the particles of the standard model, just what's called one generation. So that's an electron, an up quark, a down quark, and a neutrino. They all have different electric charges. If you go to the standard model, those different electric charges are actually replaced by something a bit more subtle called hypercharge, but it's not really relevant for the story. What we did was the following. We said those electric charges or hypercharges can be anything you'd like. But they should be integers. They should be whole numbers. There's a slight subtlety because the quark is a third, but okay, multiply everything up by three or something. But, and then given that, what are the mathematical consistency conditions that these charges should obey in order for the theory to be consistent? That's the question we ask. There's some horrible change of variables. You get rid of these some, you add others. It was a bit complicated, but at the end of the day, we showed that in order for the theory to be consistent, you had to find three integers that obey the x, y, and zed that obey the following equation: x cubed + y cubed is equal to z cubed.\n\nNow, um, that's rather famous. This is Fermat's Last Theorem, and Fermat's Last Theorem says that there is a solution to this. The solution is 1 cubed plus 0 cubed equals 1 cubed, so you take the only solution that exists. Of course, anything else instead of the one, but it's essentially the same solution. You take that, you plug it back into this horrible change of variables, and out come the electric charges of the particles of the standard model. So Fermat's Last Theorem is underlying the consistency of the standard model. This is amazing. It is amazing.\n\nSo there are these, you know, reasons that are pushing me in this direction. It just seems interesting to me. And is this is probably too wild, but we were just previously talking about hints from gravity and black holes that quantum field theory is not the right answer. I mean, those same hints might lead you to believe that you can't think of space as a lattice of points. Is there any relationship between these two ideas?\n\nIt's a great question, and I, and the first, the answer is I don't know some ideas. So what's really going on, one way to, one reason to replace a continuum of space with these discrete points is precisely because, as you mentioned, it removes the infinitives in quantum field. It's a nice thing to do for that reason. Um, how does our world remove the infinities? Well, it removes it by quantum gravity, but the part of quantum gravity that we don't understand, the technical name is that, you know, there's some UV cutoff you should put in quantum field theory. You should not allow energies to get arbitrarily high. You should not allow distances to get arbitrarily small. And it must be that somehow gravity is smearing out what's going on on very, very small distances. So the, you know, there are many reasons to understand quantum gravity, but from my perspective, maybe the first one is it's the right way to think about quantum field theory. It is the right UV cutoff for quantum field theory that preserves all the symmetries.\n\nUm, okay, so what does it have to do with this chirality? And as I said before, the only real quantum theory of gravity that we understand is string theory. And there's all sorts of wonderful stories that were understood back in the 90s about how you get these chiral nature out of string theory. And you need to do funky things. You need to make space go, you know, string theory has these internal directions, manifolds or whatnot. They need to go pointy. They need to go singular in certain places, and that's how you get these chiral fian. So everything is tied up. Um, quantum gravity doesn't strike me as the easiest way to approach this particular problem. So I've sort of tried to be ignoring it, but you're right, it's got to be the right way ultimately.\n\nBut it's good. I mean, I love this discussion because it gives a hint of how again theoretical physicists are thinking in a world where we have a model, the standard model, that fits the data, but we are deeply unsatisfied with it as a theory of nature, and there's plenty of work to be done even without dramatic new experimental input. We would all love dramatic new experimental input, but it's not as if we are bereft of questions to ask.\n\nThat's absolutely right. And of course, there are the observational questions. What's dark matter? Got no idea. What caused the universe to undergo this period of inflation, which there's overwhelming evidence for back in the day? Got no idea. Um, so there's those, but there are also these more theoretical questions. Just thing, got the theory, know what it is, don't understand it, don't understand it as well as we would like.\n\nI think we have time for one more example of exactly that, you know, these phenomena that you get in quantum field theory that we don't fully understand, which are solitons, this idea that somehow fields can wrap in knots or something like that that can't be undone. I mean, maybe explain what that is, and is it really relevant to the physics of the real?\n\nIt's absolutely relevant. Um, I used to love solitons. I think I spent the first 10 years of my career working on solitons in quantum field theory. So what are they? Um, quantum field theories give rise to particles in two different ways. The first way is that the field has a little ripple, a little wave in it. As I said before, quantum mechanics molds that ripple into a bundle of energy. The second way, um, doesn't involve quantum mechanics at all. It's that, which might be hard to explain, but the field can sort of fold over on itself in a particular way, wrap around itself, and give rise to a lump of energy that doesn't disperse. That's the important thing. It doesn't disappear. It sits there in a stable way, um, even without invoking quantum mechanics, and that's goes by the name of a soliton.\n\nThere are some almost examples, there are some cheating examples that are easy to explain, and some others that are genuine that are maybe less familiar. So, an example that isn't quite a soliton, but is almost, is a smoke ring. If you, you know, if you're into cigars, that's a loud one, but if you're into cigars and you blow smoke rings, these are amazing objects. They persist for an extraordinarily long time and float around slowly expanding. And if you're very good, I'm told you can blow one smoke ring and then get another to go through it and backwards and forwards. And so they have amazing properties. They can link each other. But back in the 1800s, Kelvin famously had a theory of atoms which was all to do with not quite smoke rings, but it was inspired by his love of cigars, that you know, the these knots that you could form from things like smoke rings were the underlying atoms.\n\nUm, so that's something that's akin to a soliton. Another example is in a superconductor. So a superconductor is, um, the name suggests a material in which electricity passes with no resistance whatsoever. What happens in a superconductor is the electrons miraculously feel an attractive force, which is unusual because obviously the electrons are both carry the same charge and they get repelled, but the lattice in the superconductor deforms in such a way that there's a compensating attractive force. Those pairs of electrons are called Cooper pairs. They do something funky, and they give rise to this amazing superconducting behavior. Um, but what happens in a superconductor is if you try to pass a magnetic field through the superconductor, it says no. It says no to start with. It's called the Meissner effect. In Japan, they managed to levitate trains using this. My country, we're not technologically sophisticated enough to do that, but levitate frogs. We do, we can levitate frogs. That's right. Guy in Manchester famously levitated a frog. Um, but okay. So what happens if you insist, right? If you insist on pushing the magnetic field through, what happens is the superconductor relents. It has to at some point, but it relents in an interesting way that the Cooper pairs, these pairs of electrons, start to swirl around the magnetic field. And rather than the magnetic field just going everywhere through the superconductor, it forms what's called a vortex. And that vortex, it's a bit like the water leaving the plug in your bath, it's a swirling region, but the swirl is not water. It's these the these Cooper pairs. But that's a genuine example of what's called a soliton. So something new in the system that happens because the field, in this case, the Cooper pair field is having some interesting behavior.\n\nSo these also exist in quantum field theory. Um, and so it's quite interesting. There are these two different ways in which particles can exist in quantum field theory. Now I should say that in the standard model that describes our world, there are no solitons, which is a little bit disappointing. Um, but to theoretical physicist, for theoretical phys, that's not quite true, that there's a description of what's called pions. Pions are a state of quark anti-quark pairs, um, and the theory of pions as a solo, which is the proton and the neutron. So you can actually think of the stuff we're made of as solitons if you view it in a particular way. Could also view it as made of three quarks. So I think this touches on why solitons are interesting. There's often competing, complimentary ways to view the same system. You can either view a proton as made of quarks or you can view it as a soliton of pions. Um, but at a more fundamental level, I think it's true to say that any theory that goes beyond the standard model, certainly the majority of them, does have these solitons. Um, my favorite kind of soliton. I think if I had a favorite particle, this is it. Uh, is a magnetic monopole. Magnetic monopole is the north pole of a magnet without the corresponding south pole. Uh, there is a law of physics that says they don't exist. It's one of the four Maxwell equations. Uh, and yet I think anyone who's thought about this seriously is sure they sure they exist somewhere in the universe. One reason is that if you have a grand unified theory where all the forces are unified into one, these magnetic monopoles arise as solitons. So I spend a lot of time, maybe less these days, but back in the day, I spent a lot of time thinking about these objects. So for those of audience members who have not yet bought your book on electromagnetism and have not yet seen Maxwell's equations, there is this beautiful almost symmetry, right, between electricity and magnetism. The only difference is that there are electrically charged particles and not magnetically charged particles. So the magnetic monopoles would, if they existed, restore that symmetry, right?\n\nThey would. But they would kill gauge symmetry that we talked about earlier, that again, there are these little almost mutually exclusive things in physics. You pick one, you pick the other. So naively, it looks as if having gauge symmetry, which is crucial, means that magnetic monopoles can't exist. But the great physicist Paul Dirac back in\n\n\nThe 1930s figured out a loophole to that argument.\nSo again, they sort of they sit just on the cusp of what what seems to not be allowed, uh, and yet just sneaks through.\nIt's just a loophole that these things are allowed by the laws of physics.\nAnd we're at the end of the podcast, so, um, we can say provocative things and then not follow up on them.\nBut, uh, that sounds like I could like take electricity and magnetism and replace them with each other and take magnetic monopoles and electrons, replace them with each other, and I've invented a duality between two different ways of talking about ENM.\nWouldn't that be wonderful?\nThat it is is something of a dream, and it's a dream that, um, that holds in other context.\nSo if we go back to superconductors, you have these Koopa pairs, these electron pairs that are moving, and we think of these as fundamental, and we think of swirls of them as forming these vortices.\nBut it's quite possible, and indeed often useful, to invert that.\nIt's kind of a bit of a zen-like maneuver.\nYou think of the vortices as being the fundamental objects that are moving around, and you think of a quantum field of vortices, and then the vortices themselves can start swirling, and when the vortices swirl, they give back the electrons.\nSo there is this sort of complimentary view: vortices versus electrons in superconductors, monopoles versus electrons in our universe.\nThis is what quantum field theorists call duality.\nIt's probably the most overused term in all of physics.\nI wish we had a better term for it.\nBut the fact that there are two different ways of viewing the world, uh, depending on whether you write the fundamental equations in terms of, let's say, electrons for us or in terms of these admittedly speculative magnetic monopoles.\nSo there might be an entirely different formulation of the laws of physics where the electrons aren't mentioned; they emerge as solatons coming out of, uh, the monopoles.\nAnd these kinds of ideas were central toward the second super string revolution and showing that all the string theories were the same because what was a soliton in one was elementary in the other, and it's all stuff we're still thinking about.\nThat that's exactly right.\nAnd it's, yeah, it's beautiful stuff, and it it feels like it's a little bit of a hiatus now.\nYou know, we understood a lot.\nIt's not quite clear how it's useful for our universe.\nIt has had lots of impact in condensed matter physics, the way materials work, that there these ideas have been much more prominent, so it's clear that it's part of the story of quantum field theory.\nIt'd be nice if it was part of the story of the fundamental laws of physics as well.\nWell, since we are at the end, um, I'll close with, and you can be as loquacious or not as you like, what do you see the next 10, 20 years of thinking about quantum field theory bringing us?\nI mean, if what what is the best possible scenario?\nWhat are the breakthroughs we can get even if the LHC doesn't help us out with any clues?\nWell, best possible scenario is experiment guides us.\nUm, maybe dark matter axons.\nI, I, I don't know.\nI, you know, if you study the history of physics, and I know you have, I think it's fair to say that everyone was confused at every single step of the way.\nUh, and often the great breakthroughs happen by accident, or they happen for the wrong motivations.\nUh, and we do need experiment to guide us.\nWe're not smart enough to do it on our own.\nSo that that's my dream is that we find something; it's unsettling, and it pushes us in the right way.\nI know that wasn't the question you asked.\nSo if experiment does not come to help us, um, one of the things I've been doing is looking more in condensed matter physics, part because there are experiments, amazing experiments, and the ideas of quantum field theory that I learned about originally in string theory, um, are extremely useful, and it's the right way to think about topological insulators or fractional quantum hall effects or high energy superconductors, or, sorry, high temperature superconductor doctors.\nGot my communities mixed up there.\nUm, you know, these are incredible quantum many-body entangled systems.\nThey're described by quantum field theory, and it's not fundamental physics, but it's important; it's important to understand them.\nThey're also just as beautiful as anything in, uh, in other parts of physics.\nUm, from, uh, the high energy perspective, you know what I'd like to see, and I think this has started happening a little bit, is everybody just taking more of a chance on something that if experiment isn't there to help us, you know, what do you want?\nYou want, you want to just send out probes in as many directions as you can.\nYou want people just exploring crazy ideas, so I can see the community moving in that direction, certainly from 10 years ago when everyone was just gung-ho on supersymmetry, string theory, whatever it is.\nWe don't have such a strong guiding principle.\nI think that's healthy, actually, that people just start to explore different directions.\nI, I mean, I'm very, very sympathetic to that.\nI completely agree.\nThe empirical problem is, you say we should all strike out in different directions, and then people start striking out, and other people say, no, not those directions, that's not what we had, my directions.\nIt's a sticky situation, but you know, I have faith that a bunch of people as smart as theoretical physicists are going to keep trying new things and find out something new.\nAnd I and I hope that the audience has that belief also after listening to this wonderful conversation.\nSo, David Tong, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape podcast.\nYeah, thanks Sean.\n[Music]\nYeah.\nYeah.\n[Music]\n",
