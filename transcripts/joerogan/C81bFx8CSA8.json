  "transcript": "Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day.\n\nAll right. What's going on, man? How you doing, Joe? Very good to see you, sir. Thanks for having me, Austin. What is it like to be the head of the FBI? How weird is that? It's completely effing wild. I mean, I don't even know how to describe it. What was it? What did you think it was going to be like and what was different once you got in there?\n\nUm, I thought that we were going to be able to come in with the movement that President Trump came in with the administration to fix this, fix the errors that the leadership of the FBI previously made, not like the 37,000 change people. And we are we're doing a ton of work.\n\nUm, I didn't know we would be able to do it this quickly is my surprise. And that what that showed me was the people at the bureau, literally people who've been there, 30-year agents, they're coming up to me like, dude, we wanted to do that 15 years ago. Really, we wanted to do that 10 years ago. And then my question was like, you guys are the pros. Like, I'm just my job as the director. I'm not chasing down bad guys. I don't know how to do that. Is to give them what you need and get the hell out of the way. And they were like, dude, all they did was get in the way. So like what like what kind of stuff specifically specifically did you start doing that they wanted to do 15 years ago? Simple.\n\nThe one that I've taken the biggest heat for, you know, when I said, \"Hey, there are these are the statistics from the USG, so you can take them or leave them, right? I don't know where else to go because nobody else does these, right?\" In the last calendar year, not this one, the year before, last, a 100,000 people were dying of drug overdoses a year. That's one every seven minutes. A child or kid was being raped every six and a half minutes in this country. And there were two homicides an hour in this country. And we have a 38,000 person workforce. And I said, \"Okay, where are where are the agents? Where are intel analysts? Where is everybody? We got 55 field offices. We got 300 what we call RAS, resident agencies. So satellite offices to field offices, major cities.\" And they said, \"Well, we've got 11,000 FBI employees in what we call the NCR, the National Capital Region. So if you take DC and you do a 50 mile, 60 mile radius around it, 11,000, almost a third of the workforce work there.\" They said, 'What the hell are they doing there? They said, 'Well, they mandated if you want a promotion, if you want to move up, you got to come back here and prioritize stuff here. So, I said, 'Look, we're moving agents and intel analysts to the field. And that's what I did. 1500 people are going to the field because a third of the crime doesn't happen in Washington DC and the 65 miles around it. And everybody was like, we've been wanting to do this forever. I mean, just think about it. One agent out in Indian country, one agent out in Texas, Arkansas, Washington State, prevents a homicide, conducts a major drug bust, stops a ton of fentanyl or meth from coming into our country. One agent can do that. And the agents that I talk to now from around the country are just stoked. That's awesome. That's great news. That really is great news because the fentinel thing scares the [ __ ] out of me. It really does. Well, it's one of the things I want to hammer down on, but whenever you want to get into that.\n\nYeah, please. Yeah. It's so terrifying because, you know, we've shown it on the podcast, the amount that'll kill you. Yeah. It's so small. It's like the the tip of a pencil. Yeah. It's like point something something milligrams. It's it's nothing. I'll give you I I put this to big programming. I love doing this long form stuff and this is the only long form interview I'm going to do. I hope you know. Thank you. I do one interview. I do one interview a month. One. And it's usually like a five minute TV thing just to keep a breast. And we do a lot of stuff on social media. But I've been looking forward to this for a long time. Even when I was on the campaign, I was just uh this is like the best way to get information out. So fentinel, right? Everybody's like, \"How do you attack fentinel? How do you stop this stuff?\" Okay. Yes. Let's go after the gangs, excuse me, the uh narot terrorists down in Mexico. 100%. You got to go after the cartels, the drug trafficking organizations. You got to shore up the southern border. And the president has done an amazing job at both of those things. Made it a priority. So we have decreased the amount of fentinol being moved around let's say right but not necessarily coming into the United States. So where's the root of the problem? The CCP. So the fentinol precursors the stuff you need to make fentinol comes from mainland China. That's it. Now I'm sure like 1% of it comes from somewhere else in the world but that's where it comes. They've got hundreds of companies standing up in mainland China shipping this stuff out into the world. Now, their cover is that fentinol has and it does have a legitimate lawful purpose in terms of an anesthetic or medical use for um anesthesiology related stuff. Okay? So, there's like a minimal use for it. And what the CCP has done is they've come out and said this is like the biggest like talk about the devil pulling the wool over the world's eyes. They're like, \"We don't make fentinol.\" They're right. They don't. They just give you all the ingredients for it and ship it to Mexico. And then what they did was to trick the world. They came out and said, \"Hey, we're going to not sell precursor X.\" They're like, \"So now we're out of the fentanyl trade entirely.\" The problem is there's 14 other precursors you can use to make fentinol and they're still shipping all of those. So what we did when I got to the bureau is we stood up this massive enterprise to go after fentinyl precursor companies in mainland China and they're probably not going to like that. And what they're doing now to get cute is they're shipping that stuff not straight to here. They're going to places like India and I'm also doing operations in India and they're having the Mexican cartels now make this fentanyl down in Mexico still. But you know instead of going right up the southern border and into America, you know what they're doing? They're flying it into Vancouver. They're taking the precursors up to Canada, manufacturing it up there and doing their global distribution routes from up there because we were been so effective down south. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a it's a huge lift. Part of it is Americans just don't understand the\n\n\nDepth and depravity of fentanyl. But what's worse is fentanyl.\nYou don't hear fentanyl debts in China. You don't hear fentanyl debts in India. You don't really hear fentanyl debts in England, Australia, New Zealand, or five eyes partners in Canada. The Chinese, in my opinion, the CCP, have used it as a directed approach because we are their adversary, and they don't like us, and we don't like what they're doing when it comes to fentanyl. And their long-term game is this. How do I, in my opinion, kneecap the United States of America, our largest adversary? Well, why don't we go and take out generations of young men and women who might grow up to serve in the United States military or become a cop or become a teacher? And that's what they're doing when you wipe out tens of thousands of Americans a year. It's a long-term plan for them.\nOh, that is such a dark, dark thing. It is. But we got, we got, we're on it.\nWhat else could be done like with the Chinese companies? I mean, has there ever been any negotiation with Xi Jinping, with the United States, or the like where you could lighten up tariffs or do something and make some sort of a deal, or is it just so profitable for them that they're going to do it no matter what if they can? Here's the thing, they're not making a ton of money off of it, right? So, it's really just for that purpose. You could send, you could sell fentanyl precursors, and unless you jacked up the price to exorbitant amounts of money, they're not making a ton of money. And so it's an all of government approach. So I'm working with guys like the secretary of treasury to do sanctions on some of these companies. Right? Then I'm working with our five eyes partners. And our five eyes are the five English-speaking countries in the world. You know, uh, Canada, America, England, uh, New Zealand, and Australia, right? We share intelligence. We share classified intelligence on this stuff. So I'm asking them, I said, \"Hey, it's not just affecting us. It will affect you and your population. The CCP just hasn't directed it at you yet, and they know that.\" And I said, \"Guys, I need your help. I'm looking at intelligence reporting that shows fentanyl precursors are now in your country. The fentanyl itself isn't being deployed into your country, but it's there being manufactured.\" And so I'm asking for their help to shut down those factories and production facilities. And I'm asking the Mexican government's help to come and say, \"Hey, your drug trafficking organizations are now exporting the manufacturing of fentanyl and getting creative in the ways in which they obtain fentanyl precursors.\" So they'll say, \"Oh, we didn't get it from China. We got it from India. We got it from, you know, wherever.\" And they're, it's too cute by a half. It's not like there's been a reduction in the amount of fentanyl precursors that mainland China produces. What there has been a reduction in is President Trump's administration's aggressive approach to just crush the fentanyl trafficking. And unfortunately, our adversaries adapt. We're so good down south on the border here. And we're so good in Mexico that they're moving it elsewhere. Jesus.\nWe're going to get them. I promise you. I promise the president, the American people, we will not have kids dying of fentanyl overdoses in our streets. Just give me a little bit more time. We have a massive operation going on around the world on this. Well, that's great news. That's, it's great to hear. So, um, the fentanyl, a lot of it is, it's not just fentanyl overdoses, right? It's opiate overdoses overall. How much is a lot of it because people get hooked on pills and like, and then they want more, and then they buy black market pills, and those are the ones that have fentanyl in it, or is it Molly and things like that that have been laced with fentanyl? So great question. Nobody asks these questions. It's probably why your show's number one.\nUm, they are so demonic in their ways. They're like, \"We'll make fentanyl, and people can go use fentanyl and get killed on fentanyl.\" Then what they do is they manufacture as part of this lift, they being the drug trafficking organizations once they get the precursors from the CCP, they take their pill presses, and they make fake oxycodon. So like literally, I'm just giving you an example, make tens of thousands of pills of fakes oxycodon, and we, we bust them for it. And in that fake pill is fentanyl. It's laced with fentanyl that kills people. Then the drug trafficking organizations to make it appealing for the youth shape this illicit narcotic in the form of like candy and gummy bears. So you hear about kids in New York who just might have happen to have like a trace amount touching it somewhere also dying from it. So they have absolutely no rules or boundaries whatsoever when it comes to how they deploy fentanyl to get into our population. It could be through another drug. It could be through a synthetic. It could be through a fake drug. Or it could be like, \"Hey, and we've seized it. Thousands of pounds of material that looks like candy.\" Are they doing it specifically to try to get people to overdose on candy, or are they selling this candy as a drug? They're selling it as a drug. Okay. And they're just saying it looks like candy. It just looks appealing to kids, right? Like so inner city youth, they're like, \"Hey, put a pill down on the table. Put a gummy bear down on the table,\" you know, a younger person to be like, \"Oh, that's cool. Let me try that.\" I mean, I can tell you stories from now until the entire show about high school kids on the verge of graduating, and they went out and took a pill that they thought was, you know, an upper, but it happened to be laced with fentanyl. They died. Their parents are calling. They're destroyed. And people are like, \"Well, we got to go after the drug traffickers.\" I'm like, \"We do.\" And we are. But what my job is to educate the American public on the root cause of the fentanyl that is destroying our society, and it's the fentanyl precursors. And I've asked, I literally just got off the phone with the Indian government. I said, I need your help. This stuff's coming into your country, and then they're moving it from your country because India is not consuming fentanyl. They're not. No one's dying over there from fentanyl. But I need you and your help. So, my FBI is over there working with the heads of their government, law enforcement authorities, to say, \"We're going to find these companies that buy it, and we're going to shut them down. We're going to sanction them. We're going to arrest them where we can. We're going to indict them in America if we can. We're going to indict them in India if we can.\n\n\nStart indicting in places like Canada and the UK and England and Australia.\" This is a global problem. And the reason it's gotten so bad is because nobody did anything for four years. You know, people are like, \"How do they stand this up?\" Well, if you give the CCP, who has an endless amount of money to deploy in human capital, that's what happens. It metastasizes. Why didn't anybody do anything for four years? Have you been able to figure that out? Look, to me, I'm a national security guy, and anything that kills a 100,000 people a year is a national security crisis, right? It's what we call a tier one threat. And the last administration did not classify the drug trafficking enterprise as a prime threat against the American people. And so what happens is you reorient the system of intelligence collection operations. I mean, I'm not making this up. They said climate change is our biggest priority. DEI is our biggest priority. I mean, you guys have heard this and you've had guests on that say it, but these are the ramifications in real life. I only have X amount of people that can target something, right? Same with the CIA. Same with the DoD. But if the United States government and Uncle Sam and your commander-in-chief said, \"Hey, I need your x amount of people looking here. I can't clone that army to look back at fentinel.\" Plus, we have to follow the chain of command. It's so crazy that they would say climate change and DEI were the priorities for the FBI. Well, for the government. For the government in total. So, I'll give you a better example. So, I was in the end of the last Trump administration, I was chief of staff at the Department of Defense, one of the greatest jobs at the time. I thought the greatest job I'd ever have. And when we left, we said, \"Hey, you know, Iran's a huge threat. We got to uh never let up on the counterterrorism mission. We still have hostages out there we got to find and bring home. And the narcotics mission is a big priority. We handed off our playbook.\" And we said, \"Look, this is not a political issue. This is protecting the American people and our allies. So, we hope you guys continue this effort.\" So, the DoD has this thing called KONOPS, concept of operations. The Department of Defense has three million employees and a conop is how you move the machine of the Department of Defense. Hey, we have a threat in Indoaccom. How many carrier groups are we sending down there? We got a threat uh with government X. What are we doing operationally, kinetically? What are we doing intelligence collection? That's a con. The first concept of operation that the Biden administration launched at the Department of Defense was on climate change. You can't make this [ __ ] up. What do you think that's all about? Like as an outsider, as someone like looking at it going, I just don't understand. Like where's the profit in this? Like what what is what's the motive? Like what would incentivize all these people to get on board with it without someone logically stepping in and saying, \"Hey, this is not our top priority.\"\nI think at its so that was something I tried to answer when I was out of government for the last four years before I took this job and the answer laid in the first Trump term. We were doing things so effectively on national security that hadn't been done before in such speed and volume that the media hated us for it because the the other party had tried to do it and failed.\nWhat what things specifically? So when it comes to Okay, hostages. I could talk about that forever, too. Used to be counterterrorism was a big portfolio. I ran it for the White House and National Security Council in the first Trump administration. We brought home, people don't know this. President Trump in his first term brought home and rescued over 50 hostages and detainees from around the world. That's more than every president before him combined.\nWow.\nDid you hear about the the successes of reuniting families with lost loved ones from Africa and the Middle East or these operations that the president was courageous enough to greenlight to go into places like Afghanistan and do these hostage rescue ops and use Seal Team 6 and Delta or take out guys like Baghdaddy and Solomaini? President Trump's directive was simple. We are going to protect the homeland. we're not going to endanger the lives of our armed forces and our intelligence community, but their job is to protect the homeland. And he said, \"Go and we went.\" And I think there was such a resounding success that the media had such a hatred for President Trump and his administration. They just said, \"One, we're not going to give you the credit. Two, we're going to put out a ton of disinformation, which we can get into. And three, when they came time to transition governments from Trump to Biden, they just said, \"We're not going to do, and this is my opinion, we're not going to do any of the stuff that worked because then we'll have to attribute it to Trump's policies. So, we're going to go off on our end.\" And I keep asking people to prove me wrong. Like, tell me something you did in that administration that carried out the apolitical national security mission to a tea. Right? I mean, you had the Secretary of Defense in the Biden administration go down, go to a hospital, MIA, literally awall, and didn't tell the commander-in-chief and broke the National Command Authority. There is a reason and I was a guy responsible for the nuclear football for a part of my time at the White House that that thing and there is an unbroken chain of command between president of the United States, the secretary of defense and the national command authority at all times because [ __ ] happens. And what if it had happened in that one or two weeks the guy was in the hospital and maybe something did and we don't even know, right? But no one, including the president, didn't know the Secretary of Defense was in the hospital. I can't tell you how big of a cataclysmic failure for the national security mission that is. And what I tell people when they're like, \"It's all right. It's not that big of a deal.\" What if Hexath took a week out and said, \"I'm going to the hospital. I'm not telling anyone.\" What do you think the media would do to that guy and Trump if that were to happen now? Yeah. It would be catastrophic. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so this person went to the hospital for what? What was the I keep losing my flame. You got the Isn't the letter over there? I got it. Yeah, you got it. What was uh what were they in the hospital for?\nSo, Secretary Austin was in the hospital for medical issues. And I'm not saying you shouldn't have Right. But there should be someone else that's there's a plan in place. The Deputy Secretary of Defense comes in, you know, every time a senior goes out, there is a continuity of government plan in place. Oh, you're out for a weekend treatment. No problem. But they just hid all this. They hit it. That's That's insane.\n\n\nWe broke it.\nWe discovered it, and we broke it. And it wasn't the only time he did it. It was the second time, or the guy would end up doing it another time. Why would they do that? Just to hide the fact that they're sick. Well, that I think is up for debate. Like, people are old, and they get sick. Like, no big deal. You know, everybody needs treatment. Everybody's got to go to Walter Re. Do you think that he thought it would hurt him politically if he looked weak? I'm not... Yeah, I don't know. Speculation. Yeah, I don't know if I can answer that. I just... and the secretary at the time, Secretary Lloyd Austin, was like a 45-year military man. It's not like this was new to him. He'd been doing it his whole life. Next man up, you know. So, he had made a decision to try to keep it private intentionally. And he would come out later to say, \"Well, oh, I just wanted to keep it private.\" And I said, \"Hey, man. Your life when you're the Secretary of Defense, Director of the FBI, director of CIA, it ain't about being private. That's gone. You signed up to serve the mission. And when you do that knowingly, you have literally violated the National Command Authority.\"\nWow. So, you were saying there's a bunch of misinformation that was put out. Yeah, or disinformation. Like, what was that? Pick it. So, my thing is all roads lead to Russia Gate, right? That's where it all started.\nI was uh coming out of uh my tour at J-Sock as a civilian and and DOJ and um I would end up going to Congress to run this thing called Russia Gate, which at the time no one knew anything. It was just a whatever, and then it became what it became. And I would be the guy, the lead investigator on the Hill who said, \"Hey man, look, they lied in the FISA application.\" Let me give you Russia Gate in '96. Okay.\nCould you imagine a time in the United States of America in the 21st century where a political party would go overseas and acquire fake foreign intelligence from a foreign intelligence officer funded by donations to that political party in the United States of America, then take that material, package it, walk it to the FBI, literally, and say, \"Hey, we need you to surveil the opponent of our political party who happens to be running for the president of the United States,\" then convince the FBI to go into a secret federal FISA court that I used to use to manhunt terrorists and say, \"Hey, I need you to wiretap essentially all the comms in and around Trump camp because of the material we gave you,\" and then have that FBI lie to the federal court and the judge in that warrant application, which is a felony, and intentionally remove information of innocence from that application just to get it above the threshold so the judge would sign it. That's Russia gate. That's what they did. And you remember the years and years of reporting surrounding Russia. The FBI would never lie. The leadership there is above reproach. James Comey, Andy McCabe, Peter Stro, the list goes on. We caught him red-handed. We caught him. You've seen the text messages. You've seen the documentation. You've seen the reports. But when I did that, when I exposed that initially as a staffer on the Hill, Adam Schiff comes out and has his cronies leak to the world that I am acting as as a genocidal dictator. There was actually an article that called me genocidal. Hang on, it gets better. Dictator. Yeah. No, it gets better. How do you get to be a dictator? I don't know. Genocidal ones, let alone, right? Like, you know, it's it's a twofer. That's his words don't even mean anything anymore. No, he literally there's an article out there that they called me Torquamada, the guy from the Spanish Inquisition. Jesus Christ. And I was a staffer. So, the rule was you can ding elected representatives all you want in the media. You don't touch staffers. They didn't care because they knew what I had on earth was the biggest political criminal scheme ever perpetrated by portions of the FBI leadership and other people in the Intelligence Community in coordination with the media in coordination and who could have investigated it. But hang on, that's the kicker. So what people don't know about Russia gate that weren't paying attention was that warrant that initially kicked off the FISA surveillance on the Trump campaign at large was substantiated by FBI leaks to the media. Two of the articles cited in that warrant from uh I think Mother Jones and Yahoo News were leaks of information from the same leadership at the FBI, Peter Stro, Andy McCabe, James Comey and company. And then they in the application be like, \"Hey, it's not just us saying that Trump's a Russian asset, right? Look at this article, Mr. Judge, on the federal FISA court.\" And they included it in that application. So this was a coordinated conspiracy to take down your political opponent by weaponizing government. And now I say that now in February 2025, when I said that in 2017, whatever it was, people were like, \"You're out of your effing mind.\" And I was like, \"Look man, I'm just showing you the facts. I'm not making this up. I'm showing you the application. I'm showing you the documentation.\" And that's when they came after me. Um and it hasn't stopped ever since. But the the damage they did, they the media and the people that wanted to take out Trump, and I didn't care what you thought about, and remember back then I hadn't met Trump. Never spoken to him. Didn't know him. I took that job at Congress on one condition. I said, \"Whatever we find, we're putting out.\" I'd been in for 16 years at that point. Democrats, Republicans. I was a national security guy, intel guy. That's what I wanted to do. Chase terrorists, chase bad guys, bring hostages home and help protect the homeland. And I said, I didn't know if Trump did this. I didn't know if he was colluding with whoever. I didn't know it would turn out like this that they would actually manufacture and make it up. But half of America to this day still believes the narrative that the CNN's of the world pushed for five years. And if you look on their shows now, Russia Gate keeps coming back up because we keep exposing the documents that showed how bad these guys were. And most Americans like, \"No, no, they're already convinced.\" So in order to fix that disease temple, it is just that much harder of a lift for me to go back into the FBI. We're going to get it done. But it takes so much more communication and so much more energy to get after the American people and say, \"You were lied to.\" Because that's the hardest thing I think people can ever admit to themselves. You were lied to. I went out for years and created a life cycle out of this lie of Russia gate. I went on TV. I made money. I wrote books. I sold political advertisements based on it. I educated my children based on it because I thought it was the truth. And some of them have come back and said...\n\n\n\"Yeah, we got it wrong.\" But most haven't. And that's the disinformation seed in my opinion that started it all. And then you could talk about things like January 6th or, you know, pick your poison, rescuing hostage or what have you. The media just never got on board. They kneecapped Trump from the beginning by participating in the Russia gate uh collusion conspiracy with the FBI. It's so crazy that someone could do something like that and a whole enormous group of people could do something like that with no repercussions and to be able to operate and you know say they're the trusted source in news and you were part of something that was one of the biggest scandals in political history. Mhm. But just because of because it's targeted towards Trump, people look the other way. Like if that was targeted towards Obama, could you imagine how psychotic the response would be? People would be up in arms and furious. But the same people that would be up in arms and furious if somebody tried to do that for Obama are completely silent if it's happening to Trump. Yeah. Just think about it. What if me as the Director of the FBI in the Trump administration, right, during a presidential cycle went out there and said, \"Hey, Republican National Committee, do you guys have dirt on whoever's running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States? If you don't, can you go overseas and pay a foreign national who used to be an MI6 guy? Get me some bogus intel. Then I, as the Director of the FBI, will authorize a warrant. I'll leak to the media while I'm doing it. take their articles, put it in that warrant, and then go surveil the opponent so he doesn't get elected. I would be in prison, which I should be for doing anything like that. Crazy. And that's what people want accountability for. And that's what you asked me at the beginning of the show, you know, what's the hardest part?\nI'm like, hey, I'm the guy that is exposing and giving you the accountability from 2017 onwards, but I wasn't the guy in charge of putting people in prison and arresting them for this conduct. And so the other education campaign I have to go on is there's this thing called the statute of limitations. I can't prosecute people for their crimes in the past as the statute of limitations has run. And I'll give you a great example that goes right back to Russia gate. So one of the big uh systems I've created maybe because of my time in Russia gate is I'm committed to congressional oversight. I'm committed to giving Congress the documents they need to do their work and give them to the American people. Unredacted, no classification BS. You want it, you get it. So, we we just think about this. Me at the Director of the FBI, the former Russia gate guy, when I first got to the bureau, found a room that Comey and others hid from the world in the Hoover building full of documents and computer hard drives that no one had ever seen or heard of. Locked the key and hit access and just said, \"No one's ever going to find this place.\" What? Yeah. So, my guys are going through that right now. What's in there? A lot of stuff. I mean, that's the thing. People are like, \"Well, okay, go arrest him.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, well, how about you let me run a methodical investigation while I give over information.\" One of the things we gave over before this uh the room deal was I don't know if you remember who Nelly or is. It doesn't really matter. Nelly's husband, Bruce, was like the number four at the Department of Justice, and he was the one who introduced the world to Christopher Steel, the guy that started Russia. Well, the entire time her husband was doing that at DOJ, she Nelly or was working on an outside contract to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. So, she goes to the Hill and testifies as a result of our investigation right under oath. She said, \"I never worked,\" and I'm paraphrasing, \"I never worked with my husband on any of that. I would never do that.\" What a grassly put out just yesterday, two days ago. The Nelly documentation that the FBI hid to the world that we gave them where Nelly is caught red-handed providing information to her husband. Thumb drives related to Trump Russia collusion directly proving that Nelly lied to Congress. Felony can't prosecute her. Statute of limitations is gone. That's just one example.\nWow. What a dirty business. Yeah, I hate it. Politics is just it is just the dirtiest and in this age of transparency because of you know the internet and social media and independent news like everybody knows about it now. Like if this if if CNN and you know and all these left-wing news sources MSNBC and it was only Fox on the right and that was all we had and we had no internet all this would be completely secret. No one would have known the the Russia gate collusion that that all that stuff would be people would really think it's a true story. It would probably take decades before someone wrote a book where people started to really take it seriously and really realize that there was something [ __ ] up about it. Yeah. Um I'm not allowed to plug my book, so I won't. But I did write You can plug your book. Why can't you plug your book? I think there's some rules on it about I can plug your book. What's your book? Give it to me. Here you go. This one's for you anyway. Government gangsters.\nGovernment Gangsters by Kash Patel. Go buy it. Plugged.\nYou didn't plug it. I did. I love it. The Did you do the audio? Yeah. You read it? Oh, I I got somebody to to do it. I My voice is not for radio or TV. Oh, come on, man. You got a great voice. I appreciate that. It's uh it's taken time and a lot of cigars to get to hear. It would be good for you to read it. They should let you read it. Well, I mean, what's in But the reason I wrote it is one, I never thought I was going back in a government service. And two, part of the job to completing the mission was exposing what people didn't ever think could happen in the United States of America. And it was not just disinformation, misinformation, but your government and leaders in government weaponizing it for political purposes. Not just FBI and DOJ, but others in the Intelligence Community. And what it shows you is the back end of that, too. The rewards, right? the guys that wrapping it back up or reversing it back up. The guys that were in charge of Russia gate at the FBI, Andy McCabe, right? Remember what this guy did? Andy McCabe agreed to set in motion a plan with the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, at the time to have him wear a wire into the Oval Office to record President Trump. That those documents we found, we released them. Whoa. Put that aside. While Andy McCay was in charge of the Trump Russia gate collusion investigation, his wife was running for political office in the state of Virginia. Do you know who's funding her campaign for political office to $600,000? Hillary Clinton world, who happened to be running against Donald Trump. Do you know what Andy McCabe did? He leaked information about\n\n\nThe Clinton investigation to the media unlawfully as the deputy director of the FBI.\nGot caught by us, then lied about it to federal authorities, and that's the reason Andy McCay was dismissed.\nDo you know what the Biden administration did?\nThey allowed him to retire out of the FBI with full benefits.\nWow.\nHe got rewarded.\nYou know what he does now?\nHe's on CNN.\nYou know who's also on CNN?\nPeter Stro, the head of the counter intelligence unit that had that affair with Lisa Page, who basically put out those text messages, who was running that investigation with Andy McCabe and said, \"Trump people smell in Walmart and we're never going to let them win.\nI have an insurance policy.\"\nThat guy's on CNN.\nSo, they get rewarded for putting on this disinformation campaign, for this illegal activity because the media will never correct or some portion of the media will never correct the record.\nRemember, these guys got Pulitzers.\nNew York Times, same thing.\nThese guys got the biggest award in journalism.\nThey were proven wrong, not by me, by the own evidence created by, you know, how I caught these guys?\nBecause these guys were so arrogant, they would write everything down.\nAnd I found the documents.\nWhy would they write everything down?\nThey're so arrogant.\nThey think, \"No one's going to catch us.\nI'm going to write everything down.\nWe're going to put it in a lock box.\nWe're going to put it in a vault, and no one's going to find it.\"\nWell, you know what?\nI found the vault, and now I'm going to work.\nWow.\nNow, is there a statute of limitations on those crimes?\nSo, generally the statute of limitations on crimes for process crimes that we call them, it's five years.\nBut if you can tie them to an overarching conspiracy, there is no statute of limitations.\nSo, if there was more egregious conduct that no one knew about before that we are just finding and we are investigating, then we'll have to relook at it.\nThe one thing we will do is put out all that information to the American public.\nOnce we actually get through it and we'll give it to Congress and if we can work with our partners at Department of Justice to come up with a prosecution that'll be their decision, we'll we'll do it.\nThe disturbing thing about all this to me is how people on the left are willing to look the other way because this is a just a dangerous precedent.\nIf if the federal government is doing this and they're doing this to someone who you consider an enemy, what's to stop this from doing it against your candidate, like this is unprecedented behavior that's tolerated and coordinated with the media.\nLike that's dangerous for the country.\nIt's d but people are so ideologically captured.\nThey're so they're so locked in to their party and by any means necessary, we got to get Trump out.\nAnd they push that narrative so hard that they're willing to do a very unamerican thing.\nYeah.\nAnd my goal now that I'm back in government is to make sure this doesn't happen again ever.\nThat's the goal.\nHow can you do that?\nHow can you make sure it doesn't happen again?\nEver?\nExposing it all.\nAnd I know there are people and look, people keep calling me and saying, \"When are you going to arrest every when you going to go out there and arrest everybody that did everything to Donald Trump?\"\nI was like, first of all, you guys were barking at people who were in the seat before me to do that, and they didn't.\nThey failed.\nThe difference between me and that guy is one, I'm the guy that exposed it.\nTwo, I didn't tell you this.\nI was the guy they targeted.\nSo, while I was doing the Russia gate investigation, do you know what Trump's own Department of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general of the Department of Justice, Christopher Ray, then Director of the FBI, did to me and a dozen other staffers who were working Russia Gate.\nThey subpoenaed all of our information while I was running the Russia Gate investigation.\nWe wouldn't find out for 5 years.\nYou want to know why?\nBecause these guys were so vindictive.\nThey went to the federal court, not only got a search warrant, they got a judge to say to all the telecom companies, Google, Facebook, everybody else, your banking companies, everybody, do not tell them for 5 years that we authorized this subpoena.\nSo, I just found that out last year.\nWow.\nThis is how hard This is what I'm trying to show.\nIt's not a Republican and dem or Democratic thing, right?\nIt's an all hands-on approach to protect the leadership that was so corrupt, to protect themselves and their actions and their friends.\nMy mission is to educate the world that this happened.\nAnd as director of the FBI of responsibility, I'm not just going to bring a case because somebody hurt me.\nThey did and they continue to do it.\n[ __ ] my house just got swatted yesterday.\nWhat?\nYeah, but you got swatted.\nOh, yeah.\nThe head of the FBI gets swatted.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThese people play it's it's the ultimate height of hypocrisy.\nThey have two sets of rules.\nOne against you and one for them.\nAnd what I want to do is lay out that entire body of work for the American people with Congress.\nAnd I'm doing it with guys like uh Grassly and Jordan and Kennedy and Ran Paul on CO 19 and we could talk about the origins.\nWe actually have some pretty cool developments on that front and let the American people know that my mission has always been to put out the truth whatever the consequences are whoever it's against.\nLike I did when I signed up for Russia.\nIf Donald Trump was a Russian asset and I proved it, I was telling the world that that's what matters.\nAnd if we can hold people accountable in terms of indictments, then we'll work with our partners at Department of Justice.\nBut what I'm asking people is don't trust me.\nI don't care about that.\nLook at what I have done and what we have done.\nThat's the guy that's now in charge of the FBI.\nHis leadership team is in place.\nWe've got great partners at Department of Justice.\nWe're the ones working on all this stuff.\nAnd and look, let's just let's just get to it because I know it's on people's minds.\nEpstein, right?\nThe reason people are pissed off about that is the same same thing, right?\n20 years ago or whenever it was 2006,78, Epste gets his sweetheart plea deal, right?\nRight.\nAfter committing the most horrific crimes on planet Earth, right?\nI wasn't in I wasn't in power there.\nI wasn't in place there.\nI, you know, nothing to do with it.\nBut people were rightfully pissed.\nI mean, this guy was committing the most grotesque ask acts you can against children.\nAnd the media spins up about it.\nMany in the media protected him.\nWhy?\nBecause of his relationships, who he knew, who his bankers were, who his colleagues were, who was on the island and stuff like that.\nSome pretty powerful human beings.\nAnd so when you peel back the the layer and then you and then what happened?\nThe Trump administration the last go round decided, \"No, no, we're not going to let that go.\nWe're going to investigate him.\"\nRight?\nThey charge him, they indict him, and he's awaiting trial.\nAnd I've said it, Dan Bonino said it.\nWe've\n\n\nReviewed all the information, and the American public is going to get as much as we can release.\nHe killed himself.\nDo you think, let's play out the logical conclusion of this, do you think that myself, Bonino, and others would participate in hiding information about Epstein's grotest activities?\nOr do you think we would also participate in not prosecuting people?\nWe had evidence to prosecute people on.\nBut the problem is there's been like 15 years of people coming in and creating fictions about this that doesn't exist.\nWhere's the videotape of an Ipsy island of X, Y, and Z committing these frauds?\nWhy haven't you given it to us?\nDo you really think I wouldn't give that to you if it existed?\nI'm working my ass off along with the leadership at the bureau and DOJ to get you what we're allowed to give you.\nAnd you're going to get the video of the cell and you're going to see for yourself.\nAnd we will never be able to convince everyone.\nOkay, let's let's get into that.\nSo, what did you think before you got in office?\nDid you think that Epstein was murdered?\nNo, no suspicion at all of it.\nBut I have a different background.\nRight.\nRight.\nSo, I was a federal public defender back in the day.\nI used to spend a lot of time in jails and a lot of time in segregated housing units, shoes as we call them.\nRight.\nAnd so, um, and I've known people that have committed suicide in these cells and I know how you get in, how you get out, who works the system.\nAnd so, the way based on public information at the time that he ended up put the pictures and him hanging himself, I was like, man, that guy killed himself.\nIt's there's just no way that you could have run an op and had people go into that cell and not have any video of it and not have any people come out and say, \"Hey, yeah, I saw that guy.\nHe shouldn't have been there.\nThe guard or this guy.\"\nThere's just no access points into places like this in the detention center he was in.\nWhich I've been in.\nSo, correct me if I'm wrong, but what I was told, what I'd read was that the guards were not paying attention or were sleeping.\nWell, yeah.\nAnd in short order, you'll see it.\nIs that is that correct?\nWell, it's hard to surmise that from a video, right?\nLike where they like, you know, and look, do guards doze off on the night shift?\nYeah, but no one can get in to the cell.\nAnd if they had gotten into the cell, you would see it, but we were told that the cameras were down.\nWell, I don't know who said that, but that was that was in the news.\nUm, we're giving you all the footage we have.\nSo, why wasn't that released like immediately?\nWhy?\nWhy did this speculation escalate?\nI think you'd have to ask uh whoever the attorney general back then was, Bill Barr.\nDid you ever see Do you remember that HBO autopsy show, Dr. Michael Baden?\nHe's a famous forensic I don't think I scientist.\nSo, uh he's a pathologist and he reviewed the case and it was his determination that it was a homicide because of the way his neck was broken.\nMhm.\nAnd what he said was it was indicative of a liature strangulation and it was because of the positioning on the neck where the marks were that it wasn't indicative of someone hanging by their weight which had been higher on the chin and there's a specific break of the bones and the vertebrae that's consistent with someone who is just strangled to death.\nI I haven't seen it.\nI'll definitely take a look at it because that's part of my job.\nYou haven't seen that the report on that?\nNo, I haven't looked at that.\nDid you see any kind did was there any other autopsy done other than the official one?\nNot to my knowledge, but if there was, you'll get it.\nAnd that's what we're doing.\nSee if you can find that doc Dr. Michael Baden thing.\nDid you remember that show, the HBO show?\nNo.\nPretty cool show.\nSo this guy Dr. Michael Baden, he had a long career of catching murderers, you know, exuming bodies, finding trace amounts of poisons, different kinds of things, and it was a crazy show.\nLike all these wild ways of people.\nWell, I love watching shows and I spent a lot of time on planes.\nYeah, it was an old show.\nIt was a show like from the early 2000s, I believe.\nUm, but this guy was like, you know, this very wellrespected forensic scientist who would analyze these bodies and it was his determination that he was murdered.\nYeah.\nAnd my job going back to the core of what I've been doing since I studied Russia was to get and is to get everybody the information.\nWhen did you get here?\nEpstein's autopsy points to homicide pathologist hired by brother claims.\nNew York City medical examiner strongly disputed the claim that the evidence from the autopsy suggested strangulation.\nSo, let's go to the By the way, this is the New York Times and they never lie.\nPrivate pathologist Dr. Michael Baden said the morning TV show Fox and Friends, Mr. Epstein experienced a number of injuries, among them a broken bone in his neck that are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.\nI think the evidence points to homicide rather than suicide, said Dr. Baden, who observed the autopsy done by city officials.\nDr. Baden, a former New York City medical examination and a Fox News contributor, said, \"I have not seen in 50 years where that occurred in suicidal hanging case.\"\nUh, findings by Dr. Baden were strongly disputed by the city's chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Samson, who previously ruled that Mr. Epstein's death on August 10th in the Metropolitan Correctional Center was a suicide.\nI stand firmly behind our determination of the cause and manner of death in this case.\nDr. Samson said in the interview on Wednesday, she added, \"In general, fractures of the hyoid bone and cartilage can be seen in suicides and homicides.\nThe hyoid bone is near the Adam's apple.\"\nDr. Samson also dismissed Dr. Bad's contention that the circumstances around Mr. Epstein's death suggested other people may have been involved.\nShe said her office had done a complete investigation taken into consideration information gathered by law enforcement in the making in making the determination.\nSo this is a perfect example of going back to my federal public defender and prosecutor days.\nThis is what we call a war of experts.\nYou can always find someone right to come in and say the opposite, right?\nAnd I used to do it all the time.\nI mean, I represented some of the worst humans that you can possibly imagine on earth.\nLiterally, the guys that uh were trafficking children from Mexico into America, and you could put up a professional expert to say, and this is what's going to go on forever, and my job is not the forever.\nMy job is to get you absolutely everything that we can give you, and that's what we're going to do.\nWhen did you become aware of this video that showed that no one had gone in and out of the cell?\nUm, recently.\nSo why was it recent though?\nI mean if this death was how long ago was this death?\nTwo years.\nCouple 2019.\n2019.\nOh really?\nWhy?\nTime flies\n\n\nSo, six years.\nWell, again, that's part of what I'm going to try to answer for you. Jeffrey Epstein, JLCC TV, erased by technical errors. Whoopsies.\nYeah.\nBut you see how anybody on the out, I mean, this is like a perfect storm. Yeah. for something. Can you pull that article up so we can read what it says? Jamie, US prosecutor said the jail mistakenly saved footage from the wrong cell.\nSorry. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, first tried to kill himself in July last year and hanged himself in jail. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. Yep. Reread that line that he first tried to kill himself in July of last year. Yeah. How much of the American public do you think knows that? I didn't know that until right now. There you go. Maybe I heard it and forgot. Did you ever hear it, Jamie? Well, he was on That's why he was on suicide watch, I think. Oh, okay. So, a guy hanged himself in jail in August while serving trial on federal sex trafficking charge. He pleaded not guilty to abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14. Soon after Epstein's death in August, two of the CCC CCTV cameras outside his cell malfunction and were being examined by the FBI. Found semic-conscious in his prison cell with injuries on his neck on 25th of July after this incident. He's placed on suicide watch. I'm not saying every single camera in the place was working. I'm saying we've got footage and you're getting it and then you can make up your own mind and right the theories can continue, but my job so you you became aware of this footage recently, the ones that we're looking at.\nYeah. Right. And so, but this is like an article from quite a while ago that was saying that the footage was mistakenly erased. Look, I mean, it goes back to the same. Ask the people that were in power then. I mean, I get it that you want to hold me to account for their actions and Not you. Not you. I'm not saying that. Not you. That just the the public in general. And that's okay. What's confusing to everybody today? First of all, it's very confusing because AI can kind of make anything. You know, it's which has got to be a bizarre position for you to be in when you're looking at videos. I mean, I've watched Viking videos. It look real as [ __ ]. You know, they just make Viking towns. I mean, it's really quite incredible what they're doing now. And it it accelerates every month. I mean, I talked to Elon about it. He said, \"We're blown away literally every week. Every week there's some new breakthrough. We're like, \"Wow, we didn't expect that.\" Well, I can tell you after having looked at it, this ain't going to be AI. You don't think so? You're gonna It's It's just not great. You know, it's like if it were AI, like someone wanted to come in and make it, they'd make it better. But why would you make it better when people could, you know, you could have ambiguous footage that is, you know, totally generated by AI? I mean, AI can generate blurry images. AI can generate night vision. AI can generate essentially anything that's already existed like really shitty 1984 VHS tapes. They can do that. They can. But I'm telling you, I'm giving you the tape from the tape. Mhm. You know, there's just like I'm giving you the documents from the vault, just like I'm giving you information to Congress on CO origins or what have you. What we find is what you're getting. Okay. Okay. So now it's saying in 2019 missing jail video from the first Jeffrey Epstein for the first attempt has been found.\nSo maybe let's put it into perspective. Jails are not the most efficient best-run places. It's not like Fort Knox. Yeah. No, it's not. It's Yeah. You know, we're working with what we got, right? So, and listen, this guy's not the only guy to kill himself in prison. It happens I don't know how often, right? All the time. Even if he killed himself in prison. So if he if he was murdered in prison, crazy, right? You could see why very powerful people wouldn't want if he was murdered in segregated housing in isolation after being on suicide watch in a place in a detention center that I physically been in myself. It would be fiction. It's just in in my experience that is not doable. It's not doable. Even for the most powerful and wealthiest people in the world. Yeah. Wouldn't you think though that like if if someone was in a position where a guy could release information that could potentially damage the most wealthy people on earth, you would have a concerted effort that's unprecedented.\nSure. You'd have the resources that we could even possibly comprehend all pointing towards eliminating this one person that it could be done. But I mean, so many people have been implicated right already and some of that information what do they did to Prince Andrew and everybody else is already out there and so that's the conspiracy stuff that me and Bonino and the folks have to say look we will give you everything we can and then we will have done our job. Also, if I had a shred, me Kash Patel had a shred of evidence, the Russia gate guy, the Jan 6 guy, the co origins guy had a shred of evidence that this guy was murdered, I would be the first guy to bring this case hard and fast. And I would do even doing press conferences every week on it. The first guy. That's what I'm asking people to play out to their logical conclusion. I'm not Comey. I'm not Mabe. I'm not the guy that was in the seat before. I have a wildly different background. I've been putting out the truth my entire career. Why would I risk all of it on this guy? I believe he cast the letter. Oh, I I believe you. I just think that, you know, the problem is we've been fuming on this conspiracy for so long and it we love conspiracies, don't we? As as a country, there's so much I mean, you know, they make JFK tapes. Come on. Like release the documents. We all love them. We love them. We love UFO ones. We love everything. We love the craziest conspiracies. They're exciting. We don't want to hear that he tried to kill himself in July and then succeeded in August. And uh look, I could imagine why the guy wanted to kill himself. He was going to jail for the rest of his [ __ ] life. And in jail, sex offenders for children are not treated well. And also, by the way, most Americans haven't, nor should they. Have you ever spent one minute in segregated housing? No. It's the worst. The absolute worst. Like you and your background, you could probably handle it, right? Like, you know, just in all reality, most Americans, you put them in there for 5 seconds, they're going to slam their head against the wall. Literally, they're going to lose their mind. Yeah. Immediately. Yeah. It's that bad. I'm sure. I could only imagine. And I could only imagine this guy knowing that it's over. And what do you want to do? Do you want to Yeah. And who knows who the [ __ ] he's working for? Let's just put that aside. Now,\n\n\nIf you're working for...\nLet's just... We don't have to name names. We don't have to speculate. If he's working for some agency, some group, some foreign group, and they decide to target his family because he... look, he's going to jail for the rest of his life anyway. They decide to target his family if he testifies against them. I could see where... if I thought that it was like, \"I'm gonna be in jail for the rest of my life,\" or \"I tell, and my family winds up being killed or destroyed,\" or who knows, maybe you'd say, \"Look, the honorable thing is to end it in prison.\" Honorable, cowardly thing, cowardly, whatever it is, like you just decide at some point that guy was going back into gen pop. And the one thing I'll tell you about prison systems is the... the people they eat are child predators. Yes. And he was going to get eaten. Well known. Yeah. And they probably wouldn't have protected him. Yeah. Um, so the narrative has always been that there's video.\n\nNow, what is the chain of custody? Do... is there evidence that there is video? Is there evidence that it was moved around, stored, protected from people looking at it? Like you're going to get all that information. Like that's literally what we're putting together, and we're going to give you every single thing we have and can, and that's the whole point. We can't fill gaps by making stuff up, and we're not going to do that. And you have to be methodical, and we have to be... that's the other thing, right? We're reviewing not just the video. We're reviewing ev... you know, everything as meticulously as we can because that's what we owe the American people. That's our job. And I don't want to rush to the sticks or the podium and just say, \"Hey, look what we found.\" Right? And then be like, \"Oh, sorry. I... I forgot the 4 seconds.\" You know, if we miss 4 seconds, you're be like, \"Oh, well, it's in the 4 seconds you missed.\" Right. So, I... I'm... I'm... How much can you talk about what you've seen? Not yet. Um, just... just what I've told you. Can you say you've seen anything?\n\nNo. That's the point that there's nothing in there like in the video. You guys will be bored. You're talking about the video of the murder or the... the suicide... suicide. But what about the video of from the island? Oh, that's the... Sorry. So, you're talking about two different... So, sorry. So, yeah. So, again, we're going to give you everything we can, and people have to remember, we're not going to revictimize women. We're not going to put that [ __ ] back out there. It's not happening because then he wins. Not doing it. You want to hate me for it? Fine. Again, logical playout. If there was a video of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island, and I'm in charge, don't you think you'd see it? If you have access to it, if I have it. Period. If I have it. If I have it. So, where else would it be? Right. If you have it, right? But you can't say that you have it. No, we're giving you everything we have so far.\n\nEverything we have so far is... Have you guys gone over all the video that's available? Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. That's what takes so much damn time, right? And... and is there video from the island?\n\nNot of what you want. The... the people out there have filled the void with \"can't wait to see X, Y, or Z,\" right? Speculation. And I'm like, here's the other thing I've been asking for, right, openly. If you have information on this, call us. Tell us the best resource we have is the American people in the world, right? Get me the tail numbers, get me the flight, you know, get me new information, and I will run that down.\n\nSo, this narrative might not be accurate that there's video of these guys doing this. Exactly. Is it possible that the video was taken and destroyed?\n\nWell, you're talking about what, decades worth of stuff, right? Remember, we have what we have pursuant to lawful uh search warrants and authorities from the case that was done uh however many years ago it was done. That's what we have. If other people have other stuff and they want to give it to us, bring it. Have you guys reviewed everything that you have? Almost. Like we're... That's... I mean, yes, we have. And now we're figuring out how to... right, put it out. Now, I understand that you would never revictimize these women and show this footage, but is there footage?\n\nOutside...\nOf the only thing I can say right now is if there was ever... if there was footage of anyone doing anything else, we would have opened a case. Is it possible that there was footage that you just will never have access to because they've already gotten rid of? I mean, anything's possible, right? Well, there was a long time, right, between the time when it was clear that Kamla lost the election and that Trump won. Yeah. I mean, I got here before he got into office. I got here 100 days ago, literally. Right. Exactly. It's just kind of crazy, you know. So, I'm... I'm doing what I can, and... and that's this type of stuff like, you know, and I'm happy to to talk about it and bring it up, but what I... what I'm trying to achieve at the bureau is not only are we doing what's of public interest, what's of great public interest, our biggest job, our biggest job is to defend the homeland and stop kids from dying. That's my... Well, that's my biggest job, and that's what I'm focused on. And I think we can do all of those things, and we're doing them really well. And I think if you give us just like another hundred days, it's not a lot of time. I've been literally... I just hit my 100 day mark like two days ago, right? Um, you're going to see a ton of stuff. You're already seeing it. We... we just hit the... we just rolled out the Catholic memo. The truth about that. What is that? Um, the last administration, the FBI wrote a memo targeting Catholics. Remember the Richmond Catholic memo? I don't remember that. Okay. So, basically they uh there was a write up from the FBI relying on the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is like the modern-day Fusion GPS, um, and basically said Catholics should be targeted as domestic terrorists. Yeah. So, then Chris Ray, the former Director of the FBI, went to Capitol Hill and testified about it. And the Congress was like, \"Wait a second. Is this real? Is it predicated on actual fact?\" And how... how wide is it? Is it one office? Is it all these people across the country? Are Catholics being targeted as domestic terrorists? And what ended up happening was Ray said, \"Oh, it's just one office, one memo, nothing to see here.\" Well, what we just rolled out again to Congress this week to Chuck Grassley, who put it out, was that in fact it was multiple offices, multiple memos that were weaponizing law enforcement to target a religious group during an election cycle, and we proved it, and now everybody has read it. Why? Why were they targeting the Catholics? I don\n\n\nI don't know.\nYou'd have to ask the people that got here before I did.\nDid you have any suspicion of what kind of motivation they would have to do that?\nI think when you use it goes back to Russiagate.\nIf you're willing to use Mickey Mouse journalism, if you're willing to use the fusion GPS's and Christopher Steels of the world like the leadership at the FBI then did, then it has a chance to replicate itself.\nAnd that's what happened.\nI don't know if you know anything about the Southern Poverty Law Center, but it's they literally are the ones that sent information to the FBI.\nAnd the FBI said, \"Oh, we'll write a memo.\"\nAnd so that's the type of work that I think gives credibility back to the bureau, us exposing it, us giving Congress the truth, Congress coming back in and saying, \"Hey, you actually didn't give us the Heisman, you gave us the documents, we gave them to the American people.\nAnd if there were criminal referrals to come out of that, then let's do that.\"\nI mean, we just had a great breakthrough this week on Fouchy.\nUm, so Senator Ran Paul, Senator Kennedy, and I hate naming names because I always forget people are doing a great job with us on CO origins and and we've got multiple investigations open on that.\nBut they had always been looking for um Fouch's original phone and or not original but phones and devices he used while he was Fouchy back in Trump one during CO and nobody had found it till two days ago.\nReally?\nYeah.\nNow look, your audience and everybody listening to it is not shouldn't jump to the conclusion everything's in there.\nWe'll look at it.\nWe'll pull it.\nWe'll rip it as we say.\nAnd maybe it's deleted.\nMaybe it's not.\nBut at least we found it.\nAnd at least now we can tell the American people we've been looking because it is of public importance to figure out did that guy lie.\nDid he intentionally mislead the world and cause countless debts?\nWe owe those answers to the American people.\nAnd the best evidence ever is always the people's evidence who created it.\nAnd so now we're going to go and exploit those hard drives.\nBut I think a victory for the American people that we broke with Congress is that we did find it.\nWe're not done.\nWe're still looking and we're on the case.\nSo whether it's Richmond Catholic memo, whether it's Fouchy CO origins, whatever becomes of great Russiagate, crossfire hurricane, whatever becomes of great public importance, that's a big part of what we do at the FBI, too.\nThe crossfire hurricane one is bananas.\nWell, that's all Russiagate.\nYeah, it's completely nuts.\nI mean, you can we can do three days on that.\nI mean, I'm that's like I spent It's bananas.\nI mean, it's I mean, there's so many things in the past that you you get like like the uh Operation Fast and Furious.\nYeah.\nThe guns.\nInsane.\nWhich led to the death of American lives of a federal agent.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYou You know, and there's just things that like I see that you would think I would have more uproar even as as much time I've been doing this that don't and things that wouldn't have that my mind would be like no one's going to pay attention and people like, \"Oh my god.\"\nAnd so that's part of the learning curve for me too, you know, like trying to figure out what the balance is, you know, should I be given this so much attention, so much resources, but then when I have to call a parent because their kids dead from fentinol or when I have to call a cop's family and I call every single line of duty death that we have in this country, I call everyone's chief and I call their families.\nAnd I'm glad that the numbers are going down in terms of how many have been killed this year versus last year.\nHow much have the numbers gone down?\nUm, by over 15% so far, but I want to be at zero.\nYou know, that's where my focus needs to be.\n15% in 100 days.\nStill, you know, pretty good, give or take a couple of points.\nUm, and that's where my focus that's where the FBI's focus needs to be.\nI these guys are on the line.\nWe're doing all these raids across the country in Homeland Security Task Force.\nWe just hit a 10,000 mark.\nWe just we just arrested over 10,000 people in the hund and change days that we've been doing this with DHS.\nHuge, right, on illegals and and whatnot.\nWe also just like this is great.\nThis this piece of information has actually made me happy.\nWe are on track to have the lowest homicide rate ever.\nMurder rate, excuse me, murder rate ever in the country.\nYeah.\nReally?\nWe're already and look, we got six more months to go.\nSo, we're not done yet for the year, but we're already down 20% from last year.\nAnd we broke it this week that right now the murder rate, if we, the FBI, and our government partners achieve the mission will give the American people the lowest murder rate in decades.\nThat's incredible.\nAnd that's what I'm the focus on.\nWhat What steps have been made to do that?\nLike, what how did that become real?\nSo, I think and I and I've worked with cops and law enforcement a lot in the past and you have too.\nThey're they're awesome.\nThey all they wanted to do was do the work once President Trump got elected and before I even got the nomination, right?\nAnd excuse me, when I was traveling country with with them before that they were like, we take the handcuffs off off of us.\nLet us go do our jobs.\nAnd that's where I came up with let good cops be cops.\nI said, if I'm going to get this job, that's what I'm going to do.\nI'm going to let you, the agents, the police officers, the sheriffs, go out there and do the work you so badly want to do.\nAnd I'm going to give you the resources you need to do it.\nAnd I'm going to take away the politicization and weaponization saying, \"Oh, we can't target this group or this thing or this area.\"\nAnd that's it.\nThat's what we've done.\nEverywhere I go, I I speak to cops across this country constantly, and it's a humbling message that I receive back every time I talk to them.\nThey're like, and it's not me, it's the president's administration and our entire government that's doing it.\nThey're like, \"Thank you for letting us do the work.\nWe want to chase child predators.\nWe want to bust up MS-13.\"\nI mean, look at the victories we've had for the American people in the first two months.\nThe FBI arrested three, not one, not two, but three of the world's most top 10 wanted fugitives.\nThree.\nOne of them happened to be the guy that was the Abbey Gate bomber.\nWhat was the Abigate bomber?\nThe um terrorist that blew up 13 US soldiers in the Afghan withdrawal.\nOh, I did it with my inter agency partners in a week.\nIn a week, we found that guy, went to Pakistan, brought him back here.\nNow, there's others responsible for it and we're we're chasing them down, too.\nBut the question the American people should be asking is why didn't the prior administration putting aside the\n\n\nDisastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, a plan that they completely politicized. We handed off them a proper way to do it and methodical way to do it. And they just said, \"F you. We're doing it this way.\" And you saw the videos and you saw people plunging from our aircrafts and you saw Abby Gate and 13 Americans dead. Why didn't anyone go get justice for those families? Well, that's the priority that the president said. We're going to go find him. And we let good cops be cops. We let federal agents be agents. We let our intel community focus intelligence collection on terrorists. And we went and got that guy. It's so hard to believe that it's really that simple that it's just they weren't given the resources and they weren't given the support to let cops be cops and that they could have done this all along. I don't know if that's the only answer. I'm just telling you what I'm doing and I think we're seeing some results. I appreciate that. But as a person again who loves conspiracies, you know, you look at that and you're like, what would be the benefit of not letting cops be cops? Why would you want more crime? Why would you want more murders? Why would you not want to arrest bad guys? Well, you have to look at the landscape of the last, I don't know, 4, 8, 12 years, call it, right? It was an intentional decision, and this isn't politics. It was just an intentional decision to say, we're going to let all these people into our country and let them stay. The result of that is, you know, this is another part of the lift that we're doing at the bureau. We call them KSTs, known or suspected terrorists. They get pinged at the border, the northern border and the southern border. And then the last administration said, \"You guys can come in.\"\n\nAnd then one of the most terrifying things I heard was my predecessor Christopher Ray went to Congress a year or two ago and said, \"Well, the last year's annual statistics for known KSTs was u a few dozen and we don't know where they are in America.\" What do you mean you don't know where they are? How is that not a national security crisis?\n\nAnd so what we're doing while we're doing these raids and chasing down illegals is trying to target those with terrorist affiliations, those who are terrorists, those are in our homeland because the last administration let them be here. And that's you can say I'm being political. I don't really care. But that's me being the Director of the FBI and saying Americans come first and we're protecting our own and we're chasing them down. And DHS is doing a great job and so is our Intelligence Community and so are the local police departments who are now working with us and not living in sanctuary cities and allowing police stations to be burnt to the ground, working with us and not having law enforcement attacked constantly for just doing the job of protecting the American people. I think that's a tectonic shift in the mentality of what this administration has brought in. Now, people are still vilifying us for doing that. How dare you separate families, they'll say. And I'm like, how dare you separate a mom from a kid on a fentanyl overdose? How dare you separate an American soldier's mom or dad from the guy that got blown up at Abby Gate? I have different priorities. I have a different view of it. And so, that's the ethos I'm bringing to the bureau. I appreciate everything you guys are doing. I just I I'm baffled to try to come up with any kind of an explanation why anybody would let known or suspected terrorists into the country and just let them loose. I mean when when you I mean I know you can't speculate but when you take office and you realize all this is going on like what what is going through your mind? Like how are you processing this? Like is this pure incompetence? Is this malice? Is this is this a foolhardy adherence to ideology and just completely ignore the danger that they're putting the American people in by doing this?\n\nIt's I think it No, it's intentional. The intentional decision was when you're going to let in what is it 9 million people, a lot of them are going to be criminals. A lot of them are going to be TDA. You saw what they did in Colorado. A lot of them are going to be MS-13. A lot of them are going to be narcot traffickers, which when you enter when you allow narcot traffickers in the country, you're automatically bringing sex trades trafficking, human trafficking, and drug trafficking automatically. And the drug traffickers have partnered with the terrorist organizations and our adversaries. We haven't even talked about Russia and the CCP and how they've combined forces over the last however many years to infiltrate America, not just with people, but our cyber capabilities and our infrastructure. And so when I come into a job like this, patience is one of the hardest things. You have to manage because you can't fix everything overnight. You have to build up the workforce. You have to get them the resources. You have to fix the infrastructure that's broken. I mean, I'll just give you a quick example. The building that the FBI calls headquarters, the Hoover building, is like 70 years old. I literally have netting, mesh netting, holding up the side of the building because pieces of concrete fall off of it so it doesn't hit people in the head. I'm not kidding. I'm dead serious. So I said, \"How about we give the workforce a safe place to work so we're moving out of there?\" And people think it's a political decision. Oh, Kash Patel's taking the FBI out of the historic Hoover building. Yeah, because I don't want people to die and I think they deserve a better workplace than something that's 70 years old that has pipes exploding literally every single week, every week. And also, we're going to save the taxpayer money. We're going to get out of a building that would cost billions to fix. And we're going to move into a location that's already built instead of a 15-year government boondoggle an hour outside of DC. And we're going to stay in DC. We're going to stay near our partners in government. And we're going to put out the workforce and spread them out across the country like I talked to you about earlier and put more agents on the streets and put more agents in Indian country and put more agents in your communities and intel analysts to figure out where the crime is. But that all of that takes time. I can't do it overnight. But why do you say Indian country? Like what what tribal lands? Well, what about tribal lands is problematic. Oh man. So this you're uh thank you so much for bringing this up. It's one of my biggest priorities. So the the tribal and I just met with um almost all of the the the the chiefs and the leaders of the tribal communities in America. The crimes they have committed on on on what we call Indian country is just as horrific if not worse than the rest of America. Look up the story about Emily Pike whose family is still waiting for her arms. This child was murdered on a reservation and they found a piece of her body and not the murderer and not the rest of her body. They are plagued by drugs and they have never been a priority um in terms of law enforcement working together. And\n\n\nAnd now, remember, you're talking about two different sets of legal structures, right?\nThey have their own, and we have our own.\nBut what I've asked of them and what they've asked of me is pay more attention, give us more resources.\nWhat I've asked of them is said, \"Hey, all the leaders said, let my guys on, let my guys come to you, and let's work together on solving some of these horrific, horrific crimes.\nThe trafficking, the murders, and the violent crime on Indian reservations is skyrocketing.\nAnd I'm not going to treat people who live in the United States of America differently because they have a different way of life.\nWe're going to help them.\nAnd we put out operation not forgotten where we deployed this this month and this summer, um, I can't remember how many agents and intel analysts specifically to remote tribal locations to solve crimes that have not been solved for years, specifically the most violent, and we're going to double down on that.\nAnd as Bonino likes to say, this summer we are unleashing a massive operation across the country, um, as Dan calls it, it's a uh, it's a bad day to be a bad guy this summer because the FBI is putting out all these extra agents and personnel into the field, and we're going to come find you.\nIf you think you can nest in our communities and and find safe haven, you're going to prison.\nThat's great to hear.\nSo, when what is the when you guys sit around, you think about the motivation to let all these people into the country?\nMhm.\nI mean, again, you you kind you're kind of speculating, but why do you think they allowed it?\nWhy do you think they allowed the border to be wide open like that?\nYou know, in my job now, that's like one of those political decisions, and so I try to stay out of that.\nUm, but how is that political to leave the border?\nLike that, how is a national security issue political?\nSo that's just it from my perspective.\nIt's a national security decision, and they failed on the national security mission.\nBut I think where the decision from that administration to do that was a political one.\nThat's what I'm trying to sort of separate.\nI've always viewed it singularly.\nProtecting the border, preventing drugs from coming in, preventing terrorists from coming in, preventing people from What What political decision could be made that makes any sense at all to not do that?\nI don't think there is one, but unfortunately they did it anyway.\nDo you think it was just that Biden was just not there and everyone else that was really running things, was completely incompetent, was focused on other things, was focused on maybe the optics of border protection that it, you know, that somehow or another there was some negative connotation to it politically?\nI don't I think it's I always say this.\nI think it's dismissive to say those people were incompetent.\nThey're super smart.\nThey're not dumb, and whether or not Biden was running things or whatever conversation for other people to to have.\nBut there's lots of people around them who are very smart who were in government for a long time, and they this is what I mean, they politicized the national security and law enforcement apparatus of this country by making those decisions.\nThe why.\nYou'd have to ask them as to why they did that and why they thought that was okay and why people think it's okay for uh James Comey to go down a beach and put up 8647.\nYou know, that's another political act that hurts our national security from smart people who are doing it intentionally and maybe because it's they want press, maybe because it's they're selling a book, maybe because it's they want notoriety.\nI don't know the answer to that.\nBut for me, it's all national security related, and these people keep doing it over and over again.\nThe good thing is now there's a bull work against it because we're in and the president just is not having any of it.\nWhat was the case very recently where you guys caught a scientist bringing in pathogens?\nYeah.\nSo I'm a New Yorker, and I brought this for a reason.\nThis means spore.\n[ __ ] New York Post is the best.\nThey're the best.\nThey have the best headlines ever.\nYeah.\nSo it's so funny.\nIt's based.\nSo the case is still go.\nIt's obviously ongoing since we just made the arrest.\nSo I'm a little limited in what I can say, but backing up the truck a little bit.\nAgro terrorism is a thing, right?\nThe CCP isn't just coming at us with fentinel and coming at us in our cyber infrastructure and our capabilities in space and underwater.\nThey are literally exporting people to the United States of America, having them end up being senior researchers like this individual at the University of Michigan.\nAnd the bureau picked up on this and said, \"Wait a second, why are you bringing you and her husband was also um indicted, but he's in mainland China, so he's not here.\"\nBut we retraced what he did.\nAnd what's public now is that he also tried to come to this country to do the same thing.\nSo they were making the connections on that.\nBut what they did was literally bring in a a mushroom that technically alone exists, you know, in the US, but in an altered state causes billions of dollars of damage to wheat, to corn, to maze, and to agricultural industry, and also could wipe out your livestock and causes reproductive damage to human beings.\nAnd so this is the lethality in terms of the mindset of people that want to do harm to our country.\nAnd this case, I didn't know, this is one of those things where I knew it would garner a lot of attention, but like this thing went massive.\nLike it's everywhere.\nAnd I'm glad it's everywhere because for me it highlights the multiple levels of operation that our adversaries are looking to do harm on us.\nThank god we caught this one, but what about the ones we've got to still catch that are still out there?\nThey're not going to stop because this lady's in jail now, right?\nAnd being prosecuted by us.\nThis is just the one you caught.\nThis is the one we caught.\nSo, this is proof that this is actually an ongoing thing.\nIt's an It's been an ongoing thing.\nJust like, you know, why are we allowing our adversaries to buy land around our military?\nJust going to ask you that.\nYou know, it's insane to me.\nIt it it's lunacy.\nHaving been the former chief of staff at DoD and having gone to a lot of our bases, I I was just like, why is that Chinese CCP establishment right there?\nWhy are the Russians right right across the street?\nWhy do they provide towers for cell phones?\nSo, what and and that's a trickier issue because that's not like a federal saw.\nThat's a state-by-state issue, you know, and a lot of states have taken action.\nI think the Dakotas are leading the charge up there by outlawing it and banning it and saying, \"Nope, you can't do this.\nYou can't buy this because a lot of these things have third party input.\nRight.\nRight.\nAnd a lot of these things tr unfortunately are just about money.\nRight.\nThey'll sell it to you cheaper, but then they're spying on everybody.\nThen they're spying on everybody.\nHere's the thing, like what I ask people in in because what I get hit with is why shouldn't foreigners be able to buy land in America?\nI'm like are you able to buy\n\n\nLand in downtown Moscow?\nCan you guys buy a farm in China?\nNo.\nNo.\nSo what's with the desperate treatment?\nI get that we're the United States of America and we want to give everybody a chance, and you gave this kid a chance, but that's different than literally inviting our adversaries into our country and saying, \"Well, as long as you build X or dump enough money into your state, we can uh we can look the other way.\"\nSo, what can be done about the land that our adversaries own outside of military bases?\nAgain, it's a it's a state.\nIt's like every state has to take steps legislatively in my opinion to either kick them off, stop the contracts, prevent them from coming in, things like that.\nWhat we can do at the federal level are things that you've seen, um, you know, the State Department under Marco Rubio do, revoking visas in certain places, um, in certain sectors of the economy, and I think rightfully so, because if you stop the personnel from coming in, kick them out, then who cares who owns it?\nIt's basically a dead sight.\nThat's the vulnerability that we have for being such a free society is that we allow foreign nationals to come in and go to universities and start and do research and become the head of these different departments, and they're constantly reporting back to the CCP or coordinating with them.\nYeah.\nOr Russia.\nYeah.\nAnd they're not going to stop.\nThat's the thing with these guys.\nIt's just because you take one out unless you take a whole of government approach, unless you get buying from the American public.\nAnd again, this is one of those things that you would think is a national security issue, right?\nYeah.\nBut they'll politicize it.\nThey'll weaponize it.\nThe Post will write about it one way, and it probably won't even make the headlines in a number of other outlets because they don't want to talk about that.\nHas the New York Times written about this, Jay?\nI have no idea.\nI mean, it seems like something that everybody should want to know about.\nIf a foreign government, an adversary government is trying to poison our food supply and and human beings and affect the reproductive system, that that seems like that's that's a bipartisan issue.\nYeah.\nAnd that's the thing about your show that that's I agreed that I wanted to do it is because getting out to a population that has stopped listening to mainstream news and reaching out to them and challenging them with information and how we're doing things and saying, look, this is our priorities, this is what I'm doing right, is so hugely important because the audience, the influence of that manpower on the electorate is huge is huge.\nAnd if we can reach through on certain some of these issues, then we're going to win collectively.\nLike I can only arrest so many bad guys, and we will.\nBut if we arrest them and people don't know who we're arresting and why we're arresting them and what the threat is, then it almost becomes irrelevant.\nWe're still going to do it.\nWe're not going to stop.\nBut if we can get more and more people talking about these things and saying, look, the national security of our country is of what's utmost importance to me, not who wins the next election, but also we need to work with our communities to say who's in our communities.\nHow many registered sex offenders are there near our schools?\nAre they violating federal laws?\nWhy aren't we on, um, these priorities?\nAnd we need help.\nWe need we need American buying to to really accomplish the mission.\nI wonder what heavy lifting has to be done to separate national security issues from political issues and for everybody just to just say, listen, all the other stuff that the Democrats disagree with or the Republicans disagree with, put that aside.\nWe should all be concerned with stopping fentanyl, stopping gang members and cartel members and terrorists from coming into the country.\nHow that becomes political to me is just [ __ ] bananas.\nIt really is crazy because it's just like if one side supports it, the other side has to be against it.\nAnd it's and and you give you raised the reason it's so politicized and the reason it's so sort of in many sectors of government is because of the answer to that question.\nThe leaks from inside of government and then the spin on that information by the media is what's causing the most harm in my opinion, um, to the American public.\nWhat kind of leaks?\nWhether it's classified information or or just leaks about fake news, like people saying, \"Oh, so and so hate each other at the White House.\nDid you hear about this meeting they had that never occurred?\"\nAnd I was like, \"I was in that meeting.\nWhat are you talking about?\"\nWhat have you heard like that?\nYou know, what kind of like fake rumors.\nOh, so I'll give you an example from, um, from actually FBI than the New York Times.\nSo, which never lies.\nNo, no, of course.\nNo, no, we're relying on them to solve everything.\nUm, so we have these uh we have a regular drum beat at the FBI where everybody has a we have a morning meeting with the heads of our divisions, counter intel, counter espionage, CT, everything, criminal, cyber, so we can move the machine.\nAnd I and I was like and I did them for a week and I was like, why do we do these every morning?\nAnd the whole place looked at me, and these are career agents and intel folks, like 10, 20, 30 years in the seat.\nThey go, \"Boss, we hate those.\nThey make us come offline of our work and focus on briefing you rather than staying on mission, and we can come brief you on our own.\"\nSo, I chopped it to two days a week, and I cut the time in like less than half.\nNew York Times puts out the story.\nKash Patel upends, and I'm paraphrasing, the uh ethos at the FBI.\nHow dare he cut down the morning briefing cycle?\nAnd this is a perfect example of these people are coming to me saying this is what they wanted to do for years.\nAnd I'm working with them to say that's a good idea.\nWhy don't we do that?\nBut the Times comes in and kicks us in the face with this leak.\nThat's not even true because they go out and say anonymous source this, retired person that.\nIt's just one example.\nIt might it might sound small to you, but now a reader is going to read that.\nA new kid who's like, \"Oh, I may want to join the FBI,\" and they're going to look at it and say, \"This place is a circus.\nI don't want to go work there.\"\nWhat do you mean they they disrupted the morning meeting?\nThat guy should be getting briefed six hours a day, right?\nUh, you know, and I'm like, \"No, I want my agents on mission.\nI don't need them briefing me.\nI can call them.\nI can talk to them later.\"\nAnd so, it's just stuff like that.\nSince we were talking about fake news, this is going to come up because it's been going on since we've been recording here.\nUh, oh, uh, Elon and Trump seem to be in a bit of a spat.\nJoe, you want to check the tweet that Elon just put out a little bit ago?\nTime to drop the really big bomb.\nDonald Trump is in the Epstein files.\nThat's the real reason they have not been made public.\nHave a nice day.\nJesus Christ.\nI'm not participating in any of that conversation between Elon.\n\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nDJD, someone should take his phone away. They're going back and forth about different things and yeah. Listen. Well, he said he was disappointed in Elon. They told him to leave. Jesus Christ. That's a crazy thing to say. How does he know? Does he know that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files or does he have access to the Epstein Files? I don't know how he would, but I'm just staying out of the Trump Elon thing. That's way outside my What the [ __ ] are they doing? Uh I know my lane and that ain't it. I just don't I mean I understand he owns Twitter. I think it's bad for your mental health. I think posting things public all day and arguing with people all day is bad for you. Well, you raise a great point. Sorry to cut you off. Go ahead.\n\nHalf of what we have to respond to are is the click army on social media. Right. Right. And 50% of that plus is bots. But let's take the other 50% of that is just constantly pushing out information to sell t-shirts or subscriptions or whatever. Listen to my show.\n\nAnd then people are like, \"Hey, FBI, why aren't you looking at this thing in Oklahoma?\" And I'm like, \"Because it's fake. I don't have time for that.\" And and and so to your point on like social media does have a great use in terms of me. And so the reason Dan and I don't do a lot of media is because we're the FBI. Like let our work speak for itself, right? But we have to find the right balance of going to do media and posting on social media the things we're doing and keep keeping people updated. And so that's the delicate balance we're trying. But what I'm learning is no matter what you do, it it doesn't matter. It's going to just completely not make everyone happy. And there's no solve for that in terms of how the FBI operates. But at the same time, the FBI won't be thwarted by it. We're going to keep going. Like I do, you know, I mean, I've already told you I've been called a genocidal dictator, which is ironic since I'm the son of a of a man who fled a genocidal dictatorship in East Africa and his parents lawfully immigrated to this country and had me and now their kids the FBI director, first generation Indian kid. Kind of a pretty freaking cool story. That is a cool story. But I'm like, that's what me and Dan say all the time. You can call us whatever you want. But genocidal dictator like that you now those words don't mean anything anymore if you're calling you that.\n\nWell, that's what I mean. You're not a dictator and you're not genocidal. So, what are you doing tagging both of those together? What is the proof? And what does the media do in printing it? It's that's insane. That's an insane thing. But I think they were given a mandate to be the attack dogs, you know. I think they were. And I think during the last administration, they reinforced that. I I think I mean just look what happened with the Hunter Biden laptop story where 51 former intelligence agents testified that this Thank you for bringing that up that tell me about how crazy that is.\n\nSo, you want to talk about the ultimate weaponization and total disinformation combining forces, right? A week before the election when Biden and Trump were running against each other, maybe a week or two weeks before that, right? A guy who used to be in the Intelligence Community says, \"Oh, we got to bring the Hunter Biden laptop thing into play.\" Knowing it was bogus. And they come out and they basically say the FBI even though knew that Hunter Biden's laptop was a righteous piece of investigatory material and were examining it and at the time knew that they were going to work up criminal leads on it. Sat silent. Put that over here. The Intelligence Community comes in and says, \"We got to get this information out.\" because the guy who would end up becoming Biden Secretary of State was advising him and saying, \"Hey, we got to squash this 100 Biden laptop thing. Let's do the Russia gate play. Let's do the Crossfire Hurricane play.\" So, they go to the CIA and they go to then Director Gina Haspel, who by the way, there's no coincidence in this government. Gina Haspel was chief of Station London when Russia Gate was launched in London. We can come back to that.\n\nSo now she's director of CIA and we're on the eve of an election and there's this thing called a pre-publication process. Uh so like when I had to put my book out as a government service server uh ser whatever you call it has to go in and everybody's got to read it and they got to chop it whatever takes forever even if it's a two-page document. The 51 intel letter was written by these same people, some of who participated in Russia gate. And the person that has to authorize that as a director of the CIA before it goes public. Do you know how long she took to authorize the release of the letter? Knowing the information in the letter was false, knowing the laptop with Hunter Biden's information on it was true and accurate and being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal purposes. Eight hours. Eight hours. They released that barrage of disinformation for eight hours. And what do we do? We've spent the last four years proving up, and we've got more information coming on that, too, proving up how those former secretaries of defense, CIA, NSA, deputy directors of the Intelligence Community, all came together to politicize intelligence once again because they got caught on Russia gate and don't care. And they wanted President Biden to win so badly, they were willing to lie to the American people. and they did it again. That is so insane. It's so hard to believe because it's so corrupt and coordinated. The fact that 51 people would be will be willing to do that and they've doubled down on it. They keep doubling down on it. How are they doubling down? In what way? They've been asked in the years since they've they've been like, \"Hey, actually, do you remember the time where Hunter Biden got charged in two separate felony federal indictments, right, in two different districts?\" And they're like, \"No, we stand by our miss.\" Like the people that signed the letter have said, \"We've stand by it.\" Guys like Clapper and Brennan and all these guys, Petta, no. So they stand by the idea that that laptop was Russian disinformation. And they know it's not. And these guys who rose to the highest ranks in government service won't come off that perch because the media will allow them to be propped up. Wow. And it's the same, look, totally switching gears, but a similar disinformation tale. January 6, right? I was chief of staff at uh DoD on January 6th. Days before January 6th, I was in the Oval Office with the president, the secretary of defense, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on a foreign matter. And on that day, he goes, \"Hey, you know, how's it looking for January 6? Do you guys have everything you need?\" And he goes, \"\n\n\n\"I'm going to authorize up to 10 to 20,000 National Guardsmen and women if you guys need them anywhere in the country.\" The reason that's important is because we can't uniformly deploy military in the United States. That's what the National Guard's for. But in order to do that, the president has to one, authorize it, and two, the mayor or governor, so it's DC, so it's the mayor and the capital police and the speaker of the house are in charge, have to request the deployment of troops. We went to them days before January 6. We went to Bowser. We went to Pelosi. They said no in writing. We were excoriated for it. Your guys are lying. You didn't offer this up. If you had been there, this would have never happened. Well, actually, President Trump preemptively authorized 10 to 20,000 National Guard. And what happened? I spent the next three years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, testifying before Congress, proving up just what I had said was the truth. Then the documents came. We finally got them out because I know what we had written. And it showed Bowser in writing declining National Guard. It showed Pelosi in writing saying no to the Capitol police. Don't get the National Guard. So, they wanted it to be chaos. Well, that I'll leave for to you on that. But what I'm telling you is they knew they knew what was true. They knew what was false. And I'm not asking you to give an opinion on the events of January 6. But had 10,000 of my guys been there, do you think it would have gone differently?\nYeah, 100%. They stopped it and they spent years lying. And now we're still lying about that authorization even though we've put it to bed. Like Russia gate, like Hunter Biden's laptop. 51 intel letter. They keep doing it over and over again. What about agent provocateurs that were involved in in January 6th? So what we just released to Congress was um I think we're still digging through it is there was a couple of dozen sources that were involved with January 6. And so we're getting Congress those files and the American people are going to learn the extent of that. We're doubling down on our investigation on the pipe bomber because we think it's of great public importance that someone almost blew up the headquarters for the RNC and DNC and oh by the way the vice president of the United States happened to be in the vicinity of that pipe bomb. How did that pipe bomb not detonate? Was it faulty? Um did they never activate it? Yeah, it's the latter. And um and so but we keep going back to events like January 6 and and I keep trying to say hey again don't trust me I was we put out the truth about Russia gate about 51 intel letter about Hunter Biden's laptop about the National Guard on January 6. These are the guys that are now in charge about these sensitive issues like the pipe bomber and all this information you want. So we're giving you we're the ones that are reopening these investigations and doubling down on them. co origins. We think that there was definite foul play. But my opinion is irrelevant. It only matters what I can show to the American people and prove. And that's what we're working on. That's why I don't run out there and say, \"Look, we're going to get this guy. We're 100% going to get him. We're working our butts off to get him.\" We're also working our butts off to identify who brought cocaine into the White House because when you bring a felony narcotic into the most secure compound in the world, I think the world has a right to know. Yeah. Is there footage of that?\nSo, we're on Who is like a known guy who likes Coke who happened to be at the White House at the same time? Well, again, like let also I don't want to jump to conclusions because, you know, I've done this for a long enough time where even the most obvious suspect, you're like, \"Well, [ __ ] it wasn't him. It was her, right?\" You know, and so let's do it methodically. We are. It's of great public. If someone brought a dime bag of cocaine or however you package it, I don't know, or or pills of fentinol into the White House. Now, yeah. In a Trump administration, what do you think the media would say? What a wild [ __ ] doing Coke in the White House. You know how wild you have to be? I mean, to be doing lines in the bathroom of the White House. I I was like dancing the line when I was using the bathroom that I wasn't supposed to use because I wanted to go to the East Wing and they had a nicer setup and I was like hiding my badge. That's as far as I took it. That is It's just such a crazy thing to do. Like you have to be completely off the rails where you can't be on Coke for just a few hours while you're hanging out at the White House. You're like, \"No, no, no. I need a little bump. I need a little bump in the White House.\" It's crazy, man. And I would think that like everybody would get urine tested immediately upon finding that bag. Well, you you could have done a lot of things then, but they didn't. Of course, they didn't want it. I mean, there wasn't even even a suspect, right? No. For them, they was like, \"Ah, whatever. We're done.\" And I was wild. Wild, right? Yeah. And you know, so it's just you I mean you have to my other mission is to control the things I can control. Was the bathroom the men's room or the women's room or was it like an all gender bathroom where anybody can go into? You know, I'm not sure. I got I got to go back. I got to go back and look. I actually got to go back and look. But I think when we do these things and we answer these questions for the American people, we're restoring the trust in the FBI. That's what I can control. That's sorely needed because when I go around the country, this is not me saying it or the leadership saying it. The FBI's credibility took a hit because of these actions by these few people in charge. And we're building it back. We've done a lot in a 100 days to get it back. And I think if you wait for the rest of this year, you're going to see some massive massive actions taken over the summer. And our priorities, and I changed it, our are sort of our our website or and our pillars, you know, uphold the Constitution, defend the homeland, crush violent crime, and rigorous constitutional congressional oversight so that we restore trust. That's what we want to do. Now, a lot of people got pardons, like more pardons, I think, than anyone ever, right? Yeah.\nDoes does the pardon cover like if you find that Fouchy lied to Congress like when Rand Paul was talking to him about gain of function research clearly he was being deceptive. Mhm. If someone is is that are they pardoned for that as well cuz it was like this crazy blanket pardon from 2014 forward which I didn't even know you could do. So I'm the investigator. So that would be a decision for the Department of Justice. They'll have to make that. I don't know the answer to that. We'll\n\n\nIn we'll, we'll work it up and we'll say, \"This is what we found,\" and then legal minds will have to come in and chop on, \"Does this pardon apply or not?\"\nIs that the same sort of thing apply to the 51 intelligence agents that lied about the laptop?\nI think the same scenario applies to anyone who got the pardon.\nI can't remember exactly who off the top of my head got it, if there was some of them or none of them or what happens, but that's never happened before in the history of the country.\nSo there's literally no legal precedent, as we say, to figure out how that goes.\nBut what I can do, irrespective of the pardon and how it applies, is produce the information in the documents.\nJeez, what a crazy place to come into.\nYou know, it's a gong show.\nIs it surprising how dysfunctional it is to you?\nWell, I think I, I would change that a little bit.\nI think I'm, I'm thrilled at how functional most of the FBI is.\nI'm shocked at the levels of depravity and even me that few in leadership would do to alter that and then go out into the public and lie about it.\nLike you got James Comey running around and he can yell at me all he wants and Andy McCabe can too.\nThis is another perfect example, right?\nThese two guys used to run the bureau.\nAnd we had a, we had a guy in Denver without a shirt off running around throwing 16 Molotov cocktails on human beings shouting \"Free Palestine.\"\nI got that information because I'm the Director of the FBI and I put out a statement because the American people need to know.\nWe are investigating this matter as an act of terrorism.\nCNN, New York Times come in and crush us.\nThese guys don't know what they're doing.\nHow dare they label it as such?\nThe investigation is still ongoing.\nAnd I said, \"Yes, I'm investigating the matter in which a man who was from overseas in Egypt threw Molotov cocktails at American citizens at a peaceful rally and screamed, 'Free Palestine.' \"\nThat's what you want your FBI doing.\nWhat you don't want your FBI doing is having New Orleans in Super Bowl and having another known terrorist come in there and run people over and kill them and then have the FBI go to the podium and say, \"This is not an act of terrorism.\"\nThat is the politicization of the FBI.\nThat's what we've changed and I think the American people are seeing it and I think our results are speaking to it.\nBut that doesn't even make sense that the New York Times would criticize that and and criticize the description of it as an act of terrorism when it by definition is an act of terrorism.\nBut the action itself, you're throwing Molotov cocktails on human beings that are at a political peaceful rally, that's terrorism, isn't it?\nI mean, what is terrorism if that's not terrorism?\nAnd what I can say, remember, the charging is for the Department of Justice partners.\nWhat I can say is what I'm investigating it as.\nAnd that's what I'm investigating it as because the facts to that point in time, quickly relayed to me by our people in the field, the pros said, \"Hey, this is what we got.\nThis is what happened.\nEveryone's talking about it.\nLet's report out to the American people what we can responsibly.\"\nAnd that was a responsible way of doing it.\nBut that's what I'm saying.\nThese people that that used to run the FBI are coming in there and they would have made the same decisions.\nIt's just the fact that we're making them and they got fired because they got caught conspiring against the United States of America and weaponizing the FBI and CNN's given them a platform.\nThey keep crippling this country by putting out these stupid statements, uh, or not stupid, these intentionally false statements to attack us.\nAnd again, you can hit me and Bon all you.\nWe don't care.\nWe're winning.\nI believe we're winning this fight.\nWe're winning it because the American people are like, \"Hey, that was an act of terrorism.\nI hope you get the bad guys.\"\nAnd I don't know if you just saw, but we also remember the fertility clinic that was bombed in Southern California.\nWe just busted the co-conspirator in Poland and brought him back last night and now he's getting charged because publicly what we can say is he procured like something like 45 pounds of ammonium nitrate.\nSo what we're doing is investigating acts of terrorism as acts of terrorism and we're utilizing our our authorities overseas under that to give the American people justice.\nThe guy didn't act alone.\nWhat about the shooter?\nThis the this savage shooter in Washington DC who comes in and murders two people for the Israeli embassy in cold blood.\nLike just literally what is it, 21?\nI don't know how many shots, right?\nYelling something \"Free Gaza,\" whatever.\nWe investigated that as an act of terrorism because that's what it is.\nThat's what the American people deserve to hear.\nI'm not saying they don't have a presumption of innocence.\nI'm not saying that they're going to be convicted at trial.\nBut I'm telling you as the Director of the FBI, what I'm doing as a number one cop in this country and who is in charge of investigations.\nThat's my call to make and I'll make it every time.\nI just don't understand how the media, particularly the the thing in Colorado, how they could print that this is not an act of terrorism and not diminish all of whatever credibility they have left.\nI just don't understand why they would even be willing to do that.\nI think it all goes back to the same derangement syndrome that people have.\nYeah.\nTheir hatred for certain individuals and people who dare to work in those administrations is so great that they don't care about the truth.\nThey care about the platform and they'll go on and they'll be given a platform on TV or in print media or on on on other shows and there's a still a significant portion of the American populace that is willing to give them their ear.\nThat's what I'm trying to change.\nWe're never going to get everybody, but if we can get 10% of them, I think it's a home run.\nWe get 20, we're totally winning all day long.\nBut it's going to take time.\nYeah.\nI mean, I know that people are super.\nEverybody wants OMIC today, right?\nThey just wanted, you know, they wanted a quick fix and when you're dealing with four years of whatever the hell was going on and 9 million people being released into this country and all the all the stuff that comes with it, it just would stand a reason.\nIt would take a long time to unravel all that or to fix all the problems that were created.\nThat is, man, I hope you clip that and play that over and over again.\nThat's what I've been trying to explain to people.\nI'm like, we're going to fix as much as we can, but you guys want answers yesterday for problems that have been metastasizing for decades.\nAlso, you want to have all the information in place when you finally do go public with everything where you can't miss things, not cross a tea, dot an eye, and someone can get off.\nThat and we also twoprong that is just as equally as important as the following.\nWe want to fix the institution so it doesn't happen again.\nThat's the bigger win.\nCatching the bad guys is the everyday job.\nWe're going to do it.\nCalling out the people who corrupted the place in the past is hugely important.\nBut leaving the American people,\n\n\nAn FBI, a DoD, a CIA, a functional national security apparatus is the ultimate is my ultimate goal.\n\nSo the apparatus that was in place before that was so riddled with corruption, what what do you think happened between Trump's between when he was in for the first term and the the four years?\nLike how did it get so bad in the when when he left?\nYeah.\nWhen he left in the last four years?\nI mean, I'm assuming there was always corruption, but why how did it get so bad in this past four years?\nBecause of the the priorities.\nThey completely shifted the priorities.\nUm, but how does that encourage corruption amongst the top officials because the priorities themselves were corrupt?\nFocusing on DEI and climate change is a political potshot to weaponize the Department of Defense and the intelligence community and the law enforcement community to say we're going to promote you based on your background and beliefs rather than your ability to get through the pipeline.\nYou know, another thing we're doing is we're changing the PFT, the physical fitness test at the Federal Bureau of Investigation for new agents and for current agents because it's wholly insufficient.\nI'm not asking you to be a special forces operator, but I am asking you to be able to take down a dude running away from you in a hundred yard sprint who may be twice your size and detain him and safeguard the American public.\nAnd so when you don't focus on those things for years, years and you focus on promoting people based on I'm not here because the color of my skin, but when you do that, this is what happens.\nAnd then when the media celebrates these these victories, people are like, \"Oh yeah, I'm gonna subscribe to that because I hate the other side so much, I'm just going to go along.\"\nI don't I honestly don't believe what most of the people are putting out there in the media that they actually believe it.\nI think they are go home at night and they are like, \"Yep, we know this is wrong, but we've made our bed and we are going to sleep in it every single night and we are not going to retract.\"\nThat is such an insane decision.\nIt's such an insane decision and again it diminishes the credibility of an already damaged organization.\nYeah.\nI mean people now that people know about Russia gates, they know about the Hunter Biden laptop story.\nThey know about the steel dossier.\nThey know about all this [ __ ] that happened like their faith in media over especially after the pandemic.\nTheir faith in media has been deteriorated so badly that I can't imagine they wouldn't just for self-preservation reasons shift course.\nBut they have been a problem they have been able to persevere in their space and they're not looking to persevere anything past that.\nI mean look at the the from a monetary standpoint most of the media has been losing money for years, right?\nYou know, but they keep reporting it.\nThey don't care.\nMost of these editors and chiefs at these big wig operations get blown out the door in a year or two.\nNew people come in and buy it.\nThey keep losing money.\nMost of these shows on mainstream media, the TV shows at night, their hosts get fired every other minute because their ratings suck.\nBut the institutions themselves don't care to change.\nThey don't go out and bring in a Joe Rogan.\nUm, that would probably be what it takes in my opinion to fix something like that.\nDo you imagine?\nI don't think you should do it.\nGet the [ __ ] out of here.\nThey would torture me.\nIt would be horrible.\nEvery news story I mean then then I mean we just you see that they're willing to lie in the news.\nYou see they're willing to push narratives that just are not true.\nIt's just so hard to imagine how you can sustain the American people's trust.\nAnd if you don't sustain the American people's trust, they're you're going to keep losing money.\nYeah, I just I can't imag I know I know CNN made of some of what of a concerted effort to try to be objective for a while.\nThey brought on Scott Jennings.\nThey've they've changed a bunch of things in that regard, but it's still like some of the the panel talks they have, you're just like, what [ __ ] planet are you guys even living on?\nRight.\nAnd the problems we're facing, he does a good job of highlighting.\nHe's like, hey man, these pro- Hamas positions didn't happen overnight.\nThey happened because we let in all these people from all over the world and they came in and they started attending our universities and they started getting together and they started seeing in the media that that was a quote unquote popular thing to do.\nAnd then that ethos spread and now look what we have.\nWe have chaos on college campuses.\nWe've got lonewolf attackers.\nWe've got terrorists.\nWe've got openings for our narot traffickers.\nWe haven't even touched upon what our adversaries are doing to our cyber infrastructure.\nI mean, Salt Typhoon is a massive telecommunications breach engineered by the CCP.\nIt's public.\nIt's not classified.\nUm, and they literally got into our our United States of America's telecommunications providers broken.\nAnd we are playing catch-up.\nThese are the priorities we're focused on.\nWe have solutions for them.\nThey're they take time.\nThey're not sexy.\nNo one wants to talk about upgrading the nuclear arsenal of the Triad.\nThat's not the sexy thing to talk about, but that's what we need to do.\nNo one wants to talk about hardening our infrastructure and fixing our grid switch system across the country.\nYou take out one electrical grid uh infrastructure plant and you take out a large chunk of this country.\nBut when you don't prioritize those things for years in these last however many years, then our adversaries get hip to it and they say, \"Hey, there's a vulnerability.\nLet's double down.\"\nAnd what our adversaries are doing, we haven't even talked about the war and the Hamas and all that stuff.\nWe don't have to, but they're teaming up.\nThey're saying, \"Look, we really don't like each other, but we don't like America more.\nSo, why don't we partner up?\nWhy don't we use you, the drug trafficking organizations of Mexico, for human smuggling?\nUm, not just drugs.\nWhy don't we use uh you, Russia, Iran, the CCP, get together, we'll sell ammunitions to you because you can't get them from anywhere else in the world.\nYou don't have access to banks.\nYou know, the biggest threat we have from a counterterrorism standpoint is Iran.\nAnd that's why the president's trying to achieve a peaceful resolution with them and end this war that Hamas started in October um in Israel and Gaza.\nAnd nothing would be a better solution than a peaceful one to that because we talked about hostages before.\nAnd what did they just report out?\nTwo more American Israeli citizens bodies were uncovered yesterday or the day before.\nThe cost of these wars, people don't see and feel right away.\nAnd unless you give them in-your-face 24/7 coverage of it, their focus is going to be on what CNN's talking about and how they're talking about it.\nYeah.\nAnd that's that's part of the shift.\nAnd that's like one of the large reasons I was like, we have to come on this show.\nWe have to at least swing at it.\nI don't know how many people maybe no one will watch it.\nMaybe some people\n\n\nWatch it.\nOh, a lot of people are going to watch this.\nNo, but that's not, you know, like that's not the point for me.\nLike it's we just have to try to reach different audiences.\nWe have to have to have to have to try.\nYeah.\nWell, I don't think people have heard it from your perspective before like this, especially over a long form.\nI know you have a heart out at 3:00.\nYeah.\nSorry, it's 3 o'clock now.\nSo, um, thank you.\nThanks for being here.\nReally appreciate it.\nAnd I appreciate you illuminating a lot of these things that I think very confusing to a lot of people and I think you've answered a lot of questions as to like how long time takes and what the process is like.\nBut I appreciate everything you're doing.\nMeans a lot to me.\nI can't believe that was two hours.\nUm that's awesome.\nUh hopefully I can come back.\nBut look, absolutely.\nPlease do.\nJust a just a parting message.\nUh if I may.\nI appreciate the show and what you've done and I love seeing you at UFC fights.\nI'll see you at one soon.\nUm, but um, we uh, I just want to say this for the folks at the FBI, and I probably should have answered it when you first asked me.\nThe thing I'm most proud of is most all of them.\nThey're crushing it.\nThey're crushing it, and they've been wanting to do it for so long that um, this part, this job's easy.\nMy job's easy.\nWhat they're doing is hard.\nMe moving people around the country, taking them from their families, uprooting them, and everybody's like, \"That's the mission.\nThat's what we're here to do.\"\nAnd I don't want people to take away, oh, okay, he's bought and sold by everybody that corrupted the place.\nIf you look at the show and you look at in its entirety and don't take clips from it, you'll see what we're about and putting the mission first.\nAll right.\nThank you very much.\nThanks, brother.\nAppreciate you.\nAll right.\nBye, everybody.\nTake care.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n"
