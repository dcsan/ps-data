  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, welcome to another latest in space learning pod.\nThis is Allesio, partner and CT at Desible, and I'm joined by Spix, founder of Small AI.\nHello.\nHello.\nWe are just all recovering from the Grok 4 livestream.\nUh, and and uh, we're so happy to have Greg Kamradt from the ARC Prize Foundation.\nIs that is that the full name of it?\nThat's exactly Foundation.\nNo, ARC, I'm sorry, ARC Prize Foundation.\nARC Prize Foundation.\nThat is the sponsor of the ARC AGI challenge benchmark.\nWe're also recording this.\nSo, we're recording this one day after the Grok 4 release when and you were there.\nYou spoke with Elon about uh their progress in ARC AGI, but then you're also doing this launch event for ARC AGI V3 next week that we'll also be at.\nSo, this is a little bit of a preview, a little bit of a recap, a little bit of an introduction to people for ARC AGI.\nIt is clearly becoming, I think, like this time last year, people weren't super taking ARC AGI that seriously, and now they really, really are.\nFirst of all, congrats on picking the right horse, and then and second of all, maybe let's let's get a high level like how are you introducing ARC AGI these days?\nYeah, absolutely.\nSo, ARC AGI, we are a nonprofit that wants to act as the northstar towards AGI.\nAnd the way that we do that is we build benchmarks because the way that I think about a benchmark, it's kind of like a target that's out there in the sky, and it says, hey, this is where we need to go, and this is where we need to incentivize research to go for it.\nSo the first benchmark Francois Chalet came up with in 2019, and he came out with this paper on the measure of intelligence, which is kind of it's an interesting way to come out with a benchmark because he first started to try to define intelligence, and then you define a benchmark that can actually go and measure that definition of intelligence.\nSo he did that in 2019, and then in 2024, Mike Koop, one of the co-founders of ARC Prize, he went to Francois and he said, Francois, either I'm wrong or this benchmark is drastically underrated.\nSo Mike actually put um, he put up a million dollars of his own money and said, \"Hey, I'm going to put up bounties.\"\nSo for anybody who can beat this benchmark, they're going to get a million dollars.\nAnd that's where ARC Prize, the competition came out in 2024.\nAnd then uh, this year we expanded the mission and went into a full-blown nonprofit.\nSo now, not only is it the competition, we're also doing a lot of the leaderboard stuff.\nWe're building another benchmark, and we're about to come out with our first platform or at least a preview of the first platform on uh interacting with that benchmark.\nWhat has been the most surprising thing working on it for you in the last year or so?\nLike you went from underrated to obviously as Sean said, very popular.\nDo you think there's something fundamentally different about either the models that you're testing against or people's interest or just right time the space is growing?\nWell, I I think nothing happens in a vacuum.\nRight time the space is growing.\nHowever, the way that we think about our company is if we were a company or a nonprofit, if we're going to equate it to a startup, the product that we have is the benchmark.\nAnd so you're not going to convince the community.\nYou you can't BS your way through a properly inappropriately designed benchmark.\nAnd so the great work that Francois did, like the foundational research that he did and the flag he put in the ground, that is what the differentiator was for it.\nAnd so in 2024, um, we were solving for awareness, and we're very happy where that ended at the end of last year.\nUm, we left uh 2024 with OpenAI uh inviting us to come join them on their 03 model uh preview for it and like Des and uh co-announcing the results for that.\nSo um, solve through awareness, and now we have to solve for a whole lot more.\nYeah, I I think also I think there's a little bit there's a there's a fit between the reasoning paradigm and ARC AGI, and in some sense, like ARC AGI 1 was almost like too early, like or honestly just like well-timed because it was like already a well-established benchmark, and people found like, oh yeah, like actually this somehow tests abstract reasoning and learning uh acquiring intelligence on the fly.\nI I forget what um Francois's specific term for this, like his definition of AGI.\nYeah.\nWell, so I mean this is where we get into the really interesting stuff, and you're going to get me going here, but Francois's definition of intelligence is not necessarily how well you do at any one test.\nSo you can buy by arbitrary levels of skill.\nJust if you go practice more, you're going to get better at a skill, right?\nSorry about that.\nYou're going to get better at one skill.\nFrancois's definition of intelligence is what is your ability to learn new things?\nSo can you go and learn new things?\nSo we already know that AI can beat chess, and we know that it can beat Go.\nWe know that it can do self-driving.\nBut those systems, they cannot generalize to other domains outside of their training data.\nAnd that's the important part is can you actually generalize for that.\nSo the way that Francois calls it is skill acquisition.\nBut then the the kicker that comes with this, which is really important, is skill acquisition efficiency.\nAnd so what is your efficiency to actually learn new things?\nAnd so when you talk about efficiency, you're talking about a ratio, and there's a denominator in that, right?\nSo what is the denominator of intelligence?\nWell, there's two things.\nNumber one is the amount of energy required to actually go and learn new things.\nSo the reason why this is so cool and important is because ARC uh ARC Prize Foundation, we use humans as the benchmark for what general intelligence is because that's our only proof point of general intelligence out there.\nIt's the human brain.\nAnd we know how much energy the human brain takes.\nYou can literally measure like the number of calories and like wattage that the human brain actually does.\nWhat's really cool is with that you have an intelligence output and you have an energy input.\nSo you know how much that is, and you can directly compare that to the energy required for current AI, like how much energy energy do they take for it.\nNow the second denominator is how much training data do you need in order to output that intelligence that you see from there.\nSo humans, they do not have an internet's worth of training data um in their training data, but yet they can still do generally intelligent things, whereas we're not seeing that with AI right now.\nSo energy and training data are the two denominators we we use for intelligence.\nSo if somebody were to maybe have a steelman argument of this would be that everybody's saying energy cost is going to zero, and while humans are limited by clock time of like their life on what they can learn, machines we can just kind of parallelize all of it.\nSo maybe can you talk about why it's actually important to generalize and versus somebody might say, hey, you know, we can just do RL in all the different domains, is it because the data is not there, it's hard to build the environments, and how does that tie into the games that you're building for the new challenge?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, I hear that argument a lot.\nOh, you can just RL like on anything, right?\nAnd I think one could argue that if you had a proper environment, then yes, you could RL on a whole bunch.\nAnd humans are RL on the ultimate eval engine that there possibly is, which is physics reality, right?\nThat that is the ultimate eval engine that we're all going for.\nNow, if you're not using physics or an eval engine, then you have to have a manufactured simulation RL environment.\nAnd often what happens is the human or developer intelligence is often injected into that environment itself.\nAnd so the model isn't actually intelligent.\nYou're just almost like taking the intelligence from the developer, injecting into the environment, and then then you're transferring it over into the into the AI from there.\nSo the important part of the intelligence definition is your ability to learn new things.\nBut that's on unseen tasks.\nSo it's really difficult to create environments for things you can't anticipate, but yet humans are good at that, right?\nLike we come out the womb and all of a sudden we can, not all of a sudden, but throughout our lifetime, we can learn to drive, we can learn to play chess, we can learn English, we can learn all these different things.\nAnd so generalization is the key piece of that.\nNow, what you're bringing up though is what we're announcing um either today or however it may be for this podcast recording is we're coming out with ARC AGI 3.\nAnd what this is going to be is it's going to be a series of 100 different novel environments or you could simply call them 100 different novel games that we're making ourselves.\nSo, these are simple games, 2D games that humans can do that are really easy for humans to be able to play and intuit about them, but AI is still going to have a really, really hard time with this.\nNow the reason why we're moving to actual games is because of this movement that goes from static benchmarks and to interactive benchmarks.\nMy hypothesis is that when AGI is declared, it will happen via an interactive benchmark.\nWe're not going to know that a AGI is here just via a static benchmark.\nAnd the reason why is because humans are very good at intuiting their environment, understanding what the goals are, making a plan, making a long horizon plan, and you're not going to get any of that from a static benchmark.\nAnd you're required to have an interactive benchmark.\nSo that's what ARC AGI 3 is going to be.\nYeah.\nLet's run through whatever you can share.\nI know some people a lot of people are watching on YouTube, so it's always nice to have a follow along.\nYeah, absolutely.\nWell, so I just got word from my uh developer that Sean should have good access for this.\nSean, are you there?\nAnd you can share your screen and try this out for us.\nI don't think Sean is here.\nHe just texted me that, but you can share.\nYou can share it.\nLet me go for Let's go for it.\nHere we're going to do Awesome.\nSo here we have an example of one of our games, and each one of the games has a um has a fun name that goes along with it.\nSo as a part of the preview, we're launching five games.\nNow three of them are going to be public on day one, and two of them are going to be private.\nNow the reason why we're going to be two are private is because we're having an agent competition.\nSo we want to see how good can the community be against uh trying to beat these things.\nAnd so we'll release the um two two extra ones at the end of the competition.\nIt's only 30 days long.\nSo you'll get these immediately.\nNow, here we are looking at uh Locksmith.\nNow, you just look at this one screenshot and it doesn't make a ton of sense, but that's on purpose because you need to explore in order for it to like intu in order to intuit it what's going on.\nSo, we'll show the same thing to AI except the AI is going to get a JSON grid of uh uh list of lists.\nSo, they'll just get a bunch of numbers 64x 64, and they can choose to turn that into an image if they want to.\nWe're agnostic, do whatever you want with it if they want to do multimodal.\nSo, what I'm going to start doing is I'm going to start clicking around and trying to figure out what are the rules of the environment that I want to do.\nSo, I see there's some sort of walls, and I'll go over this dark thing.\nNothing there.\nLet me go over this one.\nAnd you can see here that in the bottom left, this object changed, and now it matches what's in this a black area over here.\nOkay.\nWell, let me go over there.\nNice.\nThat looks like it was.\nMy guess is that you're going to have to match what's in this bottom left to what's in the um to what's in the black square over here.\nSo, let me go try that out.\nLet me make that match.\nOkay, cool.\nNow I got a match.\nLet me go down.\nOh, dang.\nI ran out of energy.\nI ran out of life.\nOh, there's this purple thing.\nOh my god.\nI need to go get that.\nAnd so now you're seeing how there's rules about the environment that force you to explore, to understand what it is.\nI just picked up more life.\nNow I can successfully go down to the dark one over here.\nRight now, what we have is each new level should introduce a new game mechanic.\nNow, the reason why we introduce a new game mechanic is because we're testing your ability to learn on the fly.\nSo, now there's new rules about the environment.\nAnd this is what humans are very good at is sample efficient learning.\nRight now, let's go through here.\nLet me try this one.\nYou'll notice that this dark square is a different color than what's in the bottom right here.\nSo, now you need to switch the color from what this thing is to try to make it match.\nI want to be mindful of my life right here.\nSo, let me go let me get some more there.\nThen, let me make change the object.\nAnd let's go down.\nLet's make sure that See, I just ran out of life.\nI I play this all the time and I I need to redo it.\nLet me do that one more time.\nOkay, we have that.\nLet me go up.\nAll right, let me try to match this object.\nAnd oh my goodness, I this probably an annoying demo if you don't know what you're doing here.\nAll right, I'll do it one more time.\nMore life.\nI think it's positive that you know the game and you still struggle to complete it.\nWell, part is what's interesting here though is even though I know the game, that doesn't omit the fact that I need to pre-plan what I need to go do because like we need to actually do some planning on this one, and that's what humans are very good at.\nSo, as you start thinking about coots and reasoning here, reasoning and AI is going to have to plan their actions and what they're going to have to go do for it.\nSo, now that we matched up the symbols.\nOkay, great.\nLooks good.\nNow we go to this last one.\nAnd this is where I'll stop right here.\nLet me make sure this matches up.\nLet me get the right color.\nAll right, let me get some more life.\nLet me match the shape.\nOkay, so I match the shape.\nBut notice that it's out of rotation right now.\nSo now I need to go to this last one and actually need to rotate this object.\nAnd let me get some more life.\nLet me go through here and and go all the way down there.\nSo we're forcing exploration.\nYou're forcing long-term planning.\n\n\nYou're forcing understanding what the different actions do and how the actions map to the action space, and then you're getting just minimal, sparse rewards for if you actually did something. Anyway, so this is Locksmith, our first demo for it.\n\nNice. Are you limited to only 2D, easy to translate to text environments, basically, or how are you thinking about designing the rest of the games?\n\nYeah, so the API actually, so what when agents play this, what they will get, let me jump out of here. What agents will get is a series of frames, and those frames will be 64x64. Now, generally, it's just going to be one frame, but you might be able to get like maybe two in a row or three in a row, and that would show an animation. And so, beginning state, middle state, end state, and so you can kind of get a perception of over time there. What we ask for back is just one through six, a series of one through six actions. And it's really just integers. And so, you pass back a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Those are just like, we call them basic actions, and then six could represent a click. So a six, you submit a six action and a coordinate somewhere on the screen, and that represents that you actually clicked on something on there. Now, we like a really scoped environment because that removes a ton of, we'll call it, it's really easy to analyze the learning efficiency for humans and AI if we scope down the environment really well. So to your point, yes, it will just be 2x2 in the beginning. So another thing that I think is a consistent finding from people that I just wanted to double-check is that you pretty much always emphasize a visual representation, but most models do not benefit from visual learning, right? Is that, does that still hold?\n\nActually, you know, we get that, we get that pushback all the time. We are agnostic as to how the model represents the data to themselves or anybody represents it. So, we've had people turn the, like we give a JSON grid. We've had people turn that into emojis. We've had different text representations. We've had people turn it into pictures. Anything is on board if they want to go for it. Now, we communicate these puzzles to humans via pictures because it's so much easier to do it via visual. Um, it's a valid, it's a valid pushback we hear all the time. We're not concerned about it because we're agnostic as to how you represent the data to the model.\n\nI wasn't asking about the pushback. I, this is me using some prior knowledge of the solutions to ARC-AGI that apparently most people say that adding multimodal vision doesn't actually help. I'm just, I'm just wondering if that's still true.\n\nYeah. Yeah, it's still true. We have, we have yet to have an AI successfully beat any level on any of these games. So, it hasn't happened yet.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, I think that just the previous ARC-AGIs, I'm just right looking for like, because for example, in the game that you showed us, you're representing life, and you're representing sort of planning, presumably this, this sort of like sort of path planning algorithm, like an AAR or something that uh, people are going to have to end up intuiting or, you know, finding if, if they don't explicitly program it, they're going to have to model it, basically. And there's just just a question of like, you know, how much does vision help and uh, you know, uh, I, I definitely am using it a lot in solving it, but language models might act differently.\n\nYeah. And um, that's one of the reasons why we're having our agent competition too, because we want to know, we want to use the collective intelligence of the community and say, hey, what is, what are the types of, like, what are the types of scaffolds that are needed in order to be competitive on this, and what are the types of scores you can get for it? So, the way that we're going to judge the agent competition is we will have a generalization score, which is like, how well do you do on the private test set? We know people are going to overfit to the public stuff, but we'll, we'll um, place a higher weighting on the private side. But that's a good point, and one of the things I'm actually really curious about is what role does scaffolding play in Future AGI? Now, I know that sounds kind of like, like a weird question, but my current hypothesis that AGI will be heavily scaffolded. And why do you have that?\n\nWell, my hypothesis is that you're going to need different components that are working together in order to get the effect that you want. So, for example, in this game, you need to have a concept of memory because certain actions that you took back then are going to inform your future actions. Is that all just going to be held in the context window? I don't know. That's a lot of tokens that come from that. Is that the most efficient way to do it? Probably not. You're probably going to want to do some compression. Okay. Well, then all of a sudden, you have the beginning of a harness that's sitting right there. So, um, one of the questions I have going into the agent competition is what is the minimum viable harness that you need in order just to swap out the model and see how they do on this? And then if you're going to have the Porsche of harnesses, like what if you're going to go crazy, what are you going to go do for it? And so that's why we're going to throw up a little bit of prize money, incentivize people, and see what they do for it.\n\nYeah, I think it's a really interesting open question. I would say definitely the researchers, you know, like we, we specifically asked this question to Nam Brown, and his answer was like, yeah, scaffolds are all, all going to die. So, he's definitely on like the sort of thin agent camp.\n\nYeah, I think that the um, the jury is still out for that, but I think that...\n\nWell, yeah, the jury's still out. I could argue both ways for it.\n\nI know in the B2 you also had the dollar per task thing. How do you think about keeping that in B3? And then, are you recalculating B2 based on the price drop of the of the models? Because I think like, for example, 03 was like, I think the most expensive one, but I know they dropped the price by a bunch. So I'm curious how you balance the how much to weight it versus how much is kind of like a temporal thing.\n\nTotally. Well, so two things here. If a model, if a provider drops a price, yes, we will update our pricing, and it just, we just want to reflect reality. So we, we would say in our reporting, hey, the price is up here, now it's down here. And that, and then that's what it is. Now to the, to the first question though, is around efficiency, right? Because like I said, if intelligence is a, is a fraction or is a efficiency metric, the denominator is energy and training data. We don't get that for closed models. Obviously, they're not going to tell us how much energy it takes and how much training data they use. We can only guess it. So, we use cost as a proxy for that because in theory, cost is market efficient. Now, it's not perfect because it's not a complete commodity yet, but it's a, in in theory, we, we're okay with the with the error buffer there. Now, for V3, that's a different, that's a different question. What's cool about interactivity is we get a new efficiency metric. So, yes, we still get cost, yes, we still get training data, but now we actually get action efficiency. So, the way I like to demonstrate this is imagine if you're playing that Locksmith game I just did and you had a brute force random agent. In fact, that's one of the templates we'll launch with is just like a random agent. It's going to be extremely inefficient. And one of the quality checks that we do is we run a random agent at a million steps to see if it beats it or not. And no, it doesn't beat Lockstep at all or Locksmith. And so what we'll do is when we come out with ARC AGI V3 in Q1 of next year, 2026, we're going to go and test hundreds of people on how they do on Locksmith right here. And what's nice is that you can get on the x-axis, you're going to get number of actions. And on the y-axis, you're going to get levels completed until game over. And you're going to get a little line that goes up and up and up and up. And that slope, you can kind of think of that as your learning efficiency, right? If you take a lot of actions to go a little bit of levels, well, you're not really learning the rules of the game. And we're going to know who's the best. We're going to know where it lands. Now, the brute force agent, the random agent that I was just talking about, that's going to be a flat line all the way out. It's not even going to be even close. So, when we report um, learning efficiency for this, especially with AI versus humans, it's all going to be around how many actions do you take in order to complete the goal of the environment, which not only does that encompass learning what the environment entails, but also executing what you perceive to be the goal of the environment as well. So, it's almost learning and execution there.\n\nYeah, that's, that's a, I like that you're consciously designing with that chart in mind and and specifically tracking, you know, what you have defined what France has been pushing as an important dimension for AGI, which I think is very relevant. If I had one criticism that came to my mind while you were describing this is that it is very sort of embodied. It's very single agent, and that may be not the case. We might want to do multi-agent. We might want to do branching. I don't know if you have responses to that kind of stuff.\n\nYeah. So, what's actually really cool is, so the one game I showed you is agent-based, like you have a little thing that's moving around. We have a requirement that games must be novel from each other. We have a large percentage of games that are non-agent-based. So, think of it as like, like solitaire or connect 4 or like Simon or memory or something like that. Those are non-agent-based games. And so, game mechanics will be completely uh, different across those. Now to your other point, we are also designing some games that require cooperation with other things in the environment to be able to complete the goal. And so you can think of it as uh, if we have a hundred different games, we can tag different levels in different games with different skills required in order to complete that thing. One of those skills may be cooperation or alignment with other things in order to complete the common goal. So, just making this up for example, kind of like prisoner's dilemma. If you were to just go right for the exit or something, you're going to get a lower score than if you were to cooperate. Or maybe you can't even complete the game unless you go and cooperate. And we can start to measure that.\n\nOh, yeah. That's, that's actually super interesting. Um, because then you start to have to model other entities and it's not just a map. Yeah. Adding that.\n\nWe don't, we don't have plans yet to have multi-agent in the fact of like two LLMs battling against each other because we're really kind of focused on the one. But yet we may have deterministic agents out there in the environment that are kind of more code and program based.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to show you really quick is going back to that learning efficiency piece. We're actually taking inspiration from a uh, Josh Tenbomb paper that came out um, in 2000, I think it was 2021, and they actually, this is, this is a little bit of a same thing. They, they, they're not doing the exact same test that we have, but you can see that there's number of steps for these games, number of steps taken by agents, and the number of levels that they were able to do. And then they started to differentiate between the um, like human players and AI players. Now, our games are going to be different. It's going to look completely different, but this is the chart that I have in mind for when we go and start to report the uh, efficiencies here.\n\nWas the 120 games number picked with any math behind or just a good, a good number?\n\nIt's kind of a balance of what do we need for statistical significance versus what is realistic from an operations perspective in order to actually go and execute these. So in order to build each game, we actually have a team of seven game developer contractors right now. So we call it our assembly line, and it literally starts with a good game idea, like let me even back up from there. Franuis made an architecture document that's basically this is what makes a good game. This is why it's going to measure intelligence. I hope he open sources that at some point. Maybe we'll do that with the actual um, Benchmark. Then we take that and then we turn it into a game idea and game spec, and we go and hand that to one of our uh, game developer contractors. They make it for a week. We go and test it. We do some light testing, some QA, is it a good game, you know, etc., etc. And we market is done, and then we go from there. Our goal is to come out with 120 by Q1 of next year. And so that means that we need to make 20 per month. We need to make five per week because there's four weeks in a month. So we need five or six game devs that are helping us making these. And so we got the assembly line. And so a lot of folks come to us and say, \"Hey, Greg, we'll make programmatic games for you.\" Like, \"We'll just go and make an LLM, go make these, and we'll just make them or whatever.\" And the problem with that is that we don't want to incentivize AI to derive the program that made the game, right? And so if we continue to have humans make the game, then the AI is incentivized to try to reverse engineer the G inside of humans. And that's kind of the whole point of what we're trying to do here. So anyway, to answer your question, longwinded way, it's an operational limit mixed with what do we need for data significance?\n\nAnd so today you have the game devs, you have an engineering team that kind of builds the gaming platform. What's the breakdown of the team overall?\n\nYeah. So like we have three FTEs on ARC Prize right now. I'm one of them, and it's kind of like GNA and like, like everything else. So I run ARC Prize right now. And then we have a very awesome generalist engineer.\n\n\nHe's an absolute rockstar.\nHis name is David.\nHe's doing everything from serving the API to user off to management to game serving to QA to all that other good stuff.\nAnd then we have a lead game dev.\nHis name is Hunter, and he is the one who looks over and kind of does the quality check and idea inspiration for all the different game devs from there.\nNow, Mike and Francois are still very involved, but they're not full-time.\nThey're on the board that comes with it.\nSo, ARC Prize, our engineering team is one person.\nAre you planning on hiring?\nShould people reach out?\nShould people contract?\nWhat's the any call for action for people?\nYeah, you know, we're opportunistic with that.\nAs a nonprofit, we are very budget conscious and mindful for what we can.\nWe're not, we don't, um, we haven't like raised a whole bunch of cash for it.\nSo I would say it's also a bit of financial driven as well, and that's one of the things you know that's on my plate as well is going and fundraising for ARC Prize with philanthropic donors.\nSo I would say have folks reach out.\nWe may not have a spot.\nWe may have a spot.\nWe'll see how it goes.\nYeah.\nUh, so I think it's a very noble cause and very impressive what you've done so far.\nI think there's always the question about like the future roadmap for ARC AGI.\nPresumably, you know, you went to two and three really quickly.\nUm, and presumably there's thinking on four and five.\nI think like constantly whenever ARC AGI comes out, the question is always, you know, how does this apply to sort of real-world situations?\nIt is becoming more and more real world.\nDoes this end with you know, you cloning Dota?\nBecause it's starting to be a game.\nIt's like, you know, yeah.\nHow where does this end?\nWhere does this go?\nWhat's V45?\nYeah.\nI tell you what, my view on it is at the Grok 4 livestream last night, Elon actually said something along these lines, which I agree with, which is reality is the ultimate eval engine.\nThat's as simple as that.\nYou're not breaking laws of physics.\nThat's what we all operate in.\nIf I could have any benchmark possible, I would want a perfect simulator of reality.\nAnd of course, who wouldn't?\nBut like a perfect simulator of reality, and then that's when you go and that's what you go and simulate on.\nThat's your environment that you can just manufacture different tests for that.\nIn lieu of that, we have approximations that happen um every now and then.\nSo the way I think about it is if you had like a linear um spectrum, ARC AGI 1 and 2, it's a static list of like three or four JSON grids.\nStatic doesn't move.\nARC AGI 3, I guess on the other side would be reality, like pure representation of reality.\nARC AGI 3 is a step more towards reality, but it's still going to be a scoped environment.\nSo, without knowing what the exact answer is, I do know that ARC AGI 4 or 5 or whatever it may be will need to allow us to have more axes of freedom that um are above a 2D 64x 64 type of grid that comes from there.\nBut one thing I do want to, I do want to emphasize here is one of the things that sets us apart from other benchmark creators is we don't aim for PhD++ problems like the hardest possible thing that nobody understands.\nOur anchor and our constraint, which is actually really freeing, is can humans do this, right?\nBecause our hypothesis and our definition of AGI is as long as we can come up with problems that humans can do and AI cannot, then we do not have AGI, and then the flip side of that is also true, which is when us as ARC Prize, we're like, we consider ourselves like our job is to come up with problems that humans can do and AI cannot, when we can no longer do that, for all intents and purposes, that's practically AGI.\nAnd the fact that ARC 2 is still out there and humans can do them, and the fact that ARC II is going to be out there and humans can do them, proves that we do not yet have AGI.\nSo the other thing I do know about ARC V, and this is where I'll wrap it up, is that ARC 4 will still be doable for humans, but it's still going to be hard for AI, but it's going to need to have more axis of freedom for us to test.\nDo you have a timeline on when you think V2 will get close to like 50%, then 100%?\nBecause I know Grok 4 yesterday really 16%, which everybody was going crazy over, but it's still 16%.\nUh, so how do you think about saturation of current version, when to build the next one, and then you know, you're releasing V3 in 2026?\nDo you think that's a benchmark that will last another kind of year and a half, two years?\nThat's kind of the rough timeline for you.\nYeah.\nSo I, I will say that the V3 timeline also depends on how V2 goes.\nSo like right now, like you said, if we end the end of the year and it's 16% still, it's just a different dynamic on if we want to introduce V3 or if we don't.\nUh, we don't necessarily have a timeline on V2.\nMy hypothesis is it's not going to get beat in 2025.\nThat's only 6 months away.\nBut like if if we really back this out here, like what are the things that would like surpass it?\nWould an O4 Pro, whenever the heck that comes out, would that, would that be it?\nI'm not sure.\nI'm very, I'm more confident to say that if you have a base LLM, like a GPT5, if if GPT5 is a base LLM without all the routing and COT and all that crazy stuff, uh, it's not going to, it's, I'm pretty confident it's not going to beat um ARC 2.\nWould an O5 be needed for it?\nI, I don't know.\nBut 05 is not coming out this year is my guess.\nYou know, it's going to be coming out next year.\nSo I, I guess longwinded saying I, I don't know, but my guess is it's not going to be beat for the next 12 months.\nAnd then V3, our durability estimate for that is 3 years.\nThat's what we're aiming for is 36 months for V3.\nThat's kind of wild in this in this time frame.\nWho knows?\nThat's our hypothesis.\nThat's what we're aiming for.\nWe told a big lab that our timeline for V3 was 36 months for not to get beaten.\nAnd I won't say which lab it was, but we were basically left out of the room when when when we told them that.\nWell, yeah.\nI mean, I think it's a cat and mouse game, you know.\nI think it's all towards a good cause.\nSo, it's up to them to prove you wrong and, you know, we'll all be better for it, right?\nSo, that's that's exactly how I think about it.\nAnd like I'm even hesitant to say the words like beat ARC AGI, cuz it's like we're not putting up this test as as like a like look at us go and try to beat this thing.\nIt's like it is a tool to incentivize research.\nLike that is why we put up a million dollars to see who can actually beat it because our hypothesis is the thing that actually does beat ARC AGI 2 has something worthy in it that can be applied to other types of domains.\nAnd so in um ARC Prize 2024, we had over 40 papers submitted for our best paper award to try to be ARC AGI, and that's one of the most rewarding things for us because that's open research that's out there.\nAnd so one of the things that came out of that was the whole you know test time fine-tuning adaptation for that.\nSo as test time compute was coming around, a form of that is test time fine-tuning, and one of and that was a huge proponent within ARC Prize of last year.\nAs we think about what as I think about it, it's almost like I don't want ARC Prize B per se.\nYeah sure that's what's going to happen, but I want cool research to happen because of ARC, and you end up performing well on ARC because of that research.\nYeah, ideally Mike didn't put up a million dollars just for somebody to win it, but in order to get more research out in the ground.\nI think that that's a great goal to have.\nYeah.\nLike tactically people ask me like what what am I trying to do here or what is like what's the goal?\nIt's like well once AGI is found, I think ARC Prize is setting itself up for a very good place to declare to be the one to declare that AGI is actually here because someone's going to have to do it, and like maybe it might be like the turning test where it kind of just happens and goes.\nI doubt that that's actually going to be it.\nI think there's going to be a before and after moment, and I would love ARC Prize to be in the place to validate that.\nAnd then number two is once AGI is actually here, I would want to look back at the learning path and research path towards that and say ARC Prize had a role in accelerating that progress.\nThat's a very good mission I would say, like, but you know, it's hard to declare a moment when AGI is here.\nI don't see why that's a worthwhile goal.\nLike you guys are moving the the goalposts like v1 v2 v3, right?\nAnd and even OpenAI, I think in their current communications, they no longer say, like, at least not in the public ones, you know, with whatever they have with Microsoft, uh, you know, it's like if we like make hundred billion in profit, that's AGI, that's controversial, but at least publicly they're saying that we're no longer talking about a binary, it's here, it's not here, it's just levels, right?\nAnd we're like level two, three right now.\nIsn't that okay, you know?\nUh, I would would have a healthy debate on that, and I would push back on that.\nSo like for the first one, I agree with you.\nAny AGI definition that involves money has ulterior motives.\nI mean, simple as that.\nUm, money has nothing to do with intelligence, right?\nAnyway, that, but that that's a whole another side concept from there.\nI would argue that AGI is here once an artificial machine can match the learning efficiency and generalization of an actual human.\nAnd to me that that's a pretty binary place to go for it.\nI agree that there's going to be spectrums and levels of that.\nWe're already seeing it with the progress on ARC AGI 2.\nThey're showing non-zero levels of fluid intelligence.\nSure.\nOkay.\nI accept that.\nBut we will be able to look back at a point in which machines were basically able to learn faster or quicker or at the same level as humans.\nOkay.\nWell, you're set up to declare that.\nShould we spend a little bit of time on on Grok 4 since it's like hot on everybody's minds?\nYeah, let's do it.\nYou were at the event.\nWhat, what was the vibe like?\nJust, just give us the on the ground review.\nYeah, totally.\nSo I now I've had the luxury of attending two labs of live streams here.\nAnd so for the OpenAI live stream in December and then Grok's here, they called us up today's Thursday.\nThey called us up on Tuesday and they said, \"Hey, we got a new model.\nWe want to test it.\"\nWe say, \"Yep, sure.\nThis sounds good.\"\nWe have a kind of a standard testing procedure with them.\nSo like no data retention and the model that you that we test should be the one that's going to go out to the public so that people can actually reproduce these results.\nAnd they said, \"Yep, cool.\nNo problem.\"\nThey gave us a little bit of credits to go for it, which is always very happily accepted.\nAnd then tested it.\nAnd one of the things that we do is we say, \"What is the score that you're claiming?\"\nBecause they do their own self testing and we want to see what what's their score so that we can go and validate it.\nAnd they said they're public eval scores.\nYep.\nWe we ran it on semi-private.\nIt it worked out.\nLooked great.\nValidated.\nThey were excited about it.\nAnd then they said, \"You should come be in the audience of the live stream.\"\nWe said, \"Sure, sounds great.\"\nAnd so went over there.\nAnd the one thing I wasn't expecting is this was p.m. on a Wednesday, right?\nAnd so, uh, I walked into the XAI place.\nThere might have been 200 employees there like buzzing and the energy was high.\nUh, there's like, you know, Door Dash deliveries happening all over the place.\nEveryone was absolutely buzzing going for it.\nUm, and then we get into the live stream room and they have a proper live stream setup.\nIt's great.\nAnd then they were an hour hour late.\nLike not an hour late.\nIt's like I don't know what they were doing.\nThey were just like practicing like their slides, right?\nWhich is totally cool.\nI think it was just like um they're figuring out what they wanted to say and it was just um not an ad hoc thing, but just you know, off the cuff going from there.\nAnd then they announced the results.\nIt's great.\nI was sitting there in the audience with my laptop like getting the ARC Prize tweet ready and then click enter right right when I saw the slide come up and click merge on the website push and we go from there.\nYeah.\nI mean it it was great.\nSo, we love when labs pull us in early to help them validate scores.\nUm, cuz that really gives kind of a public boost and a public like vote of confidence that ARC AGI like has the merit to like they're saying that yes, we trust ARC AGI to help describe the intelligence of these models.\nWe absolutely love that.\nSo, we're very thankful to the XAI team to giving us the giving us that access for letting us come join the stream.\nAnd then after that, right after the stream is over and that, you know, the cameras went down, there's a good chance to go talk to Elon.\nAnd so, uh, went up there and said thank you to Jimmy, one of the founding engineers of, uh, XAI, and went over and thanked Elon.\nAnd then I gave him the V3 pitch.\nAnd cuz he cuz he he wasn't as familiar with ARC 1 and ARC 2 as some other folks were.\nAnd so, I quickly realized that and then pivoted over to the V3 conversation.\nAnd so I said, \"Hey, um, we're coming out V3 next year.\nIt's going to be a series of 100 video games.\"\nAnd he immediately did his like Elon, like I, I can't do it.\nBut he did his Elon like eyebrow raise like right after\nvideo games.\nOo.\nYes.\nYeah.\nNo, really.\nAnd because he had just got done in the presentation, they just got done how Grok made a video game.\nAnd he's like, \"Okay, Grok making a video game one shot.\nOkay, cool.\nThat's kind of impressive.\nWhat Grok really needs to do is Grok needs to play the video game and\n\n\nThen iterate on the game and then play it and then iterate and then play it.\" And so I knew that that would probably hit with him. And I said, \"Hey man, I mean, we're making a hundred video games here that are going to be easy for humans, hard for AI.\" And he goes, \"When's it coming out?\" And I said, \"Well, we're doing the developer preview next week.\" And then he raised his second eyebrow right at the right at that point. And so he he was interested in I you know, he's a gamer himself and so we're hoping to talk talk to him more about it. He's excited. And so we'll see how it goes.\n\nI'm always curious like, you know, Elon is a a unique figure in human history. I always figure like how much you actually have to deal with him versus like his people, you know, like actually, you know, you should be talking to Jimmy, not not Elon, but you know, like it's nice to have Elon, you know,\n\nYeah. Well, I I tell you, I mean, it it was cool to have that experience with Elon just because of his prominence in the field and in industry in general. Shake his hand, congratulate him on the ARC stuff here, too. But like if we want XAI to to come jump on board with us and like come along with this journey for us, um Elon like wouldn't necessarily be the person necessarily who's going to be doing the operational execution of getting that to happen, right? Like it's going to be Jimmy and team and all those other folks. And so we're excited if we can have Elon support either way. We're excited to have Jimmy supporting the rest of the team, you know. Well, you know, he's he's got a big uh checkbook that he can he can help to fund a nonprofit and he has a history of that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Any other takes from from Grog 4? Uh obviously doing doing very well in all the evals that everybody's like is is it is is it just the new Frontier LM? Like have they have they come from nowhere and beat everyone?\n\nI mean that's what it looks like right now. I mean I tell you what I'm with everybody else. When you look at the benchmarks it's like okay great let me get this thing inside of Cursor and what's the deal? Let me get this thing inside of let me go in the chat and let me see like actually how how it does right? So the vibes seem great right now. I'm excited to see more adoption that comes from it. You know, I think it it still needs to be investigated and researched as to the reason the RL paradigm. Like you saw that they they 10x the RL that they put on top of Rock 4 for that. And so, how does that bleed down on actual performance and where are the gotchas and where the nooks and crannies in the corners and where's the spiky intelligence actually spike? I think there's still a lot of open questions for it, but either way, right now we're seeing freaking awesome performance.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um I I would say that too. I I think the cursor thing they they did mention maybe they have like a coder specific model like a dev specific model that might be coming out separately. So maybe I would hold off on on the coding side of things especially you know it's it's it's a huge model. I heard rumors I heard rumors that that Grok doesn't want to release the coding model until it's better than one specific other lab out there. So they're going to wait and see when it's actually better for them to so they can have that marketing point.\n\nYeah. I mean, sure that makes sense, you know, but also like uh the fact that they they can credibly do it, you know, kind of come from a standing start is really is really I think commendable. I think it's there's there's a lot of stories to be told from inside of X like how they did this because you know there's just a lot of data you have to get and you can't always get it from Twitter because like God knows Twitter is not the best source of information.\n\nYeah. So\n\nwell I think it's really if you think about the ablation study about what does it take to get a good model out there. I mean, obviously there's people, there's money, there's compute, there's there's data, there's all these other things. And it's super interesting to have AGI labs out there that are frustrated with their external performance. And there's other labs out there who are very happy with their external performance. And what's the difference between the two and they all took different routes together. So, like you're talking about coming out of nowhere, I mean, more or less. I mean, they they've been at this for not for not too long. They're literally building the ship as they're doing it. And so, it's very impressive for what they have. And I think other labs may look at this and be like, man, what is going on there? That we want that type of success, too.\n\nI know Zuck. Zuck's over here looking and going like, you know, these these XI researchers looking very interesting.\n\nYeah. Well, you won't be able to blame Zuck for not taking a move either, so\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. It's it's a it's a it's a wonderful time. Cool. Well, thanks so much. Uh, any any other last questions or thoughts, Allesio or Greg?\n\nNo, this was great. I'm excited to play the games when they come out.\n\nCool. Yeah, absolutely. My only call to action for folks is we want agent builders. And so we're going to come out with three different games. I would love if you could build agents however the heck you want using whatever tools you want, RLbased, LLM based, or whatever it is. We're going to have about a $10,000 price pool and put up some money for it. It actually may be more valuable. We're going to like push all like on our every single social channel that we have push every single top performing agent. So I would love if you guys would participate with that. Uh call out to the audience for that.\n\nYeah. I mean, I'd love to hack on it. I don't know if I can I'll do I'll get anywhere, but you know, I love to hack on it and and promote it. Um I think it's it's a really fun cause.\n\nBeautiful. Love it. Thanks for having us on.\n\nThanks, Greg.\n\n[Music]\n",
