  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHey everyone, welcome back to the latest space podcast. This is Allesio, partner and CTO at Decible, and I'm joined by Swixs, founder of Small AI.\nHello.\nHello. And we're very excited to as Warp users welcome two folks from Warp, Ben Holmes, who I've known for a while, and Zach Lloyd, who's CEO and founder of Warp.\nWelcome to the pod.\nThanks for having us. This is awesome to be here.\nYeah, this is great. I don't even remember when I switched over to Warp. I think changing a terminal is a very personal choice for a lot of people. I think I was an IT term 2 guy for a long time, and then Warp came along, and you were one of the first to be basically the AI terminal, and obviously you're like, \"Woo, I want to try all the AI things,\" and like it actually stuck. So that's how I introduced Warp. I don't know if you would augmented in any way. That's how we've been presenting ourselves. Like we are, we are today, I think, as this podcast comes out, releasing Warp 2, which, you know, we're positioning ourselves as being no longer just a terminal but an Agentic Development Environment. And I can kind of like explain what that means, but short answer is like we are, Warp already does and has done for quite some time way more than what a terminal typically does, whether it's like translate your English into commands or doing tasks for you, or it has a collaboration platform. And so, you know, calling it a terminal, it boxes it in a little bit and creates sort of like preconceptions around like what you can do with the tool. The biggest new thing that we're launching though today is a coding agent in Warp. And it's like a state-of-the-art coding agent. We should have some, I don't have the Swedebench score yet. Ben, Ben's been working on our Ben's been working on Sweetbench, but we're basically state-of-the-art on Sweetbench. I think we will, again, I don't want to be quoted here. We could maybe edit this later, but like we'll probably be number one or close to it on TBench also, which is the terminal benchmark, which really we should be the best on. We're launching, uh, basically it works very similar to Claude Code, which I know you all covered, and you know, I listened to that, uh, that that recording where you can just tell Warp to build a feature for you, tell Warp to fix a bug, and you can also tell Warp to do basically anything, like you can tell it to help you debug why a server is crashing or why your git is breaking or how to rebuild your docker stuff. So it's it's a super flexible interface for doing these like agentic workflows. And so we're trying to break out of the terminal box to make sure folks um get a good sense of its power.\nI want to say even though like it wasn't like Warp one wasn't strictly like kind of an agent. So I, I just want to share this this experience I had, uh, which I know that you saw, but uh, you know, I I've been I've been kind of critical of Warp just as as as everybody who uses the thing does. But then I was like, \"Hang on.\" So like I started installing this, uh, this new project called Home Assistant, which is kind of like an open source Alexa, and I didn't have some packages, and it just it just started suggesting things to me to fix my Python environment. All I did was I just hit enter and it just hit enter, enter, and it mostly worked. I there were sometimes I I had to sort of go backwards, but this was agentic in a sense, except that I was powering it by hitting enter, like I was the human looper.\nThis is my my favorite tweet you've ever done on us. I know we've uh we've blown up your memory several times. I apologize for that. But yeah, this this is like how most people I would say are who are Warp users are for the first time exposed to like, \"Wo, this thing can just sort of like solve my problems.\" That's like the most common inroad that we have for AI. So it was it was cool. It was cool to see you post that. And like it's very magical when it works, cuz you're like, \"It's the last thing you want to be dealing with as a developer a lot of times is like, oh, [ __ ] like I'm missing this dependency, this path variable is wrong,\" and just like Warp can just fix that stuff for you. And so that that still definitely works, and I think we're the best at that. We've introduced the ability to let that go fully agentically now. So you know, there's like a new set of, we call it like an agent profile, where you can at the level of like running commands or executing diffs or doing code search, you can control the autonomy level, and so I basically run Warp now with full autonomy, and you know, as long as you're not on like some production server or something, that that works pretty well.\nWe should just let you go right into the the demo if you if you're loading that up. And while while you're loading that up, Alicia, I don't know if you want you have any uh questions that you want to.\nI have one question. So since the ChatGPT desktop app, there's been the work with Warp and chubbyd, which I used before. You can either do yeah, the switch workflow of just let Warp suggest or you can do chubd work with Warp and ask it to figure something out. Obviously you build support for that. Why did you then decide to say, \"Hey, we should just own the end-to-end agent and build the coding into it and like instead of outsourcing the intelligence to a different layer?\"\nThere's a few reasons. So, the integration I think you're talking about is you're using the chat GPT desktop app, it can sort of like pull what's on your screen in Warp. The main reason is like we feel like the integration can go way, way deeper if Warp itself is the thing driving the interaction primarily because of like the the type of tool calling that we can do like directly in Warp. Like when I think of ChatGPT desktop app or um claw desktop app, the big difference that I see with Warp is Warp is much more of like a read write interface, and I tend to use those tools as like readon in some sense. Now you can kind of like MCP hook them up and like do stuff through MCP with them. But the command line is really an interface that's built for doing. And so when you give agents the ability to run CLI tools or make code diffs directly with it within it, it's it's way more powerful. The other thing is like we do a whole bunch of stuff in terms of like what the prompts should be for working with the terminal, how you get context uh correctly to do things in the terminal and like the what we're now calling the ADE. And so it's not integrated enough if it's happening outside of our control and just using ChatGPT's prompts. And finally, we use a bunch of different models. So like chatbt isn't even the model of choice at this point. It's it's anthropic for us. Does that make sense?\nYep. All right. Let me start with this. If you are a Warp user, it's it's going to feel very, very familiar, except that the main thing that you see here is what we're calling this universal input, which is kind of just like a nicer input for driving either terminal commands or agents. One of the things that it does, so it will detect whether or not you are typing English or typing an agent command. So I could be like, \"Tell me about this repo.\" And you'll see that this is like I have this in a mode right now where you do auto detection. It realizes this is English. If I execute this, it's going to execute it as launching an agent. Let this run for a second. While it's doing this, the other thing is like if you are a Warp user and you find this feature annoying because it sometimes misfires, we now give you the control to just basically lock this into terminal mode or lock this into agent mode. I always use the auto detection uh cuz I find that that more useful as a terminal. Even if you're in auto detection mode, you can just like run regular terminal commands and it works the way that Warp has always worked. So you get all these nice features in the UX. And you know, our thesis here is that the best interface for launching agents is actually pretty similar to what traditionally has been like a terminal UX. You know, you want this like grouped output. You want the ability to seamlessly run commands. And so we've kept a lot of that. The different things which I'll go over here and show you, one are like the coding capabilities. So, I'm going to go ahead and ask Warp here to fix a bug for me. This is a real bug in Warp. The issue here is like if I turn this off, what should happen is that this model picker should go away. But right now, that's not happening. It's not listening to the setting. And so, I'll just show you what the workflow looks like in work for fixing a bug like this. I will just be like, \"Can you look up my linear issue?\" Uh, this issue is filed in linear already.\n7252\n\"Help me come up with a plan for fixing it.\" I'm going to talk to Warp because I just find it easier and less annoying than like having like watching people have having people watch me type. So I would say, \"Please look at the attached screenshot to understand where the setting is. What I want you to do is figure out how to honor the setting. You should get a good idea from the bug description what the problem is.\" And so I just talk to it. And then the other thing that we've added is the ability uh within Warp to like give direct context to file references, which by the way is actually very useful even if you're just using Warp as a terminal. So I'll be like, \"You should look in at universal in this file.\" And I'm going to go over here. I'm going to take a screenshot of this.\nAnd I'm going to go over here. And if you've used other agenda coding tools, probably this is like uh like a fairly familiar uh type of workflow, but I want to show you some of the stuff that makes this cooler in Warp. So, I'm going to go ahead and and do this. We'll wait here for a second while it does this just to show a few cool things. So, one is it's it we now have full MCP support. So, this is uh using the linear MCP. MCP and Warp is configured over in Warp drive or you can get to it through the settings. I have linear, I have notion, I have sentry. This is super useful. I assume people watching this are familiar with MCP, but if not, MCP is like a way of getting external context into an LLM driven tool. A second thing that it's doing here is another thing that's new in Warp, which is uh we have codebased embeddings now. And I know there's been like some question of like, \"Do you need codebased embeddings?\" It seems like there's differing opinions on this. We find that like definitely in Warp's internal repo, having the ability to do sort of like semantic search across your code files is actually quite useful. This is all controllable, I will say. So if you go over into settings, you can see the code bases that have embeddings so that we can do sort of vector search over. You can control this and turn this off. We don't store any code. I know there's some coding tools that are actually like storing your code base. We just store vectors for semantic search. If you go back over here into Warp, we'll see where this got to. So, this found the issue in code. It gives me a nice view of what the problem is. It needs to check this uh setting. This is correct. And by the way, so the way that I use these coding tools is I I use I don't really vibe code. I don't know if how folks in this room feel about vibe coding, but I I like to really try and understand, especially on a real codebase like this, what it's doing. So, this looks right, but I think actually might be missing one step. So, I'm going to tell it what to do. \"Make sure you listen for when the setting changes. You can follow the pattern that other settings use. You may need to call context.notify when that happens. Please check that out and update the plan.\"\nWhat are you using for the speech to text?\nJust the Mac OS. We're using Whisper Flow, which is another startup which has got like a really good API around doing speech for text. And I do find the speech for text when doing this kind of prompt driven development is like a magical thing. Otherwise I'm just like typing these long things. While this is going, I'm going to go over here and fix another issue. So this is one of the cool things about using something like the terminal form factor uh is that you can naturally multi-thread uh while doing this work. And actually I can see notifications going on. If I come back over here as this agent is working. I'm going to start over here for this. We have a noull pointer exception annoyingly in our go code base that is uh being tracked in sentry with this issue. So I've kind of like you know set this up to do this. I'm going to ask Warp at the same time to go ahead and try and fix this for me. So I'd be like, \"Could you look up this sentry issue, doesn't get that perfect sentry issue, and diagnose why there's a null pointer exception. I'd like you to look through the code, figure out where it's happening and suggest a plan for fixing it. Once we have a plan, I would like you to create a new branch and on that branch, let's go ahead and implement the fix, assuming the plan looks good, and then we will write some unit tests for it as well.\"\nMy god, the amount of typing and work that you put in here is just an order of magnitude above anything that we we normally do.\nSo, this is going to go do its own thing. Over here, you can see this one is done. I want to show one other cool thing that we've added, which over here is the ability to see the status of multiple agents. And so, agents in Warp are just sessions. They're terminal sessions. They're running within terminal sessions. You can do them in split panes. You can do them in tabs. Anywhere you can run a command, which is like analogous to running an agent, which is an intelligent task, you can run one. And so this gives you an overview of all the ones that are running in addition to what their status is. And so what we're trying to build towards here is a world where you're truly doing this like multi-threaded development where this is going and uh you you know you have multiple of these things going at a time cuz you don't really need to sit there and watch them. So let's see this. Okay, so this worked. This took my advice, which is\n\n\nNice to see. Warp's built in\nRust, by the way, which is why you're\nseeing Rust code here. One thing that's\nvery cool, Warp is over a million lines\nof Rust code. And this is like up until\nvery recently, this type of agentic\nstuff just did not work in Warp because\nit's not built on any public UI\nframework. Like we have our own internal\nUI framework. And so it really needs to\nunderstand our codebase to do this. So\nI'm going to be like I'm going to ask it\nto go ahead and make the change and then\nwe will go do something else. So I'll be\nlike yes please make I'm going to talk\nagain this change for me but please\nfirst create a new branch with the\nappropriate linear branch name format so\nthat it's tied to the linear issue. So\nthis is how I code now. I'm curious if\nother folks code like this. It's pretty\nwild. It doesn't work perfectly like you\nneed to be able to go in and edit and\nI'm going to show you that next how that\nflow works. Um but in the meantime for\ndemo I'm going to show you can use Warp\nto do production work. That's another\nkind of agentic workflow. So here I'm\ngoing to use a feature of Warp that's\ncalled save prompts. So we have a save\nprompt that I made before. And a save\nprompt is just like it's like a\nparagraph telling an agent what I wanted\nto do. But the thing is it's reusable.\nAnd this is also sharable across your\nteam. So Warp has a bunch of features\nthat are really cool for supporting\nteamwork in this area over here called\nWarp Drive. This is something that if I\nwant to do logs analysis, I can pull\nup. I'm going to go ahead and start\nthis. And what it's going to do is it's\ngoing to help me get some logs from our\nCloud Run instances, but it's going to\nwalk me through that. And again, you can\nsee over here, I think this is super\ncool. You can see what these other\nagents are doing. Uh, let me go back\nover here for a second and see if it\nstarted adding code. So, it has. So,\nwhile this one is running, I want to\nshow you what the code experience looks\nlike. So, you get sort of similar to\nCloud Code here, which I think is the\nparadigm that we're most similar to.\nOkay, this one is waiting for my\nattention over here. You get these\ninline diffs. One thing that I should\nshow you is that I also have the ability\nto edit these. And so, let me go over to\nmy AI settings for a second and turn off\nsome of this autonomy. So, I'm going to\nchange this to the agent should ask me\nfor a code diff. And I should Oh, it\nalready made the code diffs. Hold on.\nI'm going to stop this for a second cuz\nI want to show you what this looks like.\nCould you add some comments into the\ncode diffs that you just created,\nplease?\nOkay, so we can do this. Let's see how\nthis one's doing. So, this one now needs\nmy help. Oh, I got it over here. Okay,\namazing. So what's cool about Warp\ncompared to say Cloud Code or ADE or\nCodex CLI is that as you do this sort of\nlike linear agent-based coding workflow\nyou can actually use like some elements\nof rich UI to do it. So this is a diff\nviewer right that we have built right in\ninto Warp. If I want I could also go\ninto here and this is a full code\neditor. So, this is brand new with the\nADE launch and I can sort of, you know,\nactually edit in here if I want.\nMy feeling is that you're going to be\ndoing fewer and fewer manual code edits.\nUh, and I know like again, I watch you\nhave the cloud code folks on. I think\nthat they agree, but sometimes you\nneed to do them and not having to\ncontext switch to an editor outside of\nthe tool I think is a really nice piece\nof the workflow. So, I'm going to\ncancel out of this. This one also, you\ncan see, is now paused.\nIt the same thing. So, I asked it to add\ncomments. Start ask comments. I'll go\nahead and apply this comment, but I'm\ngoing to turn autonomy back on so that\nwe can um doesn't have to ask me all the\ntime. Okay. Go over here. This one in\nthe meantime is waiting for me. I'm\ngoing to go ahead and try to let this\none run to completion just because I\ndon't know how long I should take with\nthis demo. But I'm going to remember\nthis one is doing some logs gathering.\nI'm going to be like, can you use\nwarp-server-staging,\nuse the warp-server cloud run instance,\nand then pull all info, warning, and\nerror logs for the last 10 minutes. Do\nan analysis of the most common\ncategories of errors for those three\nlog levels and print them out for me in\na nice format.\nSo, if you've done any like production\nwork in your career, this is like the\nlast thing that I want to spend my time\nlooking up, like figuring out how to\nuse these tools, like it's like kind of\nhell. And this is like a place where\nI think Warp really really shines. So,\nit's doing these commands. And again, a\nreally nice thing here is like because\nWarp is at its core a sort of\nterminal UX, you can always drill in and\nlike pop these open and see the results\nof the tool call. It is, let's see if it\ncan figure this out. So, yeah, it's\nfiguring out what all my services are.\nIt's also, this is cool. So, it's using\nthis little derive from thing here means\nit's using one of our rules. And so,\nthis is very similar to like Cursor\nrules. The biggest difference that these\nare is that these are sort of like\nclouds synced and so you can sort of use\nthese wherever you log in. They're sort\nof sharable across team and so like this\nis our version of cursors rules. I\nthink we will also by the way probably\njust literally support the cursor rule\nformat. This one already kind of\ncompleted. So this is a peak inside our\nstaging like where do we have like what\nare we doing? These are our graphql\noperations.\nWe see anthropic. We have warning\nlevel logs here. We have some timeouts\nwith Gemini because we're we're using a\nwhole bunch of different AI services\nunder the hood. Some 500s. I just think\nthis is like so awesome. Let's go back\nover to this one. So I could be like,\nyou know, continue fixing the NP\nin the Go code. I'm going to I think I\nbasically hit most of what I want to\nshow. I'll show one last thing which I\nthink is a super cool and very\ndifferentiated thing just just to Warp.\nOne other place where AI is really\nhelpful which is not something that's\nsuper well known in Warp but it can be\nreally powerful which is like if you go\ninto a ripple and here I'm inside a\npostgres ripple you have AI access even\nwithin this ripple to do natural\nlanguage into ripple command translation\nfor instance I could be like show me all\ntables and it will live translate that's\nvery trivial but I could be like you\nknow uh oops I hit the wrong key. Uh, I\ncould be like, \"Show me our users\ntable.\"\nAnd I don't want to do anything. I don't\nwant to think do anything sensitive\nhere. Maybe I'll do like show me our\nworkflows table.\nYeah. Careful demos on\nyour production data.\nYeah. I mean, this\nthis is not real data, so it's like I\nthink fairly safe, but even showing the\nlike schema like maybe scares me\nslightly. Uh uh. But the idea here is\nlike you can then be like you know show\nme all workflows\nrelated to git or something like\nthat. And what's cool here is like it is\ngenerating SQL for me on the fly and\nalso learning the context based on the\ncontents of the session. So if you're\ndoing like work in node or python,\npostgres, my SQL, it works in any ripple\nand it's a uh it's a pretty\ndifferentiated and cool feature of Warp.\nSo I think this is a good demo. You know\nwhat I was really hoping to show is like\nWarp can code and Warp codes at a level\nthat's like comparable to Cloud Code. I\nthink it's actually better than like\ncursors agent. It's probably better than\nWindsurf since they aren't they don't\nhave sonore. It's a really really great\ncoding agent and a really awesome and\ndifferentiated UX for doing coding with\nthe inline editing features that we\nhave. It's also an awesome interface for\nagent multi-threading. So you can have\nmultiple of these running at a time. You\nget these cool notifications around what\nthe agents are doing. It's got this\nuniversal input around like how you\ncontrol the agents including with voice\nwhich is super useful. So hopefully this\ngives everyone a good sense of um you\nknow what we think the future of\ndevelopment in like an agentic\ndevelopment environment should look\nlike. So let me come back to the session\nand stop sharing. How was it?\nThat was\ngreat as an early Warp user. As I was\ntelling Ben, I'm still using pound sign.\nUh ask for recommend.\nI don't know.\nThere's like way better way of doing it.\nHow are you thinking overall about like\nthe UX and the shape of it? You know, I\nfeel like even now you have the Warp\nDrive was kind of like there on the\nleft, but maybe it's almost more\ninteresting to have the different see\nthe different agent run times run versus\nhiding them like what what are like\nmaybe some of like the baggage that\nyou're bringing with you, you know, and\nlike where you see things going. the\ndifferent like primary thing that I\nthink we want to feature in the UI is\nlike what are your agents and what are\nthey doing to your point and like right\nnow you can sort of see that in that tab\nthing up top but it's also kind of like\nwhat a tab is or what a pain or what a\nsession is and so we are we're trying to\nthink through on the design side like\nyou know what what would a agent first\ninterface look like we're also trying\nthough to um kind of like build a bridge\nfor people who are already using Warp\nand like there is like some baggage\nthere. Like here's a a hypothetical way\nwe could have built the app. We could\nhave made it look like Slack or\nsomething where you're like, you know,\nyour primary modality is like you chat\nwith an agent. I think that that would\nhave been like maybe a step too far for\ncurrent users. It's debated and Ben, I'm\ncurious if you have a take on this, but\nlike I think there's something awesome\naround like, hey, you get like the\nfamiliarity of the terminal form factor.\nYou get this very very clean abstraction\nof like tabs and panes and sessions are\ncontainers for agents, but maybe like\nthe tab bar or like the agent switcher\nlike that there's some way of combining\nthose that we haven't quite settled on\nyet. Uh Ben, what do you think? because\nI did get to work on some of the status\nfeatures in the tab bar and also the\nmanagement pane that you see in the\ncorner. And around that time, Claude\nCode was experimenting with like\nobfuscating the details of what it's\ndoing behind a nice to-do list that\nshows it checking off interesting\nfeatures, which is similar to our\nmanagement popup as well. And I've found\nmyself enjoying Warp's approach a bit\nmore because as I'm sort of feeling out\nthe style of a PR or if I need to make\nedits to a code change, I never have to\nopen an editor to actually review the\nfiles and get diff everything cuz Warp\ndid the first step of we'll show the\nagent output. We'll show the diffs that\nare occurring. We'll have an option to\nedit it. And one thing you didn't demo\nwas also a little fast forward button\nyou get at the bottom where yeah if you\nturn off automatic mode for everything\nyou can hit a fast forward button\nwhenever you want it to just go off and\ndo everything. Otherwise it will just\nnotify you with the desktop ping\nwhenever you need to review a file. And\nthat just feels like the natural next\nstep from using like tab tab tab inside\nof Cursor with super maven where I'm\nstill looking at the code. I'm still\nworking with it and I have an option to\nfast forward the more I trust this tool.\nAnd then eventually I may just check the\nmanagement pane and my desktop\nnotifications and rarely have Warp open\nat all except for inputting prompts. So\nit feels like a more progressive\ninterface since we own everything beyond\nlike the CLI itself. It's all the tab\nviews and everything.\nYeah, it could be\nthat that that real estate on the left\nis like prime real estate where agents\nshould go. It's an interesting it's an\ninteresting question. We do have the\nhistorical like Warp Drive is over\nthere.\nIt's almost like where's the\nstrength of it, right? I think like if\nyou really take it further, it's like\nwell if Warp code is so great, I should\njust pay for Warp code to run in ghosty\nas well. You know what I mean? It's like\nit's interesting. It's like more of the\nAI piece comes into it. Like the\nintelligence itself is like what's\nvaluable to me more than like the\nterminal itself. Why people like Cloud\nCode is they bring it around you know\nand like with Warp code it's like I\nwould love to bring it around but you\ncan imagine somebody saying I'm not\ngetting anything from Warp outside of\nWarp code so why do I have to only use\nit in Warp you know what I mean like a\nheadless like CLI version is interesting\nmy take on that is that there is a lot\nof value in what we can do with the UX\nthat if it's a pure CLI app you just\ncan't do. So like there's no way for\nCloud Code it running in ghosty let's\nsay to have an editable diff. Uh, now\nyou might say like, well, why do I need\nan editable diff? Like if it does it\nperfectly, even if you don't want to\nedit the diffs, I think honestly like\nthe next thing that we'll probably be\nbuilding is like basically a way in Warp\nof code reviewing what the agent has\nproduced cuz I think that you totally\nwant like if you're having an agent\nwrite code, I find it very very\ncumbersome to like push all the changes\nup to GitHub, review it myself, then\ncome back into my tool and have the, you\nknow, then retell it to do it. And so\nthere's all these like native UX things\nthat I believe you want if your primary\nworkflow is like launching and managing\nagents that is not available if you're a\nCLI app. I would say like our likely\npath forward on that is like we will\nprobably at some point make a Warp CLI\napp where if you really want to run it\nheadless like you and want to run it in\nCI cuz I do think this is an advantage\nof like Cloud Code you can run it there\nbut I think for like the hands-on keys\nlike I'm a developer coming into work\nand I want to like use these tools to\ndelegate work I think it's a much nicer\nuser experience if you're doing it in\nWarp than if it's just running as a CLI\napp which is by the way it's It's kind\nof the thesis behind\n\n\nWarp itself, which is that like just using CLI apps was really hard, a pain in the ass, and like having like the mouse work and that kind of stuff is is nice. And so, you know, I I think it's in keeping with that original philosophy of like how do you build a super accessible user experience? I don't know if how big of a question you can probably decompose this question, but as a comms person, I think I have trouble fitting Warp in the universe of things. And because you're a bundle right now, you're a bundle of UI, terminal, and agent. And you know what? If I really like Claude Code, I'm going to try to use Claude Code inside of Warp. And actually, I've done that. But you've basically made a competing harness that I now have to think about, you know, using. And then obviously that, you know, before Warp had Warp 2.0, I actually did the voice coding that you just did inside of Windsurf. I use super whisper instead of whisper flow, but same thing. I just talk into it and and and did that. And then I think the last piece for me that Warp doesn't have yet, but I presume it's, you know, if you you might eventually explore this, is some kind of sandboxing, some kind of cloud background sandboxing because you can only use Git for so much. Like it's going to have code has side effects, terminal commands have side effects by definition, and they're going to interfere with each other. So like basically, like I think like where are you going to own and where are you going to compete?\n\nIt's an awesome question. You might have like I'm going to try and answer all these. You might have to remind me of all the different parts of it because it's like a complicated question.\n\nAgent harness UI and sandbox. I think the sandbox one's the easiest, which is like we're local right now, like in a very similar way like Cursor, Windsurf. And I think that's the right place to be right now, but I don't think it's the right place to be forever. The reason I like it right now is because it's where developers are doing their work. And when agents fail or need to be corrected, it's very convenient to correct them without the long feedback loop of like either sshing or trying to like replicate a remote environment locally. So just a much faster feedback loop in a period where these agents are pretty fallible, right? So they're not perfect. So that's why I like it local now. But if our thesis is that multi-threading is going to become really important, it's going to not be doable on a single machine. Like if you didn't like our memory usage before, you're not going to like it when we're running, you know, 10 agents. It's just not going to scale.\n\nAnd so there's like a resource pro part of it, and then there's like a sandboxing part of it, which I also agree with. I also think like the sandboxing thing is very cool, but a very big barrier to adoption in the developer tool space. We've been trying I think forever to get people off of their local machines to do development, whether it's like code spaces or Git pod or whatever. It's such a freaking pain to set up. It doesn't work for all kinds of development if you're doing anything with local hardware or mobile development or whatever. It like it just is not ergonomic. And so, you know, we'll get there eventually. I've I've been saying that forever, but I I I think right now you got to start where the development happens. So that's my answer to that one. What was the the first question was like what are we like where in the landscape are we something like that.\n\nThe first part of the stack was agent harness, but basically yeah, that's the real question, right? What will you own versus what will you like sort of collaborate with.\n\nThe way I think about this is like we've been a terminal, right? So like the the like developer tools landscape I think for a long time has been like are you a terminal? Are you an IDE, or maybe are you like a CLI app or like an IDE extension, I guess, would be the other like thing. What our thesis is is that the primary workflow of development is changing, and you know, it's changing from your primary development workflow being like, hey, if I want to make a coding change, I'm going to open an IDE, I'm going to open a bunch of files, I'm going to handedit them, and then I'm going to open the terminal and I'm going to like run a bunch commands and I'm going to do a bunch of stuff with Git and I'm going to do so stuff with Docker. I don't think that's how developers are going to be working. Like I think the way that developers are going to be working is primarily by prompt. Instead of like if I want to make a change, I'm not going to open an IDE and open five files and use autocomplete and LSP and all that stuff. I'm going to ask an agent to make a change. If I want to do something in production, I'm going to ask an agent to figure out like why my servers are failing. And you know this may say sound like out there, but I think that you want a new type of workbench for that workflow, and that is what Warp is like aspiring to be. We don't fit cleanly in any of those boxes. I I think that that like hurts us to some extent because it's like if I'm a lifelong developer and I'm like okay I get it CLI app or like okay I get it IDE. We are trying to be a different kind of thing, and being just like a terminal I think is like doesn't do the tool justice. It's not like it's just like not what it is anymore. And so we're trying to build that next thing, which is the most natural way of supporting this like prompt driven development workflow. And we're coming at it through the terminal form factor. That's our DNA. It's like that's the app that we have. I actually think it's like pretty close to the right form factor for doing this kind of development. I think it's certainly much closer than the IDE. Like the IDE is like a static view of all your files at a point in time. And like if you look at all the IDE agents, they're like in a chat panel. They're basically rebuilding something that's kind of like a terminal. I think Claude Code is like proving that this like prompt driven workflow is super valuable and feasible. But I think from uh I just think that is you're going to run into a wall if like your entire app is a a terminal app, a CLI app. And I think even hearing the Claude Code folks on your podcast, like I would not be surprised if Anthropic like launched a thing that looks a little bit more like Warp where it's like a harness for running a whole bunch of different cloud codes, but it's an actual like thing that can live in your desktop. You know what I mean? Cuz I think it's it's like from a distribution standpoint, it's pretty limiting to just be like a terminal app. Although there are advantages to it, I think it's a very difficult question. I think you answered it as well as you could. I think it it's it could be cleaner, but you know, sometimes you just have to compete where you compete. I think that the challenge for you is just the sheer amount of firepower the big labs are putting behind their agents, right? And you're coming out saying you got a better agent than them. Good for you. But also like, you know, you're fighting them.\n\nSo, it's an interesting position because we are competing with them and we're also their customer. And it's it's interesting question to me from their perspective.\n\nHow much do they want to own the enduser relationship? How much do they want people building on their APIs? There's this interesting dynamic where I think Anthropic is like pretty clearly the leader in the in the coding models right now, but I don't know if that's going to be perpetuity. Like they have a competitive dynamic with each other also, right? Whereas we have this interesting advantage of like if Gemini became the best coding model in two weeks, everyone who had like gone all in on Claude Code would be like in a little bit of a weird position, whereas because we're just like, \"Okay, we'll make Gemini our default model.\" So, there is like some advantage to being where we are at a layer above. You know, I'm sure that the model companies are thinking like, how do we lock people in cuz they don't like that's a very big risk for for Anthropic in my opinion. Uh to just be like, okay, like Gemini's best next week. Cursor moves like Cursor I think is some very significant portion of their revenue. I don't totally know like is the short answer, but the sort of north star for us is like can we build the best user experience around these like around the models? I do think there's a bunch of alpha in terms of like what's the UX, like what's the prompt engineering, like what's the context retrieval look like, but yeah, we're competing with them and it's they have more money than us, that's for sure. They have more people, they have bigger brand, like they have a bunch of advantages that we don't have, but we have some advantages too. We actually have a lot of developers using Warp, by the way, which is a very significant advantage. It's a good thing for us that we started building up that user base a while ago. Do you have any public numbers that we can reference of like what are you saying regarding growth trajectory of Warp just just to establish in people's minds if they've never heard of you?\n\nYou know it's like almost 600,000 active users on Warp right now. Our revenue since the beginning of the year is growing like depends on the week between 5 to 15% every week. And so like it's actually a pretty fast revenue ramp. Now we're not nearly at the scale, just to be clear, of like Cursor or even Windsurf, but like we have pretty awesome product market fit with people who discover the coding and paid parts of Warp. So the other is we're in an amazing market right now is the other thing I would say is like the um and this wasn't true a year ago, but like now it's uh it's very expected to pay for developer tools, and for the first time we have companies that are coming to us being like my developers aren't using the latest AI tools, like how do we get them to use it? And that's like a totally new development, which is very good for us. So we're growing really, really well, and we have this very big existing user base, you know, not big like relative to like GPT is like 500 million users or whatever, but for a developer product, like pretty substantial, and that's also growing pretty quickly.\n\nYeah. And usage of it has also been going to the right from dipping your toes into just asking Git questions to actually asking it to do long running tasks. That's the thing we've been looking at. But all this growth has just been on the back of I want something to help me through Git and Vim, which is crazy. And now it's able to do a lot more things asking through the exact same input box. So people are just finding it organically and now they'll find it a lot more readily.\n\nWhile we're on the topic, uh what is is pricing changing at all for this new thing? Have you looked into any other models?\n\nWe're giving away more. Uh basically Okay.\n\nThe two plans were a uh actually there's three big changes. So there's the two plans were the pro plan and the turbo plan. Pro was at a,000. That's going to 2500 requests. The turbo plan is going to from 3,000 to 10,000 requests, and then we're int introducing uh usage based pricing. So if you hit the limit on the turbo, you can buy more credits. We're trying to also get that into the other two plans. I will say this on the pricing is that it's like it's very hard for us to figure out how to price this correctly. Like I feel like a lot of the a lot of the AI like what we're trying to do is like we really want people to get a ton of value out of it, but it's very expensive also for us, right? And so we don't know if it should be a subscription, if it should be usage based. I see pros and cons to both approaches. It looks like our competitors also don't quite have this figured out. you know, if anyone listening is like paid Warp customers, just like we're we we're trying to to to do this right, and we're kind of airing on the side right now of like let's let people use it as much as we possibly can, but it's tricky thing to to sort of price right.\n\nAnd we also have the benefit of having access to every model. So, I know you can fall back to Gemini Flash and use that for simple ass and you don't uh have to worry about overages in those cases.\n\nYeah, we give users control on that. I think that's one of the things that people don't want to think about. I think even in Cursor you have like the model picker and people are like, \"Hey, look, I just always want the best model because I'm paying the monthly thing.\" And that's why even with clock code when it first came out, I think it had a way less adoption than it should have because it was only usage based pricing. So people would do something and it was like you pay 5 cents and they would be like, \"Okay, I'm over it.\" And and now that you can use the cloud subscription, people like, \"Oh, whatever. I'll spend a hundred bucks a month on Claw Max and do this.\n\nI don't know if you want to go in the business model. The challenge with the subscription is that um you know for like a $50 a month subscription for Warp Turbo, we probably have some users who are costing us like a,000 bucks or something, and we have some users who aren't fully utilizing it. And so to price that correctly is very is very challenging. But you're absolutely right. Like the the reason we haven't done the usage based just the pure usage based is it feels psychologically like it's like in your face of like it encourages like rationing the usage in a way that I I think is doesn't let people get the most out of it. So I don't really know how to to price it right. It's been a real fun uh business challenge. Well, uh I think the orb guys, you know, have uh they published an online tracket, uh the New York AIE where they have some thoughts on pricing, but yeah, it's something that I think people are actively trying to figure out. I think this is honestly a fun like economics uh challenge for any nerds out there that want to want to get into the pricing and talk to Zach. Just uh one more thing on the team side or enterprise side, you know, like u that was basically the original pitch for Warp. any enterprise AI needs you're you're seeing that maybe individual developers wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't have\n\n\nVisibility into until they hit that size. Just to unpack that question a bit. So the original sort of business model Warp existed before uh LLMs became really good. The original business model was building a collaboration platform around the command line where you would share workflows, you would share notebooks, you could share sessions, all that type of stuff. Postman, Postman for CLI, you know, that's the easy way to think, Postman for the terminal. And you know, we do have uh paying customers who use that very extensively. It's actually really um it's complimentary to the AI in the sense of like all the knowledge that goes into that becomes goes into an embedding space that the uh the AI can access. And so if you have like your like onboarding guide in there or your like firefighting guide or your database migration guide, what's really cool is like you can just ask AI and it'll get it. Now it's not a complete solution, and like the complete solution is like that plus MCP and the other place where I think we can add real value by making MCP configurations sharable, by making rules sharable, like that type of thing. And having the team concept also makes it easier for us to do enterprise-wide sort of like admin controls, which is honestly the probably the biggest thing that they want. They want to enforce that everyone's on a team, that they sign in with SSO, that they use a certain set of models, that there's like different data retention policies in place, and that sort of stuff. And so the team construct lets us do that. And like, you know, we've we've gone through all the work of like being SOC 2 compliant and like all the stuff that you need to do to sell to enterprises, and we have a bunch of enterprise uh customers, which is a big part of our uh future business.\nYou have all the workflows, you have all the keys and everything, right? So, you actually own a very valuable part of that information. I guess my question is, is there a standard gateway that people are using where they they want to, they're like, \"Okay, run every AI request through this thing. We'll track everything because I I need to be on top of my team's uh AI usage.\" That's another enterprise feature where it's like they could be like, I don't know exactly, I'm not sure if I'm understanding gateway right, but they might be like, we have a internal Azure-based OpenAI LLM endpoint, and we don't want you going to the public endpoint. And so we can support that kind of configuration. We can't support like an on-prem type configuration, which some people want.\nEvery enterprise wants on-prem. That's been like an impediment at some places, but not not a huge one at the moment.\nI'm exploring for like what is the state of industry right now. Uh it seems like it's not as secure as it could be, and I see some potential for other founders to like get in there and like do stuff.\nAh, interesting. It's very obvious where all this will go. It's just no one's built it yet. So, yeah.\nYeah. I I think we're we're we're ready to start wrapping up. We had some miscellaneous questions if you're if you guys are are up for it.\nYeah, let's do it. The first thing we saw, both Allesio and I were were texting each other. You're a production GraphQL user. I haven't seen one for four years. What's your take on GraphQL?\nOh god, I don't think I'm going to let Ben take this one. I I'm not coding much against the GraphQL. What, by the way, what are you seeing out of curiosity? Just so I know how to go back to our engineering team.\nWhat do you mean? Old TRPC, like old school APIs? I don't know. Like just not graph.\nOh man, that's tough, cuz I know that more of the complaints about our back end are the fact that we leaned on Golang than the fact that we leaned on GraphQL, which is surprising, mostly because the way we model everything with Agentic tool calls doesn't match to go structs very well. So that could be a cautionary tale. I don't know. But GraphQL, yeah, cuz I come from literally building a framework that included RPC endpoints. It's like I I feature le that a while ago, and it only works if you have the full stack written in the same language and same contract. So I don't know. I feel like for tool calls it kind of makes sense because you can define the structure and return different data, but if we switch to rest tomorrow, I feel like it would still work. So I don't know if there's a spicy Twitter take I need to get out of our engineering team, but I think it's fine. It's not about does it work, but like does it uh bring the benefits that you expected from the extra level of extraction, right? There's a cost, fine, but like there should be a benefit.\nI don't know, cuz I know at the last company that I worked at, the benefit was not there. It was overengineered, and here it feels the right amount of engineered.\nYou could be honest if you've been like...\nI've been working on the front end since joining, that's the tough part.\nYeah, he's the consumer. Consumers are great.\nOh yeah, as a consumer.\nIt's a producer of the GraphQL API. That sucks, like...\nInteresting.\nAnyway, okay, I'm happy to move on.\nI think like there's also the more history of the company, kind of like getting started, the first pitch, pitching Dylan Field. I I know Dylan has been very active also in the AI space and kind of talking about that. Any fun backstories uh that you haven't shared?\nI mean, so the original Yeah. the original like pitch and vision uh was, hey, there's this like tool that most developers use every day, which you know, the terminal, that I think is like kind of hard to use tool, hasn't really changed in a long time, but if you get really good at using it, you can be like an incredibly productive developer. And like all the best developers or a lot of the best developers I've worked with are really good at using it. And so it was like, can we build a better version of that as a product? I think from like a business standpoint, it was like fair, you know, there was like a lot of question marks. Uh I think I got like a good amount of trust from our our investors based on, I guess, kind of based on my background. So I was a I used to be the lead engineer on Google Docs. I was a principal engineer at Google, and um I think that they gave me a bunch of trust. I think it was also like a a weird moment in history where it was like co and prelim.\nFrom an investor perspective, I think it was like a weird, like, what do I invest in at this time? Do I do more SAS? Like people were trying to like pattern match. They're like, oh, there's no collaboration platform for developers around this tool, and like Figma was like, you know, successful with adding, you know, making design collaborative. And so like there was a bunch of that going on. But uh yeah, I don't I don't have any like super specific fun story other than like Dylan is awesome to work with. Uh and has been like super big supporter, especially as things have changed. It's interesting also, like I think Figma honestly is now like in the developer space, like I don't know if you all have tried any of their tools, like they're further up the up the like app building kind of stack, like competing with more with like lovable and Bolt, but it's it's like every company is like building for developers now. It's pretty wild.\nWe have MCP support, trying it out. It's really cool.\nYeah.\nMy Dylan anecdote is, I ran into him. I was like, \"What did you see in in in Zach that like you led like a $50 million round, you know, in a terminal?\" And he was like, \"You know, this guy's extremely cracked.\" Like he wasn't specific at all. It was all by his waist.\nYeah. I guess I mean, I guess the only things I mean, which is a big compliment, cuz he's he's a he's a super, super smart guy. Uh so that's nice.\nHe's basically never wrong. He's just early, and like that's fine as an investor, like...\nBut having like an investor who's a um who's an operator who runs like a real company, like such an awesome like cheat code compared to our institutional investors are amazing too, but like having having Dylan to ask questions to is like incredible.\nYeah. Yeah. But he's like a... like I've never seen like an individual person lead like that until until he did. Too much chitchat on on maybe background stuff. Um, any parting thoughts, call to action for people as as we wrap up the episode?\nI mean, just the obvious one. I'd love people to to try Warp. Try it with like a new set of eyes. Try and do stuff in it uh that you might not have tried to do before. If you're an existing user, if you are a new user, please give it a shot. Give us feedback. It's at warp.dev. It's free to try on every platform, Mac, Linux, Windows. It even runs via Web Assembly and the web. If you want to like get fancy, try it. Give us feedback. I I I'm really, really psyched about uh about Warp 2. I want to hear what people think.\nBen, I know you're uh a few months into Warp. You've done a bunch of stuff. You had a great talk. Uh what what's your plug?\nI mean, one thing I used it for was just to learn some new languages. I was trying to use it to build a Swift app because I touch Xcode with a 10-ft pole. I just do not want to deal with that. And it's totally good at writing like Mac OS desktop apps in Swift. I threw it out on Twitter and my hot take was, I don't know if we need things like React Native in the future because you can just ask these LLMs to translate between different native environments. And people said the training set's not there. It won't perform. And sure enough, Warp seems fine at holding Swift or Rust or Go or anything you're trying. I think that's the big thing is it's really good at languages outside of just JavaScript and React, which seems to be the zeitgeist for all these other tools, but I've been using it for everything but JavaScript.\nThat's a great point. That's actually not our special sauce at all.\nAlthough it's very good at it. Oh, you found it.\nYeah, it riled up the React Native crowd for sure because well, React Native is a really great tool.\nIt's got a lot of engagement, man.\nYeah, I know. Sometimes you have to throw out the weekend takes, otherwise... Yeah, there's my Twitter, BeDev. I do whiteboard explainers on all sorts of technical topics and I put Warp in there wherever I can. So, check them out.\nWe're going to try to amp up video production for in space and I'm going to try some whiteboarding. Not not to your level, but like...\nI I think we should draw things, you know? I think there's like enough podcast where it's like four four guys on a on a Zoom chat.\nOr four guys on Next Cow Draw. You need the physical whiteboard. It's just different. Feels like you're inviting someone in.\nOkay. Well, thank you so much for joining. Thank you for working on Warp. We're we're both uh you know, happy users. I I I'm sometimes grump about it, but I only complain about things I use, right? So, you know, um thank you for Thank you for working on Warp.\nThank you guys.\nThank you. Uh thank you so much uh for having us. This was awesome. Really appreciate it.\nYeah, it was great.\n[Music]\n",
