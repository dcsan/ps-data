  "cleanText": "- Is this, you know, secret sauce?\nAre we sure we want to give it to people?\n'Cause this is the same tool\neveryone at Anthropic uses every day.\n- Hey, I'm Alex, I lead cloud\nrelations here at Anthropic.\n- And I'm Boris.\nI'm a member of technical staff\nand the creator of Claude Code.\n- And today, we're gonna be\ntalking about Claude Code.\nBoris, to start, what is Claude Code\nand how did it come about?\n- Yeah, Claude Code, it's\na way to do agentic coding\nin the terminal.\nSo, you don't have to adopt new tools,\nyou don't have to use new IDs,\nyou don't have to use a\nparticular website or anything.\nIt's just agentic coding, and\nit works wherever you work.\nAnd I think that actually came out\nof the way Anthropic engineers\nand researchers use tools\nto get the job done,\n'cause people have all\nsorts of different stacks.\nIt's super weird.\nThere isn't one normal\nstack everyone uses.\nThere's people that use the Zed ID,\nand there's people that use VS code,\nand then there's people that are like,\n\"You're never gonna take my Vim from me.\n\"Pry it from my cold, dead hands.\"\nAnd we wanted to build something\nthat works for everyone,\nand that's how we ended\nup in the terminal.\n- I see, so the terminal is\nalmost like the most universal\nof all the interfaces\nin that it's flexible,\nand it's incorporated into\neverybody's workflow already.\n- Exactly, exactly.\nAnd it also just happens\nto be the simplest,\nand because it's so simple,\nwe get to iterate really fast.\nAnd that's, in hindsight, it\nturned out to be a good thing,\nbut definitely wasn't the\nintent from the start.\n- Interesting, so if I'm a new developer\nand I wanna be using Claude\nCode, what does that look like\nto actually get this product working?\n- Yeah, it's pretty simple.\nSo you just download it from NPM.\nIt's npm install -g\n@anthropic-ai/claude-code,\nso it's a little bit of a incantation.\nSo you download it, you just\nneed no JS on your system,\nand a lot of people\nhave that and that's it.\nYou open it up, and it'll walk\nyou through everything else.\n- Wow, so you just type\nClaude into the terminal,\nhit enter and then that's it,\nand it's just like Claude will guide you\nthrough the rest of the process,\nand then you can just start talking to it,\nand it'll start coding.\n- Exactly.\nExactly, yeah.\nYou install it and then you run Claude.\nOne of the cool things is\nClaude works in any terminal,\nlike you said, so if you use\niTerm2, or Apple terminal,\nor whatever terminal you use,\neven in a SSH session or\nTMUX session, it'll work.\nOne of actually the top ways\nthat people use Claude Code\nis within ID terminals.\nSo one thing you can do is run Claude\nwithin, for example, VS code terminal,\nand it'll become more powerful.\nSo, instead of seeing file\nedits in the terminal,\nyou're gonna see them\nnice and big and beautiful\nin the IDE itself.\n- Okay, interesting.\n- And we use more signals\nfrom that IDE also\nto make Claude more intelligent,\nbut the experience is the same,\nyou just run Claude in the terminal.\n- Okay, so there's a lot there\nthat I wanna get to in a second.\nBut before we get to that,\nso we released Claude Code in February.\n- Yeah.\n- So it's been about\na little over three months.\nWhat's it been like?\nWhat's the reaction\nbeen from the community?\n- Yeah, just insane, so unexpected.\nBut before we released it,\nwe weren't sure if we wanna release it.\nIt was this tool that internally is just,\nit makes our engineers and\nresearchers so productive,\nand we were having this debate.\nWe were like, \"Is this secret sauce?\n\"Are we sure we want\nto give it to people?\"\n'Cause this is the same tool\neveryone at Anthropic uses every day.\nAnd yeah, I think it turned\nout to be the right decision,\n'cause it makes people more\nproductive, and people like it.\n- What was the moment that\nyou knew we had to ship it?\n- So it started in a small group,\nand it was just a few people\nin our core team using it.\nAnd then, at some point,\nwe gave it to all Anthropic employees,\nand there was this DAU\nchart, so the daily actives,\njust looking at employees,\nand it was vertical for\nlike three days straight.\n- Wow.\n- And we were like,\n\"All right, this is crazy. This is a hit.\"\nAnd then at some point,\nwe give it to a few people externally\njust to see are we crazy, is this useful?\nAnd all the feedback\nwas just super positive,\nand I think it was pretty obvious.\n- Okay, so it really took\nfire within Anthropic first\nand then all the engineers,\nall the researchers\nwere using it themself,\nand that made it pretty obvious for us\nthat we should put it out\ninto the world as well.\n- Yeah, yeah, and that's a big way\nthat we developed this thing.\nClaude Code is written using Claude Code.\nAlmost all the coding\nClaude Code has been written\nand rewritten and rewritten\nusing Claude Code.\nAnd yeah, we're very big\nbelievers in dogfooding.\nIt's so important, 'cause\nwhen you use a product\nthat has obviously been\ndogfooded, you can feel it.\nAnd in the products I use every day,\nI can feel this is something\nthat the team uses all the time\nand this is not, and yeah,\nwe just wanted this to\nbe one of those products\nthat when you pick it up and try it,\nit's obvious, a lot of love went into it,\nand it's something that we use ourselves.\n- Who do you think is the ideal\nClaude Code customer right now?\nWho is using Claude Code?\nWhat type of person?\nWhat type of developer?\n- Yeah, so I think the biggest thing\nis Claude Code is pretty expensive.\nSo, if you're coding on the weekends,\nyou can try it for a little bit.\nSo, you get an API key\nand put in five bucks,\nand you can just try it.\nBut if you want to use\nit for more serious work,\nit'll cost you $50, $100,\n200 bucks a month, something like this.\nThere a big range.\nIt depends what you're using it for.\nBut generally expect maybe\nlike 50 bucks a month.\nThere's a lot of enterprises\nthat are using it,\nso if you're in a big company,\nit tends to be a really good fit.\nIt's amazing at big code bases.\nThere's no indexing step.\nThere's no extra stuff to set up.\nYou just run it, and\nit works outta the box\nfor pretty much every big\ncode base in any language.\n- And what's this\nintegration with Claude Max?\nHow does that work?\n- Yeah, so one thing that we found\nis when people were using\nAPI keys to pay for this,\nthey were a little\nworried about their usage.\nAnd they didn't use it\nas much as they wanted.\nAnd so, we shipped Claude\nCode as part of Claude Max,\nso you pay for the Max subscription.\nIt's like 100 bucks a\nmonth or 200 bucks a month,\nyou get to pick the price point,\nand there's different usage limits.\nAnd you get pretty much as\nmuch Claude Code as you want.\nAnd practically, you're not\ngonna hit any rate limits.\nVery few people do.\nIt's unlimited Claude Code.\n- Wow, so unified between your Claude.ai\nand then your Claude Code accounts\nis just this one subscription package.\n- Exactly.\n- Okay.\nSo if I'm a developer and\nI'm using Claude Code,\nand I have my code base that\nI'm working on on my computer,\nI get into my terminal, I\ntype \"Claude,\" I hit enter.\nWhat happens next?\n- Yeah, Claude gets to work.\n- Okay.\n- So, it's gonna use tools,\nit's gonna go out and do its thing.\nIt's gonna take many steps.\nSo if you've only used coding\nassistants in IDs before,\nand you're used to an experience\nwhere what the assistant\ndoes is it completes the line\nor completes a few lines or\nsomething, it's not this at all.\nIt's super, duper agentic.\nSo, Claude will understand your query,\nand it's gonna use all\nthe tools at its disposals\nso that's Dash, file editing and so on\nto explore the code base, read files,\nget the context it needs,\nand then edit files,\nmake any changes that you want.\n- Wow, so this is maybe a\nnew form factor of coding\ncompared to how we've been doing it\nfor the past 20 or 30 years or so.\n- Yeah, for me, my journey\nfor coding goes way back.\nSo, I've been coding for a while,\nbut my grandpa was\nactually one of the first\ncomputer programmers in the\nSoviet Union back in the 1940s\nor something.\n- Wow.\n- And he programmed using punch cards,\n'cause programming with\nsoftware wasn't a thing yet.\nAnd what he would do is he would take\nthese big punch cards and in\nthe US there was this IBM thing\nthat was sort of the ID of the time,\nand he would use that to\nprogram these paper punch cards,\nand that's how he programmed,\nand he would bring these home every night.\nAnd my mom would tell\nme stories growing up\nabout how she would draw\nover these with crayons\nand for her, that was part\nof her experience growing up.\nAnd since then, programming has evolved.\nSo it was punch cards\nand then we had assembly,\nand then we had these\nfirst high-level languages,\nso COBOL and FORTRAN.\nAnd then we got, in the eighties,\ninto Java and these typed\nlanguages in Haskell,\nand that was really exciting.\nAnd then in the nineties, we\ngot into JavaScript and Python.\nSo, these are interpreted languages\nthat still give you a lot of safety.\nAnd I think about the programming language\nand the experience of using\nthe programming language\nas evolving in lockstep.\nBecause around the time\nthat Java started appearing,\nyou saw, for example, the Eclipse IDE,\nand it had the first\ntype of head features.\nLike you could type a character\nand then you get a dropdown\nand the idea is like, do you\nmean this or this and this?\nAnd it was just incredible.\n'Cause as a human, you didn't\nhave to read the code anymore.\nAnd so I see this as the\nevolution, so this is the...\nLanguages have sort of,\nI think, leveled out.\nAll the modern languages\nbelong to similar families.\nThere's a few big families of languages,\nand they're pretty similar if you glance.\nBut the experience is now really evolving\nwhere now you don't have\nto deal with punch cards\nor assembly or even code,\nyou deal with prompts,\nand the model figures out the coding part,\nand this is just hugely\nexciting to me as a programmer.\n- Yeah, I love that.\nWe've gone from punch\ncards to prompts basically.\nWell I have a couple questions\nfor you on that front later,\nbut before we get into that,\nI wanna talk a little\nbit on the model front.\nSo, up until just recently,\nClaude Code was powered\nmainly by Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\nSo now with the Claude 4 models\npowering Claude Code under the\nhood, what has this unlocked\nand where do you think we're headed?\n- Yeah, maybe a couple months or so,\nbefore the models came out,\nwe started trying them out internally,\nand I just remember my jaw dropping\nat how much more capable it feels.\nSo, I think there's\nall these new use cases\nthat are unlocked.\nwhen you're using Claude Code\nsynchronously in a terminal,\nI think one of the big changes\nis Claude is just much better\nat holding your instructions.\nAnd so you tell it to do something\neither in a prompt or in Claude.md,\nand it'll tend to just\ndo that and stick to it.\nAnd this is a big change,\n'cause 3.7 was kind of a beast.\nIt's an amazing coding model,\nbut man, it's hard to steer.\nLike you try to write tests,\nand it would just mock all\nyour tests and you're like,\n\"No, that's not what I mean.\"\nAnd usually, you say that once or twice,\nand it figures it out, but\nit was just so powerful\nthat it was worth it.\nAnd I feel like now with this\nnew generation of 4 models,\nyou don't have to do that anymore.\nThey typically do what\nyou want the first shot.\nAnd Opus is, it feels like\nthis next level above Sonnet\nwhere not only does it\nunderstand my intent really well,\nbut also, it's able to\none-shot a lot of things\nthat previous models just couldn't.\nSo, for example, I haven't\nwritten a unit test in months,\nbecause Opus just writes my\ntests, and almost every time,\nit'll one shot it\nperfectly the first time.\nAnd this is pretty useful in a terminal.\nIt makes it so it can be a\nlittle bit more hands off.\nBut I think one of the coolest use cases\nis running it in GitHub\nActions and other environments\nwhere you can give a task\nand then the model would just\ngo off and do its own thing,\nand when it comes back with the\nright result the first time,\nthat feels amazing.\n- So, with GitHub Actions now,\nwe can, within GitHub, @Claude\nand then have it go off\nand work on the task in the background\nand then bring it back\nwith a result and a new PR.\n- Exactly.\n- Okay.\n- Yeah, you open up Claude\nin the terminal, like normal,\njust run Claude, and then you\nrun /install GitHub Action,\nand that'll walk you\nthrough this install step.\nThere's a few steps.\nIt's all automatic.\nYou just have to click a button or two,\nand it'll install the Claude\napp in your GitHub repo.\nAnd yeah, the experience is pretty cool.\nSo in any issue, you can\n@mention Claude, just @Claude.\nI use it in PRs every day.\nA coworker will put up a pull request,\nand instead of asking them,\n\"Hey can you fix this thing?\"\nI'll just say, \"Hey\n@Claude, fix this thing,\"\nand it'll fix it.\n- Wow.\n- And instead of asking,\n\"Can you write tests?\"\nI always feel kind of guilty\nwhen I have to do that.\nI'll just say, \"Hey @Claude, write tests.\"\nIt's just not a thing anymore.\n- I mean, that feels incredible to me.\nThat is like an entirely new aspect\nof programming right there,\nwhere we can basically pull in\nyour always on-demand programmer\nto go fix these issues for\nyou, not even on your computer\nbut operating in background.\n- Yeah, yeah, and I\nthink it's the beginning\nof interacting with a model\nlike you would with a\n\n\nFellow programmer.\nSo instead of at mentioning a coworker, I would at mention Claude.\n- How does this change software engineering when we move into that model?\nWe're managing all these Claude codes in the background.\n- I think there's a little of a mental, there's a bit of a mental shift that has to happen where some people really love controlling the code, and if you're used to handwriting code, I think now, the industry is shifting to a place where you're orchestrating agents that write your code, and it's more about reviewing code than handwriting code.\nAnd yeah, I think people have to deal with this transition, and I think as a programmer, it's incredibly exciting, 'cause you can do so much more so much faster.\nAnd there's still some stuff where I'll have to dip down and hand write code, but now I dread it, 'cause Claude is just so good at it.\n- Interesting.\n- And I think increasingly as models get more capable, these windows where you have to hand write code either 'cause it's a complex data model, or it's just something really sophisticated, like the interaction between a bunch of system components or something that's hard to type out in a prompt, I think this will keep receding, and more and more programming will be about orchestrating agents.\n- So I wanna dive into that a little bit more on your type of workflow.\nSo how are you currently using the combination of all these things from the IDE integration to just Claude Code as it is in the terminal to these background actions in GitHub?\n- Yeah, I think there's two kinds of work that I do.\nSome things are really easy.\nSo, for example, writing some tests or making a little bug fix or something.\nAnd usually, I'll ask Claude to do it in GitHub issues.\nOr the other thing I'll do is I have a couple Claudes running in parallel usually.\nI have a couple checkouts of our code base, and so in one of these terminal tabs, I'll ask Claude to do something.\nI'll hit shift-enter to enter into auto accept mode, and then I'll come back in a few minutes, and I'll get a terminal notification when Claude is done.\n- Oh wow.\n- There's a second kind of work where you have to be a little bit more involved, and I think this is still the majority of engineering.\nMost engineering, you can't one shot, it's still hard.\nAnd so what I'll do is I'll run Claude in my ID terminal, and I'll ask it to do something, and at some point, it'll get stuck, or the code won't be perfect or something.\nAnd so I'll go in and edit in my ID to get that last mile of edits, and-\n- I see, so there's this spectrum almost of difficulty of task compared to where you're interacting with Claude.\n- Yeah, yeah, there's a learning period when you first start using this kind of tool.\nI think something people do sometimes is try to use it for too much, and you give it something too hard, and it gets choked up and you're not happy with the result.\nAnd this is a learning that everyone has to go through to get internally calibrated on what can Claude do, what can it one-shot, what can it two-shot, and what's that interaction like?\nAnd unfortunately, it changes with every model, so you can't just run it once.\nEvery time there's a new release, the capability grows, and Claude's able to do more stuff correctly the first time, and so you can ask it for a little bit more every time.\n- Right, I've noticed that just generally, even outside of code where these models are changing so fast and improving so fast that if you were to have tried a model six months ago and wrote it off for a task, it's not correct to still assume that frame in the present day.\nYou almost have to reset your intuitions every single time.\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- Yeah.\nI'm curious for other maybe tips or tricks that you're seeing from usage from devs or from people within Anthropic, what are some cool things that folks are doing with Claude Code?\n- Yeah, I'd say the biggest thing that I've seen power users start to do in an out of Anthropic is ask Claude to make a plan before it starts to code.\nAnd something people will do sometimes when they first start using Claude Code is they'll be like, \"Hey, write this really big complicated feature,\" and then they get frustrated when it doesn't do it the way that they imagined in their mind.\nAnd a really good way to align what you want to do with what Claude wants to do is ask it to make a plan and run it by you first.\nAnd I'll explicitly say sometimes, \"Here's the problem I wanna solve.\n\"Before you code, brainstorm some ideas and make me a list of ideas for how to approach it and don't write any code yet.\"\nAnd Claude will, you know, it'll give me option one, option two, option three.\nAnd I might be like, \"Okay, option one and three sound good.\n\"Let's combine it.\nNow you can start coding.\"\nAnd it's generally pretty good at listening.\nAnother thing to take this to the next level is ask Claude to use extended thinking, and this works best if Claude has some context already.\nIt doesn't work very well if Claude doesn't have any context yet, and it just thinks.\nAnd it's sort of like a human, right?\nYou can think as long as you want, but until you go in and read the code, you won't actually know what it is you're doing.\nAnd it's the same thing with Claude, just ask it to read files first, then pause, and then I'll ask it to think and brainstorm some ideas, and then I'll ask it to code.\n- Interesting, so that sort of interleaved approach where it's able to call out to a tool, think about the results, think about what it needs to do next, and then call another tool and continue that back and forth.\n- Yeah, exactly, exactly.\nAnd we actually see this on internal benchmarks too when we do internal benchmarks of different kind of evals.\nGenerally, if you get context first and then think and then use tools to edit and use Bash and so on, the results are a lot better, and this is what it feels like too as a user.\n- Yeah, tell me about Claude.md files.\nThese seem really powerful.\n- Yeah, Claude.md, we use it for everything.\nIt's Claude's memory.\nIt's instructions to Claude that you want to share across our team.\nIt's instructions that you wanna share across all your projects.\nSo yeah, it's very powerful.\nThere's a lot of different of Claude.md's.\nAnd so, the simplest kind is a file called Claude.md, and you put it in the root of your repository.\n- Just a markdown file.\n- Just a markdown file, yeah.\nCLAUDE in all caps, md, lowercase.\nAnd Claude will automatically read it when you start Claude in that folder.\nSo it'll be automatically read into context, any kind of instructions you want Claude to do every time, so Bash commands that you want it to run frequently or files that it should really know about when making changes or big architectural decisions, anything like that, MCP servers, just put it in the Claude.md.\nThere's a second kind of Claude.md, and this one you check in, and so you wanna share it with your team.\nYou wanna write it once and then share it with everyone across your team, so people don't have to write it themselves.\n- Yeah, interesting.\n- The second kind of Claude.md is just for you, and that's called Claude.local.md.\nAnd this one, it also goes in the same place, and it's just for you.\nYou don't share it with your team.\nYou can ignore it so you don't check it in.\nThe third one is a global Claude.md, and that goes in your .Claude folder in your home directory.\nMost people actually don't use this one, but if you want, you can put any kind of instructions you wanna share across Claudes there.\nAnd then the final one is you can put Claude.md's in any nested file in any directory in your code base.\n- Oh wow.\n- And Claude will pull it in automatically when it thinks it's relevant just to get instructions about working with that part of the code base.\n- So these are, yeah, specific instructions or even your preferences for just coding style or anything like that, about how Claude should interact, what it should know about you, how you like to work, could be anything.\n- Exactly.\nAnd sometimes when I see Claude do something really good or really bad during a conversation, what I'll do is I'll hit the pound sign, and this goes into memory mode and I'll tell Claude, \"Hey, you should memorize this.\"\nAnd it could be an instruction, for example, \"Whenever I make code changes, always around the linter,\" and I'll tell it that, and it'll incorporate it into the right memory file.\n- Interesting.\nI need to do more of that, I think.\nWhat's next for Claude Code?\n- Yeah, I think there's two directions we're thinking about.\nSo, one is how to make Claude work even better with all your tools.\nAnd it started with working with every terminal.\nNow it can work with many IDs, and it can also work with a lot of CI systems.\nAnd we've been thinking about what's next there, just to make sure it works with all the tools you use, Claude should know how to use them, and it should work with the tools natively.\nThe second thing is how to get Claude better at these sort of easy tasks that you may not want to open a terminal for.\nSo what if I could tag Claude in a chat app or something like this and have it fix an issue for me the same way that I can do on GitHub.\nAnd what does this mean, what feels good to use?\nSo we've been trying a bunch of options here.\nWe wanna make sure that it feels really good before we give it to users.\n- That's exciting.\nWell, I'd love to see Claude Code everywhere, so looking forward to it.\nAnd thank you, Boris, for the conversation.\n- Yeah, thank you.\n",
