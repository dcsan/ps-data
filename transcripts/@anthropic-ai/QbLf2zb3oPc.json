  "cleanText": "In this video, we'll examine the diligence competency from the AI Fluency framework.\nRemember that AI fluency means working with AI effectively, efficiently, ethically, and safely.\nWhile the other three competencies primarily address effectiveness and efficiency, diligence focuses mostly on the ethical and safety aspects that are just as crucial for successful AI collaboration.\nAt its heart, diligence is about taking responsibility for your AI interactions.\nIt's the dimension of AI fluency that ensures your use of AI systems is not only productive but also rigorous, transparent, and accountable.\nUnlike the other competencies that primarily focus on getting results, diligence asks us to consider broader questions that are nevertheless critical to AI collaboration, particularly in professional environments, such as what are the implications of working with this AI?\nWho might be affected by what is created or by the collaboration itself or by any missed inaccuracies?\nWho has access to the data used to produce this output?\nHow do I ensure that my interaction and the outcome aligns with ethical standards and values?\nThink about it like driving a car.\nWe don't just focus on getting from point A to point B efficiently.\nWe also consider safety, follow traffic rules, and remain aware of how our driving affects others on the road.\nSimilarly, diligence recognizes that AI systems and our interactions with them don't exist in a vacuum.\nWorking with AI responsibly requires awareness of broader contexts and their implications.\nDiligence begins with becoming more critically thoughtful about which AI systems we work with, how we work with them, and the impacts that come from those collaborations.\nWe should seek answers to questions like, how is this system trained and built?\nWhat data was used?\nWho owns the data I'm inputting right now?\nWho may have access to it once it's shared?\nHow am I protecting the privacy and security of myself and others?\nWhat other impacts does this system have?\nHow does this interaction align with my personal and professional values or with my organization's policies?\nFor example, before sharing sensitive company information with an AI assistant, it's important to first check whether the service has appropriate data protection policies in place or if your organization permits such sharing.\nWe call this type of diligence creation diligence.\nIt is your ability to be critical and intentional about which AI systems you choose to work with and how you work with them.\nDifferent settings, personal, academic, creative, and professional may have different expectations of disclosure about AI interaction.\nHowever, the responsibility is on each of us to understand and meet these expectations.\nAsk yourself, who needs to know about AI's role in this work?\nHow and when should I communicate this?\nWhat level of detail makes sense to share?\nMeeting expectations for transparency, in other words, being forthright and honest, isn't just about following rules and regulations.\nIt's about maintaining trust and respect in your relationships.\nIt acknowledges that people have the right to know when AI has played a significant role in content creation or in decisions that affect them.\nFor instance, if you used AI to help draft a team proposal, letting your colleagues know which parts were AI assisted allows for a more honest collaboration and keeps everyone on the same page.\nWe call this transparency diligence.\nIt's the ability to be open and accurate about AI interaction with everyone who needs to know.\nAs we discussed before, AI systems can make mistakes.\nWhen you share AI generated content with the world, you not the AI are ultimately responsible for its accuracy and appropriateness.\nThis means verifying facts, checking for biases, ensuring accuracy and usage rights, and other checks needed so that you can stand behind what you share.\nConsider a journalist who uses AI to help draft an article.\nBefore publishing, they would need to verify every fact and source.\nEnsure that the final piece meets every journalistic standard, the same standards that would apply had they written it entirely themselves.\nWe call this deployment diligence.\nIt's the ability to take informed responsibility for the outputs that you use or share after they've been created with AI assistance.\nNavigating these diligence considerations isn't always straightforward.\nDifferent contexts and stakeholders may have different expectations and standards.\nSo it helps to develop personal guidelines for working with AI that align with your own ethics and values.\nAnd in professional contexts, familiarize yourself with organizational policies and industry standards.\nAnd remember that the legal and regulatory frameworks around AI are still emerging and will continue to evolve.\nStaying informed is an important part of diligence.\nTo recap, creation, transparency, and deployment diligence work together to form the complete diligence competency.\nBy developing your capacity for diligence, you ensure that your AI use is not only effective and efficient, but also ethical and safe.\nDiligence reminds us that our interaction with AI comes with responsibilities.\nTo be thoughtful about the systems we choose and about how we work with them, to be honest about AI's role in our work, and ultimately to be accountable for what we create when working with AI.\nWe all want AI that is fair and safe and of benefit to our society.\nOur own behaviors play a key role in making this happen.\n",
