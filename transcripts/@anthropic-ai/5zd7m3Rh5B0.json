  "cleanText": "Please welcome to the stage, head of revenue at Anthropic, Kate Jensen.\n\n[Music]\n\nGood morning everyone. Thank you so much for being here today. I'm Kate Jensen, the head of revenue at Anthropic, and I am so excited to welcome you to the future of finance powered by Claude.\n\nI want to invoke a scene that's probably familiar to many of you in the audience today. You're three coffees deep. It's 3:00 a.m. You're furiously checking that last model. You have a 100 tabs open. You have a 5 a.m. prep call ready for a 6 a.m. client call.\n\nToday, that's all about to change. We are so excited to announce Claude for financial analysis. This is the industry's first unified intelligence layer that transforms how financial professionals will work with AI. Now you will have a virtual first class virtual collaborator powered by AI that will help you to get your work done better and faster.\n\nWhat this is is a tailored version of Claude for enterprise. It's specifically built for financial analysts and it's equipped with the nuance, accuracy, and reasoning that you need to handle the complexity of your work.\n\nSince 2021, Anthropic has been building AI systems that are helpful, harmless, and honest. At our foundation is safety and trust, which is exactly what financial services companies need. When you're managing billions in assets, good enough just isn't good enough.\n\nAI is transforming every industry, and nowhere is this more prominent than in financial services. The complexity of modern markets, the velocity of information, the sheer volume of data that you need to process, it has reached a point where human intelligence alone, no matter how great, just isn't good enough.\n\nFrom speaking with many of you, our customers, we're hearing that the world is bifurcating. There will be two types of investment firms: those using AI institutionally and those who are losing their top talent to competitors who are.\n\nOver the past year, we have been partnering with leaders who are breaking new ground across every segment of the financial industry. The teams at Bridgewater have been using Claude since 2023. This is to power their investment analyst assistance which solves complex models. Their CTO tells us that Claude is really powering their efforts to push the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nDown in Australia, Commonwealth Bank is making a massive bet on AI. Their CTO, Rodrigo, sees our partnership as the foundation of their global AI strategy. And here in New York City at AIG, Peter tells us that they have completely reimagined underwriting with Claude. What used to take weeks is now taking days. Timelines compressed more than 5x and accuracy has gone up from 75% to 90%. Underwriters can now serve their customers better and faster.\n\nNow, the solutions we're sharing today, we didn't create alone. They're the result of deep collaboration with the entire financial ecosystem. At our foundation, we have our cloud providers AWS and GCP provide secure, scalable infrastructure that financial institutions demand.\n\nI am thrilled to share that today Claude for enterprise including Claude for financial services is now available on AWS marketplace and it's coming soon to the Google cloud marketplace as well.\n\nWe hear all the time that AI is only as good as the context it has. We're excited to partner with platforms like Box, Databricks, Palantir, and Snowflake to bring your company's data into Claude so that you have the context you need to get work done that's actually relevant to your day-to-day.\n\nAnd today, we are especially excited to announce new integrations to critical external market data sources for informing your most important financial decisions. We're partnering with the companies you already trust. FactSet delivers comprehensive fundamentals and consensus estimates. S&P Global enables access to Cap IQ financials, market data, and transcripts. Dupa provides AI verified fundamentals with source citations. And between Morningstar and PitchBook, you have both public investment research and private market intelligence at your fingertips.\n\nOur consulting service providers are also turning this technology into real business transformation. Deloitte and KPMG are modernizing entire organizations and deploying AI agents at scale. PwC and Turing are solving critical regulatory challenges, navigating constantly evolving compliance requirements and Slalom and Tribe AI are modernizing core operations from migrating legacy Cobalt infra to accelerating due diligence with intelligent document processing.\n\nCollectively, we are building the AI ecosystem that will define the future of financial services. As our head of revenue, my team and I spend all of our time talking to customers and partners. We heard from you how important it was to bring all of this context, both internal and external, into Claude to help you make use of this technology. We care deeply about defining the future of AI and human collaboration, and thank you for your feedback. We are thrilled to bring this solution to you today.\n\nNow, I'm really excited to welcome up to the stage two of our partners who helped to exemplify the power of our ecosystem in action. Peter Lurie is the chief strategy officer at Kensho Technologies, S&P Global's AI innovation hub. He's been defining how AI transforms financial data into actionable intelligence. And Vikram Bhambri is vice chair and financial services industry leader at Deloitte, where he has been helping global financial institutions navigate digital transformation. Please welcome them up to the stage.\n\n[Music]\n\nDid you pick that song?\nYes.\nIt was actually in my writer.\nI love it. Thank you so much for being here. You have both been instrumental in shaping the frontier of AI adoption at your companies. From your unique vantage point, Peter with data and intelligence, Vikram with implementation and transformation, what's the one breakthrough that you've seen that has really created an aha moment at your companies?\n\nSo, yeah, I think I mean for me it's really adoption. I mean I've spent the better part of the last decade trying to get financial services companies to adopt AI and we've had some really great successes with traditional machine learning. I would say in the world of generative AI that conversation is very very different. It's a it's kind of how can you serve us as quickly as possible the data that is in a format that is optimized for these large language model use cases for generative AI and how can I make sure that the data that you're providing is trusted, that it's accurate, that it's kind of foundationally a part of the workflows that we've always that we've always relied on. And so I think for us, you know, the big kind of surprising thing about generative AI has just been the speed of adoption, the rate of adoption. You know, we it has it's it's been very influential on our roadmap. The products that we've that we've kind of foregrounded for us are our LLM ready API, which is the data behind what we've done with MCP, has been we've seen like enormous traction with that. Our clients want to make sure that when they're interfacing with this technology that they can rely on trusted data and data in workflows that they that are already existing that they can then automate and optimize with large language models. And so that's really been a huge surprise. It's going into these client conversations and not saying, \"Okay, but here's what AI can do here. Here's the here's the kind of magic that you can unlock.\" They already know that part. It's now how can we truly make our company or institution or group an AI forward group and also make sure that we can trust the outputs and for that you need you need trusted data. So that that's kind of been the big thing that that we've noticed.\n\nAnd Vic, what about you? As you think about bringing this technology, what are those aha moments that get people to really adopt it?\n\nWe we have really an AI first strategy in everything we do. Some of it is internal in every in every service that we have. We are starting to embed AI, you know, kind of front to back. On the client side, what we're seeing is there was an initial focus on productivity as a key theme of value in through AI. But what is really happening is that is expanding to can we develop new products based on AI? Can we reimagine distribution? Can we reimagine front to back processes? It is really changing the conversation from a pure productivity as a value driver to revenue generation. Can we do better risk and control? Can we drive more employee and client experiences? So, as the appetite and the aperture of value has really expanded, it is really brought AI into everything that does and every piece of the client organization.\n\nI love that. And we'll start with you this time, but what do you think you need to do differently as an organization to make sure that you're really capturing that full value, not just adopting the technology?\n\nYeah. So I'm I'm probably going to give a incorrect non-political answer. In financial services, we are a highly regulated industry. Everybody knows that. So the real challenge is in this battle of I'll say innovation and risk management. How do you coexist in a manner that there's not 20 checkers for one doer and the equation is actually flipped that you actually have more people driving innovation across your organization and you work in coexistence with your audit teams with your model risk teams, you know, all the other players that are necessary in order to get adoption successful. The other example is that AI first strategy that I mentioned. I think more and more clients are actually saying AI is not just about driving 30 to 30 to 50% productivity in the CIO organization or anywhere else. It is really about changing the way we do business and to do that they are how do you actually bring the humans we we have this philosophy of humans and machines coexisting in the age of AI and how do you drive the human change at speed and scale together with the pace of change that's coming through AI?\n\nHow do you think you do that? How do you get them to coexist and adopt at the same time?\n\nI think it is not one answer. There's a number of different levers that one can pull in order to drive that. For example, some organizations have done executive academies where the top 300 executives really drive training. Some are doing hackathons to really think about certain processes or or value streams that they can completely reimagine. There is you know complete AI academies and trainings that are being pushed forward at you know for developers but also for general users. So it's not one lever I think in the end that's going to drive the speed of human adoption of AI. It's a number of things that need to be done together.\n\nLove that. Peter, what about you? What do you think people need to do differently and institutions need to do differently? Well, I think I mean I think that honestly it it comes down to like and I think Vikram touched on it. It's it's kind of a culture thing and I think that a lot of that culture does have to be top down, right? You have to you have to have your leadership teams really buy in to this concept of AI first. I I totally agree with that. I think but part of that top down is to also embrace the fact that in many of these organizations innovation's coming from the bottom up, right? People who are in the trenches doing day-to-day work are surfacing amazing ideas not just for productivity which I think is is oftentimes the focus but for huge expansions of revenue opportunity. I think I think I think that's absolutely correct. You know, I think that it's it's kind of changing a mindset around innovation and I do think a big part of that is understanding especially in our space there are going to be workflows where being maybe a little bit less riskaverse is is really important and being able to create those that room for experimentation is going to be really important. I mean certainly for us at Kensho, right, we we've been able to have that room and and the way that that it works for us is that we kind of operate somewhat independently and as a result we kind of have a little bit more room to experiment but then you know crucially it's also understanding where those boundaries are and where that risk is unacceptable and and and that's I think where for us we've also seen an enormous benefit in in having S&P's trusted data as our kind of foundational core competency. You know, for we've we've been on this journey creating this grounding agent where for us it's ensuring that when a large language model is interfacing with our data that we're taking responsibility for automating where you know where in our entire data universe we're going to pull and and query those data sets and then surfacing that data with citations. And so it's it's both right enabling experimentation but then also making sure that your response is and whatever the output is is truly grounded in in verifiable fact. So I think there's there's a balance there and and creating that trust is is something that's really important to us.\n\nI love that that push to innovate, that desire to really harness all the energy that you have from your organization, but to do it responsibly. That's really at the core of a lot of what we do. Thank you both so much for coming up and thank you for the partnership.\nAbsolutely pleasure. Thanks.\n\nAnd now I'm thrilled to welcome up to the stage my colleague Nick Lynn who leads our product for Claude for Financial Services. Thank you all.\n\n[Music]\n\nAll right. Thank you, Kate. My name is Nick Linton and I lead product for Claude for financial services. I am also a recovering investment banker and private equity investor. So, I was the analyst K mentioned frantically trying to debug the model at 3:00 a.m. while building the pitch deck running on no sleep. That's why I am especially excited to share what we've been working on.\n\nAs Kate mentioned, we're announcing the Claude financial analysis solution. Anthropic's first offering built specifically for finance. Our solution is built on three main pillars of what comprises of an agent. First, the models. Now, something I always think about is that the models we interact with today are the worst they will ever be. Even so, Claude today is not just state-of-the-art for code. Claude has been specifically trained for finance domain knowledge and excels at tasks like data analysis at scale, financial reasoning, and even Excel manipulation. Now the research product flywheel is a critical part of an Anthropic strategy. We firmly believe in working with customers like yourselves to really understand where the models are working, where the gaps are, and to borrow a term we use internally, hill climb to improve the next generation of our model capabilities. The finance agent benchmark published by our friends at vows.ai has picked up a lot of traction in the industry and is well representative of many financial reasoning tasks. You can see Claude Opus and Sonnet far outperform competitors. Similarly, Claude is also very capable of actually doing the work. One of our partners, Fundamental\n\n\nLabs has built an Excel agent called Shortcut on Opus. This agent was able to pass five out of seven levels of the financial modeling World Cup competition and scored over 83% accuracy on complex Excel and financial reasoning tasks. Again, far outperforming competitors. The next pillar of our solution is agent capabilities built on top of these models. Now, model intelligence needs to be translated into something that's actually useful for humans. Claude agent capabilities are flexible and composable and really aim at solving the core problems you all work in every single day, including building multimodal reports like pitch stacks investment memos, analyzing and visualizing data like benchmark analyses or stock price and volume charts, and natively reading and writing Excel and PowerPoint documents. I'm excited to announce that for the very first time, these expanded output capabilities are now in research preview exclusively for select customers of our financial analysis solution. We've also expanded usage limits to really support the deep work analysts work in every single day. And we've integrated cloud code to support use cases like analyzing much larger data sets, Monte Carlos simulations, and risk analyses. Finally, the model intelligence and agent functionalities are delivered through our very flexible platform. Our solution is the first agent with unified intelligence across all the core finance data sources you all work in. As Kate and Peter shared, we're excited to partner with industry leaders like yourselves to build those critical integrations into the agents with many more to come in the future. Importantly, we're delivering white glove finance specific implementation and onboarding to really assist you all with deployment, education, and change management. Now this is of course built with enterprisegrade security and trust. We're sock 2 type2 certified and by default we do not train any of our models on your data. Now our solution is really targeted at solving the problems you all know well. In investing, insights are alpha. The ability to sort through the noise, build a thesis, get to an investment decision quickly is paramount. As we've heard from many of our customers, this is of course true for the sell side and the buy side. To summarize the pain, analysts work in a deluge of documents every single day and spend hours researching into data sources that are difficult to verify. They painfully prepare analyses and tick through models sell by cell, and they manually prepare investment memos and pitch decks, often pulling all-nighters on a tight deal timeline. With Claude, we can start to address all of these pain points. Now, let's show you what that looks like in action. Meet Sarah, a hedge fund analyst at Acme Capital. It's 2 p.m. Her portfolio manager burst into her office with an urgent question, which I think many of you know well. Our target company, Velocity Athletic, reported terrible earnings yesterday. Revenue is down 12%. But somehow the stock price is up 17%. Trading at $71 per share. Our PM needs to know is this rally justified by their new strategy or should they sell into the spike? And he needs an answer before the market closes. Now, let me show you how Claude transforms this typical four to five hour scramble into analysis under 30 minutes. First, Sarah connects her tools. Look at what is available in one workspace. All the tools she works in: S&P Global, Morning Star, Faxet, Dupa, and even her firm's internal box documents. No more juggling 14 different browser tabs. Everything she needs is right here with unified access. Sarah starts a comprehensive query asking Claude to pull from multiple data sources simultaneously. Watch what happens. Claude orchestrates across platforms: S&P Global for transcripts, Morning Star for reports, Box for internal analyses, the Lupa pulling eight quarters of financials. And here's the key. Sarah gets synthesized intelligence, not just raw data dumps. Output full earnings transcript analysis with red flags from Q&A. The CFO disclosing a 400 basis point margin hit from the tariffs. Competitors look like they're doing better. Pace running has been in Vietnam since 2019. And most importantly, you can see full financials linked to the original data source like we're seeing here with the Loopa. So Sarah can verify the results instantaneously. To go deeper, Sarah asked Claude to create visualizations and specific analyses like an annotated stock price chart, comps and benchmarking analyses, and even discounted cash flow model. As you can see, Claude is now pulling key corporate events from SEC Edgar and the web, price data from S&P Global, historical financials from Dupa, consensus estimates from fact set and creates several visual artifacts. First, an event annotated stock price chart showing the 17 SP% spike with all key events marked. Emergency board meeting, CFO stock sale, earnings surprise. Next, a comprehensive comps table. Velocity is trading at 21 times Ebida against peers at 16 times despite having worse fundamentals. And here is where it gets powerful. Claude has built a fully auditable discounted cash flow model with a functional case selector, projections tied to assumptions, and even a perfect whack calculation without needing to be prompted. Now, this DCF model projects a base price of $54, suggesting that perhaps $71 is overly optimistic. Finally, Sarah actually needs to prepare a deliverable for her PM. She asks Claude to create an investment memo using her firm's templates from Box. Claude searches Box for any relevant internal information, including a memo template and any past event driven trades as reference. In seconds, she has a professional memo with an exact sum recommendation to fade the rally, clear rationale with supporting data from market performance and comps, and specific action items and risk analyses, all properly cited. The bottom line, the market is overpricing a complex operational challenge. So, take profits now, buy it back later, cheaper. Now, let's recap what just happened here. Sarah delivered institutional quality analyses in under 30 minutes, a typical process that takes 3 to 5 hours across multiple platforms. So, she didn't just save time, she uncovered insights she might have missed, like the CFO sale or the competitor's existing advantages. Now we believe this is the future of financial analysis where AI fully augments an analyst capabilities where the best insights across all of the platforms come together in one intelligent workspace. Now, one example of these capabilities coming to life is from the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, otherwise known as EMBIN, the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. To share a quote from their CEO, Nikolai, Claude has fundamentally transformed the way we work at Envim. They've achieved 20% productivity gains. That is 213,000 hours back a year to focus on what really matters. That is better decisions and returns for the Norwegian people. As Nikolai put it, Claude has become indispensable. Now, building these solutions requires deep partnership with all of you. Everyone in attendance today will receive a one month free trial to the solution. I am personally very excited to spend much more time with all of you to dive deeper into the problems we can solve together and to shape the future of financial services with both our products and model capabilities. And with that, I'll pass it to my colleague, Jonathan Pelosi, our head of financial services, and our distinguished panel of industry leaders to share their own journeys with Claude.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nThank you, Nick, and to the DJ. Well, I didn't choose that song. I love it. Me put these down. And thank you to everybody for joining us. Hopefully you get a sense of why we're so optimistic about being able to support every one of you and every one of you dialed in on all of your tasks as it relates to financial analysis. But don't just take my word for it. I've got a much more impressive panel that can speak to what they're doing with this type of technology and how they're doing it. And as Nick alluded to, in my role overseeing all financial services for Anthropic, that effectively means we support the biggest banks and insurance companies, hedge funds and asset managers in taking this technology and practically applying it to your firm in a way where you can use it to drive real value and real transformation. And I say practically because all too often we'll read about the theoretical headlines of what this stuff can do and you're like, \"Oh, it'll transform the way we work and it'll improve productivity by 50%.\" But by the time my team and I sit with you, we often pull back the layers and say, \"Well, how do you actually make that happen? How do you actually tailor this to your organization? How do you actually work on change management?\" getting these individuals comfortable with using this technology. Those are the types of things we obsess over and the types of things we're excited to chat further about. So, with that said, I'm going to call up my esteemed panel. If you can come on down and give them a chance to introduce themselves, head on up, gang, and I'll be over here.\n[Music]\nThank you team. We're going to do quick intros uh because I don't think the titles necessarily do justice to all of the AI work they do. And we're going to start with my good friend Michael here. Take it away.\nThanks JP. Uh my name is Michael. I co-head the COO group at uh DE Shaw. that means is my team and I uh work on big firmwide transformation initiatives and there is no bigger firmwide challenge and opportunity that we're spending time on uh right now than AI.\nThank you Michael Lloyd.\nThanks JP Lloyd Hilton. I am an AI lead at HG Capital. So for those of you who don't know us, we are a major PE firm, one of the top 10 largest globally and we're a sector specialist. So we have about 50 portfolio companies in the B2B SAS and services space. Um and we've been driving a major transformation effort with those portfolio companies for the last two and a half years now partnering with the anthropic team.\nDon morning everyone thanks for having us JP. My name is Don Vu. I'm the chief data analytics officer at New York Life. For those that aren't familiar with New York Life, we're Fortune 69 over a trillion dollars of insurance in force. Um and we're one of the largest insurance companies in the world. I'm responsible for our overarching AI and data strategy and its execution.\nThank you, Don. And Frod, last but not least.\nYes. So, my name is Frod. Uh I am I'm part of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. We are a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund uh and uh 70% equities, 30% uh fixed income and and bonds. And we are only 700 employees worldwide. So, we have um uh a single owner, the Minister of Finance, who represents the Norwegian people. I'm part of uh the team here in North America that manages the bulk of the equity assets.\nThank you Fro and I were chatting earlier and I think the stat I think has to be true that per employee no organization manages more money on Earth than MBIM. So it's it's an impressive stat indeed. And for those in the audience, we'll have a chance for you to ask questions as well after I ask a couple to the panelists. So keep that in mind. Uh we're really looking forward to hearing from you as well. But let's start the AI AI investment thesis. Naturally, your big organizations, complicated firms. At what point did this decision to go allin and do this at like a firmwide level take place and who drove that? And for this, we'll start with broad. I'm curious to hear from you.\nYeah, sure. So, I mean, our AI strategy is really to be a leading user of AI in investment management. uh and that just means embedding AI into everything I do I think in in a in a responsible way. Um so that means uh creating efficiency gains, reducing costs, uh enhancing returns and really improving risk management. So I think the what's changed is that we have a coordinated strategy with really dedicated dedicated organizational support um and a dedicated AI team that uh helps out in the in the organization and this is really driven from the top right. So it's uh we have this AI maniac at at the top of the fund uh Nikolai Tongen and uh he is just all in on uh on on the change that we see in society right so his leadership his enthusiasm about AI is really really setting the scene internally in the fund and and driving the cultural adaptation that we see. So I think that's just absolutely crucial.\nThank you Fro. And not surprisingly, this kind of top- down buyin is critical if you're trying to drive adoption and really meaningful change across the I think the Frosborn Nikolai has done an amazing job of that. Lloyd, how about you as it relates to to your firm both internally and with your portfolio companies?\nYeah, so I mean I think that the top down buyin really resonates for for us as well. Um so although we are investors, a lot of our leadership team are sort of technologists um and engineers. Um, so very early on I think we sort of recognized that this was a platform shift. Um, a lot of HG's success has been predicated based on helping our portfolio companies navigate the sort of on-prem to SAS platform shift. Um, we've also been investing in AI for a while. So we have a central data team. Uh, we actually had access to GPT3 back in 2021. Um, so we we've been experimenting with this for a while and I guess when um, you know, the early LLMs were sort of launched around 2022, 2023, we realized this was a pretty major opportunity. Um, I think for us though, you know, people find conviction at their own pace and what really helped was we ran an event in Silicon Valley. So we worked with the anthropic team. We actually had Mike Creger, the CPO, come to speak at that event. And we've fully immersed our execs in this AI topic and got people really hands-on. So for us, that was a that was a real catalyst. Um, and I guess over the last two years, the thing that's really surprised us is just how quickly this has moved. So, we started probably thinking about, oh, no, we can get 10 to 20% productivity gains through integrating AI into our existing processes. What we're now really focused on is fully transforming our portfolio companies with with AI. And we think that there's going to be a huge amount of value uh upside for us and for our portfolio companies through through doing that. So, that's really where the the focus is now. Um, and we've kind of replicated that same approach. So, you know, we got that top down buy in centrally for HG. We're now making sure that we uh create that same catalyst and that same spark for our for our portfolio companies. And we're finding that sort of now permeating pretty nicely through the HG portfolio to drive that that transformational change.\nFantastic. Thank you, Lloyd. And for the folks in the audience, I can imagine this is something on your mind. And for those dialing\n\n\nIn, all too often we hear, you know, should I build this internally or should I buy something out of the box? With APIs now, it's increasingly easy to build really bespoke AI powered solutions. And at the same time, there's a lot of great solutions out of the box. Nicklin just walked through one with you today. So with that said, we'll start with you, Don. How do you think about this notion of build versus buy and basically deciding which path to go? Do you go both? Walk us through that thought process.\n\nYeah. No, I think it's a great question. I think when we first started this generative AI wave, a lot of organizations, especially financial services companies, went through a decision like should we leverage APIs and build our own custom rappers or should we partner with a company like Anthropic and leverage these enterprise solutions? There's obviously trade-offs with those. I think for us we were actually very intentional that you know continuing to innovate on the UI layer and all these different sort of capabilities like canvas and things of that nature connectors etc etc was going to be really challenging. I think companies like Anthropic are just moving at such incredible velocity with respect to innovation. We wanted to ensure that our internal developers and engineers were focused on our most proprietary and specific organizational solutions. So for us, it made a lot of sense to more so partner versus try to build our own custom ones. And let's leave the custom integrations and solutions for those things that are really important for us competitively.\n\nThanks, Don. Michael, how do you guys think about that?\n\nSo for those in the hedge fund industry at least, I think we're pretty well known for having a big focus on building things. We hire amazing technologists and we give them the opportunity to build great things. And so the instinct when something comes along for us is to build the best version of it ourselves. But resources aren't infinite and with great people comes big opportunity cost. And so we always think hard about build versus buy.\n\nWhat I think is different this time, and I think Don alluded to it, is the speed at which the technology is changing and with that speed comes a different balance between build and buy. To be able to build and deploy at that speed and scale that some of what's being offered in the commercial market can provide is often somewhere between difficult and impossible internally. So that shifts our calculus. We're still doing both and we're being extraordinarily deliberate in where we choose to build and where we choose to buy.\n\nFantastic. And yeah, we hear that so often as well when they'll develop a partner will develop an internal AI chat and they'll share a feature that they're particularly proud of and by the time we meet with them you're almost you know afraid to let them know it's like that's already a thing of the past and look at this this and this that's that's already been developed. So I couldn't agree more. Recognizing you're all big firms and leaders in your respective spaces. Another huge challenge we hear about is this change management and driving this kind of transformation at scale. It's one thing that this technology can do cool stuff. How do you actually get people using it? So when you think of like transformation the size that you're operating at and Don I'll start with you. Obviously you've got a lot of employees. How do you think about like practically driving adoption with technology like this when you've got so many different departments employees to to think about?\n\nYeah. No, for us, our AI strategy has been pretty everything everywhere all at once. So, we actually treat our AI strategy as a portfolio of initiatives. So, I think we started with like a lot of folks on targeted use cases specific to workflows or certain business domains. We had measurable value in production and that was great. We certainly realized that we wanted to raise the floor and the ceiling of our aspirations by really democratizing and empower all of our employees with AI tools. And so there's multiple tools that we're really leveraging to do that. And then we're actually also focusing on reinvention. So like business leaders at the top are really looking at each of their respective domains to understand how AI, agentic AI and these new paradigms can actually help us re-anchor our aspirations of how we can transform and the velocity for us to do it. And so for us to do that, I mean, again, very very pervasive, tons of hands-on training and hackathons, all these different things that you actually have to do like get in the trenches to really help people understand what these possibilities are. There's mindset shifts that are related to that that I think maybe we'll touch on later in the discussion, but it really has been kind of a fullcourt press that's complemented by both a top-down commitment from our CEO and his executive leaders, but again this bottoms up sort of empowerment that goes alongside that.\n\nThank you, Don. And Lloyd, you have a bit of a different challenge and you're working with the employees internally, but also of course the portfolios that you that you support. So how do you guys think about scaling this and driving that transformation at the portfolio level realizing that's a lot of different companies you got to help train and educate?\n\nYeah. Yeah, for sure. So I mean I think a lot of what you said resonates Don. So we have 50 companies about 120,000 FTE across those companies. All of our companies look a little bit similar and and mostly you know verticalized software platforms. So what that's enabled us to do is really sort of bring transformation at scale to that group. So that starts with a central effort from HG. We have 20 AI specialists internally supported by about 150 or so kind of contractors and close partners. And we've been really driving that that central change across the portfolio. It's also allowed us to experiment with lots of different tools, lots of different initiatives and really see what works quickly across that sort of laboratory and you know understand what the best processes are. But I think the yeah the top down point has been absolutely critical. So, we've been kind of systematically working with each of the leaders of our portfolio, getting them engaged, getting them hands-on. And then there's also the piece I'd add is that we we're really trying to be disruptive in the way that we think about this. So, you know, rather than retrofitting existing processes and adding some AI, we've re-engineered a lot of our our functions. So, if I take software engineering for example, on average across the the portfolio, we're now measuring about 30% productivity gains in software engineering. We have some companies who have taken their development squads down from nine people to two people. So getting really material leverage. We have one company that's deployed a thousand instances of an agentic software engineer. So they've kind of added 50% productive capacity to their engineering team. And that's the sort of reinvention that we're now sort of driving out across across the portfolio. I should say there what what we're not doing is you know taking out any cost. What we're doing is then re reinvesting in productivity. Basically clearing down tech debt and also building AI products and that's the other key focus for us where we're seeing you know a huge amount of transformational value through embedding the Anthropic API but other solutions as well into our core software solutions and that's adding material growth to some of our businesses already.\n\nThank you Lloyd. And on the topic of change management this also comes up a lot with our partners. How do you think about, hey, this technology, there's a lot about it that scares me and my employees might interpret this as something that could do their work and how do you tow the line there in empowering them to use it while also recognizing that there's some fear on is this going to kind of do my my job for me. So, we we we think about like the cultural implications at the firm and how do you make this a part of the culture? And so Fro, this one's for you because I think MBim's done a masterful job navigating this. How do you and I guess starting from Nikolai, but as you as a senior portfolio manager and your teams, how do you see this fitting into the culture of the firm and becoming just a core part of how you guys operate?\n\nYeah, I mean starting with a top down perspective obviously very important, right? I mean that's really driven it and I think we had focus on tech for a long time. We've been a very techdriven organization now. We've we've taken a journey from moving from our infrastructure to the cloud having data on snowflake integrating cloud for enterprise and being able to really chat with our data and that fits very well with our quantitative nature and our inclination to use data right so I think from a culture perspective is a very good fit and I'd say in my team for instance a lot of us are really introverted right and we like to sit in and and code and and do things and I think just having Claude and having the projects that we can now build assistance and just share and collaborate on it is just really accelerating the the cultural shift that we see organizations. I think that's super fascinating. And I'll also add that being a sovereign belt fund with a single owner. It's just having AI into the organization is just such a massive enabler for us, right? Because we can do a lot of stuff with this technology that others just can't, right? because we're not hampered with you know client and and customer dynamics. So we can we have a really open and and lean organization with a collaborative culture and we're just 700. So this is just fascinating.\n\nFantastic. Thank you for I really I really appreciate that. This idea of like demystifying what this technology is all about at the individual employee level is so critical because so quickly you can address those concerns or fears at you know a cultural level because very quickly they see oh this is just a great assistant if you will it's a great partner when I wake up and I start my role in helping me do my work more effectively. So it's wonderful to hear that example.\n\nYeah I think JP I think it's a great point. I think we were actually very intentional. I think very early on in this journey, folks would talk about, you know, AI is not going to take your job, but someone using AI will. And so, we wanted to really, you know, address that head-on and ensure that as many employees as possible. And we were intentional about every employee having multiple AI solutions and then not just that, but getting like the training involved to help them feel even more empowered. I thought that was really critical to your point to like get through some of the call it the FUD that might be a little bit of a headwind.\n\nAwesome. Thank you, Don. And oftentimes I'll I'll laugh because even when partners ask like, you know, how do I train? How do I build these curriculums to drive adoption? I'll pause and I'll be like, ask Claude. And jokes aside, whether it's Claude or another tool you're using, these tools are very good at that sort of task where you're like, \"Here's my firm.\" And for those dialing in, same applies. Here's my size. Here's what we do. I want to build a simple training program for my employees. Maybe they've got three hours they'll spend over the next two weeks. How would you break it up? What would that training look like? I'm telling you, if you do that exercise when you go home, it'll be a beautiful, beautiful output.\n\nCan I give you a double down on that?\n\nYes.\n\nUh if your staff say, \"I don't know what to do. I don't know where to start.\" Tell them to describe their job briefly. And ask the AI, how ought I start working with this? what are a few things I can try? It uh it actually works wonders.\n\nI mean, I I love that example because I'll even go so far as to say I've got two little kids, for instance, a four and a two-year-old. And if I'm looking for an activity to do on the weekend, I'm not very good at coming up with those. But I'll ask Claude, but I'll do one better. I'll be like, \"Claude, I want you to optimize the following prompt.\" And I'll be like, \"I need to come up with activities for my kids.\" And then Claude will rewrite it. I'll copy paste it. and then I get the world's greatest to-dos. Um, so that's that's another good hack. Ask ask Claude to write your prompts for you. But deciding where to start is another thing we hear a lot about, right? So for folks in the audience, some of you are smaller firms, a lot of your massive firms, but okay, there's a lot. You've heard a lot from this group. Transformation across the or top down leadership. I'm going to start with Michael again here. Where do you for the folks in the audience if we have to start somewhere like what's the use case? what is the first place they start if they're starting with a clean slate? What would you suggest?\n\nSo, it's incredibly tempting to look for a first place to start and my advice would be to resist that temptation. Your colleagues, I don't know that they know more about how best to use the tools. They certainly don't before you give them the tools, but once you give them the tools, they will discover things to do with those that you never imagined. So, we're a pretty decentralized place. We are a place that wants to make every one of our colleagues better using AI. So our core focus off the bat and what I would recommend to others is get really easy to use tools out there. Let people figure out what they're doing and then pay attention. Help accelerate the spread. in some cases centralized as you learn but not as not as your first step. I'll give one concrete piece of advice on that. I think some people will do that. They'll try something, it won't work the way they'd like it to, and they'll abandon it. What we found to be valuable is to encourage folks to come back, let's call it every 6 months. The rate at which the technology and the products are changing is just foreign to most of your colleagues and the degree to which they can improve for a particular use case in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months can sometimes shock them and so pushing them to revisit is one play. We don't tend to be too pushy but that's one place where I think pushiness can pay off. So, I love that because I think to Michael's point, I want to hear from the from the rest of the panel.\nThe notion of starting with one specific use case, oftentimes it can be like, oh, I'm going to build\n\n\nA bespoke analyst or\nrisk mitigation agent.\nWe'll always advise, similar to what\nMichael said, first things first, get\nthis technology in the hands of your\nemployees in a safe, responsible way.\nObviously, you saw we have a solution.\nThere's many solutions out\nthere.\nAnd that should almost always be\nstep one because so often, and I imagine\nthis is true for everyone in the room,\nit's only when you start using this\nstuff, and honestly, that's true in your\npersonal life, it's true at work, that\nyou really start to see what it's\ncapable of.\nI'm going through a process\ntoday.\nI just bought a new house.\nI'm\ngetting home insurance.\nI don't know\nwhen the last time you read a home\ninsurance policy was.\nThey're brutal, and\nthey're like 400 pages.\nAnd I get these\nthree policies, and I'm like, even\ndistilling the difference between\ncoverage and umbrellas and all that, and\nI work with a lot of insurance companies,\nso I should know all of this.\nI just\nuploaded to Claude, and I'd be like, give\nme a breakdown of like what I'm looking\nat here, and I'm sharing this as an\nexample because those same aha moments,\nand it gave me a wonderful answer.\nThe fastest way to create them is to\ngive your employees access to a tool\nlike Claude, and there's again, there's\nother tools out there, but just to get\nit in their hands in a\nsafe and responsible way is huge.\nWith that said, um, I want to go over to\nLloyd as you think about\nadvising this group on they've got\nlimited resources, limited people.\nWhere\ndo they begin?\nDo you have any other\nthoughts on where they should start?\nAnd\nlet's assume for the purpose of this\nthey've already enabled a Claude or an\nAI tool at the employee level.\nWhat's\nnext?\nYeah.\nUm, so I was just going to add on\nto Michael's point.\nI fully\nagree with, you know, revisiting the\ntechnology every 3 to six months.\nThe\nother point I'd add is really investing\nin your sort of prompt engineering or\ncontext engineering.\nI think there's a\nmassive difference between a sort of\naverage user who puts a kind of a lazy\nprompt into Claude versus someone who\nreally thinks about that context.\nSo I\nthink finding those people who sort of\nbecome power users in your organization\nand just have a sort of natural\nintuition for that can really help to\naccelerate if you, you know, put those\npeople up as AI champions that can\nreally drive a lot of change.\nUm, I guess\non other use cases once you've gone with\nbroad enablement, um, I mean, the way we\nthink about that is looking at, you know,\nthose kind of high friction tasks where\npeople uh, do a lot of mechanical\nprocessing that are quite repeatable\nthat are using structured data.\nThose\nare often sort of perfect candidates in\nyour organizations uh, for something like\nClaude.\nSo for us, um, you know, for the\nreally critical decisions where it\nrequires a lot of sort of careful\nthought and system two type thinking, um,\nwe maybe use Claude as more of a\nsounding board, but for a lot of those\nsort of mechanical uh, tasks that happen\nin all of our organizations, it's kind of\nusing Claude plus other automation tools\nto really drive, um, yeah, transformation\nof those processes is how how we\nthink about it.\nAwesome.\nThank you, Lloyd.\nOne of one of\nmy favorite questions to ask, so I'm\nobviously going to ask it here.\nUh, for\nthe purpose of the audience, all of you\nhave a lot of experience.\nYou've kind of\ngone through this.\nYou've applied it in\nyour organization.\nYou've seen a lot of\nwhat works and a lot of what doesn't.\nI'm going to start with Frod.\nUm,\nknowing what you know now, if you could\ndo it all over, what's one thing you\nwould do differently?\nI don't know about what I would do\ndifferent, really.\nI think in in MBM we\nreally nailed it in terms of uh, getting\nit.\nI think it's just uh, maybe just\nstart even uh, even before, right?\nAnd uh,\nstart right.\nI mean, uh, that's what I\nwould say, you know, this is something\nyou just have to lean into and and and\ntake take on.\nSo I think um,\nmove fast and make mistakes, learn from\nthem and move on is really the the key\ntakeaway, and I think if anything is just\nuh, speed there.\nThank you, Frodo.\nHow about you?\nYeah, yeah, I'll lean into the do more\nfaster bit, but um, I think one thing we\nhaven't touched on that I think that we\nfocused on, but looking back, perhaps we\ncould have focused on earlier was this\nnotion of it's a true like mindset and\nculture shift.\nUm, we talked a lot about\ndemocratization and like a tool roll out,\nbut certainly this is more than just\nlike rolling out tools and giving people\naccess.\nIt's like giving everyone in\nAmerica a treadmill and expecting like\nheart disease to be cured.\nUm, what we\nwere very intentional about is\nunderstanding that this is actually a\nmindset shift as well.\nSo I think a lot\nof people look at like a Claude or a\nchat, they see a text box and like, oh,\nthis is like Google, I should just like\nput in one question.\nI'm going to get\nback an answer and then I'm kind of\ndone.\nI think the reality is the the\nthis technology is really designed to be\nmore like a human.\nThis truly is a\ncompanion and a co-pilot, however you\nmight describe it.\nAnd so having a bit\nof a mindset shift and actually helping\nfolks understand that I think is really\ncritical.\nWe've been really intentional\nabout partnering with um, folks from the\noutside to help our executives\nespecially on that journey.\nUm, one\nanalogy we've used is, you know, if\nyou're going to Costa Rica with your\nfamily, you could go to Google and ask\nfor some recommendations or you could\njust prompt Claude or Chat PT and say,\n\"Hey, you are the Costa Rica prime uh,\nyou know, head of tourism.\nI'm going to\nCosta Rica with my family of four.\nMy\nkids are 10 and 12.\nOne likes surfing,\nthe other one likes, you know, wildlife.\nCan you come up with a customized\nitinerary?\"\nAnd so that's that's a very\ndifferent sort of paradigm between those\ntwo tools.\nAnd frankly, for most folks\nthat, you know, first start to engage,\nthat's kind of where they start.\nBut we\nthink it's really important to kind of\nhelp people on their journey.\nAnd if I\ncould have, if we could go back, we\nwould maybe even started that even\nsooner.\nSo,\nthank you, Don.\nHow about you, Lloyd?\nYeah, I mean, I think I'd echo Frodo.\nWe\nare running at this very fast at HD, and\nI like to think we're we're sort of\nahead of the curve.\nWe were building our\nfirst AI products back in 2023, but if I\ncould say one thing, it would be run\neven faster towards this.\nUm, just the\nyou know, the exponential rate of\nimprovement of models and the ecosystem\nthat's developing around that is uh,\nfrankly unprecedented.\nSo yeah, I would\nhave said, um, you know, run even harder\neven faster.\nMichael.\nSo we're pretty relentlessly data driven\nand one thing we do is we look at the uh,\nusage intensity across the firm and what\nyou see is a logn normal curve something\nlike this and the theoretical\nunderpinning of that is it it describes\nprocesses that are roughly the more you\nuse it, the more you use it.\nSo they're\nmultiplicative.\nAnd if you combine that with this\nbottomup view, what you want to do is\njust encourage people to take more bites\nof the apple.\nSo here are two things\nthat I do to to help make that happen.\nUh, one, uh, at a lot of my team\nmeetings, I just make people do a\nlightning round of some strange AI thing\nyou tried in the last week.\nIt worked,\nit didn't work, but you know, 30 seconds\neach share with the team.\nUm, and two,\nand this plays off something you said,\nthe route to comfort and learning about\nhow to use these at work doesn't have to\nonly run through work.\nAnd often people\nare more comfortable taking risk in\ntheir personal life.\nUh, it's not as\npotentially embarrassing at least in\ntheir minds.\nAnd so encouraging people\nto experiment there I think can pay off\nuh, as much or more than encouraging them\nto take those first jumps in the\nworkplace.\nYeah.\nNo, I I could not agree more and\nthat's a huge, huge\nI think benefit to\ndriving adoption for everyone here today\nand dialed in.\nIf I had to recap what we've talked\nabout today is enable.\nSo give your\nemployees access to one of these tools.\nTrain.\nYou don't have to be a master\ntrainer or you know a buy a\nmillion-dollar training program.\nYou can\nwork with some great partners which\nwe've touched on a few of them today\nand you can use a Claude to help you\nbuild a training program to give them\nbaseline training.\nI'm not talking about\n100 hours here.\nBaseline how to prompt\nhow to interact with these tools\nmeasure.\nThere's to Michael's point now\nI think he's doing it in a really great\nnatural way.\nLet's do a speed round at\nAnthropic.\nYou can imagine it's like we\nare monitoring in a way are you using\nthese tools to do a better job and like\nyou're actually tracking that because\nwhether or not you use them it's making\nsure you hold your employees accountable\nfor building that muscle\nand getting used to using it.\nI'll share\na personal anecdote in closing and\nMichael touched on this.\nSometimes folks\nare more comfortable\nusing this technology in their personal\nlives to see what's capable of them\nwork.\nI have a 2-year-old son who has a\nlot of medical\nconcerns\nand the in learning to navigate what his\nchallenges were and what we could do for\nhim.\nThe hospital sent over,00 pages of\nnotes from the NICU\nfrom our neurologists\nand it's very hard to make sense of all\nof it.\nSo even when you talk to\ndifferent doctors, it's they all give\nyou different answers.\nAnd\nI took all of this and I upload it to\nClaude.\nI go, \"Help me understand what's\nhappening here.\"\nAnd I took that timeline and I'm not\nsuggesting Claude's a doctor by any\nmeans.\nUm, I just took that timeline,\n1100 pages by the way, PDFs, and I took\nit back to our doctor.\nI'm like, \"Does\nthis seem right?\nHelp me understand what\nhappened here and what I can do about\nit.\"\nAnd literally the doctor's jaw\ndropped.\nHe's like, \"How did you come up\nwith this?\"\nAnd I'm not sharing that\nstory because look how great Claude is.\nI'm sharing that story because in\nmoments like that when it has such a\nmeaningful impact on your life\npersonally, you can see my inclination\nirrespective of working in a company\nlike Anthropic to try using this\ntechnology in work goes up dramatically.\nSo as a takeaway,\nif you don't have one of these apps,\nthese AI apps in your phone today, I'm\ngoing to say step one, use it.\nSet a\ngoal for yourself.\nUse it.\nI don't care\nif you're taking a photo of a tree or\nyou're analyzing life insurance\nstatements or policies.\nUse it a couple\ntimes a day.\nBuild the muscle and in\nturn you'll be better equipped\nto do that with your own employees.\nSo I\nwant to say a big thank you to our\npanel.\nI really really appreciate it.\nThank you for everyone who dialed in and\njoining us today.\nAnd for those seated,\nstay put because we'll have a chance for\nquestions.\nBut a big\n[Applause]\nAnd now we'd love to hear from you.\nSo\nwe have I think Mike's going around.\nUh,\nI see a hand up here.\nLet's start.\nTake it away and please introduce\nyourself and let us know where you're\nfrom so we have some context and fire\naway.\nHey, good morning.\n[Music]\n",
