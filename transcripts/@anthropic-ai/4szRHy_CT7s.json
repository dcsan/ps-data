  "cleanText": "Let's begin our exploration of the AI fluency framework that is central to our learning over the rest of this course.\nWhat does it really mean to be fluent with AI?\nWhy does it matter?\nWe're living in a fascinating moment of technological change, one that brings both excitement and uncertainty.\nAI is reshaping how we communicate, create, learn, and solve problems in both our work and personal lives.\nMany of us now have versatile assistants and virtual collaborators at our fingertips that can help with writing, brainstorming, researching, decision-making, and much more.\nBut here's the thing.\nHaving these powerful systems doesn't automatically mean we know how to make the most of them or to engage with them responsibly.\nThink about a time when you got an unexpected response from an AI and you weren't sure how to proceed.\nOr when you struggled to explain exactly what you needed and left the interaction feeling frustrated.\nOr perhaps you've wondered if the information you're sharing is being properly protected.\nAll of these moments highlight the gaps between simply having access to AI and truly being fluent with it.\nSo, how do we move beyond just knowing a few prompt tricks to developing a thoughtful and responsible approach that will continue to serve us well as AI keeps evolving?\nWhat exactly does AI fluency look like?\nAI fluency isn't just about being a technical expert or memorizing the 10 best prompts for whatever trending task is popular this month.\nIt's about developing a collection of practical skills, knowledge, insights, and values that reinforce each other and adapt as the technology changes.\nAt its heart, AI fluency means interacting with AI systems in ways that are effective, efficient, ethical, and safe.\nIn other words, really maximizing what you get out of your interactions with AI without wasting time and energy and in an honest and responsible way that protects the privacy and security of yourself and others.\nThrough our research and personal experiences, we found that there are three main ways people engage with AI.\nUnderstanding these modes helps us to see why AI fluency needs to go beyond simple prompt engineering.\nThe first way we interact with AI is through automation, where an AI assistant completes a specific task based on your instructions.\nFor example, you might ask an AI to summarize a document for you or draft an email or create an image or plan a trip itinerary.\nYou define what needs to be done and the AI executes it.\nAnd it works well when you have a clear outcome in mind.\nBut it can be challenging when you're not quite sure yet what you're actually looking for.\nThe second approach is augmentation where you and the AI assistant collaborate and complete a task together.\nThe AI isn't treated as a machine to automate a task.\nInstead, it becomes a creative thinking and problem-solving partner.\nFor example, imagine you're developing a character for a story and you're feeling stuck.\nYou might explore this through a conversation with the AI assistant, bouncing ideas back and forth, elaborating on backstories, experimenting with dialogue, and otherwise refining that character.\nOr perhaps you're working through a difficult architectural problem with an app that you're building.\nOr maybe you're trying to formulate your thoughts on a complex research topic.\nIn these moments, the AI augments your creativity and thinking.\nIt doesn't do work for you, but helps you do your work better.\nThis approach works best when solutions aren't straightforward and you need space to explore and experiment.\nThe third mode is agency, where AI works independently on your behalf.\nFor instance, you might set up an AI assistant to categorize incoming emails by topic or urgency and maybe even begin drafting responses to the most urgent ones.\nOr you might create an everchanging interactive experience for visitors to your website or power a dynamically interactive character in a game.\nThe key idea is that rather than defining specific actions, you're establishing the AI's knowledge and behavior patterns.\nYou become less like a script writer giving exact directions and more like a director setting a vision.\nNone of these approaches are inherently better than the others.\nThey serve different purposes and excel in different situations.\nIn fact, you might even use all three in a single project.\nWhile many start with automation, we found that augmentation and agency are approaches that really take advantage of the unique capabilities of AI and that these modes often lead to the most creative and effective solutions.\nUnderstanding these differences helps us recognize that AI isn't just a tool.\nIt's a technology that can act as a tool, but also as a medium or as a partner or co-creator and sometimes all of these at once.\nAnd this shift from mere tool to powerful collaborator gives technology a new role to play in our creative and problem-solving work.\nWhich means we also have new roles and need to adapt and develop new skills.\nThese skills are what we describe in the AI fluency framework.\nWhichever way you engage with AI, there are four key areas of competence to develop and master.\nThey form the core of the AI fluency framework which we'll explore over the rest of this course.\n",
