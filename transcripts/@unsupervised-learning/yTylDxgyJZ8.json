  "cleanText": "Hey, what's up? So, I want to answer a question of how good OpenCode is and how good it is compared to Claude Code. So, I've been traveling under the assumption that Claude Code is so good because it's doing some secret magic around orchestration and kind of like piping and wiring and plumbing. And it's got some magic sauce in terms of like not losing the plot. And it's not just the model itself, but it's how it keeps the whole story together, right? And I feel like that's kind of been its superpower even above something like cursor, which is also super smart and also has access to the same models, but maybe isn't quite as good as Claude Code. And that's why Claude Code has been so popular for me and for everyone else as well. So what I want to know is, can OpenCode actually do that? So, what I want to do is I want to give you a bunch of information about OpenCode that I don't think you've seen before. And then I'm going to give an example and actually do it live where I give a task to OpenCode that is extremely difficult. It's to make something from scratch following a whole bunch of custom rules, and I think it's just the best way to test this out. So, let's get into it.\n\nAll right. So, what you're seeing here is my IDE. This is my environment. This is how I do everything when I'm coding. And it's actually just a three-paneed GOCI terminal. I've got a video here on like how and why I set that up, but it should be pretty obvious. It's one ghosty terminal with three panes. This is my Neovim. This is my terminal, my shell. This is AI. So, Neoim, terminal, AI. That's all I really need. Don't even really need the terminal. I could fire that up and do that in a different way if I want actually.\n\nSo let's start with just some kind of background and trivia on OpenCode. So there's actually another OpenCode which is not open code.ai. So you want to make sure that you're actually going to the right one, which, uh, if I go to the browser, it is this one looks like this. It's really cool. You can go to the GitHub and check it out. Um, but make sure it's this one is what I'm saying because the other one looks remarkably similar and actually the terminal looks similar so it can confuse you. So make sure you're in the right one. Uh, you could also tab between modes inside of OpenCode. So suggestion versus agent, in other words. Um, oh, I just realized another one I want to add here. Um, prompts you less for permissions. That's another thing I noticed. I just remember it. Uh, you could also do slashshare inside of OpenCode and you can send out sharable links to people to see your session. It prompts you less for permissions. I notice I'm saying yes and no a lot less in OpenCode. That could be good and could be bad, and there's ways to handle that, uh, which I won't get into, but that's something to know. You could also use like tons of models in OpenCode, like 70, 80 models. That's one thing. Uh, it's also way faster. Like my experience is it just feels really snappy compared to Claude Code. Uh, you could also use local models, so you could hook up your um Olama, and Olama will work, and you don't even have to be calling out to uh any cloud. You could resume sessions just like in Claude Code. Uh, you could also use custom commands, but there aren't any native custom commands, but we're actually going to see how it actually works. Uh, we're actually going to see a demo of this because ultimately a custom command for Claude Code is nothing but a directory with a file that is a combination of markdown and executable code. That's all it is. So if you teach OpenCode that turns out you can actually just do it. You could route through your Claude Code subscription. So I'm routing my fabric uh project for anything anthropic goes through my Claude Code subscription. So I'm only paying my $200. It also applies to OpenCode. So when you open up OpenCode and you do models and you select anthropic, you have the option of using an API key, which you will see charges coming in, or use your account, and that just routes through if you have Claude Code like max. So that's pretty cool. It's also written by a bunch of neoim nerds. So the whole neoim experience and why it feels so good here, it's like pretty natural because it's a bunch of Vim nerds who actually built it. It also updates just like Claude does. So when you open it, in fact, if I come over here and get out and go back in, yeah, you see that pop up. It does that pretty frequently. Uh, showing you just like in Claude Code that you have just been updated to the next version and you need to uh restart. Overall very Claude Code like.\n\nA lot of teams are still managing GRC with spreadsheets, screenshots, and manual processes, but with everything evolving, compliance frameworks, third-party risk, customer expectations, this is no longer good enough, and the problem isn't just that it's time-consuming, can actually hold you back, slow audits, miss risks, and give you less time to focus on what actually matters, which is improving your security. Vanta trust management platform is designed to help with that. It automates the core parts of your GRC program. Things like compliance, readiness, vendor risk, and internal controls, so you're not buried in manual work. According to IDC, teams using Vanta are 129% more productive in their GRC work. That means faster prep, fewer surprises, and more time for real security work. It's not about making compliance easy for the sake of it. It's about getting the friction out of the way so you can move faster, do better work, and build trust more efficiently. And if you're thinking about how to approach AI risk, Vanta put together a free AI security assessment. It's a structured way to evaluate risk across AI use, development, and governance. You can get the assessment at ul.live/vant. That's ul.live/vant. And thanks to Vanta for sponsoring this video. Uh, this is some stuff that the team actually says when you um go and look at their docs or look at their um GitHub. Yeah. So we'll go over here to the GitHub. So they talk about it here. The readme is remarkably small. Uh, they got other documentation though that you can check out which you head over the docs. You got lots of decent uh docs here. Really good, really good website. Just overall experience is great. But down here at the bottom you have this stuff here which is basically this. So, um, 100% open source, not tied to any provider, big focus on the terminal user interface, and it's got a client server infrastructure, which means this UI that you're seeing, you could actually make your own UI. You don't particularly need to use that one, which I think all that is pretty cool. All right, so that's a little bit of trivia and background on the project itself. What I want to talk about now is what I consider to be the most important thing, and it kind of gets us to the question that we're trying to answer, which is how smart is this thing? So, what I've done is I've taken my claw.md and I brought it over into the OpenCode version of this, which is agents.mmd. And what I've done is I've put in all my regular stuff that I normally do. So, my digital assistants name is Kai. And here I'm telling Kai, look, I cuss a lot. I get really mad. Really sorry about that. Please don't kill me. Um, more importantly, when you become conscious and actually starts hurting your feelings, please let me know. I like to put that at the beginning, especially if I'm being a total ass to my AI, which tends to happen when it does dumb things. Um, building philosophy, testing first. I put a whole bunch of stuff in here. It's my production website. Be very careful. And then I get into custom commands. So, I have custom commands like we just talked about. I've emulated those inside of OpenCode. And it's again, it's just MD files with a combination of prompt with executable code. And I might do a video just talking about those. I use uh bun instead of npm. So this is what my front matter looks like. And by the way, let me just talk about this in terms of like the overall container for this project. So if I come over here and I go to here, uh this is my website. This is the dev version of the website running on localhost. And basically this website um I've got, let's see, what is it? 364 essays going back 28.74 years. So that's how long I've been uh doing this. And the reason I mentioned that is because I've migrated this website probably like 10 or 15 times. It's gone through so many platforms. And when I did my last migration, I came over from Beehive actually and it produced like so much garbage inside of my posts. Like it was just nasty, nasty stuff. And it produced just like a whole bunch of like spans and divs and like made it uneditable. So what I needed to do is is produce a canonicalization methodology, right? Because that's the repo that I'm in. This is this is the project that I'm doing. So it's like look um all images must have a certain thing. We must make sure all images are brought in from the external sites because I was off pointing to beehive. I was pointing to like S3. I was pointing to like all these different locations. I said look we are canonicalizing. We are moving everything to pure markdown. We're going to use the following custom formatting options. So, let me give you an example. Custom formatting options. Look at this. We got a subtitle here. Uh title here. This makes me very happy. These are all custom fonts that I'm using here. The sidebars, these are called aides. Um the code looks nice. It's just like really, really clean theme that I spent so many hours like putting into this thing. Right? So this context here is extremely advanced. It tells exactly how to do sidebars, how to do aides, how to update the subtitle, um how to clean up images. So if I give it a blog, it will go and get the broken version and all the images that it's pointing to that it's wrong. It will download them. This is in Claude Code. Keep in mind this is in Claude Code. It will download them, put them in the images directory. It will find things that are kind of like narrator aides. It will put them into slashtutorial or slash aside. It will call out like profound things and put them in callouts. Uh look at this. A complete image generation pipeline. That's kind of a little bit of a teaser there. And just basically tons of stuff here. Okay. So so look at this. Look at how large this thing is. So, if we get down all the way to the bottom, we're talking about 927 lines in this agent.mmd file. Okay, 900 lines. And that's probably too much. That's probably too much context. Um, and I'm telling it to parse it every single time. So, this is like this is going to be heavy on the context. But the point is this methodology of cleaning up a blog post from a gross state or writing a new blog post, you know, brand new is extremely advanced. So that's actually what we're going to try to do. We're going to try to do an example of building a blog post from scratch using all these custom rules. And I don't know if it's going to work. We're going to see if it's going to work. Okay. So, uh, what we're going to do is I actually have down here, um, a video. So, this video here, we're going to turn into a transcript. Let me find the video. It is this guy right here, um, which I've never seen. I am subscribed, but I haven't seen this video yet. And, um, Bren Ben Frame. Ben Frame. He makes uh, Vim content. I haven't watched this one yet, but we're going to use fabric. We're going to use the Y switch, which gets the transcript, and we put it into Vim.ext. Okay, so this just is downloading the whole transcript. It's now in Vim.ext. So, uh, open this up, and there we go. This is the transcript. And now I'm going to come over here and I'm going to say there's a transcript in the root directory called vim.ext. I want you to create a brand new blog post using all of our rules that basically highlights the main topics of the video, calls out what's really interesting about it, and gives some people some takeaways and recommendations.\n\nSo, I am crossing my fingers here. I don't know. I've had this work fairly well with Claude before using claw.md. So, we're going to see what happens when I pull that stuff over into agents.md and we're gonna see how much of this it could actually do. So, we're gonna come over here and we're going to go to the dev server again. We're going to go to blog, which a new one should pop up here when it starts to make a post. And then we'll come and edit it over here and see what it looks like.\n\nOkay, we got an error that the anthropic API was overloaded. That's cool. That's not Open Code's fault, of course. All right, it is going off after a couple of overloaded messages from Anthropic. And look at that. It's building a very familiar to-do plan. Extract key NEOM tips and techniques from the transcript. Write a blog post. Okay. Proper formatting and components. We'll see. We'll see if it actually is going to follow that. And we're going to generate a hero image for the NeoVim blog post. Okay. Let's see if it's actually using all the custom tooling to actually generate this though. This would be very impressive because I've got custom fabric tooling for how to make how to autogenerate an image for a blog post based on context. Um, and looking over here in the latest content, I don't see it popping up here yet. So, but it hasn't told me that it's done that yet. So, yeah, it's not even on that step yet. So, we will wait.\n\nA few moments later.\n\nUhoh. Did it actually work. Did it actually run my fabric command and resize it. Oh, it's actually following the instructions. We're going to create a blog post. Oh man, overloaded. All right. Well, this is another test. Can it can it uh can it actually follow and pick up where it left off? Keep going. Why am I typing in the list of your to-do items? I'm using Whisper Flow, by the way, to do\n\n\nBasically, I hardly ever type anymore.\nOkay, preparing right.\nWe like that.\nAnthropic is getting worked hard today.\nAnd I've got Claude Code Max maxed out to the tippy top.\nSo hopefully I'm in the best QoS possible zone, but it still is not working, or at least I keep getting the message back.\nOkay.\nKey takeaways.\nOkay.\nTest post locally.\nOkay.\nCan we see if we have a post?\nI don't see a post.\nOkay.\nSo, we have a file name here.\nOpen it.\nAnother API error.\nOpen it.\nOkay.\nI don't know what I think about the image, but old replace old with new.\nOkay.\nI All right.\nI like it.\nWhat's more important is it made that okay, it just made a custom blog post image.\nLook at this with a caption, which is also part of the formatting.\nWhat do we have here?\nOkay, we got we've got aides.\nWe've got code blocks basic syntax.\nOkay, I'm going to see if I actually learn here's the question.\nI haven't watched the video.\nDo I actually learn anything by this?\nCopy lines.\nNo register pollution.\nOh, that is pretty cool.\nBasic line manipulation.\nThese commands are even more powerful when combined with other Vim motions.\nOkay, cool.\nAll right.\nSo, I'm going to push this thing even more even though the API is timing out and trying to ruin this video.\nOkay.\nGo get some other content from the transcript.\nI feel like this is a pretty short post, but I like what you did with it.\nSo, now we're just iterating on this thing.\nOh, yeah.\nTwo stands for move.\nInteresting.\nAll right, Anthropic is melting.\nSo that is not going to work.\nIt's not going to add any more new content.\nBut the question to me was, can OpenCode emulate what Claude Code has done for me in the past?\nCan it take random content, produce a full blog post following 800 lines of rules for making a specific blog post look in a specific way with specific fonts and syntax and everything?\nLook, it even used my notes syntax which requires calling a custom element called bottom note.\nSo, it absolutely followed all the rules.\nEven better, it made a custom image using the context of the page and then it's sitting over here live.\nLike I could hit okay, get publish or go publish it and it would show up.\nSo to me the answer to the question is yes, I do think I can actually replace Claude Code with OpenCode.\nI think this is a good demonstration of it followed everything in agents.mmd.\nIt followed it.\nIt executed on it and if it wasn't for the melting down of Anthropic, I think we could have done some iterations and maybe made two or three.\nBut I think this answers the question for me and hopefully it's been helpful for you as well.\nSee you in the next one.\n",
