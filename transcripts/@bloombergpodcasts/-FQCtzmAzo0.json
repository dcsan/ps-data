  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\n\nWelcome to Merryn Talks Your Money, the personal finance edition of Merryn Talks Money. In these bonus podcasts, we talk about the best strategies for making the most of your money. I'm Merryn Somerset Webb, and with me senior reporter and money distilled author John Stepek. Hi John.\n\nHi Merryn.\n\nRight, this week we are tackling a topic suggested by Tala, an apprentice here at Bloomberg who's been working on our team the last few months. Tala is in her early 20s and says the surprisingly frequent topic among her friends is credit scores.\n\nI don't really have a credit history yet. How would my credit score be determined? What factors go into determining my credit score? And how do I even check my credit score? I've noticed that when I check my credit score on different websites, they vary. Why is that?\n\nI'm a bit lost by this one. I literally do not remember ever talking about credit scores in my 20ies, John.\n\nUm, no. But then we were privileged cuz the '90s were a much better time for young people in general. We didn't have to worry about money, did we? Really, cuz everything was so cheap.\n\nYeah, we could buy houses.\n\nYeah, we could buy houses.\n\nOn the plus side, the fact that that Tala and her friends are caring about credit scores, maybe they're taking out mortgages. We'll talk about that later. Anyway, so the question is, how do credit scores work? What are they? Do I have one? Do I have several? How important is it? What does it mean? What affects it the most? And how do I make it good? So, lots of questions here, some of which John and I could answer alone, some of which we quite clearly couldn't. So, we brought an expert to help us go through all the basics of this subject, John Webb. John is the senior consumer affairs manager at Experian. John, thank you so much for joining us today.\n\nOh, glad to join. So right back at the beginning, what is a credit score?\n\nThere is not one credit score. So your credit score is a number that is given to you by a credit reference agency like Experian and there are others as well. Equifax and TransUnion are the other two. So there's three main credit reference agencies and we will all give you a number and it's a summary of the performance of your credit report. So all the information that's on there, how you've managed credit in the past 6 years or so and how much debt you are in for example right now and the number gives you a good indication of how a lender will judge the information on your credit report when you apply for credit.\n\nOkay, so this is a number. What is a good number and what is a bad number?\n\nWell, that's an interesting question because there is not one credit score. Don't judge the numbers side by side. Each credit reference agency will give you their own experiences out of 999. So we will give you a banding to say you know somewhere along the lines of you're somewhere in the good or very good or excellent category for example and your number just summarizes and gives you a really good indicator of where you sit on that banding. And you know that that's how a lender will really look at that information and say okay you know what we do think that's good and that's how we base that number.\n\nOkay so you're out of 999 Equifax and TransUnion are out of different numbers. So Equifax I think is out of a thousand and TransUnion is slightly lower out of 710.\n\nYeah. Well don't compare them side by side. It's good to check them all and you can do it for free. So you know please do uh but don't compare them side by side and say right my Experian score is this why is my TransUnion score so low just view them individually and see how you sit on the banding with those credit reference agencies.\n\nOkay and do any other organizations have credit scores for us? I for example does my bank have a credit score for me? Does my mortgage holder have a credit score for me? Are there other numbers around the place that aren't with these three main unions?\n\nYes. Well, just to make this, you know, even easier for you, there are different numbers, but you will not ever see those numbers. The only time the the other number is generated for you is when you apply for something. So, you'll apply, they will check the information on your credit report, plus your application form information. So, really, your affordability, your salary, dependence, other expenses, and so on. And perhaps if you bank with them already, their own information. And at that point you apply, they'll generate a score for you. That's the score that determines do you get accepted or not? What's the interest rate going to be? What's the limit going to be? But they don't tell you what that number is. So, you know, you'll know you were good enough if you get accepted and get the good rates. You'll know you were borderline if maybe the interest rate goes up a bit at the end or you don't quite get the limit you want.\n\nOkay. All right. Very useful. Then I suppose the next obvious question to ask is how are those scores built? What goes into the building of the score? What what are the agencies looking at?\n\nThe score is built on lender feedback. So they tell us the credit reference agencies what's important. So you know what's important in terms of your payment history if you've made them on time or in terms of the amount of debt you have, missed payments, court judgments. There's lots of information that goes into calculating the score, but it's based primarily on how we work with and experience hundreds of lenders to figure out exactly what's important and how we build that score.\n\nOkay. So, your score will be good if you have borrowed money, always paid it back on time effectively.\n\nYeah. A good track record of managing credit. So, you've you've had some sort of credit agreements in the past. you've paid them on time and possibly in an ideal world you have paid them off and closed them successfully and then that that's kind of how you build your track record of managing credit well and that leads to generally a good score. There are other things that obviously impact it. So you know not just that but how much current debt you are in for example will have a big influence if you've got credit cards how much you're borrowing on those and how close you are to the limit and so on. So your current debt levels have a big impact on your score as well. But the history is really important.\n\nOkay. I think there's an obvious question that comes out of that. I I want to ask the obvious question first and then move on to asking you what makes your credit rating bad. So the first question is if you are Tala for example, you asked us this question and you're in your early 20ies and you have never borrowed money before that means you don't have a credit score at all or it means you have a bad credit score.\n\nIt's uh no it doesn't necessarily mean you have a bad credit score. So they're kind of what we call a thin file. So where you just have very limited information, which means the lender can make very little judgment about how well you'll manage credit. So you know, we always kind of talked then about the process of building your credit history. And it's kind of step-by-step process of getting some sort of information onto your credit report, managing it well through those credit accounts, and then building it over time. Is there anything you can do to boost that low? I mean, something I always hear about is making sure you're on the electoral register or the voters role and exactly, you know, because I suppose the first time you you get credit, you don't want to be going for a mortgage. I mean, does having a mobile phone contract help all of these sorts of things?\n\nYeah, it does actually. And it's a good point because in terms of building it, let's say almost from scratch, getting on the electoral role is probably the first thing that I would suggest people do. So, wherever they can, of course, get registered on the electoral role. That's your first bit. Your next bit is having a bank account. It doesn't matter if it's got an overdraft, but as long as you've got a bank account, it'll add some information on there, but don't have any problems with it if you can. So, try not to go into unarranged borrowing and so on. That can cause an issue. And then the next stage would kind of be thinking about getting a credit card. And that's because if you use that in the right way, uh, and perhaps we'll talk about that in a moment, is they're quite easy to get. And if you use them in the right way and pay them off in full, you don't pay the interest on it. And suddenly you've got a couple of accounts plus the electoral role, you're building up some positive information on your credit report. So that's a great way to start that process.\n\nI think we better go straight into what is using a credit card the right way. I mean, I think we would we would think using a credit card the right way is buying stuff with it, paying it off, not paying any interest, but you you said that already. Is there something else involved in the right way?\n\nWell, it's just to do with the balance and how you use it on there. And of course, this is the right way for, you know, me as a credit reference agency, let's say, because what we want to see and what a lender likes to see is a very low balance, but an active account. So the way to do that is spending a few pounds every month on something you would have bought anyway. So try not to buy something that you wouldn't have wanted to buy normally. That's how you kind of get into problems. But spend it on something the food shop once a month, something like that. Pay it off in full every month so you don't pay the interest on it. And so if you keep the balance low, you keep it active, you don't pay the interest, that's a great way to keep your credit card running. Of course, there are people who use credit cards to do their normal spend on. That's because they might get rewards, points, things like that on it, and there's nothing wrong with that. But if you're spending a large amount or getting very close to the limit every month, then that can show on your credit report, and that could affect your credit score. So, you probably want to avoid that right before you apply for something important. That's interesting because this is another thing I've read about this idea of not wanting to do too many things like if you go to the personal finance websites and people often talk about how you apply for a new bank account so you can get the switching bonuses every six months or something like that. But then they sort of say but don't do that if you're about to apply for either a mortgage or a personal loan or a big credit card. Can you give us an idea of what the kind of leeway is and that sort of stuff? Is there any sort of guide as to what's a less less of a big deal and what's more important to avoid?\n\nYeah, so there's lots to that question, but the first part is we generally say because when you apply for credit, it pops up on your credit report and it could lower your credit score. And so we say keep those to a minimum where you can. So probably a couple every few months is a good idea. And so, you know, that's why we say probably a couple of months, 2, 3 months before you apply for something bigger, like the mortgage, for example, you want to avoid applying for other types of credit, just so you don't have those applications pop on. But the other part to your question is if you're applying for something that, you know, has a value to it. So, let's say you you're taking out a loan or um potentially even using buy now pay later or something that would add a balance of debt to your credit report. You again might want to avoid that before applying for something big just because of that will then impact into your affordability, how much you're currently borrowing, those kinds of things.\n\nYeah. One quick thing there. You mentioned buy now pay later. What is the status of that at the moment? And because I I've not stayed fully a breast of this and I remember the sort of clown style stuff wasn't really being kept an eye on and how's how's that changing or or what's going on with that?\n\nYeah, so it's an interesting question but that there are buy now pay later lenders who are sharing with credit reference agencies now. Clearpay being one of them. They share their information with us and some of the others do with the other credit reference agencies as well. It doesn't factor into the credit score we give you yet because the sharing is so new. And there is regulation that is kind of proposed and coming down the line which may mean that possibly next year 2026 there they will be regulated to share all buy now pay later accounts with credit reference agencies. So that might come down the line but it may be that if you use certain ones they will share with a credit reference agency at the moment. So you'll see those accounts pop onto your credit report. So, let's talk about what makes your credit rating bad. What are the things that actively make it bad? I mean, I'm assuming things like having a county court judgment against you, a bankruptcy, an IVA, um that that kind of thing, but is there is there anything else that will actively make it bad that might not be immediately obvious to people like us?\n\nYeah, of course. So, these obviously are the things to try and avoid where possible? We've talked about applying for credit. So, you know, lots of applications in a short space of time, that's likely to drop your credit score. Um, if you've got lots of new accounts as well. So, we we calculate the average age of your account. So, really what we're saying is longunning accounts are good. Loads of new accounts can kind of impact your credit score quite significantly, especially if they're under a year old. And then the next part is payment history. This a really big part of calculating your score. So missed payments, even one of them could impact your credit score by quite a lot. So, you know, really important to have the direct debit set up, make sure things are paid on time. Even the mobile phone contract, you know, the the smaller bills that you think actually, you know what, that's not going to have much of an impact, it will still impact your credit report if you miss it.\n\nDoes that include your electricity bill and your water bill and all that sort of thing?\n\nYes, they are shared with credit reference agencies as well. So, you know, if you're missing those payments and and also incurring debt for missing those payments, yes, that will show on the credit report as well. You talked about county court judgments. So, court judgments, uh, anything to do with insolvency like an IVA\n\n\nOr bankruptcy will obviously have a significant impact on your credit score. But the biggest thing that actually does have an impact on your score is what we call a defaulted account. So, that's an account where you haven't paid it in probably somewhere around 3 to 6 months, and the lender has then closed the account with an outstanding amount set as a default. Stays on your report for 6 years from that point, and that has a really big impact on getting credit. So, you know, my biggest advice actually in that scenario is if you're missing payments or you're going to miss payments and you're in that place where you will go on the road to potentially a default is speak to the lender straight away. Try and set some sort of payment arrangement up that at least stops it going to a default. Or as well as that, speak to a free debt advice provider, your step change pay plan, someone like that who can really help sort out, you know, your kind of finances and budget and so on and find the right solution for you.\nLet's say I'm applying for a mortgage and my credit score with Experian with all of them is not excellent but very good. What's the difference in the interest rate that I'm likely to get offered for a mortgage?\nThat's a very difficult question to answer. So, well, let's don't focus on that too much. And the reason I say that is like I explained earlier, what happens is the lender doesn't see the score that we give you. They see the information on the credit report, but they use that in conjunction with the your affordability information. So, you might have a huge deposit. I'm sure you've been saving for a long time. So, you've got that. Your salary is great. Your other expenses are minimal and that you know together they calculate that and give you their own score and that might mean that you get you know a a very very good interest rate if there is an issue with affordability or with negative information on your credit report. That's where you might start to see the interest rate is getting a little bit higher when you apply. But that's down to each individual lender, how they judge it, how they you know assess that score and you know what rate they give you at the end.\nYou're saying that there may be no difference between the interest rate I'm offered if I'm very good or excellent and still so subjective, isn't it? It's uh well I wouldn't say subjective because it's slightly so I guess it's scientific in the sense that you know there's just it's a lot of data to look at and judge but each lender will be slightly different in how they assess it. So I don't want people to get hung up on the fact that they're 12 points away from being in the excellent category because that will have very minimal impact on you know how the lender judges the information. It's really about making sure your credit reports in a good place and then obviously they factor in the other information as well.\nYeah, it's a bit late for that John Bruners because we are target driven people and John and I the second we finish here we'll be going online and we'll be trying to find out what our score is at each one and if it doesn't matter how far we are off, we're both going for it and it will be a competition. I'm going to be excellent long before John. Right, John?\nOh absolutely, absolutely.\nMaybe he's excellent already. I don't know. We'll be finding out in the next 10 minutes. And the only other thing I wanted to check, John, was see if you do have bad credit. How do you repair that? Like say you've had, I don't know, a dodgy kind of like, you know, kind of 20ies, but now you're a responsible adult. Um, what's what what should you start with? Well, look, the the good news I'd start with is that generally information on your report stays for six years. So, there's always light at the end of the tunnel if there's something negative. The thing I would say is key is just keeping on track. So you might have some negative stuff. It's about okay, it can that negative stuff be brought up to date if you've been missing payments and kind of turn that into a positive, keep that running well. And depending on what it is, it might mean that you focus on other accounts. So you those basics that we talked about earlier, you know, having the bank account, maybe having the credit card, and just focusing on those and keeping them running well on time, paid on time, balances low, and then at some point the the other negative information might drop off the report and it has less of a negative impact on your score over time. So it's kind of just focusing on doing good things while you can and with what you can and then it will start to improve over time. The other thing I would say as well is you know kind of when we're talking about the negative bit as well in the applying for credit process is actually there are lots of services available to search for credit. So primarily credit cards, loans, car finance and in a way for mortgages as well but use comparison sites and eligibility services to check for credit. So we've got one. There are lots of them out there and the reason you use those is they don't impact your credit score when you do the search. It's a bit like searching for house insurance online. They're soft searches. Don't impact your credit score, but they will give you a very good idea of who will accept you and what kind of deals you can get. And you could even get preapproved as well, which is always a delight to know before you actually apply. So, you know, if anyone does if anyone's looking for credit, even if they're in a good place or they have negative information, it's a great place to do your kind of credit research. I know you said about admin earlier, it's more admin, but it means that, you know, you get a really good idea of who you should approach rather than just applying to anyone who you've seen and and possibly getting refused.\nIf I can look up my credit score this easily, can other people look up my credit score?\nNo.\nWhy not? So when you say open an account with a credit reference agency, we go through lots of checks to make sure it's you that is setting up an account to check your credit report and score. We verify information across public record information like electoral role account information to verify that it's definitely you. And if there's any issues with that, we also go through further checks to check your ID documents and possibly bills or statements as well to make sure that we do not show anyone else your information.\nOkay, good. I'm a little nervous about my electricity bill now and everyone else looking it up. So, I think we're all good.\nJohn, thank you so much for being with us today.
