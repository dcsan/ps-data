  "cleanText": "Well, it's unimaginably heart wrenching for the families who've lost, especially their children overnight. A wall of river that rose almost 30 feet in less than an hour. That area's prone to flash floods. We have a ranch about three miles up the road from Camp Mystic, which is at the epicenter of this. And we've never seen anything like this. I don't know how you could prepare for it. But we're all praying for that community and those families. And there's still folks missing. And I know the governor is committed to, you know, not ceasing the search and rescue until everybody's found. It's a land of states rights. It's a land of less federal. You had a horrific winter storm this winter storms. Folks in northern Texas are glacial. I mean, they're like they're like back to the ice age. And the answers is 1921, Lubbock and Abilene was absolutely leveled. And you dialed one 800 FEMA to get assistance. Is the FEMA of 2021 the same as the FEMA now? Well, I hope it's much improved, but I'm not sure that's the case. I think the president's right to push that down at the state local level. And not necessarily the resources were taxed on it one way or the other. I just think folks at the local and state level are probably best to handle it. So, Congressman, talk to us about this legislation that is a big success story for the Trump administration. I know you had a big hand in it. Talk to us about what this spending bill, this tax bill, what does it mean for this economy, do you think, going forward? I think it's significant and it couldn't come at a better time. I know there's some uncertainty with the tariff realignment. I think that will work out in a very positive way when we get these new deals and they we have reciprocal trade relationships with folks. So I'm supportive of that. In the meantime, we have supercharged the growth that we saw from the first Trump tax cuts by making permanent, for example, business expensing for R&D, capital interest expensing, the pro-growth provisions there, and then just tax relief to working families, not just the marginal rates, but improving the standard deduction and making it permanent. And then, of course, there's several working man provisions tax on tips, no tax on overtime. Families with children get a supercharge child deduction. How does it impact maybe people in your district, some a rural district, for example, the folks in your district, do they like here a global Wall Street here? Bloomberg We talk tariffs all day, every day. Did the people in your district, did they think about that or how did they think about some of the economic issues that you're trying to address in your bill and maybe the president's trying to address with tariffs? Well, on the bill, it's just more money in their in their pockets, right. That's a good thing for them. And they recognize it on that. The on the other piece, you got ag and energy dominate. Yeah. I mean, it is the largest oil patch and cattle feeder system in the world. I mean and so they understand unfair trade. They understand that it's not sustainable. And I think they're all in to support this president getting to that even competitive playing field. I am the concern for folks with this. Congressman Jodey Arrington here from Texas, facilities with this, the 19th congressional district of Northern Texas. I look at you, you slip by in the last election, you won 80% of the vote. I mean, you got to do better next time. The president took Texas with 56%. I don't know what you know off the top of your head what he took in the 19th congressional district to me. Okay. So we're going to get him up there. Okay. But the bottom line is, I only said this year, Michael Barr today student loans are going to affect Texas Tech. They're going to affect Texas Tech. How do you balance the Trump mantra of tear the federal government apart with those 842 kids at Texas Tech that can't go there this fall? I'm making it up. They can't go there this fall because of the student loan shifts he's proposing. Well, I think the fact that we have all of this student aid and not targeted necessarily, the people who need it, I think is an inflationary has an inflationary effect on the cost of education. I'm a former vice chancellor at Texas Tech. That's my alma mater and the largest employer with walk on football players that give you a fancy job. What was it like when you walked done? I mean, was Patrick Mahomes on the field when you walked out? I would never have a chance. I couldn't even catch the balls that he throws today. He throws it hard. This was under the Spike Dikes era, where just about anybody in their body, you could fog a mirror, could walk on. And and in fact, I didn't play football in high school. And when the recruiter asked me when we sat down right before my physical, he said, what did you play in high school? I said, Tennis. And he thought, oh, man, I want to look at a question. Cowboys are chiefs. You know what? Cowboys over the Chiefs. But I'm a college football guy. I'm not really interested. And we're losing that uniqueness in college sports because of denial. Another conversation. Conversation partners. I think there were districts is another D1 power Duke Texas congressman. One of the key topics and key issues for President Trump and in his election was immigration. You come from a state that is boy, that is right on the front lines of immigration. How do the folks in your district think about it? I mean, a lot of these folks that come over, they pick our agricultural, they build our homes, they do all kinds of stuff. They bus our tables. How do people in your district think about it? Well, I think they appreciate the fact that we don't have Americans that would do the jobs that are needed in the fields, as you mentioned, in agriculture. And probably the same could be said in the in the, you know, oil patch. Yeah, but I think they first and foremost wanted security and from and a returned to law and order from the chaos it's been devastating and I was just there with law enforcement I'm telling you the gangs the drug activity exponential over the last four years. So in order to have the conversation that we need to have about legal immigration and making sure we have a win win situation with people who want a better life and filling the jobs that we need to produce the food, fuel and fiber we had to do. We needed a president with the will to do what is being been done by this president in terms of border security. But there's more to be done on the legal side so that we can continue to facilitate the economic okay, including agriculture, which is a small matter from appealing to other to cut to the chase. So Henrietta trees beautiful analyst was on earlier and says they're almost hiding the president's lame duck goodness because Congressman Jodey Arrington has to get reelected in November of 2026. What's your Republican Party and particularly the Texas delegation looks like after President Trump? Is this like a moment and you guys shift back to, you know, hating Lyndon Baines Johnson or, you know, what does the framework look like after Trump? I think President Trump's philosophy and focus on America first is here to stay. I think it's here to stay and for all the right reasons. And I think it resonates with all the Republican districts, certainly in Texas. I mean, it's a ruby red state. And so putting our ag producers first in trade, putting our families first and allowing them to keep more of their money, putting the safety of our families first. Again, we've been at ground zero in this border crisis for several years now. So I don't think it it I think it remains the America first agenda into the future. And I think that's a good thing, and I think they will support that. Does he understand the H-2A program and dairy farms? I think he does. I think he does. In fact, he's the one that I did that well in the first Trump administration. You'll recall he actually pushed our party to a deal in fixing H-2A. It was called H2 C, it was a reform. It was a much improved reform. Along with giving legal status to DOCA. He pushed our party outside of our comfort. It failed ultimately because we didn't get a Democrat to support it. We continue with Congressman Jodey Arrington to the 19th Congressional District. This is northern Texas. Paul did an all nighter Friday and Saturday. Did you watch all of land, man? Oh, yeah. I'm all in. I know everything you know about oil and gas when you see land, man, Is it fiction? No, I think he's pretty true to form, actually. Yeah. For better or for worse. So it's funny when you think about Texas and energy, obviously, you think about the oil and gas, but you guys also have tons of wind farms and solar or not, you kind of lead the nation in the way things. So how does the folks out in your district, how do they think about, you know, fossil fuels versus, you know, alternative energy, I guess, is the term How did they think about that? I think most folks are for all of the above. I just think it's how you get there. Accelerating R&D, for example, where we accelerate the amortization, we make that expensing immediate and permanent in this tax bill. As long as it's technology neutral, I don't think they want the government picking winners and losers. I think they see the the the good that could come of renewable resources in the future. Obviously, fossil is finite, but after the natural gas shale revolution, we have an ocean of this great resource. And so we don't want a distortion, we don't want regressive inflationary energy policies. We want an even playing field. But no one's averse to all the above, including renewable. It's just how aggressive we've been a and accelerating with tax benefits for renewable while B over the last four years being hostile to our bread and butter which has put a lot of people on the defensive. Quite. How do you respond in the bill that Paul mentioned, the huge benefit goes to the wealthy. Granted, the wealthy on a percentage basis are paying a lot of taxes. How the middle class of Lubbock and Abilene Fair in this bill, I think they believe and have experienced that the value of the tax breaks that we extended from the first Trump administration in 17 are greater among the lower and middle income folks than the upper upper income. And in fact, the top 1% pay a greater share. And in fact, the top 10% of the income earners in the country paid 70% of all the federal bills. Now they pay 75%. You're an important Paul, I mentioned earlier, you're in a house. You guys are right and tall, maybe a lose House Senate president here over the next two four years ago. What's your response to how the Democrats have been so ineffective off of the election? You barely won the House. We witnessed that. You barely won the Senate. Good morning, Vice President. Events we witnessed. We witnessed that. I mean, are you surprised that the Democrats can't get their act together? I am. I mean, in the land of in Richard's I mean, it was iconic. I am they are still wondering why. I don't know. I think they are so used to being against President Trump and making demonizing him that that has become. And then you've got the left that has overpowered their party to the point that it's going to be really difficult to break free from their agenda that is disconnected from from mainstream Americans. Why are you in New York? Well, I'm here to tell the good news the gospel of prosperity and security and opportunity that is going to come when you get the right policies and set the right conditions. We've done it. And I want people to know that help is on the way. If if we do a remote from Abilene, Paul, I'll wear the flu cases. Okay. Lubbock, Texas boots. This guy knows his. Knows. He knows he knows his taxes. You have no idea. You're welcome. Any time.\n",
