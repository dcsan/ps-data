  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts,\nradio, news.\n[Music]\nWelcome to the *Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia Edition* podcast.\nI'm Doug Krner.\nSo, markets are now dealing with a new threat of tariffs on US imports.\nLast Friday, President Trump declared a 30% tariff on goods from both the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st.\nIt was just the day before Trump threatened Canada with a 35% tariff.\nSo, markets have been somewhat well behaved as if they are counting on Mr. Trump to back down, having seen U-turns before.\nThe question is whether that remains the best bet.\nIn a moment, we'll travel to Singapore and speak with *Bloomberg* Markets live strategist Mary Nicola.\nWe begin in the States, though, as we look ahead to second quarter earnings.\nJoining me now is Roderick von Lipsey.\nHe is managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management on the line from Washington DC.\nRod, thank you so much for making time to chat with me.\nSo, earnings from a couple of the big banks are on the list this week.\nWe'll also get numbers from TSMC and Netflix.\nI'm curious, how do you feel about the quality of the results that we're going to see for Q2?\nYou know, this is going to be a very interesting quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year look, in part because we go back just a quarter ago, and the whole tariff scenario really put corporations in a very strange place.\nThe estimates right now on the street, we're looking at under 5% earnings for EPS growth year-over-year.\nWe at UBS believe are going to come in closer to about 6% when we look at 2025 and growing to call it $265 a share on the S&P 500.\nI think that this busy week, you're really going to see some acceleration in the earnings reports that, you know, for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the big banks really start to kick off on Tuesday, and our expectation is that those estimates are going to beat consensus.\nThey're going to be pretty strong.\nIn one case, because the higher interest rates, especially for financials, have been very, very supportive of NII and net interest income and net interest margin for these banks.\nSo, we'll see some good numbers there, and I expect that some of the economic activity has been pulled forward in this second quarter, especially since tariffs have been threatened and delayed and postponed.\nSo, lots of activity, but it's going to be a strange one, and everyone is going to be looking at not just the second quarter results, but what will be the forecast for third quarter and looking forward.\nBefore we leave the banks, I want to ask about whether trading revenue has the potential to be a real standout here, given the volatility that we had in markets in the second quarter, whether banks really benefited from that on the trading side.\nAnecdotally, Doug, absolutely.\nAnd that's why we are not only, um, sort of very, very bullish, if you will, on financials and the asset managers, because we think that trading activity in this second quarter was just off the charts, especially during April.\nAnd so, with that pickup and activity, with all of that uncertainty and all of the activity that went around that, I think it's going to be a pretty strong, strong, especially for the broker dealers, is going to be a very, very strong second quarter.\nWe mentioned earlier the impact of the tariffs, and I thought it was very interesting last Thursday.\nWe heard from Kagra, the outlook well below expectations, and the company pointed out that rising cost for tin plate steel used for food cans due to tariffs is going to have a very consequential negative impact.\nIs this something that's going to be more predominant when we talk about margins, just how this begins to manifest?\nIt's interesting, the UBS base case is that we're going to end up somewhere at around the 15%, you know, sort of across the board tariff rate, and that the consumer is going to be asked to bear the brunt of much of that.\nAnd so that works into our economic forecast numbers.\nBut the commodity prices, quite frankly, are just all over the charts because of the dramatic uncertainty.\nMost of our investors are focused on commodities like gold and oil and don't dig too far into the commodity indices.\nBut when we look at commodities, they truly are really all over the charts because it's very difficult to understand how the policy and the tariffs and the trade considerations will affect those underlying commodities.\nBut I think it manifests itself, at least in our forecasts, on inflation that remains fairly pernicious and stays above the Fed's stated 2% target.\nInteresting.\nAnd yet with all the risk out there, we've got an S&P 500 trading at 24 times earnings.\nIs that a little bit of a head scratcher for you?\nIt truly is, because we have different things, um, especially if we look at our UBS macroeconomic forecasts.\nWe see, for example, GDP growth in the Americas for 2025.\nWe're estimating, you know, 1 and a.5% GDP growth, but we're looking at CPI or inflation.\nYou know, again, we have some releases this week that will tell us, but we see inflation coming in almost at 3% and actually accelerating into 2026.\nAnd that is directly because of this concern about how tariffs are going to flow through to the consumer and how they're going to keep inflation fairly high.\nNow, the markets seem to be unfazed by the tariff talks.\nThe markets seem to believe that we're going to get to August 1st, and either we'll have a favorable outcome or things will get pushed back again, and so they are completely unfazed, at least if we look at the, you know, at all-time highs and continuing to be there, and so on a macro level, we think that this bull market that we've been experiencing continues to have legs, it continues to have momentum, but the real place to keep an eye out is going to be the bond market, because at some point in time, a lot of the things that were in the big beautiful bill.\nA lot of the things that are coming into the economy because of increasing tariffs, at some point in time, the bond market is going to give us a signal, and that's really where we have a cautious outlook.\nSo, if you were going to be in the fixed income space, where do you want to hide out?\nThe belly of the curve or do you want to be maybe more exposed to the short end?\nWhat's the strategy?\nListen, we think that in the in the belly of the curve, and we think that on balance, again, with our forecasts looking one year out with 10-year rates coming back down to 4%.\nWe think that the bond market provides an opportunity for the long-term investor.\nThese are actually attractive levels, especially when you look at spreads for high-quality municipal bonds for taxable investors in the US or corporate corporate bonds.\nWe're seeing an opportunity there to to get nice returns, but that does not mean it's not going to be volatile in the short term.\nAnd that's the real challenge for the bond investor is to take a look at it, pick your yield, say this is the yield that I think is going to work, and recognize that next week, next month, that might feel like a bad decision, but by next year, you'll be glad that you're sitting on that high-quality paper.\nDoes the big beautiful bill at any point in the future begin to negatively impact the the MUN market, particularly at the state level?\nWell, that's a fantastic question, and I think that that has been structurally appears to be something that's being pushed down the road a little bit.\nDoug, I've got to say that I have not read The Big Beautiful Bill, and I don't know very many people who have actually been able to read that book cover to cover, but it's my understanding that much of the good news has been baked in and takes immediate effect.\nAnd then some of the ways to pay for that good news have been pushed back, some of it beyond the midterm elections.\nAnd so that is going to create some challenges.\nIt's going to create pressure for things that are being put on states and municipalities.\nThere's been a lot of bond issuance, especially by municipal issuers there this year to try to get out in front of this before rates potentially go up.\nSo, I guess I do think there's some challenges that'll be ahead, but I don't know that those are near-term.\nI think those are pushed into 2026 and beyond.\nOkay, fair enough.\nBut I'm wondering whether or not, given everything that we've been laying out, that you're tempted to look a little offshore right now to remain diversified.\nDo you want to look at foreign markets?\nOur investors have been clamoring to understand ways to diversify against either monetary or or fiscal pressures and challenges here in the US.\nAnd so, listen, that's why we're seeing gold prices in the in the current range.\nBut we're also seeing lots of, um, you know, great performance out of the international markets.\nI think one of the questions is whether the international equity markets, especially the Euro zone, whether it's fully caught up or is there more room to grow.\nWe think that selectively looking offshore, holding foreign currency, holding gold, that those are nice hedges.\nBut when it comes to actually making an investment that'll outperform the US markets, that becomes a little bit more of a murky question.\nVery, very difficult to us to look at European equity market growth and US equity market growth, especially when we look at the the focus of it and financials here in the US and believe that there's a lot of room for outperformance there in the developed international markets.\nEmerging markets, both on the debt and the equity side, do show some some green shoots and do show some very, very strong either sovereign balance sheets or good positions for for these corporations, but the path of tariffs will really, really make a difference.\nAnd so that makes it a little bit of a challenge for US investors to go too deeply and go too far either out of dollar investing or into international equities.\nHouse Republicans have declared the week ahead as crypto week, and I'm curious to get the take from the private wealth management perspective.\nHow is the cryptocurrency space viewed?\nIs Bitcoin something that represents opportunity, or do you see it pretty much as kind of noise around the edges of what what the market is involved in these days?\nBoy, that is a really challenging one.\nIt's also very challenging for someone in a broker dealer, especially a big firm facing the Fed to really understand the the path and the fate of of cryptocurrencies.\nI think three points though.\nOne is that these are certainly with us, and they're going to stay with us.\nI do believe that there are many of the cryptocurrencies themselves that are highly speculative, and we are now starting to see a number of stable coins that are actually buying treasuries and and basing them on treasury.\nAnd so one of the interesting things, interesting dynamics that we're seeing in the stable coin or the crypto assets is the purchase of treasuries, which is, we know, if you had had sort of thought about it, um, initially or off the cuff, you would think that that the crypto emergence of more crypto options would actually be a move away from from treasuries, when in fact the underlying securities and the underlying issuers are actually buying treasuries to make sure that they get that stability.\nSo I think that it's going to be a very, very interesting thing.\nObviously, there's administration and and and and on the hill, there's support for crypto assets.\nUm, but we continue to look at them as as being highly speculative.\nOkay, we'll leave it there.\nRod, thank you so much for joining us.\nRod Van Lipsey there, managing director UBS Private Wealth Management on the line from Washington DC here on the *Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia Edition* podcast.\n[Music]\nWelcome back to the *Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia Edition* podcast.\nI'm Doug Krer.\nSo, we know last Friday, President Trump declared a 30% tariff on goods from both the European Union and Mexico.\nThey are effective August 1st unless there is some sort of trade deal with both jurisdictions.\nOver the weekend, we heard from Ursula Vander Lion.\nShe is the president of the European Commission, and she said the EU will extend the suspension of trade countermeasures against the US until August 1st, and that in effect will allow for further trade talks.\nWe also heard from Mexican President Claudia Shinbal.\nShe said that her team had already begun discussions with the US on Friday.\nJoining me now for a closer look at the tariff story is Mary Nicola, *Bloomberg* Markets live strategist.\nMary joins us from Singapore.\nIt's always a pleasure to chat with you.\nI'm curious as to get your take on the tariff headwinds where you are and what's being said about whether President Trump may be bluffing.\nYeah, I think that is very much the case, especially if you saw the way Asian equities had reacted last week, and it looked like they were shrugging off a lot of the noise that was coming through on tariffs.\nThey shrugged off the noise on 50% on Brazil.\nObviously this morning, Japanese stocks are down, but actually if you look at the Cosby in Korea, that's holding up quite well.\nSo there has been this disparity in terms of they're shrugging it off because doors are still open for negotiations, and I think that's key for market and also the fact that we could potentially see President Trump backpedaling.\nAlso, the fact is that the data is holding up quite well.\nSo, I don't think you'll start seeing cracks coming through into markets until we actually see some of the data come through fruition or the fact that you're seeing weakness coming through.\nAnd because we haven't seen that, it looks like, you know, the markets here in Asia are holding up relatively well.\nIt's interesting tonight here in the US, we had Trump saying that South Korea wants to make a trade deal.\nNow, that's coming from Mr. Trump's perspective, I'm not so sure that the same thing could be said for the South Korean side.\nIsn't it really difficult to kind of get a sense of where we are in the negotiating process?\nYeah, it's interesting too, because if you look at Korea, the US has a free trade agreement with Korea.\nSo, obviously the building blocks are solid and they're already there, but it's a matter of what more is the US looking for?\nAnd I think that keeps coming up, especially in negotiations.\nSo, for example, with Japan, you've had a setback because of agriculture.\nAgriculture is always a key sticking point when you're discussing trade negotiations and trade agreements, because obviously agriculture is considered some sort of national security issue as well.\nAnd then for but for Korea specifically, it's interesting because you do have solid building blocks.\nYou do have a free trade agreement.\nBut of course, it's a matter of the the 25% tariffs on cars.\nThat's obviously a key sticking point for the Koreans, and they want it to go away because obviously cars are a big part of what they're sending and what they're selling to the US.\nSo unless those sectoral tariffs, which are still some of the bigger issues, go away, I think that might still hold Korea back and hold off an agreement between the two nations.\nSo I'm curious, Mary,\n\n\nAs to whether or not we have any data, high frequency or otherwise, that might give a little bit of insight into how this trade war is impacting not only Japan but South Korea as well economically.\nDo we know anything?\nYeah.\nSo, so far actually if you look at some of the South Korea, for example, releases export data 10 days, 20 days, and then also if you look at the current account data, actually all of them have been quite solid.\nSo that's another key reason as to why the Asian markets have been holding up relatively well.\nNot to mention the fact that China as well has been holding up relatively well in addition to that.\nSo but if you look at some of the trade data coming out of Korea, there's no real indications that there has been a real slump and that's really helping a lot of the markets.\nAnd I think as long as you see the strength in the current account, the strength in the external sector, that's going to keep equity markets at least in the region robust.\nSo I know we get a couple of key data points for the Japanese economy this week.\nMachine tool orders, industrial production.\nI think there are some inflation data in there as well.\nWhat are you going to be looking at?\nYeah, I think the main thing for investors right now for the Japanese economy is on CPI.\nObviously, there's a lot of concern about inflation.\nThere's a lot of concern about because especially we're seeing yields rise and there's this toxic mix for Japan.\nWhether you're seeing it because of quantitative tightening, whether you're seeing it because of inflation, whether you're seeing it because of worries about fiscal profagacy and especially with the elections coming through and the potential for more fiscal spending.\nSo there is really the heightened focus is on CPI.\nIs CPI still high?\nAnd of course we know that the Bank of Japan has been quite reluctant to hike rates.\nSo real rates remain quite high.\nAnd as a result, I think you're seeing investors just incredibly wary of especially Japanese bonds.\nThat's also going to weigh on the yen in addition.\nSo I think the focus for investors this week is going to be not only on CPI but also on the elections.\nSo is the BOJ in a little bit of a bind here?\nI mean if there is upward pressure on price action or to say upward pressure on inflation and the risk of more economic slowing.\nI mean how do you engineer your way out of that?\nAbsolutely.\nAnd that's a really good question in terms of what do they do?\nAnd so far they've sent a message that especially on the tightening side that they're sitting on their hands.\nThey're weighing what is happening externally.\nThey're concerned more about the external challenges and the implications on the economy than inflation and that has actually been to the detriment of the Japanese bond market and will likely hurt the yen as well.\nBut in the meantime we are seeing quantitative tightening and it's interesting to see the bond market reaction that despite the tweaks they've made.\nSo for example the Ministry of Finance has already decided to reduce issuance in the back end and we've seen some of those tweaks yet we're still seeing pressure on bonds.\nSo it's almost like they've let out their tools but the tools aren't working.\nAnd that's just very much indicative of the bind that they're in.\nAnd of course adding to that is just the potential of fiscal expansion and that will just only add to the pressures on the bond market.\nSo, I know based on our history of conversations over the last several years, you pay very close attention to what the Fed is doing.\nAnd we've got President Trump and some of his allies who have been very critical of Fed Chair Jay Powell's handling of some of the renovations being done at the Fed headquarters.\nAnd a few people in the administration have been now building the case to remove Powell from the Fed's board of governors.\nWere that to happen, it's probably a very extreme type scenario.\nWhat would the reaction do you think in Asian markets be under that scenario?\nYeah, I think it's actually still a very dangerous game to play where you're potentially cracking and ruining the credibility of the Fed.\nAnd that's essentially what's been happening with all this pressure on the Fed.\nWhere you do see is a potential reaction is that a move and a shift away from the dollar.\nAnd that actually could be beneficial to a lot of the Asian currencies.\nWe've seen the dollar slowly decline or actually more than slowly decline since the start of this year and I think that just precipitates it and what you'll see is a switch over to a lot of the Asian currencies, for example, the CNY, the Korean won as well, where they are likely to get a bid as a result because of the fact that you know there there is just this loss of credibility because if you do put someone who is in that is complies with what the fiscal policy and what what the administration wants that just risks where we could see inflation and how potential policy monetary policy just gets out of control.\nSo I think in in general what you'll see is just that shift continue away from the dollar as a result if you see further cracks in the Fed's credibility.\nMary, we'll leave it there.\nIt's always a pleasure.\nI hope you have a productive week in the Lion City.\nMary Nicola there, Bloomberg MLIV Strategist joining from Singapore here on the
