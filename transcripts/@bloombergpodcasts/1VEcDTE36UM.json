  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\nThis is the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast.\nGood morning.\nIt's Monday the 14th of July.\nI'm Caroline Hepka in London and I'm Steven Carol in Brussels.\nComing up today, the EU lines up allies and counter measures as Donald Trump threatens a 30% tariff from the 1st of August if no agreement can be reached.\nHelp wanted but not by humans.\nUK hiring tumbles as AI disrupts jobs and payroll costs surge in another worrying sign for Star and Reeves.\nPlus, why Europe's defense ramp up is creating an opportunity for Sweden's Griffin fighter jet to take off.\nLet's start with a roundup of our top stories.\nThe European Union is looking to step up engagement with other countries hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs following a slew of new threats.\nSources tell us that the EU has reached out to nations including Canada and Japan and raised the prospect of a coordinated response to US levies.\nThe move comes after President Donald Trump unleashed his latest tariff ultimatum over the weekend.\nThe US President declared that the EU and Mexico would face a 30% tariff if agreements can't be reached by the 1st of August.\nEuropean Commission President Ursa Vanderline says she's hopeful of a deal.\nWe prefer a negotiated solution.\nThis remains the case and we will use the time that we have now till the 1st of August.\nUrsa Vanderline says the European Union will extend the suspension of trade counter measures against the US until the start of next month in a bid to secure a deal.\nAt the same time, Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Mertz said 30% tariffs would hit exporters in Europe's largest economies to the core if a negotiated solution in the trade conflict can't be found.\nChina's export growth has accelerated for the first time since March.\nExports rose year by a higher than expected 5.8% in June to $325 billion.\nBloomberg's Minman Low says the pickup was driven by a reduction in US tariffs and robust demand from key overseas markets.\nThe exports are really bolstered by the trade crews, the front loing of shipments.\nEconomists have been telling us that we really have to prepare for a potential fall off in demand for exports in the second half of the year.\nAnd of course, we are still waiting for the mid- August deadline when the temporary truce will expire.\nAnd some economists believe it's still a possibility that maybe the tariff levels could still increase in the later half of this year.\nSo there's still a lot of uncertainty there.\nMin low speaking there.\nThe US tariffs on Chinese goods have been cut back to around 55% down from as high as 145% in early April.\nHowever, Beijing faces mounting risks from Washington's evolving trade strategy.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart in the coming weeks.\nBloomberg understands that Jane Street has deposited over 48 billion rupees, the equivalent of $564 million in an escrow account to comply with an order from India's market regulator.\nIt comes after the Securities and Exchange Board of India temporarily banned the trading giant from accessing the local market over allegations of index manipulation.\nThe deposit enables Jane Street to resume trading in India, but sources say the firm does not intend to return to trading in local equity options.\nWhile Jane Street has not commented on the latest development, it has previously stated that it strongly rejects the premise and substance of the regulators order, calling it fundamentally mistaken about its trades.\nNow, here in the UK, hiring by businesses is down by the most in nearly two years, according to data from the consultancy KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.\nThe numbers come as employers show signs of dialing back hiring for jobs likely to be affected by artificial intelligence.\nBloomberg's Tio Adabio has more.\nOnline job postings in the UK have dropped 31% in the three months to May compared to 2022.\nAccording to McKenzie analysis, the decline is being felt most in sectors with the potential to be significantly altered by AI, including areas such as tech and finance.\nData shows job postings for these sorts of roles dropped almost twice as much as others.\nThe trend presents another drag on a job market already contending with tax increases and stalling economic growth.\nIn London, Tiwa Adabio, Bloomberg Radio.\nBritain has announced a date for the state visit from US President Donald Trump.\nThe country will host the American leader from the 17th of September after Prime Minister Kier Starmer invited Trump for a rare second visit.\nBloomberg's James Wilco has more.\nFlashery can get you a long way.\nIn Britain's case, flattery seems to have helped K star secure a 20 percentage point lower tariff rate than that of the EU, which would be a major coup if it holds.\nAnd global leaders admit to taking notes from this moment.\nCan I present a letter from McCain to Thank you very much.\nOh, that's well that is really nice.\nA very special letter.\nI think the last state visit was a tremendous success.\nIt was uh His Majesty the king wants to make this even better.\nUh than that.\nSo this is this is truly historic an unprecedented second visit if he wants to.\nSo can Stan perform a second flourish and lever the UK's pageantry industry into real gains on trade and security from the US leader in London.\nJames Wilco, Bloomberg Radio.\nPresident Donald Trump says that the US will send more Patriot air defense batteries to Ukraine as long as Europe pays.\nThe move is a change of heart for the US leader, who had argued that sending more arms would delay any peace deal.\nUkraine had been receiving US weapons, but only with money remaining from Joe Biden's time in office.\nPresident Donald Trump says that he won't be footing the bill for the new deliveries.\nI haven't agreed on the number yet, but they're going to have some because they do need protection.\nBut the European Union is paying for it.\nWe're not paying anything for it, but we will send it and it'll be business for us and we will send them patriots which they desperately need.\nThe president added that he is very disappointed with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNATO chief Mark Russia is scheduled to meet with Trump later today as Axios reports that Trump will announce a new plan for Ukraine that also includes offensive weapons.\nAnd in sports news, Yanek has captured his first Wimbledon title after defeating the defending champion Carlos Alcarz in four sets.\nSpeaking after the match, the Italian world number one acknowledged the challenges he's faced this year.\nI'm very emotional.\nNo, even if I don't cry, but it feels uh feels emotional because only me and and the people who are close to me know exactly what we have been through on and off the court.\nAnd it has been everything except easy.\nAlex Center, who also served a three-month doping ban earlier in the year, speaking there.\nElsewhere, Chelsea claims the Football Club World Cup title, beating Paris San 3-nil in the final.\nThe London side were presented with the trophy by US President Donald Trump at the Metife Stadium in New Jersey.\nThose are our top stories for you this morning.\nLet's have a look at markets where stock futures are tumbling right now for Europe.\nDown by half of 1% for the US stocks 50 futures.\nReal concerns around President Donald Trump's tariff threat of 30% against Europe.\nS&P 500 even futures also announcing some declines down 4/10en this morning.\nLooking at the euro marginally lower against the dollar, down about a tenth of 1% for the euro 11675.\nThe Mexican peso is also down 210 against the dollar because it's another country uh in the sights of President Donald Trump uh with tariffs.\nAsian equities are mixed.\nYou got the topics up.\nThe Cosby also seeing some gains uh but we've had some declines for example for the Taiwanese stock market.\nLooking at Treasury yields hovering around 441.\nThe only other really big notable move again is in Bitcoin $121,000.\nSo it's breaking has broken through another record high for Bitcoin.\nThose are the markets.\nStephen, in a moment we'll bring you the latest on the US EU trade moves.\nPlus why Sweden's fighter jet industry could be poised for takeoff.\nBut another story we've been reading this morning from our opinion columnist Howard Chaywan who has been writing about getting healthy again while a little bit older at 66.\nI decided to get healthy again as the essay that he's written for Bloomberg's weekend edition.\nUm with some interesting I mean we've we like to feature how's writing a lot because he writes beautifully and in a very sort of relatable way about some of the kind of challenges he's had like taking up running uh in his 60s again.\nHe he gave it up earlier because of an injury as well.\nAnd he's kind of talking about the the challenges of trying to be as active as possible.\nYes.\nWhile also not compromising entirely on the things that he enjoys in life like eating out.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nHe's a Boniv is he just is uh such a great writer.\nAlso that he often goes back to you know ancient texts which I just love.\nYou know he brings up lots of kind of Roman writers and he's got all sorts of interesting quotes that he um includes and kind of philosophical thinking.\nIt was based on science because he was looking at this recent scientific study that uh anybody who might be a little bit older um had probably spotted which is that apparently we age at certain points.\nIt doesn't sort of happen gradually but at around the age of 44 and around the age of 60 you can kind of age quite rapidly.\nSo he was trying to reverse that time and just like that effect you know and just like that you're feeling much older than perhaps you were last week or the week before.\nThere's great advice in there though from Howard too and essentially I mean a lot of it just comes down to don't give up and doing a little is better than doing nothing at all.\nUm and you we'll put a link to the piece in our show notes.\nIt's a great read this morning.\nNow let's bring you more on our top story.\nSo the EU is preparing to step up contacts with the likes of Canada and Japan after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 30% on its exports.\nEU trade ministers are meeting in Brussels today to discuss the latest.\nOur Brussels bureau chief Suzanne Lynch is joining us now for more.\nSuzanne, good morning.\nWhat do we know about the latest steps that the EU is planning?\nIs this about trying to form alliances against the US?\nWell, we reported late last night that the EU is preparing to step up engagement with other countries that are hit by the Donald Trump tariffs.\nUm mainly it seems after this week of um and Donald Trump digging down on his trade rhetoric, sending those letters to various trading partners and then at the weekend announcing or threatening the European Union and Mexico with with new tariffs.\nUm so we know that there is plan out to coordinate um a lot better on this.\nUm but at the same time we've got the EU at the other hand signaling quite strongly by Ursula Vanderion on Sunday that they don't want to escalate at the moment um and that they're holding back implementing any more counter measures until they try and get some kind of a deal before this new August 1st deadline.\nSuzan, talk us to us about the strategy that the EU is taking here because the decision not to retaliate is a choice.\nDoes it indicate that they are hopeful that c progress can be made between now and the 1st of August?\nWell, it's um interesting timing because today, as you mentioned, EU trade ministers are meeting here in Brussels.\nBut today is also the deadline by which a suspended tariffs on steel and aluminum expire.\nSo the EU has a choice today as it happens whether to extend that suspension or to enact that suspension again and those tariffs again.\nSo we've heard very strongly from Vander Lion that at the moment today the EU won't do that that it will allow that uh suspension to continue.\nSo it it did have that option if you like and and they have chosen not to do that.\nUm now what is interesting is that we you know we're hearing that for example from President Emmanuel Macron if you look at the language he used on Saturday when he responded to this kind of shock move by Trump he talked about the fact that the commission have to protect European interests.\nHe talked about preparing series of counter measures um including this trade tool called the anti-coercion instrument that could you know allow the EU to hit back even stronger.\nHe mentioned those things.\nNow the EU hasn't gone there yet.\nUm, as I say, it is at this moment deciding not to go any further.\nBut it will be interesting to see, you know, if there is some push back now today when EU trade ministers meeting that some countries perhaps believe, look, the EU needs to be stronger on this because, you know, as we've discussed before, the EU does have these other measures it can take.\nIt has other sanctions that it can h implement h if it chooses to do so.\nOkay.\nWell, let's watch that closely.\nSuzanne, thank you so much for being with us this morning.\nThat is Bloomberg's Brussels Bureau Chief Suzanne Lynch.\nThe move to ramp up defense spending in Europe is presenting an opportunity for the Griffin jet made by Sweden's SAB.\nThe company hasn't secured an export order since 2014, but that might be about to change.\nOur reporter Christopher Youngstat joins us now for more from Stockholm.\nChristopher, good morning.\nIs this the moment then for the Griffin fighter jet?\nIt sure does look like it's a a moment definitely.\nAs you mentioned, it's been over a decade since Saab won a major export order for its its grip and jets.\nBut in the past year, both Thailand and Colombia have decided that they do want to place orders.\nAnd these are now being negotiated with Saab targeting deals being finalized this year.\nAnd then next in line could be orders from Peru and the Philippines uh with Brazil potentially also boosting its existing contract for 36 jets by 25%.\nAnd as as Saab CEO Michael Johansson said in his typical understated fashion, it's been a while since the company was in such an intensive period on the gapen front.\nWell, Loheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets of course have dominated order books in Europe, but here two countries sort of looking for alternatives, right?\nYeah.\n13 European countries are are current F-35 customers and that's including Sweden's neighbors Norway, Denmark and and Finland.\nWhile Saab in its turn has just leased Gripen jets to the Czech Republic and Hungary.\nThe fact that Sweden hasn't been a NATO member has historically been one of their competitors main arguments for not buying the Gripen.\nBut with Sweden now a member, that's of course gone from their playbooks.\nWhat's potentially an even bigger change, however, is the foreign policy shift of the Trump administration.\nUh pulling back support, as we all know, for Ukraine and raising doubts about US commitment to Europe's defense, uh which is quite frankly uncharted territory for European leaders.\nSo what's the hope then in terms of new orders for the Grip and Jet and for SAB that makes it?\nWell, Saab executives have long emphasized that the procurement of a fighter jet is as much a political process as it is a purely technical one.\nuh buying\n\n\nWeapons and military gear from the US has long been viewed as a foolproof method to reach guaranteed friendship and support. But that is now, of course, no longer the case. Uh, with some security analysts believing that trust in the US will never go back to pre-Donald Trump levels. Consequently, uh, European countries are now trying to tow the line between lessening their dependence on the US and maintaining a healthy relationship as allies. Uh, some are starting to consider dual fleets, that is, mixing European-made fighters with their F-35s, and this to make up for a potentially lower level of US air support in the region. And some analysts expect European countries to spend a far smaller portion of its defense spending on US equipment over time as it supplies more of its own fighter aircraft.\n\nThis is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe, your morning brief on the stories making news from London to Wall Street and beyond.
