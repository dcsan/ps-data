  "cleanText": "Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\n\nGood morning.\nI'm Nathan Hager and I'm Karen Moscow.\nHere are the stories we're following today.\nKaren battling back in the trade war.\nBloomberg News has learned the European Union is preparing to step up its engagement with other countries hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nLet's go to London and get the very latest with Bloomberg's James Walcott.\nGood morning, James.\nGood morning, Nathan and Karen.\nThe EU is reaching out to the likes of Canada and Japan to see if there might be a unified global response to America's trade aggression.\nThis reporting from Bloomberg comes after the US president issued a new ultimatum of a tariff rate of 30% over the weekend on the block.\nGermany's Chancellor Friedrich Mertz warned that rate of 30% would hit exporters in Europe's largest economy to the core.\nTalks are still stuck on several issues, especially cars and tariff rates on agriculture.\nBut if levies do go up in two weeks time, the EU is prepared to retaliate on roughly $84 billion worth of US goods, risking further trade escalation in London.\nJames Walco, Bloomberg Radio.\nAll right, James, thank you.\nWell, President Trump will be heading to the UK for his second state visit.\nKing Charles will host the president in September.\nTrump had warmly welcomed the offer of another state visit to Britain when he was handed the invitation by UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer in February.\nThe UK was the first country to sign a tariff reduction deal with the US in May.\nOh, before the president heads overseas, Karen, he may have found a new pressure point for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\nThe president and his allies have been seizing on cost overruns at the central bank's headquarters renovation as they continue to hammer Powell for leaving interest rates unchanged.\nThe president made the point to reporters at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington last night.\nWe should have the lowest interest rate on Earth and we don't.\nUh he just refuses to do it.\nAnd yet he's spending $2.5 billion dollars rebuilding the Fed.\nPresident Trump says he thinks Powell should quit.\nWhite House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hasset discussed it as well on ABC's this week.\nThe bottom line is that this is the most expensive project in DC history, two and a half billion dollars with a $700 billion cost overrun.\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassid on ABC's this week heard Sundays on Bloomberg radio.\nNathan, for the second time this year, the world's most powerful finance ministers gather in South Africa without the presence of US Treasury Secretary.\nScott Besson will skip the group of 20 again this week, continuing a boycott of South Africa by top US officials begun by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nHe stayed away out of scorn over his host theme for its G20 presidency of solidarity, equality, and sustainability.\nTurning now to the newest developments in the war in Ukraine.\nKaren, President Trump says the US will send more Patriot Air-Defense batteries to Ukraine.\nHe spoke with reporters on his way back to the White House.\nI haven't agreed on the number yet, but they're going to have some because they do need protection.\nBut the European Union is paying for it.\nWe're not paying anything for it, but we will send it.\nAnd it'll be business for us and we will send them Patriots which they desperately need.\nUkraine had been receiving weapons from the US but only with money remaining from former President Joe Biden's time in office.\nPresident Trump had previously refused to consider seeking additional funds, arguing it would only harden Russian President Vladimir Putin's stance and dim chances to end the fighting.\nNathan, former President Joe Biden is pushing back at one of President Trump's harshest claims about his mental acuity while he was in office.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, the former president said he made all the clemency decisions that were recorded with an auto pen and that he had orally granted all pardons and commutations issued at the end of his term.\nAnd he says President Trump and Republicans are quote liars for claiming his aids used an auto pen without his authorization.\nTurning to the latest on the flood disaster in Texas, Karen, the search for victims is expected to resume today along the Guadalupe River.\nRecovery efforts had to be put on hold yesterday with another round of heavy rains leading to high water rescues elsewhere.\nMore than 160 people may still be missing in the July 4th floods that left at least 132 dead.\nMeanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Christy Gnome is pushing back at reports that FEMA's response to the disaster was delayed.\nSo the fact that Democrats are politicizing this while people are still looking to for their babies, they're still looking for their family members, I think is absolutely despicable.\nAnd the American people just, I think, need to know the truth of what they're doing and how they're taking advantage of this situation to help themselves politically.\nHomeland Security Secretary Christy Nome appeared on Fox News Sunday, heard every Sunday on Bloomberg Radio.\nNathan Wall Street returns to work with a focus this week on inflation and earnings.\nWe get a preview with Bloomberg's Charlie Pillet.\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts are expecting the slowest profit growth rate in two years.\nEmily Roland is co-chief investment officer at Manual Life, John Hancock.\nAnalysts are penciling in 5% earnings growth for S&P 500 companies.\nThat's come down a bit.\nSo, the bar is lower.\nWe're going from 13% earnings growth.\nJust awesome results in the first quarter.\nTanks will be front and center this week with reports from JP Morgan Chase, Cityroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs.\nAlso reporting this week, 3M, General Electric, and Netflix in New York.\nCharlie Pellet, Bloomberg Radio.\nOkay, Charlie, thank you.\nFutures are lower as we begin the new trading week, but Bitcoin is on the rise again.\nIn fact, the cryptocurrency is trading at a record right now, up 2.8% 8% above $120,000.\nBitcoin is now up about 30% since December.\nNathan, we're starting to see some of the impact of the US trade war with China.\nChina ended the first half of the year with a record trade surplus of about 586 billion dollars after exports to the US began to stabilize.\nExports rose year by a higher than expected 5.8% in June.\nShipments to the US fell 16% from a year earlier after slumping by over 34% in May.\nAnd staying in Asia, Karen, the slump in Japan's long-term bonds is accelerating, pushing yields sharply higher in a move that puts global debt markets on alert.\nWhile the pressure in Japan is being heightened by a looming election on July 20th, concerns over government spending beyond their means also apply to the UK, Europe, and US.\nTime now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world.\nFor that, we're joined by Bloomberg's Michael Bar.\nMichael, good morning.\nGood morning, Karen.\nTwo women were killed and two other people were wounded in a shooting at a Lexington, Kentucky church in a rampage that began after a state trooper was shot and wounded.\nAuthorities said the suspect was also killed Sunday.\nIn a news conference, Lexington Police Chief Lawrence Weathers says it began after the trooper pulled over a vehicle near the airport.\nThe trooper had pulled over a vehicle on Terminal Drive after receiving a license plate reader alert in the area of Versailles Road.\nThe trooper was shot and the suspect fled.\nChief Weathers says the suspect then carjacked the vehicle and fled to the church where he began shooting at people there.\nThe suspect was later killed by Lexington police.\nNATO Secretary General Mark Ruda is set to meet President Donald Trump this week.\nNATO said Ruda will be in Washington today and tomorrow and will meet with Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hexith, as well as members of Congress.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is said to have fired multiple Justice Department employees who were involved in two federal prosecutions of President Trump during the Biden administration.\nThe Washington Post reports according to several people familiar with the terminations, 20 people were fired from the department, including two prosecutors who worked under former special counsel Jack Smith.\nReports of increasing tension between AG Bondi and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bonino over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.\nThere are new details now about a confrontation the two had last Wednesday with Bonino reportedly storming out afterwards.\nFormer US Attorney General Chris Christie says he believes the decision went all the way to the top.\nThere's no chance, in my opinion, that Pam Bonnie made this decision on her own.\nNo chance.\nShe was instructed by the White House that we're not releasing this stuff and that's why he's defending her.\nFormer AG Chris Christie was on ABC's This Week, heard Sundays on Bloomberg Global News 24 hours a day and whenever you want it with Bloomberg News Now.\nI'm Michael Bar and this is Bloomberg.\nKaren.\nAll right, Michael Bar.\nThank you.\nTime now for the Bloomberg sports update brought to you by Flushing Bank.\nHere's John Stash Hour.\nJohn, good morning.\nGood morning, Karen.\nBaseball has hit the All-Star break.\nThe game is tomorrow in Atlanta.\nThe home run derby tonight.\nYankees at the stadium out hit 10-2 by the Cubs who won four to one.\nSnapped a sixth inning tie with a Danby Swanson two-run homer.\nYanks got only an early home run by John Carlos Stanton.\nThe Cubs with 57 wins at the break.\nTheir most since 2008.\nYanks are 53 and 43.\nStill two games behind Toronto and now only one ahead of the red-hot Red Sox who beat Tampa Bay 4 to1.\nHave won 10 games in a row.\nMets and Kansas City shut out until two runs top of the ninth that tied the game but not for long.\nLofty over base hit.\nHere comes Tobert flying around third.\nThe throw, the dive, he's safe.\nThe Royals win it.\nA redemption swing from Nick Loftton.\nHis second game winner in the homestead.\nAnd the Royals beat the Mets 3 to2.\nRoyals TV had it.\nThey scored off Shawn Mania who in his season debut came in in relief and threw three scoreless innings before giving up that run in the ninth.\nMets 55 and 42, half game behind the Phillies.\nNationals lost 8 to1 at Milwaukee and then kicked off the MLB draft by taking as expected a high school shortstop from Oklahoma whose father played to the big leagues but not Ethan Holiday.\nHe went fourth to Colorado where his father Matt played.\nThe Nats took Eli Willlets.\nHis father Reggie played for the Angels.\nHe was recently the Yankees first base coach.\nYannik and Carlos Alcarez met five weeks ago in that French Open final that Alcarez won in five sets.\nFive and a half hours at Wimbledon.\nIt went to center in four sets and he said the loss in Paris may have helped.\nYou just have to understand what you did wrong, trying to work on that.\nThat's exactly what we did.\nWe tried to accept um the loss and then just kept working and and this is for sure one of the reasons why I hold this trophy.\nSinner and Alcarez dominating tennis.\nThey've won the last seven grand slams.\nJohn Stasher, Bloomberg Sports.\nparent Nathan.\nCoast to coast on Bloomberg radio, nationwide on SiriusXM and around the world on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Business app.\nThis is Bloomberg Daybreak.\nGood morning.\nI'm Nathan Hager on a morning where trade jitters are working through the market once again.\nPresident Trump over the weekend threatened the European Union and Mexico with 30% tariff rates, but now the president says he's still negotiating.\nSo the European Union is talking to us.\nthey want to open up their country.\nUh I would say Japan to a much lesser extent in terms of opening up their country.\nSouth Korea wants to make a deal other than tariff.\nBut after these latest tariff threats from President Trump, Bloomberg News has learned the EU is stepping up engagement with other countries that have come under the administration's trade crosshairs.\nFor more on this, we're joined by Bloomberg News senior editor Bill Ferries.\nAnd in fact, Bill, we're just seeing a headline from an EU official saying that European Commission President Ursula Vanderline is going to speak today with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\nWhat further engagement can we expect here?\nIs this a potential pivot away from US trade?\nGood morning.\nGood morning, Nathan.\nWell, the EU negotiators, I think, found uh found the talks that they've been involved in really disrupted by President Trump's announcement over the weekend that he was just uh looking for a 30% tariff on their goods.\nNegotiations had been proceeding with the assumption really uh the working assumption that perhaps there might be a lower tariff rate, but also particular carveouts for some industries.\nSo we're talking about German automakers or alcohol exports from Europe, things like that.\nSo there really had been a lot of progress made in in kind of a complex formula.\nThe president saying, you know, it might be 30% uh and we'll leave it at that.\nIt it's, you know, this could be just another negotiating tactic.\nUh you know, it's only July 14th.\nAugust 1st is still a long ways away.\nBut the EU signaling that they want to work more closely with some other US trade partners who are perhaps feeling the same kind of heat, including Japan and Canada.\nNow, it's not clear what exactly they might do.\nThey might share some uh some tips on what's going on in their own negotiations.\nThey might find a way to rroot some of the trade to help soften the blow of whatever happens with the US.\nUh but there is this sign of a little increasing unity uh for people on the other side of the negotiating table from the US when it comes to trade.\nIt's interesting uh to you know point out that uh we are days away from August 1.\nYou say it's a a long ways off, but it's just a little more than two and a half weeks.\nAnd if uh the European Union is looking to uh step up engagement with some of these very same trading partners that the US is in the middle of negotiations with, I mean, how much more is there to give potentially?\nYeah, I mean it is it is coming.\nIt is coming up soon.\nUh but it's still two and a half weeks.\nAnd I think in Trump world we've seen a we we've seen that you can get a lot of whiplash in a in a 2 and 1/2 week period.\nUh but there are you know there are there are ways for uh European uh exporters to look at perhaps different markets for some of their goods.\nUh they had reached uh you know they have reached some agreements in the past with China on trade uh with other countries.\nI think we've seen that in Asia as well.\ncountries looking to find uh alternatives to goods that traditionally went to the US.\nIt's a lot easier with things like energy and in some cases agriculture.\nUh but in the end, US is a very hard market to replace.\nSo I think at the best you hope to soften the blow, not uh not replace your trade entirely.\nOkay.\nSo, while the president continues to put pressure\n\n\nOn trade partners, we're also seeing him put even more pressure on Fed Chair Powell, not just over interest rates, but now over these uh cost overruns at the central bank's renovations.\n\nYeah, he's been obviously hammering Jay Powell for months about how he thinks Powell needs to cut rates and cut rates faster.\nHe calls him too slow.\nHe's called him a loser.\nHe's put out a lot of insults.\nIt's not clear if the goal is to just get PAL to quit, if it's to get him to actually cut those rates or what, but they have opened this new front over these renovations taking place at the Federal Reserve headquarters that the Fed itself admits have gone way over budget.\nThey say due to rising costs in the wake of the pandemic.\nThe administration, Trump and Trump's allies are saying maybe there's some mismanagement here.\nPal did address that before Congress just a couple weeks ago.\nHe gave that explanation about the rising costs and he said there's no VIP elevators, there's no fancy marble going in.\nIt's just a matter of rising costs.\nBut this is a potentially dangerous new front for the Fed chief as Congress looks to Republicans in Congress look to investigate and the administration hammers home this message that he should go.\n\nThis is
