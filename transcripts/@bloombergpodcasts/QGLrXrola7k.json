  "cleanText": "I think we can break it down into three main areas.\nThe first is there was a large client redemption in the quarter, a $52 billion client redemption from one client.\nI think that spooked investors.\nRedemptions tend to do that and that masked some otherwise really good fund flow trends.\nThe second thing I think that also spooked investors because the entire group is off today was the higher than expected inflation number, particularly as we're likely to head into a summer where tariffs are going to probably potentially boost that number higher and, you know, long dated assets and highly correlated assets like those at BlackRock are vulnerable.\nStocks are vulnerable to a correction when that happens.\nAnd then I think the third factor that drove today's performance was, for lack of a better word, the noise around all of the acquisitions that BlackRock has done.\nHaving said all that, I am still positive on the shares.\nIt's the world's largest money manager.\nIt's certainly known over the last couple of decades for the growth that it's seen when it comes to ETFs, and that's certainly Emily Fayose's specialty in her coverage here as a cross asset.\nREPORTER: But BlackRock is going through this transformation right now, private markets, infrastructure.\nWhat is its identity and how has it communicated that to investors?\nThat's a really good question because I think some of the shortfall today may have been investors sort of digesting all these changes and also some of the execution risk inherent in that strategy.\nI mean, I do like the strategy and I think BlackRock has these sort of three pillars of growth.\nOne is the ETFs, as you mentioned.\nThe other is their technology business, which is there is a secular shift among a lot of in the asset management space that's driving demand for BlackRock's technology services.\nAnd then the third leg to this strategy, which I think to your point, that perhaps BlackRock needs to perhaps be a little more granular in the strategy, you know, maybe highlight or elevate some of the people driving the strategy, and that is their shift into private assets and alternative assets.\nI think it's an important shift for BlackRock and I think it's one that will offer support to the shares valuation, but I think it's one that has, number one, some execution risk.\nAnd number two is likely to make 2025 a transitional year for the firm.\nTalk a little bit more about BlackRock's push here into private markets.\nJust how critical is it that they get this right and the earnings that we've seen so far, this report today, did it tell us anything about how successful this push into alternatives has been so far?\nSure.\nSo, you know, one of the challenges, given that given BlackRock's size, moving the needle is going to be a challenge.\nThat's number one.\nI mean, we saw the asset, the a, um, number 12 and a half trillion dollars.\nA lot of it is in ETFs or in institutionally managed assets.\nAnd so the push to alternatives is likely to take some time.\nI mean, BlackRock's aspirational goal is to have 30% of revenues coming from technology and alternatives by 2030.\nIt's about last year, I think it was about 14 or 15%.\nSo, you know, we can sort of hang our hat on that number.\nI think the other thing to remember is this strategy and I applaud this strategy.\nI do think it makes a lot of sense.\nThey have sort of and I'm going to say cobbled together and there shouldn't be a negative connotation with that.\nThey've sort of assembled a group of companies and built themselves a pipeline through which they will be able to push more product.\nAnd by that, I mean buying Global Infrastructure Partners gives them exposure to infrastructure, gives them exposure to private credit.\nThose are very important because the demand for both of those assets is expected to continue to grow, particularly among institutional pension funds, life insurance companies.\nThat's a secular shift and it's an important it's an important part of the market.\nAnd I applaud the fact that BlackRock is expanding its reach in that area.\nI have to get an ETF question in here because like Tim said, this is part of my focus on the cross as a team at Bloomberg News.\nSo BlackRock has more total ETF assets than Vanguard.\nBut when it comes to flows.\nVanguard has taken in more ETF inflows for the last five years than BlackRock.\nAnd I'm wondering if you think this is something that keeps Larry Fink up at night, this potential that Vanguard is going to overtake BlackRock in total ETF assets.\nIs this something that is important to BlackRock and is it something that you're watching?\nWell, I mean, definitely I think the ETF marketplace represents of BlackRock's ETF franchise is an attractive franchise, but I think growth there is going to be a challenge.\nI mean, the market, you know, they're the leader.\nI would also point out, though, that BlackRock's lineup of ETFs has a greater representation in some of the faster growing areas, digital assets and things, you know, alternatives, things like that.\nSo while perhaps overall flows at Vanguard may be more than at BlackRock, they're flowing into some very low fee generating businesses.\nAnd one of the strategies at BlackRock is to have a shift to assets that generate a greater revenue or, you know, a higher higher fee earning assets.\nSo I think the focus at BlackRock is to obviously maintain their dominance in the ETF market space, continue to innovate there, which they have done, but at the same time push into areas where there still is a degree of, let's just say pricing power on the part of the asset manager.\nHey, just 30 seconds, 20 seconds on on its identity.\nIf we think about peers out there, Vanguard, certainly one that Emily thinks a lot about, what about like a capital group?\nWhat are the other companies that you think are or maybe in Apollo these days like what is a a peer now to BlackRock?\nWell, that's interesting because I sort of would put, you know, if you look at again, I'm an equity analyst, and so my primary focus in terms of valuation is on the other publicly traded asset managers.\nAnd it's a very bifurcated group.\nIf you look at the way the for example, the way S&P classifies the asset management group on one end of the spectrum in terms of valuation, you have the private equity firms, Blackstone, KKR and Apollo sort of sitting right in the middle of that.\nYou have BlackRock.\nAnd then at the other end of the spectrum, you know, BlackRock with, you know, primarily a personal asset manager shifting.\nAnd then at the other end of the spectrum, you have a number of the primarily active managers.\n",
