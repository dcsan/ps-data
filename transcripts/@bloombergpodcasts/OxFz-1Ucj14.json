  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\n[Music]\nThis is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.\nThis week on the podcast, what can I say? Rich Bernstein, rock star, former chief strategist at Merrill Lynch, just an incredibly storied career, who has managed to put together such a straightforward and intelligent way to approach asset management. Rather than me babble, I'm just going to say this is a fascinating conversation. With no further ado, my discussion with Richard Bernstein Advisors, Rich Bernstein.\nThanks, Barry. Great to be here. Thanks for the invitation.\nOh, well, I'm thrilled to have you. I thought you would be the perfect person to talk about what's been going on these days. But before we get to that, let's start with bachelor's in economics from Hamilton, MBA from NYU. What was the career plan?\nSo, the career plan was um was kind of uh foiled, I would say, six months after graduation. So, uh, oddly enough, when I graduated Hamilton, I wanted to be a labor economist. And people say like today, they go, \"Labor economist? Like, what what's that all about?\"\nThat was a big thing at one point. It was a big deal. And so, it was, you got to remember, labor unions were very powerful in the late 70s, early 80s. Um, there was rampant inflation and every company had a labor relations department. It was it was a growth industry. And so I decided I wanted to be a labor economist and um got myself a job with a prestigious economic consulting firm in their labor economics department doing all kinds of uh government related work, private sector but government related work and uh we were consultants which is very critical because consultants bill by the hour and literally the day after so election day is Tuesday in 1980 November 1980 Wednesday 50% of our business basically went away because Ronald Reagan took over. Everybody called up and said, \"Stop billing. We want to see what's going to happen under the Reagan administration.\"\nWow.\nNow, I wasn't the smartest guy in the room, but it was pretty clear to me that this was no longer a growth industry. I had taught myself uh Fortran, dating myself here quite a bit. I taught myself Fortran and was a pretty good computer programmer. And a friend of mine who had gotten fired from this economic consulting firm uh got a job at Chase uh econometrics IDC and said, \"You have to come over here. You're a great programmer. You're going to love this stuff.\" They had the largest set of economic and financial databases in the world at the time. Goes, \"You have to come here.\" I said, \"I don't what do I want to go to Wall Street for?\" I mean, like I have no interest in Wall Street. Why would I go to Wall Street? And he said, \"Well, let's be honest here. The salary is twice what you're making.\" I said I said, \"Well, I'll go for the interview. You know, I'll see what happens.\" Well, I went for the interview. I got the job. My biggest client turned out to be the Merrill Lynch Investment Strategy Group.\nHuh.\nAnd that's how I got involved in Wall Street. And I found through time that I really liked it. Uh went back and got my MBA. And uh after a while, without sounding stupid about this, realized I was I knew more about this stuff than many of my clients did. And so I just worked my way through Wall Street and and eventually, you know, but if you had said to me when I graduated Hamilton that I was going to end up being the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, I would have said, \"You're crazy.\"\nYou would have left. So So I I have to ask about Fortran. Your undergraduate, your focus is economics. You get an MBA in finance. Where did the computer programming skills come from?\nI am the poster child for the liberal arts education. So, I almost double majored in philosophy. I didn't I was too lazy to be perfectly frank and didn't want to take one of the intro courses, but I took like I don't know five, six, seven philosophy courses, something like that. And for all the philosophy majors out there, I'm sure they know that a good part of philosophy is symbolic logic. And symbolic logic, what is computer programming? What is computer languages? It's just symbolic logic. So when I got introduced to Fortran the first day I realized I could actually read a lot of the code because it was just symbolic logic.\nSo it's so funny you say that philosophy is symbolic logic. Study of law is a lot of symbolic logic.\nAbsolutely. Obviously math there's a ton of symbolic logic wherever you look that classic syllogism right here is the fact pattern here's the applicable set of rules programs parameters like this seems to be a very constant thread in a lot of areas how surprising was it to you that hey philosophy has been really helpful on Wall Street\nit's it's been amazing in fact in one of the books I wrote many many moons ago I specifically thanked one of my philosophy professors for, you know, I took symbolic logic with him. I think I took a course in relativism with him. You know, all these different things which have definitely been influential in my career without a doubt.\nAll right. So, you end up at what could be my favorite advertisement, which was the E.F. Hutton ads back in the was that the 1980s when E.F. Hutton I think it was actually 70s into the 80s. Yeah. When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen. Like these, you can find these ads all over YouTube. They're seminal. How did you make your way to E.F. Hutton from Chase Econometrics?\nSo, what happened was that um at the time uh a lot of people at at Chase IDC were very in very high demand. We were uh the beginning of the quant movement on Wall Street, right? And so there were a lot of people were getting hired away. One of my friends who was more an economist as opposed to a quant guy uh got hired by the chief economist at E.F. Hutton at the time and there was an opening in the investment strategy group and he said similar like why don't you come and interview come double your salary again.\nYeah. Well, it didn't do that but uh but it was um it was an opportunity. So I I grabbed at the opportunity. I worked at the time with a a wonderful guy named Jeff Applegate who unfortunately passed away recently. But but Jeff was a great role model in terms of of how to make Wall Street understandable to non-Wall Street people.\nMhm. Huh. Really, really interesting. And then we get the 87 crash, right? And then the following year you joined Mother Merrill, right? Tell us how how you found your way to Merrill Lynch. So Merrill, you know, Hutton went out of business on basically um 19 end of '87, I think it was December of 87.\nWas that Did they go out of Wasn't it Shearson Lehman Hutton American Express or something?\nThere was like it was became Shearson Lehman Hutton. The irony of which I once worked at Shearson when they merged with Lehman Brothers and I lost my job there and now Shearson Lehman was merging with Hutton and I lost my job again. Um, so I was on the losing end of many, many mergers of the 1980s, but it was getting to Merrill was, you know, I was out of work for a while after Hutton went out of business. I had met with a a head hunter and the head hunter had set me up with a um an interview with Merrill and um Merrill kind of passed on me, but then called me back about four months later. And so their first choice turned them down.\nIs that what actually happened? What actually happened? I found my personnel file years later. I found my personnel file and um this is actually kind of funny and in it was the head hunter letter to the hiring manager and um it described me as being the cheapest of the lot with the most potential. That was the way the guy described me.\nYou're a value stock.\nI was a value stock. And so I think what happened was the everybody else they were talking to wanted too much money and they worked their way down and they found they got me.\nThat's that's unbel How did you get access to your personnel folk?\nIt was by accident. It was I was I was uh it was like switching managers type thing and somehow it got it got put into the wrong file, wrong set of files and there was mine so of course I read it.\nSo you were at Merrill for 20 years.\nAlmost 20 plus. Yeah. Right.\nWow. That's amazing. You were there right up into the financial crisis.\nI was.\nWhat was Merrill Lynch like right in the middle of that storm? So it was, you know, I think it w it was it was an interesting time and and you know, I should say first of all that Merrill was a fantastic place to work. It was, you know, anybody out there who has worked at Merrill um you know knows knows the feeling that I have for the firm and um because they feel it too and and it was a great place to work. Um the corporate culture began to change in the few years before the financial crisis and we got a little bit aways from from our roots. you know, our roots were very much as a um uh a private client oriented firm that also had great trading and investment banking, everything else, but the heart of the firm was still on the private client side. For any number of strategic reasons, the firm decided that we wanted to change that emphasis. And I think um you know, it's kind of dangerous to take a lot of risk when you don't really have the experience doing it.\nSure.\nAnd so I think that's kind of what happened to me. You know, I mentioned the E.F. Hutton ads, but for the people who are listening who are younger, I want to say in the 1970s, maybe even in the 1960s, Merrill Lynch ran a series of television ads. Merrill Lynch is bullish on America.\nAbsolutely. with with the Thundering Herd and the Big Bull and it was pretty amazing when we talk about the democratization of investing that Merrill is arguably the one of the first companies that absolutely dove into that head first.\nYeah, if I'm not mistaken, Charlie Merrill was his whole philosophy was bringing Wall Street to Main Street. I think he actually coined that phrase.\nThat I think that's right. And later on we had um a a number of the discount brokers had come out in places like Schwab and Muriel Seabbert but I always felt they had followed Merrill's lead to we're going to push into Main Street.\nSo you start out essentially as an analyst. How do you how do you work your way up to market strategist and then chief investment strategist for for the Thundering Herd?\nIt's um you know it's funny. One of the things I always tell um recent graduates of college is is don't try to plan out your future. Um because when you're 21 or 22, you have no idea what you're going to do. When you're 25 or 27 or 30, you know, you really don't know. And my example of, you know, the changes after the Reagan Carter election are are pretty clear on that one. But the same thing was at Merrill. You know, I kind of I came in as a quantist. I was there not for any other reason to be perfectly frank and I think the people involved at the time would agree with this that in institutional investor there was a quantitative analysis slot. Merrill had nobody who was there. They thought well let's let's get somebody who can maybe run for the slot. We'll get another II vote and we'll see what happens. And I was their choice to just kind of become this quant guy. I don't think they knew what to do with me. I don't think they were thinking anything else other than like, you know, go do your thing and, you know, hopefully this will all work out.\nHere's an empty desk, Rich, see what you can do.\nExactly. Right. And um it was it was actually kind of funny. I I truth be told now I can tell this. I lied about my age to get the job.\nSaying you were younger or saying you were older?\nOlder. Because I was 29 when I was interviewing for this position. Yeah. And I knew that and everybody and back then you could ask people how old you were, right? and and they couldn't Google you and find out, right? And they couldn't find out. Yeah. So, there was all kinds of all kinds of stuff that they could do back then that that you can't do now or can do now.\nDid Did you really get an MBA from NYU? Was that just your resume?\nNo, I'm That's legit. That's 100% legit. But so, what was happening was I knew that if I went to these interviews and I told people I was 29, they would think I was a kid.\nBut 30 sounds old.\n30 It's like 29.99, right? Like you just round up, you know?\nIt was a six-month fib. That's all it Well, by the time I actually got the job and showed up at Merrill, I was 30.\nSo, I didn't feel I've never felt bad about it because I was asked in every single like why would they ask? They wouldn't ask unless they thought maybe I was too young. That would be the impetus for asking the question. Nobody's going to ask the question.\nWell, how much how much experience and seasoning?\nI don't think that was the root of the question because they had my resume. They knew exactly. And so, it was really like how old is this guy? You know, can he really do this? And so, I lied. So, I told everybody I was 30. And um um so and but but that's hilarious.\nYeah, it is. It is kind of funny. And nobody ever figured out don't don't they when you're filling out your paperwork and\nnobody took the time.\nNobody cared. Nobody if you're a W2 employee. Yeah.\nThey get your date of birth and your social security number. It's it's not like the data isn't there.\nBut by the time I got to Merrill, I was 30.\nSo nobody thought twice.\nNo. Nobody thought twice about it. Yeah. That that's that's really funny. So you're at Merrill for 20 plus years. Uh we have the financial crisis and you decide to launch Rich Bernstein Advisors in 2009.\nSo in hindsight it turns out to be perfect timing, right?\nWhat sort of push back did you get when you're like I think I'm going to stand up my own shop into this mess?\nYeah, you know I left Merrill um because I'd gotten burned out. I mean, one of the things that people don't realize is as a sellside analyst, the the the better you get at your job, the demands on your time grow exponentially. And so I was traveling all over the world\n\n\nI was I was non-stop writing. I mean, it was I, I had burned out. And I tried to leave Merrill several years before, and they had they convinced me to stay. They said, \"You know, like, no, it's okay, you know, we'll, you know, we'll take care of you. Everything will be fine. Don't worry about it.\" But in 2008, in the financial crisis, I turned 50.\nUhhuh.\nAnd so, not lying about my age, I actually did turn 50. And um, and um, uh, I was pretty burned out. And then the financial crisis hit, and I thought, \"You know, it's the wrong time to leave. It'd be irresponsible for the chief strategist of Merrill Lynch to leave in the midst of a crisis. That's just very unfair to our clients, very unfair to the firm. You know, I rose to this level. I have a certain amount of responsibility. I can't be selfish on this.\" So, I stuck it out for a while, and then uh, Bank of America bought Merrill, and and they were great, and you know, everything was good, but it was clear to me I wasn't going to have more fun, right? That the burned out nature was going to continue.\nI'm done. You know, stick a fork in me. I'm, \"Hey, 20 years is a long time being a road warrior.\"\nYeah, exactly. And um, so then the question was, what was I going to do? I had toyed with the idea of opening an independent research shop and that sort of thing, but that was going to be an equal amount of travel all around the world. And I, I had just done that for 20 years. Didn't sound like a lot of fun. But then the idea came to me, \"Well, maybe we should put some of these things that we've, we've developed through the year, put it into practice and see if we can manage money doing it.\" And we were kind of forming the firm, and we were like really in its infancy, and then all of a sudden, I remember exactly where I was. I was in our our uh, den, weekly initial jobless claims had just come out. This is like in July of 2009, and the number came out, and it was a blowout good number, right?\nAnd I said to myself, \"This, this is a rogue number.\" And then I said to myself, \"Well, wait a minute, why is it a rogue number? Maybe things are just getting better,\" because I was listening to all the talking heads, and they were all negative as as all get out, and I said,\n\"Let, let me stop you right there,\" because my next question is, I very vividly remember March '09 and saying, \"Hey, US equities down 50%, usually pretty good entry point.\" I think we finished down 56, down 57%, and but the bearishness, the negativity persisted. And it felt like people were really suffering from a little post-traumatic stress disorder. I, I'm curious exactly how, as you were starting to tell us, how you were thinking around that, because everybody was so negative, and yet the data was clearly improving.\nIt was definitely improving. And so, you know, the way I described to people is I said, \"Like, you know, markets don't move on the absolutes of good or bad. Markets move on better or worse.\" And things were horrible in an absolute sense, but they were getting better, and certainly better than consensus felt like they was.\nAbsolutely. And so, you know, I just, I remember exactly where I was, and I said, \"Well, gee, you know, this could be like a big bull market.\" And and you know, I actually at one point said to potential investors, I thought that we were entering the biggest bull market of our careers. And um, you were only off by a tiny little bit. It was, it was, oh, of our careers.\nOf our careers. Yeah.\nSo, if you look at rolling, look to today, rolling 15-year periods, uh, from '09 to '04 was 16% a year.\nFrom uh, the 15-year period ending in '99 was 17% a year, and you go to the 15 years after World War II was 18. So, we're right up there. But one of the best periods in modern history for sure.\nAbsolutely. So you're you're like, \"Hey, this is going to be good.\" So if you're going to start, if you're going to start a firm, this is the time to start a firm.\nFor sure.\nSo that, that's kind of how it began, and and you know, I don't want to say that um, everything went swimmingly at the beginning. No, you're starting a firm. You know, like any, any startup, you have, you have pluses and minuses, and you, you hem, and you do different things, but through time, it's worked out pretty well.\nSo what was, you know, we stood up a firm uh, in 2013. I'm curious, and that experience was kind of surprising. I'm curious, what was the most surprising things about launching your own firm? What was like, \"I didn't expect to be doing this?\"\nSo, two things. One was that I was getting into an area that I didn't know, and I knew I didn't know the buy side the way I knew the sell side. I knew that. And um, what I didn't know was how much I didn't know. And um, so the early fits and starts were trying to hire the right people. I didn't even know enough to hire the right people. Eventually that did happen, and um, we hired a guy named John Mcome, who's still the president of the firm. But it was, it was kind of, you know, off and on. We were not doing all that well at the beginning, because largely because I didn't even know who to hire and who not to hire, because I was so inexperienced on the buy side. Um, so that was surprise number one. Surprise number two was that people would not invest with us at the time because we were too bullish. And that was fascinating. That was really...\nThat just makes you more bullish.\nOh, it did, without a doubt. I mean, but if it was, it was incredible. We were, you know, at the time, people were very cautious on the United States. If they wanted growth, whatever they determined that was, it had to be in the emerging markets. It could not be in the United States. And we were bullish, and we wanted to invest in the United States, and people just couldn't deal with that.\nI'm g, I'm going to put a little flash on what you're describing. I vividly recall writing a market commentary. I want to say September, but maybe it was October '09, and the title was \"The Most Hated Bull Rally in Market History.\" Same experience.\nUh, absolutely. It was, it was very frustrating. If you look at our early marketing materials, you will find thing comments about what we called fire extinguishers, right? And fire extinguishers were positions we would take in the portfolio that we could pull off the wall and put out the fire in the portfolio, right? Like having, you know, cash or gold or all these different things that we would include in our multi-asset portfolios so that people would feel more confident in what was going on. No, it worked, but it didn't really work because it worked psychologically, but it didn't work performance-wise.\nIt, no, it worked for, it worked for us fine, but it didn't get people across the goal line. They, they would not, they, they were too scared.\nHow long did it take before people started to say, \"Oh, maybe this Bernstein guy is on to something?\"\nYeah. Well, you know, everybody talks about it being like a hockey stick. You know, the raising assets is sort of like a hockey stick, where you think of as a turbocharger, where you're, you're kind of going along, and all of a sudden the turbocharger kicks in. You start really accelerating. That was the experience that we had in the firm. We had, we had people who knew us as a group were reasonably willing to invest with us, but to the broader audience, it was, it was much more difficult, and then as they got more confident, yeah, of course, the turbocharger started, started revving up.\nYeah.\nSo was that 6 months, 12 months, how long?\nI would measure two years. I would say, I'd measure it in years, I think. Yeah. I think, um, I don't remember the date of when we hit 5 billion, but I'm going to say it probably took us five or six years at least to get to 5 billion.\nAnd now you're over, well over 15 billion.\nYeah, we're about almost 16.\nWow. So that, that's amazing. And and this is now 15 years later, correct?\nRight. So it took you 15 years to get to $15 billion. So a billion a year. Not, not too shabby, right?\nNo, not, not bad at all. So, we were talking about launching the firm in '09, and there's a quote of yours that has always stayed with me, which is, quote, \"When the sellside indicator turns positive, leaving the firm is preferable to going on the call and telling everybody about it.\"\nExplain that, because we were talking earlier about the sort of bearish PTSD push back to anything remotely positive. Your indicia, this sellside indicator has a pretty long and storied track record at Merrill.\nIt does.\n\"Hey, this turned positive. You guys have to change your views.\" That carries no weight.\nSo, let me explain what what it is. The sellside indicator is a sentiment indicator that's based on Wall Street's consensus recommended asset allocation. So stocks, bonds, cash, how much has you put in stocks at any point in time. I started that all the way back at E.F. Hutton. You mentioned Hutton before, and and we continued it through Merrill, and Merrill still runs it today. It, it's really just looks at the equity allocation and puts basically standard deviation bands around that. And as you might expect, when Wall Street gets really bullish, that's a bearish sign. Wall Street gets really bearish, that's a bullish sign.\nSo when you said this turned positive, it was because the street was, the street got incredibly negative, incredibly negative. And so from my point of view, and what you're referring to was that, do I stay at Merrill and try to convince everybody to be more bullish, or do I go off and start my own firm? And I just thought it'd be better, given, given all the other things we've discussed, it was better to start my own firm.\nPreferable to going on the call and telling everybody about it. Like I could just imagine the sort of push back, \"Bernstein is, he's now a permable. He's crazy. How, we, we just are in the middle of this crisis. How on earth can we recommend clients buying equities?\"\nThat's the sort of stuff you...\nAnd and it was the kind of thing where, you know, certainly on the private client side, for those of you who remember, you know, in in 2008, '09, '10, '11, '12, the story was all about bonds, bonds, bonds, bonds, and nobody wanted the risk of equities. And if you twisted their arm, maybe they would invest in large cap, high quality, dividend-paying stocks, but there was no way that they were going to take any kind of beta risk.\nSo no technology, no growth firms, nothing with any amount of potential volatility.\nNo volatility was, was terrible. Risk-taking was terrible. They were under their desk in the fetal position.\nAnd in hindsight, was there a better time ever to put money into those sort of stocks?\nI'm not sure. In our careers, there has been. Maybe, maybe '82, right? If you think back to '82, right in the beginning, maybe, maybe '82 was, was a time, and I do remember that, I'm old enough where I do remember um, you know, what, what the sentiment was like, and certainly I was, I had very little experience on Wall Street. I know what my sentiment was like in '82. I couldn't believe that the market would be going up, and um, but I...\nWell, you just had a 16-year bare market. Yeah. You finally got over a thousand on the Dow, which I want to say we first kissed in '66, something like that, right? So it's 16 years later again. Everybody seems to always be looking backwards, not, and so the lesson, the lesson from that, you know, when I was a young pup was, you know, gee, I really didn't know what I was talking about, and um, you know, I learned that from, from various people working on Wall Street, and uh, you know, so when it came to '09, I was kind of determined not to make the same mistake again. So, it's funny, because another quote of yours kind of cracked me up that I always found this intriguing. You suggest always have a 10% annual target for the S&P 500, despite being bearish. I love that optimism, but how can you maintain that bullishness when you're bearish?\nYes. So, what, Barry, as I'm sure you know, the sellside strategists are always pestered for their target, right? \"What's your target on the S&P?\" And I used to think that was the most watched, least important thing I ever did, right? And so I would never put a number out. I would never give people a firm number, but I, I would always answer the question by saying, \"Well, we don't really have an official target, but we have a 10% expected return.\" And nobody ever noticed that 10% is roughly the long-term average return of the S&P with dividend reinvesting, 10%. So I used to always say 10%. And and that would make everybody happy. And so regardless whether I was bullish or bearish, I always answer the question saying, \"Oh, I don't know. We have a 10% expected return.\" And and that kept people satisfied. But I, I really don't think that the notion of what is your target is an appropriate thing to discuss as an investor. Look, if you want to be a trader, and you want to, you want to, you know, do a lot of short-term trading, I get that, and I understand it. For an investor, I think it's kind of a silly discussion.\nHuh. Really, really amusing. Um, on your website and elsewhere, I've seen the phrase from you, \"active investing.\"\nYes.\nDefine what active investing, right? So, PACtive, which is a trademark term.\nSo, literally my next question, I saw the registered trademark.\nIt is a trademark term of RBA.\nYou literally did that. That's fair.\nWe did that. And um, uh, so PAC stands for the active use of passive investor investments, and what we're really referring to here are a lot of ETFs, and you know, we're a macro firm. We claim to know nothing about Coke versus Pepsi. Um, but rather, you know, we look at size, style, geography, and you know, asset allocation, things like that, and ETFs are right in our wheelhouse. It's, it's a, been a great invention, and we're very big users of ETFs. Jack Bogle, I met many times when he was alive, and I always thought he was one of the smartest guys I ever met uh, in my career. But one of the things that, and Jack would always say, \"Don't, don't talk to an active manager, just go buy an index.\" Okay, fine. But what Jack...\n\n\nwould and that's an interesting discussion. We can have the discussion all day long as to why that happens or doesn't happen, whether he's right or wrong. But the one thing that Jack would never tell anybody is what index to buy and when.\n\nRight? And you know, one may say, well, that sounds silly. But there's been many times in the past where if you had bought the wrong index at the wrong time, your portfolio suffered dramatically for an extended period of time. For instance, if you had bought NASDAQ or even the S&P ETF in March of 2000, for sure, right? You then entered the lost decade in equities, right? And your return for a decade was slightly negative. If you had been in other things like emerging markets or energy or you know all kinds of small caps, all these different things, you would have done fabulously well.\n\nUm, you know, if you bought small caps at the peak of the small cap bull market in 1983, it took you 17 years to catch up to the S&P. So you would have been neutral. So you know, everybody says, oh, I'm a I'm a long-term investor. I'm just going to buy an index. If you buy the wrong index at the wrong time, it can have a real detrimental effect. Then that's what passive investing is supposed to be all about is the active decision making around these passive investments.\n\nSo, so let's delve into that decision making. How do you decide which index is the one that you want to own? What data are you looking at? How are you crunching numbers for this?\n\nRight. So Barry, I I mentioned that we are uh macro investors. You know, we're not we're not looking at individual stocks. So everything we do is going to fall under some macro umbrella of one form or another. And the way to think about it is it's going to fall into three categories. Everything we look at is going to fall into three categories. Number one would be corporate profits.\n\nUh one of the things that I wrote about extensively, even when I was at Merrill Lynch, through my entire career is I've argued that equity investors spend too much time worrying about the economy and not enough time worrying about corporate profits. The stock market doesn't really care about GDP. The stock market cares about corporate profits because the GDP is reflected in profits if it's trending the right way. GDP is going to be a contributor. But a lot of other things contribute to corporate profits. We're looking at corporate profits and profit cycles, not economic cycles. Number two category is going to be what we call liquidity. And liquidity is going to be anything from central banks, central bank actions to lending standards from banks. Um, anything that's going to allow uh more leverage and greater liquidity and investable assets in the stock market. And then number three is going to be sentiment and valuation. Now sometimes people say sentiment and valuation, why are they together? And the my answer to that is the other, right?\n\nYeah. My answer is that valuation is a reflection of sentiment.\n\nHas to be.\n\nYeah. You can't have an overvalued asset that people hate or an undervalued asset that people love. That that doesn't make any sense. So So valuation is going to reflect sentiment. And so what we're basically looking for, if you think about those three categories I just mentioned, we're looking for situations where fundamentals are improving, liquidity is is adequate or getting better and everybody hates it. Or vice versa, where fundamentals are deteriorating, liquidity is drawing up and everybody loves it. We're going to try and stay away from that. That's that's a maybe a gross simplification of what we do, but but that's kind of what we do.\n\nBut but that's pactive. That's how you're selecting from broad indexes just the right index at the right time and avoiding the wrong index at the wrong time.\n\nCorrect. That's exactly what we're trying to do.\n\nUh really interesting. One of the things that comes up when we're talking about various style investing um comes right from one of your books and it's about media noise. How do you focus on the right index when there's so much noise and so much stuff going on and it's especially with algorithmic social media? It's just a fire hose nonsense. How do you separate the signal from the noise?\n\nYeah. So, I I wrote a book in 2000, so 25 years ago, I wrote a book that was called Navigate the Noise investing in the new age of media and hype. 25 years ago I wrote about the new age of media and\n\nyou were ahead of the curve.\n\nYou think it's gotten a bit worse since uh in the last 25 years. So So to just as a reminder, this is pre Twitter, pre Facebook, pre-LinkedIn, forget Instagram, Tik Tok, like this was just like message boards and websites.\n\nYeah. I mean, you're just beginning to to get websites in in depth, but we're really still talking about a period of hard copy research reports and television.\n\nWow.\n\nThat's really what you know, the main stay of what what what people were looking at. The point of the book was to say that building wealth for an individual investor is actually not that difficult. Why don't people do it? Why don't people do this? Is is kind of silly. And\n\nwell, wait, when you say it's not that difficult,\n\nwe we intellectually understand like my friend Dave Nadig loves to say investing is a problem that's been solved, but the problem that hasn't been solved is the human behavior around it.\n\nExactly. Exactly. And so what the book tries to argue is that there's some very sound principles that everybody should be following to build wealth, but yet there's this siren song, if you will, if you're into Greek mythology. there's a siren song of things telling you of of noise telling you that there's something newer, better, get rich quick, you know, all these kind of things that are going on. And to continue with that, your portfolio of it follows that sound and crashes on the rocks if you want the mythology uh example.\n\nAnd so what the book says is the way to solve this problem of this incessant noise is to hardcore follow a process. and come hell or high water, you're gonna stick to that process.\n\nThat's the mask you tie yourself to.\n\nThat exactly right. And put the wax in your ears, the whole routine, right? And and that's that's what we do as a firm. We have a very hardcore process. It's macro driven, but we're going to follow that process come hell or high water.\n\nUm, you know, it's it's funny. Uh, people understand that and they understand what we do. They understand why they do. They understand the the the notion of the book. Um but yet they get very angry when we're not following the siren song of what's the newest baddest, you know, shiniest object uh that's out there. So so walk us through the process. Uh I know you have a couple of core beliefs in your process. Tell us about it.\n\nSo I mentioned profit cycles. I think for us that is that is the most important part of our process. And as I said before, people spend too much time worrying about economic cycles and not enough time worrying about profit cycles. Define profit cycle and and because we are all familiar with the business cycle and the economic cycle, what is a profit cycle?\n\nSo, so you know, whereas people look at GDP growth or or industrial production growth and they say this is the economic cycle. What we're looking at is corporate profits growth. Now, let's just as an example, we look at profit cycles all around the world, but let's take for example the S&P 500, the US profit cycle. What happens is the the difference between an economic cycle and a profit cycle. Number one is that profit cycles tend to boom and bust. Uh fortunately the overall economy does not do that on a regular basis. And secondly, profit cycles have a shorter periodicity. So you can get multiple profit cycles in one economic cycle.\n\nPeriodicity meaning\n\nthe amount of time.\n\nRight. Got it.\n\nRight. So whereas an economic cycle maybe it's going to take four or eight years, you could have multiple profit cycles in that four or eight year period. So, so how do you define the peak and the trough of a profit cycle?\n\nSo, what happens is, you know, if you look at the growth rate of corporate profits, you will see it follows a pretty normal cycle through time. And our challenge as investors is to find uh indicators that will allow us to effectively forecast that profit cycle. Now we don't really care whether the profit cycle whether earnings growth is going to be 7% or 8% or 10% which is very common question people get asked or minus five or minus 6 or - 7. We kind of want to know is it getting better or is it getting worse, trending up or down?\n\nExactly. So if profits grow this 5%, what's the probability of it going to 10% as opposed to going to zero.\n\nMhm.\n\nSo we spend an awful lot of time with a lot of indicators uh that that look at that. What do the indicators look at?\n\nWell, look, profitability is a pretty simple formula. It's how many how much stuff are you selling and what's your margin per item? I mean, that's really all profitability is.\n\nWell, but there's a couple of factors that go in. What is the cost of capital and credit and inflation rates?\n\nBut that would be in your margin, right? I mean, and and so\n\nwhich affects profits,\n\nwhich affects profit. So all our indicators are either going to try to figure out how much stuff is is let's take the S&P 500 are S&P 500 companies going to sell and what's going to be their margin per product. So margin as you point out could be interest rates. It could be labor costs. It could be pricing power because of inflation. People forget inflation isn't bad for a lot of corporate profits. For sure we certainly learned that during the pandemic.\n\nExactly. So, so those are the type of things that we're looking at in terms of profit cycle. And as I said, we look at profit cycles all around the world. We look at them by region, by country, we look at by sectors, you know, we look at profit cycles for say the tech sector for the consumer staple sector or something like that as well.\n\nSo, so profit cycle is a one of the it's the key.\n\nAll right. What what are the other elements that you're considering in addition to the profit cycle?\n\nSo, next would be liquidity. Okay. And liquidity is a function of of several different things. It's obviously a function of monetary policy. We follow monetary policy in 43 countries around the world. I know that sounds silly. And and obviously in the G7 or G10, you get a lot more information than you would in, you know, some weird emerging market country, but we do follow uh central bank policy. Um we follow yield curves, the slope of the yield curves, right? whether you've got uh a bullish steepening of the curve. In other words, are interest rates coming down but the curve is steepening. Interest rates going up but the curve is steepening or is the curve inverting? I mean we look at all these different things. They have different implications for sector rotation and things like that as well.\n\nSo um and then we follow things like bank lending standards. Now that's obviously you can only get that in the most developed countries, right? But that's an important consideration as well. Are banks tightening credit or easing credit? People say, \"Well, doesn't doesn't the central bank control that?\" Well, not really. You can kind of lead a horse to water, but you can't make it lend. And and so so you want to look at both central bank policies and the willingness of banks to lend.\n\nHow how does the role of fiscal stimulus and spending play into liquidity issues?\n\nYeah. So to some extent it does um and uh it's going to affect more it's going to feed into our more through the corporate profit side in terms of how much stuff are you going to sell right because fiscal stimulus is trying to stimulate consumption or or aggregate demand if you prefer to be a real economist here. It's going to try and stimulate aggregate demand and um that'll show up in our stuff type.\n\nAll right. So, so we have the profit cycle, we have liquidity, and what's the third?\n\nThe third is sentiment and valuation, right?\n\nOkay. So, obviously we want uh we prefer to look at at uh more undervalued situations. Sentiment, we're trying to look for basically assets that people hate. Valuation will reflect that. You know, if something's really undervalued, something's really cheap, it reflects that people don't like it, you know, and and it's just like any other good in any other market. Um, if something's really expensive, it means people like it.\n\nSo, two questions from that. The first is, how do you distinguish, and I already know the answer to this, but how do you distinguish between a stock that is disliked and cheap and a stock that's cheap because it's in trouble.\n\nYeah. So, what you're referring to, now we wouldn't do this for individual stocks, but we would do it for for regions or sectors or whatever. You know, the commonly called the value trap.\n\nYes. The value trap is something that's cheap for good reason. And so what we do, we have models that try to look at various industry sectors, countries, whatever that are trying to look for not only cheapness, but some acceleration of corporate profits, right? And and we won't invest in anything just because it's cheap. That doesn't mean anything to us. It's it's cheap plus some other indicator.\n\nCorrect. And then and then the other question is uh consumer sentiment seems to have gone off the rails post pandemic. If you look at where uh and I suspect this is a measurement problem but I want to get your sense. So if you look at the University of Michigan consumer sentiment data for the better part of the past five years. It's worse than the worst part of the pandemic, worse than the financial crisis, the 87 crash, like on and on. It's shocking. Worse than 9/11 and the dot implosion. Like, wait, things aren't that bad.\n\nNo, they're not that bad at all.\n\nWhat's going on with that sort of sentiment? And what how do you use sentiment when you're trying to manage around this? you're asking I think a more complicated question maybe even you you think you're asking but you know everybody knows that we're in a very uncertain environment and I think that those consumer sentiment readings right now reflect that immense uncertainty if you were to ask normal people they might not use the word uncertainty they might use the word chaos they might use there's all kinds of different words that people would use I think that's what's being reflected in those consumer sentiment numbers right now is is the uncertainty the impact that's having. You know, there's other surveys uh out there that are showing similar type levels of uncertainty or concern uh that\n\n\nAren't related to the consumer, but I think it's a reflection of this. It's become a hackneed word, uncertainty. I think that's what you're seeing.\nI prefer the lack of clarity to uncertainty. But let me bring this back to your book, *Navigate the Noise*. How much of this is a function of algorithmic social media, which there was recently a study, I want to say it was Oxford Reuters, that said Americans now get more of their news from social media than anywhere else.\nYeah.\nBig, big uh issue. And then secondly, um, it seems like in the world of clickbait, crazy headlines, the media itself, if not the news stories or columns, but the headlines certainly seem to be more and more extreme.\nUnbelievable. So, you know, I don't know how to answer that from a societal point of view, but I can answer it from my point of view as sort of a fiduciary and an investor of other people's money.\nI think it is my obligation, two things. It is my obligation number one to be as dispassionate about my politics as I possibly can. I mean, if you want to go have a beer, we can talk politics. That's fine. But I'm saying when I'm investing, you have to be as dispassionate as you can possibly be. And number two, I think it's incumbent of all of us who manage money to search for truly unbiased sources. Not who's going to give us the most frequent news, but who's going to give us news that is unbiased. And I think it's incumbent on all of us to do that. And um, I have found that in the last year or so that my choices of news media and what I read and what I pay attention to has changed because of that.\nUm, flesh that out a little bit. Feel free to name names. You know, a lot of people, I think one of the questions you had planned to ask me was, what are you reading these days? And my answer is, I don't read an awful lot really of uh these days because there's so much going on. But what I have begun to do is listen to podcasts.\nOkay. Go on. Tell me about this podcast, like this one. No, but I'm buttering you up here. But um, go on more up. Sure.\nThere's three that I would recommend to everybody.\nOne is actually right here at Bloomberg. Bloomberg Law, and you'd say, like, why June Brasso?\nYeah. Exactly. Why would you listen? Why would you listen to Bloomberg? It's fascinating.\nAnd my answer is because everything these days is ending up in the courts.\nHave we ever had more issues with government in the courts than ever before? Certainly.\nI'm not a lawyer. I don't know squat about, you know, constitutional theory and everything else. And I'm sure most people don't either, but they're going to listen to some whackadoodle guy talk about this. I'd rather listen to people who have are well-grounded opinions and understand the history of law in terms of doing that. So, this is...\nI'm so glad you brought that up because we went through a run starting in 2020 where every talking pundit, Yahoo, first they were an epidemiologist. Exactly. Then they were a virologist. Then they were a constitutional scholar. Then they were a military strategist. You know, when someone asks you, \"Was COVID uh from the wet lab or wet market or escape from the lab?\" It's okay to say, \"How the hell do I know? I have no expertise in that. Why are you asking me?\"\nRight. But everybody had an opinion.\nSo it seemed, right?\nExactly. Exactly. And so, um, yeah, the other thing along with that that I love is that well-known epidemiologists are idiots, but the guy down at GNC who sells me protein powder, he's a genius and he knows my health better than anybody. I mean, it's just like, come on. There was a New Yorker cartoon that I vividly remember right in the middle of pandemic. It's the body of an airplane and there's a guy standing up in row 17B, right? Saying, \"Ah, we're tired of these pilots telling us what to do. Who's with me?\" And it was like that. Just sort of let the pilots fly the plane, just sit down.\nSo, Bloomberg Law is one that I listen to. I'm not going to say regularly because I don't have the time to listen to every single one all the time.\nI think...\nBut if I get a chance, I listen to it. That's a fascinating show. I'm like, you're surprising me because I do the same as you. I listen to a lot of them. Tell us the other two.\nYeah. So, the other two um are actually on NPR, which I realize people have now suddenly decided I'm a wideeyed liberal. Can I tell you my wife, every time I get into the car and she's been driving my car, it's on NPR on satellite radio, and I had the same thought until you listen to a few of them.\nAnd they're fascinating.\nThey are. And there's two shows in particular that I would recommend, two podcasts in particular I would recommend from NPR. One is called *Left, Right, and Center*.\nWhich, as the name implies, you have three people talking about issues. One from the left, one to the right, and one from the center.\nWait, they're going to give us all views. Who could have imagined that?\nWho could have imagined that? Exactly. And they pick a topic, and sometimes I'm really interested in topics, sometimes I'm not. But whatever. The fact that you've got left, right, and center in the same podcast is extraordinarily rare. You don't get that a lot. Um, so that's number one. And the other one is another NPR podcast called *Open to Debate*, which is very similar. They pick a topic and and this is more like a traditional debate where they have debating rules and all kinds of things, but it's a debate and and you're going to hear two sides of an issue. Now, look, sometimes the issues you don't care about. Sometimes they're very important. Sometimes they're really cool, sometimes they're not. I get that. But I think it's incumbent on us as a class of money managers and and fiduciaries to search out those kind of shows. I would argue if you are a fiduciary and you are constantly listening to MSNBC or Fox or Newsmax or whatever, right, you're doing a disservice to your clients for sure.\nSo, so there are two things I have to share with you because you're right right in my favorite space. One is *Planet Money* on NPR is something that they take this obscure fascinating little topic and we'll do a whole like way down the rabbit hole deep dive. Um, I don't know if you recall during the Clinton administration, hey, we're having problems with wealth inequality and so we're going to cap how much we can pay CEOs in cash, right? If you want to give them risky stock options, you can. And the unintended consequences is it 10xed the wealth gap. And just stories like that that are fascinating.\nThe other thing is you raised a point. I know you're not a lawyer, but I'm a recovering attorney. And the most applicable thing to investing you learn in law school is you have to be able to not just argue your case. You need to know the other side's case better than they do.\nAnd that translates into equities as you can't be bullish unless you can really state the bearish case.\nAnd vice versa. Correct. You want to be bearish, you better know what what are the best arguments for being bullish here. And I can't tell you how many people fail that test. And I bet you see it.\nBack to post09. If you're super bearish, the only question I have for those people, give me what the bull case is. And if they can't even imagine it, well, now I'm going leverage long because that failure of imagination means everybody's too bearish.\nYep. And it's interesting you said that there are times we don't do this regularly, but there are times where we do point counterpoint in our investment committee meetings. Exactly. For that reason, just so you're making both sides, just so we're being seen. It's one of these things that until you go through the exercise...\nYeah. It's like if you have an extreme position and you come out the other side of that discussion and you still have that extreme position, either someone wasn't making the argument well or hey, maybe the world really is coming to an end.\nBut most so far that's been the losing bet.\nYeah. So given what's going on with technology and AI and automation and all the latest greatest new fangled things, is anybody today a better investor than they were 10, 20, 30 years ago, 50 years ago? Has the bar since Charles Dao launched *Barron's* in 1890, has anything improved for the average investor? I think I think the amount the amount of information that an investor can get obviously has gotten greater, right? I mean, even if you think private, but it's all public. It's reg FD. So, does it help them?\nNo, I don't think it does. And I think I think that um, you know, the notion that somehow we have evolved and we are smarter, better investors than ever before, I think that's hogwash. I think that's complete hogwash. People are still underperforming like they always did. So, it's not the strategies, it's not the vehicles, although we get great tax and cost benefits with ETFs. Um, how much of this is just simply comes down to human behavior and human nature, right? And people are still people and we're still making the same mistakes over and over and over again.\nYeah. I mean, there is something to be said for behavioral finance and and the biases that we bring to the table. It's pretty hard to not be human.\nIt very much is. Um, so let's bring this back to, you know, where we are in the market today and what's going on. We just made new all-time highs in the S&P and in the NASDAQ.\nI always learned that all-time highs are the most bullish thing you can see. Um, perhaps not the very last one, but the hundred before it are super bullish. How do you look at the market and say everybody seems to dislike this market and yet we made fresh all-time highs?\nYeah. So I think Barry, I think that um, we've said a number of times that we think it is a mistake right now to think of the market sort of in quotes, that that's what people are very um, very focused on right now. We think that's a mistake. Why is it a mistake? Because the market is dominated by seven or 10 or 15 companies and and we really have an extraordinarily bifurcated market in that respect. And I'm not saying anything that people don't know. Of course, everybody, everybody knows about the Magnificent 7. Who doesn't?\nUm, although they've the Mag Seven have been the lag seven for most of this year.\nCorrect. Correct. Now that's that's that's where I was going. Exactly.\nRight. The that but the enthusiasm surrounding those seven stocks is is not changing. And and our view has been that okay, you want to go play those seven stocks, go play the seven stocks. You don't need us.\nUm, we're looking at everything else in the world. And and I've just I've I've said to our investors many times, are there really only seven growth stories in the entire global equity market? Of course not. There's tons of them. And and we've shown people how many companies are actually growing earnings 25% or more. And how the Mag Seven doesn't really even fit into that group, that there are companies that are growing, you know, much faster for and with with, you know, similar consistency. And um, so I think if you're invested in an S&P index fund\nor you are invested solely in the MAG7 or solely in NASDAQ, I think the next three, five, 10 years might be very disappointing.\nI think if you're in everything else, and we could define, you know, that's I'll leave it to everybody else to define how they define everything else, but I think if you're in everything else, I think you're going to do just fine. I think you're going to have a great time. So, so let's talk about not everything else but one of the else things, which has been international stocks. Um, when we look at either developed ex-US or emerging markets, these are areas that have underperformed the US for 10, 15 years. Absolutely.\nAnd over the past year we've started to see signs that hey, maybe this underperformance isn't going to persist. XUS stocks have been doing much better than US, certainly year to date in 2025, and we're recording this late June, maybe it's been about a year or more of outperformance. How do you look at the world of international stocks? What parts of the world look interesting to you?\nSo I will, I will twist your question a little bit and I will say that um, one of the thing, one of the aspects, one of the segments of the global equity markets that we are very bullish on is what I will call international quality non-US quality stocks.\nThat's not...\nWell, I'm just saying as opposed to a country or something. People like to talk about countries, but I think um, uh, the reason I say this is that uh, the median projected growth rate among high-quality non-US stocks is actually equal, maybe even a touch higher than the median growth rate among the Magnificent 7.\nWow.\nSo, we'll talk basically similar type growth.\nUm, they offer dividend yields of three, four, maybe a little, maybe even four and a half percent depending on how you look at this, but let's say 3 to 4% dividend yield, and they sell for a third to a half of the valuation of the Magnificent 7. So the way I describe it to people is, if somebody came to you and offered you a Maserati for the price of a Chevy, or to be fair here, if somebody offered you Manolo Blahniks for the price of hush puppies, I think we would all say, yes, I will do that. By the way, can I have two?\nRight?\nBut when we get to the stock market, this is like unimportant to people. They don't understand that that there's a value assessment made in everything we do all the time. But for some reason, it stocks. It doesn't appear. So the way I describe it is, you know, the Blahniks and the Maseratis are on sale. We think that's a great thing to do.\n\n\nWe'll take two. Thank you.\n\nSo, you're naming, uh, two Italian companies. I just chose them because everybody knows. But the reason I bring that up is you're not stock pickers. You're geography, sector, style selectors. So if someone says, \"Hey, that Rich Bernstein is on to something. I want exposure to fast-growing, high-quality, inexpensive companies. What sectors are they looking at?\"\n\nSo for us, um, I will name the ETF that we hold with all due, uh, legal disclaimers here that we hold this ETF. We have held it. We still hold it. Blah, blah, blah. You know, however, I can, uh, alert people that we, I'm talking my book a little bit here. Um, the, the, it's, it's the, um, IQLT is the ticker symbol, the International Quality ETF. And, um, it's a great way. It's actually, uh, I believe Epha based, so you're getting multiple countries. It's probably about Europe and the Far East and Asia, correct? It's probably going to be Australia. It's probably going to be about, um, 60 to 70% Europe. I don't have the stats in front of me, but something like that. So I think, you know, that's, that's an area that people aren't thinking about at all.\n\nSo here's the macro pushback, and I'm not saying this is, let me just play devil's advocate. Europe has structural problems. Brexit is an issue. Now, with the Trump administration, Europe's going to have to step up and fund more of their own military and defense. Uh, Europe has problems, and they're not going to be clear of these for decades. And that could be true, or that might not be true. Okay. But is it relevant? Notice, notice what I said was that they offer earnings growth that is comparable to that of the Mag 7. And I think that's the point that I'm trying to make, that despite all these problems that everybody is well familiar with, somehow these companies are putting, you know, are, are, have earnings growth, projected earnings growth that's roughly similar, a little bit more than the magnificent 7, and these are quality companies, and they're XUS. And so if you have a huge home country bias and you want a little diversification, you can look overseas to reasonably price quality companies, and if you think the dollar is going to weaken, it's all the best.\n\nWhat are we down, 8, 8 and a half percent year to date? Something like that. Um, so I know you're not a currency analyst, and you don't make those sort of calls. How do you look at what happens post April 2nd, uh, Liberation Day, and the ongoing weakness in the dollar? Does this come into your calculus, or is this just more noise that nobody is? Not, not in terms of, of, you know, the, the short, intermediate term, the way most people would think, but we think there are structural issues in the United States that transcend the current politics, transcend the current politics, and, uh, have been around for longer than people think and are detrimental to the US economy, and, and we find that very interesting that, you know, you hear all the time about debt and deficits, and there's some day of reckoning coming.\n\nMy entire adult life, I've been hearing, yeah, and I, I love that because the, the speaker usually is saying, \"I have some insight, and for some reason, the markets don't appreciate my insight.\" And I love that. Like, you know, we're all so smart, and the market's stupid. No, it's actually the other way around. The markets have figured this out over the past 10 to 15 years. And what I'm talking about is if you look at the spread between treasuries and AAA-rated sovereign debt through time, what you will find is when the United States was rated AAA, our yields were roughly in line with other AAA-rated sovereign debt. Since the initial downgrade in 2011, and since then non-stop, we have sold at a risk premium yield. In other words, we're trading more like a lower quality bond relative to AAA-rated sovereigns, meaning all this negativity is in the price range. It's, it's, it's, it's there. The markets have been well aware of it. There's no day of reckoning. It's like a slow bleed.\n\nAnd so what's been, if you think about how everything in the United States priced off the 10-year, mortgages, munis, corporate bonds, everything's priced off the 10-year, the fact that we're paying it at, you know, right now it's just under 200 basis points of extra yield because of our lack of fiscal discipline, that's translating through to higher interest costs throughout the entire economy. It's not just the government. It's through the entire economy. Why don't people, why aren't people aware of this? Well, because over the past 5 to 10 years, we've had low absolute rates of interest. The point I'm trying to make is we've still been penalized relative to other countries despite that absolute low rate of interest, and people haven't realized that. So, we're already being penalized, and I think there's, there's a real, um, I think everybody should be concerned about that. It's clear that neither party has a real interest in fiscal discipline right now. So we should assume that that, that penalty against the United States is going to, uh, continue to exist, if not expand.\n\nSo let me push back and and play a little devil's advocate about that. Hey, Uncle Sam was borrowing at next to nothing. We've been running up deficits for a hundred years. Um, COVID happens. Everybody's stuck at home. CARES Act One is the biggest fiscal stimulus, at least as a percentage of GDP, since World War II. Then you add the second CARES Act under Trump, the third CARES Act under Biden, to say nothing of the other, um, 10-year fiscal stimulus plans passed under Biden. And that pig working its way through the python caused a giant spike in inflation, plus supply chains, blah, blah, blah. And now that that's come out the other, and so the Fed had to respond. Whether, whether, whether the Fed brought inflation down or it was simply unwinding naturally is another debate. But, um, once the Fed brings rates back down, this penalty will go away, if and when the Fed finally does that.\n\nWell, the, that's important because remember in the period I'm talking about, which is almost 15 years now, you've got periods, you've got multiple, multiple presidents. Mhm. Um, you've got multiple Fed regimes, and the penalty doesn't go away, and I think that's, so no matter, even at zero, we were paying a penalty because other, other countries had negative negatives. So there was still the penalty there. We were still being penalized. It's, it's crazy, and that, that I think is something that's lurking in the background that people are not paying attention to, especially people who say that there a day of reckoning is coming.\n\nYou're saying it came and it's still here. It's ongoing.\n\nIt's ongoing. It's just not big enough for anybody to notice. It's, it's like, it's as I said, it's like water torture. Uh-huh. The slow bleed. That's really, that's really fascinating. Let's jump to our favorite questions, starting with, you mentioned some of the podcasts you're listening to. What, what else are you streaming? What's keeping you entertained these days?\n\nSo, streaming, I'm, I'm, I'm in a little bit of a rut in streaming right now. Yeah, I'm having, tr, everybody, you know, like everybody's got their favorite, uh, you know, streaming show that they like, and if you ask anybody, people come up with like four of them. Oh, you got to watch this. You got to watch this. And all of a sudden, it's like it all blends together, and you can't keep it together. Um, so I, I'm a touch lost right now in, in terms of streaming. Um, I won't say give me suggestions because I won't remember it as soon as I leave.\n\nI'm just going to give you one because it's quirky and interesting.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's called Department Q.\n\nDepartment Q.\n\nRight. So, this is, um, a limited nine-episode series on Netflix. Uh, uh, detective, uh, is shot, his partner is injured, the third, um, person is killed at, at the site, and he basically is appointed head of the cold case division. They're just standing up.\n\nThat's the kind of stuff I love.\n\nAnd it's in Scottish, and I normally don't love police procedurals.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nThis is kind of fascinating. It's, it's, it sort of builds slowly over time. Like I could give you a hundred others that you, you wouldn't care about, but I kind of know the sort of of stuff, um, good you like, but it's quirky and weird, but really interesting. If there, if you're going to have any complaint over it, and I don't think this is a complaint, but the complaints I can imagine are, well, this builds slowly. I'm like, \"Yeah, it's not just, you know, if you want to open with a chasing James Bond and Mission Impossible, you know, where to go find this is a little, a little more.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, well, I'm curious to see how Department Q. Such a, such an odd, um,\n\nLet's talk about mentors. You referenced one of them. Who were the folks who helped shape your career?\n\nSo, I would say there were, there were several. Um, one that had an immense, uh, impact on me was the person who hired me at Merrill, uh, Chuck Clow. Chuck Clow at the time was Merrill's chief strategist. He's, he's,\n\nI know that name from way back when.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was the chief strategist at, at Merrill from '87 to 2000, something like that.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd, um, Chuck gave me two pieces of advice, which, which, um, he, he claims he doesn't remember that he gave me, but I'm sure he does. The first was my first day when I walked in at Merrill, and I kind of said like, \"What do you think I should be focusing on?\" And he said to me, \"I don't really care. Just don't make a fool of yourself.\"\n\nBy the way, that's good advice for anybody, anywhere, anytime.\n\nIt was. And I at first I was very put off, like this guy doesn't care about me. Like what is this all about, you know? But what he was saying was you're a grown-up.\n\nRight.\n\nRight. You don't, you, Yeah. Exactly. You don't need me to tell you what you should do, but be aware. Don't make a fool of yourself. Don't, don't do stupid things.\n\nSecond thing he told me, which I live by to this day, and I tell this to people all the time, he said, \"Make sure you're a star and not a Roman candle.\"\n\nHuh?\n\nWhich I thought, I still think to this day is fantastic advice.\n\nSo, persistency, not, don't just flame out.\n\nDon't flame out. Don't be the 10-minute, you know, thing. Be, be the star. That to be a star is harder than you think. And, but be a star. Don't be a Roman candle. That I still to my day live my professional career that way.\n\nI, I think, I think that's great. Um, you said you don't read a lot, but you've written several books. I know there are books that have influenced you. What are some of your favorites? Do you read anything on vacation?\n\nSo I do what I tend to read, um, I, I don't have any one book that I would give you, but I, I will tell you I tend to read a lot of espionage, spy, and espionage type stuff.\n\nOkay. And the reason why is that as these things progress, and as the stories progress, not, not like, as you said, not like James Bond type stuff, but, but it's, it, it's almost like solving a puzzle, or, or completing, Yeah, completing a puzzle in, in some way. And, and I find that fascinating. I find, you know, I was always in high school, my favorite math was, was geometry because everything was a puzzle to me. There was like, we had different tools. How do you solve the problem? And that's kind of the way I, I view, um, spies and espionage is that there's different tools, but how do you solve the problem and how do you get where you want to go?\n\nI got, I have another recommendation for you. Um, this is why I came today. It was a charming, it was one of these films that like, oh, this looks interesting. Netflix recommended. Let's try this. Black Bag, also set in the UK. MI6, husband and wife work together.\n\nMhm.\n\nAnd there's a mole somewhere in MI6, and people somehow each of them are led, I want to say it's, is it Kate Winslet?\n\nIt's one of the Kates.\n\nUm, and I forget who's the lead hus, lead the man, the husband. Um, but each of them begin to suspect the other.\n\nOh, interesting.\n\nAnd, shockingly, interesting. Like normally you go into a movie you have no idea about. Let's see how this is. And we both were like, \"Wow, this was surprisingly good.\" So again, I know your wheelhouse.\n\nBlack Bag and Department Q. You have now a film, a series, and a book. I've taken care of your, your summer's, um, entertainment. Um, so anything else you're, you want to mention that you're reading? Um, no, there's not, you know, I, no, I haven't, I haven't been reading a lot recently for fun, I have to admit. Um, but what I do read, you know, pretty religiously is, is getting back to the whole issue of, of being dispassionate. I, I do read the Financial Times. I do read The Economist. To me, that's, that's a must-read for people.\n\nI have found the British papers, Yeah, generally like what we think of as, um, left to center is sort of dead middle to them, and they look, their right is kind of our middle, like it's not like our spectrum feels wider, our, our political range, and they, everybody seems to be clustered somewhere around, it's either center right or center left, not extreme right or extreme left, and I actually don't, I, I don't care, um, whether people are right or left as long as I can figure that out. What I care for is, uh, factual content.\n\nRight.\n\nRight. I, fact, fact-checking has to be, has to be good these days.\n\nSo our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investing or asset management or, or quantitative strategy?\n\nYeah. So I, I mentioned this briefly before. I, the advice I do give recent college graduates or, or seniors or, or whatever, um, is not to pigeonhole yourself early in your career. Don't, don't say this is what I have to do, um, and this is what I'm going to do. You know, if you're a doc, if you want to be a doctor, if you want to be a lawyer, you have to, some of that you have to do. I get that, right? But, um, if you want to go into the financial services industry in any format, um, you have to be, you have to enter that with an immense amount of flexibility. Um, our industry changes so dramatically and so quickly that what,\n\n\nSeems super interesting to you as a college graduate could be obsolete in two or three years.\nRight?\nAnd you don't want to paint yourself into a corner where that's all you know and that's all you're willing to do and you're unwilling to do other things or willing to learn other things.\nI think if you're coming into financial services, you should be one who likes to learn and likes to morph through time.\nReally, really interesting.\nAnd our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today that might have been helpful to know 40 years or so ago when you were getting started?\nOh man, I mean, um, I will tell you, I have gone back and read reports that I wrote 20 years ago or 25 years ago, and I read them today and I say like, what a... I'm amazed at my own stupidity.\nAnd so, let me, I'm going to interrupt you right here to say, so Professor David Dunning of University of Michigan, yeah, he of the famous Dunning-Krueger effect, said if you look at work that's 5 years old and you don't think it's awful, you're not progressing or growing.\nWhere abs, right, right, sitting where you were sitting and said if if you're not, if you don't hate what you did 10 years ago, you haven't grown at all professionally.\nI cringe.\nHow fantastic.\nI cringe.\nI mean, some of the, some of the ideas I wrote about, we still use and they're, they're still the crux of what.\nBut I'm just saying, I look at my writing.\nI look at how I express myself.\nI looked at how I thought something was so important.\nThat type of thing.\nAnd I cringe today.\nI absolutely cringe.\nAnd the moral of the story there is, um, I've come to grips with the fact that no matter how smart I think I am, I'm really not very smart and there's a lot more to learn.\nAnd so I think as I've gotten older, um, I've wanted to learn more through time.\nI kind of immerse myself.\nAnd it's, it's funny because my friends react to me now.\nLike, how did you know that?\nAnd it's only because I'm reading all kinds of different things and doing all kinds of different things and paying attention to different things because I kind of think of myself as a perpetual... I, I don't, I don't know how else to describe it, but that's really how I view myself.\nAll I know is that I know nothing.\nI go back to philos... philosophy.\nWhat is that?\nAristotle.\nSo yeah, so we, we'll, we'll end where we began.\nRich, thank you for being so generous with your time.\nWe have been speaking with Rich Bernstein, founder, chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors.\nIf you enjoy this conversation, well, be sure and check out any of the 550 we've done over the past 11 years.\nYou can find those at Bloomberg, iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you feed your podcast.\nFix.\nBe sure and check out my new book, How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth and How to Avoid Them: How Not to Invest: Wherever You Find Your Favorite Books.\nI would be remiss if I did not thank our crack team that helps put these conversations together each week.\nAnna Luke is my producer.\nSage Bowman is the head of podcast at Bloomberg.\nSean Russo is my researcher.\nPeter Nicolino is my engineer.\nI'm Barry Reynolds.\nYou've been listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio.\n[Music]\n",
