  "cleanText": "Bloomberg Audio Studios podcasts radio news.\n\nThis is the Bloomberg Surveillance Podcast.\nI'm Jonathan Pharaoh along with Lisa Abramitz and Amarie Hordern.\nJoin us each day for insight from the best in markets, economics, and geopolitics.\nFrom our global headquarters in New York City, we are live on Bloomberg television weekday mornings from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\nSubscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, or anywhere else you listen.\nAnd as always, on the Bloomberg terminal and the Bloomberg business app, it's time for some calm.\n\nJoining us now, the 79th Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent.\nMr. Secretary, welcome to the program.\nSir, let's pick up on that theme.\nNot you calm in the markets, but on inflation and where rates should be.\nAs Amarie pointed out, we've had a string of softer than expected inflation reads in this country.\nWe've had four.\nWe might get five at 8:30 Eastern time.\nWhy do you believe that's signal and not noise?\n\nWell, I mean there there's some persistence there, Jonathan.\nAnd look, I do have access to the number the night before, but when I'm coming on TV, I don't look at it.\nSo, I don't know what the number is going to be at 8:30.\nAnd I I wouldn't, you know, I I don't know whether it's going to be down, up, or flat, but I wouldn't put too much emphasis on one number.\nI I think it's the trend and I think one thing that Wall Street, a lot of economists market in general got wrong early on was that tariffs were going to uh cause a substantial price level rise which just hasn't happened and there are some people on the FOMC the Federal Reserve still worried about the prospect of that happening through the summer.\nWe've all sensed the frustration from the White House across the administration with Fed Chair Jay Powell and a lot of confusion I think at this point that maybe we can address in this conversation.\nIs firing the Federal Reserve chair under active consideration in the White House, in the Treasury, in your administration?\n\nUh, President Trump said numerous times he's not going to fire Jay Powell.\nUh, you know, he's working the refs and you I I've said before I'm a basketball fan.\nThere are two schools of working the refs.\nThere's the Bobby Knight school and there's the the Dean Smith school.\nPresident Trump uh seems to prefer the Bobby Knight school.\nAnd I'll tell you, I went back over the weekend and looked and Bobby Knight won three NCAA championships.\nMy hero Dean Smith only won two.\n\nThe NEC director Kevin Hasset, I'm not sure what you'd call him, but he was asked over the weekend, can the Fed chair be fired?\nHe said that's a thing that's being looked into.\nHow should we understand those comments?\n\nUh, look, I I u and I will point out Kevin was a collegiate basketball player.\nUh, and I I I think as President Trump said, he he's not looking to fire uh Chair Powell.\nAnd as I've said, I'm not going to comment on future policy or future mistakes the Fed will make.\nI'll only comment on past mistakes.\nAnd look, they they've had some big forecasting errors and this may be one.\nNow, is there a reason for not firing Kim?\nAnd I asked that question because the president's also said that his term is about to expire in May of next year.\nIs that the reason to ultimately just wait or is it something else?\nAre you convinced by the negative consequences associated with such a move?\n\nLook, I I I think a an independent central bank is very important for the conduct of monetary policy and we we can see that in in terms of the both the financial markets, the term premium and longerterm debt.\n\nYou said previously the interview process would begin later on in the fall.\nThere's been plenty of speculation as to whether that process would be brought forward.\nMr. Secretary, do you still, as far as you understand, believe that's when the interview process to replace the Fed chair will begin in the fall, or is a formal process already started?\n\nWell, look, there there's a formal process that's already starting.\nThere there are a lot of great candidates, and you know, we we'll see how rapidly it progresses.\nIt's President Trump's decision and it it will move at his speed.\nDo you see any merit at all in selecting maybe a candidate that's already on the committee on the FOMC versus taking a look at someone outside of the Federal Reserve?\n\nAgain, there are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.\nJonathan, has the chairman himself, the Fed chair Jake Pal given you any indication whatsoever as to what he would do once his term has expired?\nWill he vacate his seat as the governor at the Federal Reserve?\n\nWell, tra traditionally, uh, the the Fed chair also steps down as a governor, and there's been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance uh, of his or her nomination, and I can tell you, I think it'd be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on.\nAlso, Mr. Treasury Secretary, I'd love to talk to you about what's going on in Invidia this morning.\nJensen Wang, the CEO, out in a blog statement saying that the company has quote provided an update to customers, noting that Nvidia is filing applications to sell the H20 GPU again.\nThe US government has assured the company that licenses will be granted and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.\nCan you attest whether that's true or not?\nThe United States is willing to let Nvidia sell H20s once again in China?\n\nWell, again, I and Marie, I think that'd be a judgment that the Chinese indigenous uh manufacturers namely uh Huawei and some others already have an equivalent chip.\nSo, you know, if there's an equivalent chip, then the Nvidia H20 could be sold cuz I I can tell you uh the one thing that we do not want is a digital uh belt and road uh springing up around the world.\nbecause other countries or China are substituting for our American chip manufacturers.\n\nThis is the same chip though that the Trump administration blocked with export controls in April.\nSo why the change in policy now?\n\nUh Emory, you you might say that that was a negotiating uh chip that we used in Geneva and in London.\nSo this was part of the trade talks when it comes to Washington and Beijing.\n\nYes.\n\nWas it a quidd pro quo then?\nAs you said it wasn't, but was it potentially to make sure that you can get the licenses when it comes to rare earths?\n\nUh yeah, I think it it was all part of a mosaic.\nUh they had things we wanted, we had things they wanted, and you know, we're in a very good place.\nI expect to meet my Chinese counterpart, the vice premier, in the next few weeks.\nSo, when and where will that meeting take place?\n\nWe're we're still working on that.\nThe Chinese leadership has a big conclave at the beginning of August.\nSo, we're trying to work out whether that could be in a third country before or after that conclave.\n\nWill the administration release the framework of the Geneva and London talks?\n\nWell, we we have released some of it and you I'll I'll tell you that now having settled on tariffs on the export controls we can move on to the next stage of talks and I think it's very important both for the global economy for the US economy and for the Chinese economy for uh us to move on and talk about China uh opening its markets and the increase domestic and consumer production there.\n\nAre you hoping to get to that next phase before August 12th when that's currently the day taunt between these two economies?\n\nYeah, I look I I think we're in a very good place and I I tell market participants not to worry about August 12th.\n\nShould they worry about what's happening with Europe with respect to the 30% tariff rate?\nThey don't seem to be worrying, but I'm just curious whether that's the final rate or whether the letter was part of a negotiation that Europe uh received from President Trump.\n\nUh well, Lisa, you know what I what I would say is uh President Trump's able to create a lot of leverage here.\nA lot of leverage because he he's indifferent.\nHe's indifferent whether we take in the 30% rate or whether the Europeans come to us with a much better deal.\nas I've been saying for a while that if countries or trading blocks don't come with their best deals then the rates could boomerang back.\nSo, uh you President Trump's leading this and what I what I will tell you is that a lot of the deals and this this is where he his leadership's been invaluable.\nA lot of the deals that I thought were excellent deals keep getting improved upon every time he takes up the maximum pressure strategy.\nThere is a theory in markets and you don't even have to calm them.\nThey're pretty calm.\nThey're watching all of these rates and they're not freaking out in parlance uh on Wall Street.\nThey're taking this in stride.\nWe're close to all-time highs, if not at all-time highs.\nDo you see this is giving a green light to Trump, to President Trump, to keep going, to take hardline approaches, and to keep trying to get better and better deals?\n\nLook, I I I think this this narrative of this obsessive focus on the market isn't right.\nPresident Trump views this as a generational opportunity to reset trade in a fair and sound manner for the American people.\nSo the the idea that so some market ups or downs are are going to be the deciding factor here.\nwhat we uh are concerned about and President Trump is laser focused on is getting the best deals because uh you we were not having fair trade and now we're we're seeing with these countries coming to the table the quality of the deals gets better and better.\nSo we're not going to rush just because of some market deadline.\nNow I think what the market's seeing is market's willing to look forward three, six, 12 months and this is going to be good for the US.\nIt's going to be good for the global economy.\n\nIf you do get some sort of signal from the market though that this isn't going to be good for the US economy.\nIs there a trigger point?\nIs there sort of a sense at which it it acts as a gut check and sort of pulls back some of the negotiating tactics?\n\nLook, I I I think that the market understands what we're doing.\nSometimes individual market people don't.\nSometimes the television personalities don't.\nBut you know, good good thing about President Trump is he always tells you what he wants and what he wants is fair trade here.\n\nI won't take that as a slight on me and my colleagues around the table, Mr. Treasury Secretary, but you did tell me on April 2nd on Liberation Day that this was the ceiling when it comes to those rates.\nBut since then, we have actually had some tariff rates.\nthe president announced in letters higher than those rates he announced on that big chart on April 2nd.\nSo is there no longer a ceiling when it comes to tariff rates when you are dealing with trading partners?\n\nUh I I think that uh I I said if they if they come and they negotiate in good faith then those are ceilings and uh some some of the talks got off to a very slow start.\nSo, who's negotiating good faith at this moment?\nWho's not?\n\nAgain, I congratulated the UK the other day, as I told many of our trading partners and an Marie, I may have said on that day or a few days after April 2nd.\nI'd advised countries to move quickly because President Trump the first deals are usually the best deals and and the UK came in early.\nThey got a great deal and everybody else is kind of dragging right now.\n\nWell, when it comes to uh Japan, you're headed there at the end of this week.\nDo you expect to come back with a deal?\n\nUh I'm going to Japan to represent uh the United States government and the American people at the International Expo, which we used to know as the World's Fair.\nSo this coming Saturday is going to be America's day and I'll be taking a delegation includes the labor secretary, deputy secretary of state will be representing the US.\nSo th this is a celebration of the US more than trade talks.\n\nMr. Secretary, before you go, just a final question.\nI'm embarrassed to say that my knowledge of college basketball is nothing like yours, but I can tell you back in the '90s in English football, there used to be a concept of player managers.\nThere used to be certain managers of football teams that also put themselves on the field and they played too.\nEffectively, they had two jobs.\nAnd I'm wondering from your perspective whether that's something you'd be interested in.\nWe've seen that throughout the administration.\nIs that something you think that you could pursue?\nBoth the Treasury Secretary and the Fed chair.\n\nUh look, I I I think I have the best job in town.\nUh I will do what President Trump wants.\nWe got a lot of great Fed candidates and um you know I I'm confident it's going to be a robust process.\nJonathan, has he asked you?\n\nWhat's that?\n\nHas he asked you?\nAre you part of the process?\n\nUh I I am part of the decision-making process, but again, it's the final decision is going to be President Trump's.\n\nMr. Secretary, appreciate your time.\nThank you.\nThe Treasury Secretary there, Scott Bessent, on a range of issues, including trade and the future of this Federal Reserve.\n\n[Music]\n\nInflation data due at 8:30 Eastern time about an hour away.\nJoining us now is Sarah Hunt of Alpine Saxon Woods.\nSarah, good morning.\n\nGood morning.\n\nIs inflation dead?\n\nI think it's quiet at the moment, but I wouldn't I wouldn't completely rule it out.\nI think that there's some possibilities that it could pick its head up, but I I think that it's hard for people to anticipate data when we spend a whole lot of time anticipating a bunch of stuff that didn't happen.\nSo, I think there's a little bit of fatigue there.\nSo, it's hard to say right now.\nIt's difficult to forecast.\nThere's still some debate over the data we've already had.\nWhat's underpinning these softer than expected reads and why won't it last?\nSo if we think about whether or not companies did pull a huge pull of inventory forward and or people started changing their behavior because they knew what was coming, you could argue why that's soft now and why it should rise if the rates are going higher.\nBut you still see these moving of the goalposts in terms of timing which allows companies to bring inventories back in again and refresh that.\nSo I could see a lot of bumpiness in the data and I also think that companies have had a lot of time to prepare for this and if I'm sitting there I want my margins to stay where they are.\nSo I'm going to try to do whatever substituting I can.\nSo I also think that there's probably a lack of understanding how much of that substitution has gone on and I think that that\n\n\nis why it could be bumpier and less dramatically higher than people are expecting because they're expecting a really fast move.\nI just wonder, can we expect immaculate disinflation, ongoing immaculate disinflation, where there is no pain in the overall economy at the same time that inflation is dead?\nDoes that seem consistent with you, or is there kind of a tension right now between employment data that's pretty okay, albeit with very slow activity, and inflation that seems to be maybe, if not dead, in hospice?\nIt is one of those periods of time where finding, figuring out what that data means is going to be tricky.\nIt remains tricky.\nEarnings are going to matter for the stock market.\nInflation's going to matter to some degree, but only if it's really surprising or gets much higher than people are looking for.\nAnd then, and then people start to, investors really start to worry.\nThe question is, what do those trends look like?\nI mean, to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's point, it's not just about one number.\nIt's about where the trend is going.\nIf it looks like the trend is reversing, investors are going to like that a whole lot less.\nDo you just not pay attention to the data at all and buy AI?\nBuy Nvidia and just, you know, call it a day.\nIt would have been the good trade for this year, right?\nI mean, that's that, that's sort of what happened is that you had all this concern about AI going into the beginning of the year.\nThen you had the trade situation.\nEverybody started looking at every single earnings call from Microsoft or every hyperscaler to parse exactly what their spending was going to be.\nThere was this little bit of freakout, and then everybody got over it really quickly.\nSo that would have been that reversal, and that goes back to the idea that the companies that have growth and the companies that generate a ton of cash and have good margins are the places that they end up performing better than the rest of the market anyway.\nIt would have been good to get in on Nvidia just last night, given the fact that they have a blog post out saying that those H20 chips that this administration blocked are now going to be able to go to China.\nHow do you deal with this basically flip-flop almost within weeks or months of this administration when you're trying to direct what to do in a portfolio?\nWell, I mean, flip-flop is an interesting term.\nI think it's more about, I mean, again, to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's point, it's changing those dynamics may have been part of that discussion all along.\nSo you have to assume that some of the things that are coming out as X or Y, maybe X or Y under certain circumstances, but if I change my mind, they're going to be different.\nSo that's got to be, and I don't think that that's entirely different from things that the way the world works anyway.\nBut I think that certainly in the near term, this administration has been much different about market changes than other administrations.\nIt's not just Nvidia, it's AMD just crossing, resuming ship, ship shipments to China once their license clears, that stock is up in a pre-market as well.\nLook, China's a big business for all of these chip providers, and the key question is, can they understand the rules of the game enough to create chips that are compliant with some of the constraints that have been put on them from the US government?\nSarah, it's good to see you.\nSarah Hunt of Alpine Saxon Woods.\n[Music]\nI want to bring in Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro.\nNeil, welcome to the program, sir.\nThat's not four, it's five.\nWhy is that signal and not noise?\nWell, I mean, I think, look, we're obviously tariff revenues are going up, right?\nAnd the effective tariff rate is rising.\nThat was the case in June.\nAnd despite that, inflation missed expectations.\nSo that means that, I mean, tariffs increase costs.\nWe all know that.\nUh, who ends up bearing the cost is where the uh debate is.\nAnd you know, I think at the margin, this probably reflects more of a margin squeeze than anything else.\nIt's not like prices for core goods aren't going up.\nThey are.\nUm, but you have, you know, I mean, I was just looking at the data.\nYou see big increases in appliances.\nYou see big increases in uh all sorts of household um furnishing and supplies.\nUh, but it's also important to remember that service sector inflation, uh, service sector prices represents the lion share of uh of what people spend their money on, and prices in those areas continue to go down.\nYou know, ultimately it's going to come down to nominal dollars spent, right?\nRight.\nSo to the extent that people shift more of their household budgets towards goods because the prices of those things are going up, um, they'll have less left over to spend elsewhere, and that means that services are at risk, and that's why they'll ultimately see the prices for those things coming down.\nSo that to me seems to be what's going on.\nUh, the nominal anchor isn't changing.\nTariffs are uh resulting in a relative price shift.\nThat's that's pushing up um the prices for consumer goods.\nThat is clear.\nIf you look at the data, that's obvious.\nLook at just look at household furnishings uh in the latest uh report.\nUm, but services are are providing an important offset.\nNeil, is that a good enough reason for two Fed governors on the FOMC later on this month to stick their hand up and say, \"I think we should cut rates.\"\nUh, I, I, I mean, I don't think they'll be as noisy about it uh in in July only because um, you know, the last employment report gave them some calm, right?\nBecause the unemployment rate went down.\nBut you know, ultimately, you know, for me, it's about, you know, what is nominal income uh doing when you take like the sum product of jobs, hours, and earnings, and you look at it over the last several months, it doesn't look particularly encouraging.\nUh, at the same time, you've seen uh the work week decline, particularly in the areas that are seeing the most robust jobs growth, like education and health.\nRight?\nSo if you start to see jobs in those areas slow down, uh what's left?\nUh, so um, you know, I still continue to have like concerns about the job market over the summer.\nUh, but that just reinforces this weakness in nominal income that we've seen.\nUh, so ultimately, you know, it all comes down to like the household budget constraint, and uh to the extent um that prices are rising in one area, that means that quantity is going to go down in other areas.\nSo Neil, just to sort of sum up what you've been talking about, I think it's really interesting that you see these numbers as not representing strength in the economy, but a sign of weakness in places like services that is bringing down the overall inflation rate that otherwise is getting inflated by certain goods prices going up, uh, like home appliances.\nAt what point is that weakness necessary to keep inflation low?\nIn other words, not necessarily a reason for the Fed to cut, but to hold where they are so that you can have that offset in a way that doesn't allow inflation to really kick back up.\nI mean, I don't think one rate cut's really going to change that in any in any material way.\nI mean, the Fed, Fed policy is still restrictive.\nThat means they can, they can start, and they'd still be restrictive.\nIt doesn't, they don't have to promise like a a broad swath of of rate cuts.\nIn fact, they're not doing that.\nSo um, you know, I don't think a rate cut in July or even one in September is going to materially u, you know, change that dynamic.\nIf you are just joining us, welcome to the program.\nEquities higher here.\nThe opening bell about 54 minutes away.\nMoments ago, inflation data in the United States, month over month, headline CPI up from 0.1% the previous month to 0.3, in line with expectations.\nBut for core CPI, it's another downside surprise, 0.2% against an expectation of 0.3.\nIt's five consecutive months of softer than expected core CPI.\nMike McKe's back with us for more.\nMike, you've had a second look.\nWhat jumps out to you?\nWell, I think Neil pointed out the major tariff implications here.\nWe do see a 4/10% rise in apparel overall and a significant rise in footwear, up 7/10 of a percent.\nUh, male footwear in particular.\nNow, those things come from China.\nOther things uh coming from China that uh go up or from other Asian countries.\nFurniture, as he mentioned, was up 4/10 of a percent.\nHousehold furnishings up 1% and appliances up 1.9%.\nThey were up 8/10 of a percent last month.\nUh, a lot of this probably has to do with the tariffs on steel.\nWe saw that when uh we had the steel tariffs in the first President Trump administration that appliance prices went up.\nUh, food 3/10 of 8% still in line.\nUh, President Trump added extra tariffs on tomatoes yesterday, but in June they were down one and a half%, and I know Amarie is anxious to know that eggs were down 7.4%.\nUh, one other thing that comes in uh for uh the China aspect of it is toy prices up 1.8%.\nSo we are seeing some tariff pass through here.\nBut again, uh, I would look at what Neil was saying about service prices.\nThey were relatively restrained, up 3/10 of 8%.\nUh, we saw medical care and uh auto insurance prices very tame this month.\nSo some of the things that we had seen pushing up inflation in the services categories have backed off for a while at least.\nMike McKe, thank you, sir.\nEquities higher in response to some of this.\nWe're up by 4/10 of 1% on the S&P.\nYields a little bit lower across the bond market.\nThe yield curve looks like this.\n10-year yields this morning down by two basis points.\nSimilar move on a 30.\nSo you don't see the tariff inflation on a headline, but you start to see it just a little bit beneath the surface, and you start to see what the response function is of households that they might be cutting back maybe on eating out to compensate for the increased costs elsewhere, which uh you wonder on a compositional level whether this tamps down overall inflation, even as you see pockets of higher prices in select areas.\nIs that the path of travel, or is that just the current state of affairs as people take stock of exactly what the new scenario is?\nWe can have that discussion right now with David Kelly of JPMorgan Asset Management.\nDavid, welcome to the program, sir.\nHow much comfort can you take from this morning's inflation data?\nNot a lot.\nUh, it's a very interesting report because you can see sort of the fading of issues that were causing inflation over the last few years, but you can also see the beginnings of the inflation problem related to tariffs.\nUh, so if you look at owner's equivalent rent, auto insurance, those are the things that really held inflation up, and they're going away.\nAnd the other thing that really helped this report is we had a further decline in airline fairs, a further decline in lodging prices.\nThere's a lot of weakness in the tourism industry right now, and that's in this report.\nBut uh when you look at core goods outside of new autos, we're seeing those goods prices go up, and that's where you're going to see this tariff inflation.\nAnd we have only seen the thin end of the wedge here.\nIt takes a while for the tariffs to get to be implemented.\nTakes a while for the revenue to be collected.\nTakes a while for the the inventory to make it to people's shelves.\nTakes a while for the retailers to say, \"Look, I'm going to have to mark it up, but it is coming.\nUm, so, you know, I fully agree with the Fed's forecast that inflation's going to go up between now and the end of the year, and they've got to stay on their guard.\"\nAnd yet, David, they also believe it starts to come back down again.\nIn fact, for that reason, some officials, including Governor Waller, believes you can look through it.\nDo you think you can just look through it?\nNot yet.\nBecause we also have a lot of fiscal sugar in the first half of next year.\nUh, what's going to happen is that we had a lot of temporary tax breaks put in for four years, but they start at the start of this year.\nThey're not going to adjust income tax withholding schedules quickly enough.\nThat means a bumper season for refunds early next year.\nAnd you know, we know from 2022 that you got supply chain issues, and then you give consumers a lot of extra cash.\nWhat happens?\nYou end up with inflation.\nI mean, eventually I think it'll fade in the long run.\nI am not an inflation hawk in America.\nI think inflation will fade, but I think it's going to be sustained by some of the provisions of the OBBBA.\nUh, and and I, because of that, I think the Fed needs to hold off here.\nIf we got clarity on tariffs, if we could say this is what the tariffs rule are, and they will go no higher, then I think that makes it easier for the Fed.\nSo, you know, I think the administration really needs to think about, look, could we please, whatever the tariff policy is, let's make it and be done with it because this uncertainty is the very thing that's making it impossible for the Federal Reserve to say that that we're out of the woods or will be out of the woods on inflation.\nDavid, is there a sort of a necessary weakness that we need to see in consumer spending and services at this point to make sure that inflation doesn't take off?\nIn other words, that pain that Neil was talking about that you could start seeing uh on the in the data on the margins.\nWell, that's a tough way to do it.\nI mean, the way you, you want to, if you're worried about a long-term inflation problem, it's only going to be come because wage growth sort of compensate for price increases.\nNow, we still have a relatively weak labor force in terms of their ability to demand wage increases.\nUh, you know, I think again, we have to think a little bit about how immigration is affecting labor supply.\nAnd again, there's huge question marks there.\nBut so long as we don't see an acceleration in wage growth, the inflation will fade.\nYou, it's not just a matter of consumer spending being weak.\nUm, so long as wage growth is controlled, inflation will fade again.\nBut I think it's way too early to say that uh, you know, inflation is coming down to 2%, we still got to get past tariffs, we've got to get past the stimulative effects of this fiscal bill, and that's really what's causing the delay in any further Fed easing.\nNeil Data of Renmax still with us.\nNeil, today's about prices, Thursday's about spending.\nLet's talk about retail sales.\nHow do you expect some of our understanding of prices this morning to show up in spending and retail sales later this week?\nWell, I mean, if goods prices are rising and the consensus expects nominal, nominal retail sales to rise 3/10, that basically tells you that real spending on goods is declining.\nThat's not exactly an encouraging situation.\nSo um\n\n\nYou know, I mean, the fact that price increases are showing up, um, and you know, it's more or less matching what you see in the retail sales data, um, that basically tells you that the volume of goods sold is going down.\nLook, it comes back to P * Q.\nWhatever, um, you know, whatever goes into price is going to come out of quantity because the nominal anchor hasn't really changed.\nUh, so you know, look, I mean, I think consumers are actually quite resistant to higher prices, uh, with the exception of the uh, University of Michigan data.\nUm, if you look at, you know, other estimates for inflation expectations, was whether that's the the New York Fed survey of consumer expectations, Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations, professional forecasters inflation expectations.\nUm, it suggests that, you know, people are resistant to higher prices and they're acting as if, you know, if you look at the areas where people have been cutting back their consumption, those are the areas where the prices have been going up the most.\nSo it's not particularly surprising.\nUm, and the labor markets remain still in a tricky spot.\nUm, you know, while the unemployment rate remains low, uh, you still have, you know, rising increase in, you know, discouraged workers.\nYou know, people that are out of the workforce but want a job now.\nUm, you know, companies are telling you like the small businesses are saying that there's uh, you know, poor sales, uh, a bigger concern.\nSo, you know, I I think that that probably reinforces ongoing weakness in uh, in wage growth, and you know, that means that households don't really have the capacity to absorb um, higher prices and that means to cut back.\nNo, and it's a good point, Neil.\nAnd David, I guess that if you take what Neil is saying, the idea that you do see real price resistance by consumers, and if you do see this sort of compensating for the extra expense in goods by pulling back on services, what would the harm be for the Fed to cut rates by just 25 basis points or 50 basis points?\nWell, the any, you know, any problems the economy is facing is not really about interest rates being too high.\nAnd I think that I think, you know, I think we have to think carefully about long-term policies about helping the labor force grow, uh, about helping free enterprise and reduce regulation and reduce barriers to to business and and, you know, I think we need to focus on that.\nUm, I don't think the interest rates are too high right now.\nI think the Fed's the steward of the dollar and of our inflation outlook in the long run.\nAnd they've said they're committed to 2% inflation.\nI think they should stick to their guns.\nUm, and you know, if the economy gets into trouble, it's not because they kept rates too high.\nNeil, I just want to give you the final word just on housing, which is something you've been following now for months and months and months and flagging the weakness here.\nWhy is that so important to you, Neil?\nWell, because it undercuts an argument that was just made, which is that, you know, that interest rates are fine, right?\nI mean, obviously housing isn't weakening because of tariffs or anything else.\nHousing's weakening because rates are too high and you're seeing um, you know, a rising pile of completed new unsold inventory.\nI mean that hasn't been as high, uh, that's that's been rising, um, you know, over the last year or so and that's starting to weigh on home prices which we see.\nSo you know, I I think that the housing market does provide some evidence that interest rates are restraining economic activity.\nIs that the Fed's fault or is that the fault of Congress, Neil?\nSo no, but the reason the reason we're seeing that, sorry, the re reason uh, the reason we're have got trouble in the housing market is not because rates are too high now.\nIt's because rates were way too low for way too long after the great financial crisis causing prices to jack up to a level that cannot be supported at normal mortgage rates.\nThere's nothing wrong with mortgage rates.\nThe problem is home prices which are too high because rates were too low for too long.\nWell, mortgage rates are running 6 and 1/2 to 7% and wage growth is rising just 3%.\nSo, I think the math is actually getting quite challenging for most people.\nThat's why housing is not working.\nWell, it's challenging, but only because home prices are the anomaly here.\nThey're just too high because rates were too low for too long.\nI'm sitting back now, Jent.\nI thought you'd continue.\nNeil D of Remma, David Kelly at JP Morgan.\nSo, the two of you
