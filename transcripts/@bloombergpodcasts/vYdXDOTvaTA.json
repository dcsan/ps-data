  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\nThis is the *Bloomberg Daybreak Europe* podcast.\nGood morning.\nIt's Tuesday, the 15th of July.\nI'm Caroline Hepka in London, and I'm Steven Carol in Brussels.\nComing up today, the UK's Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will face the City for her first major speech since her tearful appearance in Parliament sparked a bond market selloff.\nNvidia gets the green light to resume certain AI chip sales to China after a dramatic White House reversal.\nPlus, targeting Boeing and Bourbon, the EU finalizes a new tariff retaliation list hitting American goods worth $84 billion if a trade deal can't be reached.\nLet's start with a roundup of our top stories.\nBritain's Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will pledge to cut red tape in her annual speech to London's financial sector in a bid to help drive the government's growth plans.\nReeves is expected to say that dialing up risk will allow more families access to mortgages.\nIt'll be the chancellor's first major public speech since UK assets sold off less than two weeks ago when she appeared visibly upset in Parliament.\nBut since then, the City has grown increasingly wary of taxes down the line.\nBloomberg's James Wilark has the story.\nChancellor Reeves's mansion house dinner could be mistaken for tapass.\nThere are many small plates on offer to the financial sector, a concierge service for international investors, reforms to the financial ombudsman, and a new captive insurance regime.\nAnd the City has been teased with hopes for a review of ring-fencing rules and possibly an entrepreneurs visa system.\nBut despite these tasty morsels around deregulation and growth, many in the world of finance see the government's fiscal worries.\nI wonder if the bill is going to be coming later in the autumn budget.\nIn London, James Walco, Bloomberg Radio.\nWell, the chancellor's speech comes as the UK economy shows more signs of rebounding from its recent slump.\nJune's retail sales figures rose by 3.1% from a year earlier, according to data from the British Retail Consortium.\nIt's a positive signal after US tariffs, tax increases, and a minimum wage hike drove back-to-back contractions in retail sales in April and May.\nNvidia is preparing to resume sales of high-end AI chips to China after getting the green light from the US administration.\nThe H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with earlier US trade restrictions, but has been banned from sale in the country since April.\nIn a blog post, the tech giant says that US officials have now told them they will approve export licenses.\nGene Monster of Deep Water Asset Management says the move comes after weeks of thawing relations between Beijing and Washington.\nMy suspicion is that some of this semi-trade truce, I'm reluctant given everything that's going on to call it that, but that we have seen between the US and China probably laid the groundwork a few weeks ago that this in fact was going to happen with Nvidia.\nAnd so what does it mean?\nWhat is the US administration essentially saying is that they have to give something to get something.\nGene Monster adds the US reversal is a significant win for Nvidia CEO Jensen Hang.\nHe had previously branded Washington's chip curbs a failure that fueled the rise of Huawei and other Chinese AI rivals.\nSome more data now.\nChina's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter.\nGDP rose by 5.2% after a gain of 5.4% in the first three months of the year.\nHowever, strong exports to markets outside the US mass deepening pressure from weak domestic demand within China despite a raft of government subsidies, excess manufacturing capacity, and weak confidence in the property sector continue to suppress Chinese consumption.\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose severe tariffs on Russia if it does not end the war with Ukraine.\nThe news comes as the US pledges fresh weapon supplies for Kyiv, which Trump says will be paid for by NATO member states.\nSpeaking during a meeting with NATO Secretary General at the White House, Trump set out a timeline for the Russian president.\nI'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there.\nSo based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days.\nIt's very simple and they'll be at 100%.\nPresident Trump speaking during a meeting with NATO's Mark Rut there.\nMatt Whitaker, the US ambassador to NATO, says the planned action effectively represents secondary sanctions on countries that are buying oil from Russia.\nThe president didn't elaborate on the powers he would use to impose those tariffs, but said he wasn't sure if congressional approval would be needed.\nBloomberg understands that the European Union has finalized a second list of US tariff counter measures targeting goods worth 72 billion euros.\nThe list includes Boeing aircraft and Bourbon as well as additional duties on machinery products, chemicals and plastics, medical devices, wines and other agricultural goods.\nOur senior White House correspondent Josh Windgrove says Europe is a significant market for President Trump.\nAnd the question is, of course, will they land somewhere or will Trump look at wherever they are in a week or two and think that that's either not enough and stick with the 30% or it is enough and go to a lower number.\nRemember, of course, the baseline number right now is 10%, he initially announced 20% on Europe in those initial liberation day tariffs.\nHe's threatened as high as 50% on Europe.\nAnd he's always, you know, that's been kind of the one of the top of the list places that he's complained about when he talks about unfair trade relationships.\nBloomberg's Josh Windgrove there on Trump's EU tariff plans.\nEU member states still need to give their approval though before the European list is adopted.\nThe measures are a response to President Trump's earlier so-called reciprocal tariff of 20% hitting most goods and the additional levies on cars and car parts of 25%.\nThe universal rate was later temporarily lowered to 10% to allow negotiations to take place.\nFrance's prime minister will outline a plan today to sharply narrow the country's budget deficit.\nThe move by France sets the stage for a parliamentary battle at risks triggering another government collapse.\nPrime Minister will present details of around 4 billion euros in spending cuts and tax increases for next year.\nThe proposals are aimed at shrinking the euro area's largest budget gap as France's fiscal difficulties continue to rattle bond markets.\nEarlier this month, the country's 5-year bond yield surpassed Italy's for the first time in 20 years.\nAnd those are our top stories for you this morning.\nSo, let's think about markets which are really focused on the US inflation data.\nThere are a number of other countries reporting CPI, but the US is the most significant coming out at 1:30 p.m.\nClues on the impact of Trump tariffs in June and the direction of course of interest rates.\nIn terms of the market response at the moment, the MCEI Asia Pacific index has been swinging between small gains and losses.\nSo, a lot of hesitation.\nJapan's 10-year government bond yields are climbing to its highest level since 2008.\nYou've also got corporate earnings season though really taking hold.\nJP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo City, and Black Rock all due to report today.\nSubdued expectations.\nSo, do we see some big beats there?\nAnd Bitcoin, we saw a surge above $120,000 on Monday.\nWe are below that 117,000 this morning.\nSo, a pretty incredible run though for Bitcoin over the course of this year, something like 27%.\nThose are the markets.\nIn a moment, we'll look ahead to tonight's Mansion House speech from the Chancellor.\nI'm bringing you the latest on the EU US trade dispute with another story we've been reading this morning.\nNow, Caroline, it's been a long time since I owned a car.\nBut every time I rent one, I am sort of mystified by the block of plastic that I get handed at the counter because keys are out, fobs are in.\nEveryone else knows this except me like you who drives regularly.\nUh but apparently this is something that now has become a key design feature of high-end cars as well.\nI love how this is described in Hannah Elliot's piece.\nIt's like the handshake.\nYou know, it gives you a little taste of what the car design is all about.\nYou know, get it wrong and you can be severely punished by drivers, as you say.\nYes.\nI I think of you, Stephen, as the ultimate car-free European city dweller.\nBelgians love cars.\nSo, you know, maybe things will change now that I'm in Brussels.\nYou know, maybe I'll be finally tempted back onto the roads.\nBut I like some of the designs in this piece of the the kind of the fancy fobs are incredible.\nLike there's a there's a Bentley one there.\nThere's the Lotus Pebble, which is sort of a triangle.\nYou know, there's a lot of effort now being put into designing what these things look like.\nThey're meant to be a reflection of the vehicle.\nThey don't always get it right.\nHannah Elliot points it out points out as well that there was a recent Cadillac model that kind of didn't go down very well because it was essentially just a plastic piece in a little leather wallet.\nPeople didn't feel reflected the luxury of the car and that probably the price tag as well.\nI mean, look, even the key fob though might be going extinct because actually loads of the high-end cars just have apps now.\nOpen it with your mind, Caroline.\nThat's to be the next step.\nI think you can read Hannah's piece on blueber.com and on the terminal.\nWe'll put a link to the article in our show notes as well.\nBut the Chancellor Rachel Reeves makes her annual speech to London's financial industry later at Mansion House.\nA key moment for the sector, but also for the chancellor for herself after the recent market jitters over her future.\nOur finance reporter Leo Ken Sheper joins us now for more.\nLeo, good morning.\nWhat are the key announcements then we're expecting from the chancellor?\nGood morning, Stephen.\nUh yes.\nSo ahead of Rachel Reeves's annual mention house speech in the City, the chancellor will actually be in Leeds first off and reveal measures to increase home ownership.\nAnd she you know she will reveal I think you said earlier as well a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme and also more home loans for people on lower incomes.\nAnd then when she's in the City tonight, she is going to announce a among various other things a concierge service for international investors who want to put money into the UK and that service will sort of help them navigate issues around visas and regulation.\nAnother key measure that's hotly anticipated by many in the City is cutting the burden of the senior managers and certification regime.\nUm basically making it easier for financial institutions to appoint senior managers and shortening the the regulatory review from three to two months.\nThose are some of the measures that are expected tonight.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo, what are we expecting then and might we get any announcements on tax?\nBecause that's the other big worry.\nYes, exactly.\nThat's the big one.\nUm so our understanding is to not expect any announcements on tax but any signaling around wealth taxes non-dom taxes potential backtracking here would most likely be the biggest story out of the mention house speech.\nYou know, when I was talking to people in the City, asking them what they expect tonight, they they would always ask ask the question back, you know, well, what are you hearing about wealth taxes?\nYou know, that's definitely a big thorn in the side for many people in the City.\nThe Lord Mayor, Alistister King, who is hosting the dinner tonight, told us a few weeks ago that the government really needs to stop the Nondom exodus and many expect the Treasury to act eventually, but probably not today.\nHow significant is this moment for Rachel Reeves after we had that recent guilt market selloff?\nYeah, it's a good question.\nSo, um it definitely is a big moment for her.\nI'd say not necessarily for the guild market because there are no fiscal measures expected.\nUm I was talking to guild market participants and they're not necessarily waiting with baited breath for what Ree is going to say.\nBut I think it's key for her to maintain her support from people in the City um from executives.\nShe was off to a good start, you know, praised by CEOs of asset managers for instance for for her growth agenda.\nBut the NOM exodus and also relatively slow movement around issues such as the reform of of ISAS, the individual savings accounts that has definitely irritated some of her early supporters in the City.\nInteresting.\nYeah.\nSo Rachel Ree speaking tonight at the Mansion House dinner, but also the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will be delivering his annual speech at that event too.\nLeo, thank you so much for looking ahead to what's happening today.\nOur finance reporter Leo Ken Sherper.\nNow the European Union has finalized a second list of counter measures targeting American goods worth 72 billion euros if it decides to retaliate as transatlantic trade tensions intensified.\nThe EU is still hopeful it can negotiate a deal to avoid the 30% levy threatened by Donald Trump.\nLet's bring in our EMA news director Rosa Mat for more on this as well.\nFirst, Ross, just on what we've been hearing from Donald Trump, he's indicated he's open to more talks with the EU, but is there any sign of actually any progress?\nWell, it does make it a bit harder when Donald Trump says that his letters laying out tariff rates are actual deals because they're not.\nIt's the US imposing a tariff rate.\nSo that's the climate in which a lot of countries are trying to negotiate or work out how to negotiate with the US and the path forward.\nThere's been lots of rounds of talks between the EU and the US.\nThere are more to come.\nUh the EU EU trade negotiator Maroskovich was due to talk last night with the US commerce secretary Howard Lutnik.\nSo we'll see how that went.\nHe's also warned that while they have to prepare for all outcomes that this proposed duty he said is quote effectively prohibitive for transatlantic trade.\nUm the preference is still for a deal.\nI mean there's wrangling between the EU some of the biggest states are saying should we do a deal for the sake of it?\nShould we insist it has to be a good one no matter what?\nBut the general feeling is they want a deal.\nThey want to avoid tipping into an even bigger trade conflict.\nAnd that's very much also the view that they're getting from business in the EU.\nYeah.\nLet's see, of course, how long maybe that lasts because the EU has been very careful not to antagonize President Trump with retaliation so far.\nBut um let's see if that is a strategy that continues or not.\nI also want a quick word though on what is going on with Russia.\nThe US president has threatened big tariffs on Russia up to 100% if it doesn't end hostilities with Ukraine.\nNow, will that tactic work with\n\n\nVladimir Putin, Ros?\n\nWell, that is the question. Obviously, it's a signal of just how frustrated Donald Trump is that there's no movement towards a ceasefire in Ukraine and now very much training his sights on Putin in all of that. But the Russian economy is already very heavily sanctioned, including by the US. It seems like it was a bit unclear what Donald Trump was saying last night, but it suggests that he's talking about perhaps further tariffs on Russia goods and Russia doesn't export a lot to the US, but primarily talking about secondary sanctions, which would penalize countries like China and India for buying Russian energy, of course, that they've bought quite a lot in recent years, and that's helped fund the war in Ukraine. And that would be a designed to squeeze the Russian economy further. You'd have to say that with all this pressure that's gone on and Donald Trump saying that he's talking with Vladimir Putin all the time and Vladimir Putin wants a deal, there's no great sign that Vladimir Putin wants a deal on Ukraine, that he doesn't want to keep pressing on with his war aims there regardless. And that's despite many years of economic squeeze. Would this change his course in Ukraine? It's very hard to say. Would it hurt the Russian economy further? Absolutely. But Vladimir Putin seems to be quite willing to wear a lot of economic pain to further his goals in Ukraine.\n\nThis is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe, your morning brief on the stories making news from London to Wall Street and beyond.
