  "cleanText": "What do you make of the president's decision to give this another 50 days?\nIs this the right move right now?\nI think what we have seen is that Vladimir Putin is not going to come to the table to negotiate in any real serious way unless he is feeling a lot more pressure than he has to date from the Trump administration.\nSo I think we need to take up and pass the Graham Blumenthal legislation that has 85 co-sponsors in the Senate.\nIt's bipartisan.\nIt would send a very strong message to Putin and the Russians and all of those who continue to do business with Russia buying Russian oil, that the United States is serious and we are paying attention to what's going on.\nI think the announcement that NATO is going to provide weapons, particularly those Patriot missile defense systems that Ukraine so desperately needs as they are under nightly attack from Russia against Kievan civilian populations all across the country is welcome news.\nAnd we need to do everything we can to see that that moves as quickly as possible.\nSenator, President Donald Trump suggested in the Oval Office today that there's no real difference between a 100% secondary tariff on a country like China or India that's buying Russian oil compared to the 500% in the piece of legislation we're discussing.\nWhat to you would change the calculus for Russia when we're comparing 100% levy like this to 500%.\nListen, I think if we are serious and if we actually implement those sanctions and follow through and ensure that we police them in ways that prevent actually India, China, the countries that are buying oil from Russia with a shadow fleet, from actually being able to buy that fuel, to be able to reimburse Russia for those costs, then we are going to go a long way towards shutting down Russia's war machine because they will not have the funding they need to continue to operate it.\nBut love your thoughts on this weapons arrangement that the president rolled out today.\nSenator, as a key lawmaker who supported the Biden administration's efforts to arm Ukraine.\nWhat do you think of this idea as we get to the end of the weapons package that you already approved having NATO buy American weapons and provide them to Kiev?\nWill Ukraine get what it needs?\nIs this sustainable?\nWell, I think it's an important step forward.\nAt the NATO's summit, I had a chance to meet with President Zelensky.\nHe talked about the willingness of Ukraine to pay for weapons that they were not expecting to hand out.\nWe also talked to a number of European leaders who were talking about how they could continue to provide Ukraine with what they need for weapons and buy some of those weapons from the U.S.\nOf course, NATO is the best way to do that.\nAnd we know that we have seized Russian assets in Europe, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars, and that was seized assets.\nThere is interest coming in on what's the holdings of those assets that can be used for some of these weapons purchases.\nSo I think, however we can make that work is important because the most critical thing is to ensure that Ukraine gets what it needs to continue the conduct of this war to fight back against Russia, and that we put significant pressure on Vladimir Putin and Russia to get to the negotiating table.\nThe fact is, I'm pleased to see the turnaround in President Trump's language.\nHe finally seems to understand that he's been played by Vladimir Putin for months, and he seems to be getting serious about ensuring that we do something to put pressure on Russia.\nWell, if pressure, pressure on Russia might necessitate pressure on China, Senator, as we consider this prospect of secondary sanctions or tariffs.\nHowever, we want to characterize that knowing China is such an important trading partner of ours.\nThat's why so much focus has been put on the level of tariffs.\nThese are our country and theirs have on each other.\nDo you worry about the potential economic ramifications here at home?\nI don't.\nAnd in fact, what would we have done today as a minority report from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to release a report.\nHere it is on the impact that is happening because of America's retreat account across the world and the opening that that gives to China.\nSo I think it's very important for us to take strong action.\nChina has moved in where the United States has shut down foreign assistance programs.\nThey started doing that in days, describing China as the reliable partner and the United States as a partner that was not reliable.\nSo it's important for us to keep the commitment that we make to our allies and partners.\nWell, it's important that you bring up this report from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and I wonder your thoughts if, in fact, these sanctions are put into effect, if that would have the impact on China that many suspect.\nBut also you're referring to the outreach that we've seen here from US Agency for International Development and the effort to claw back some of the funding in this rescissions package that's before you now in the Senate, has raised a lot of questions for Democrats about whether it will be possible to work with House Republicans.\nWill that pass that rescissions package to begin with, with the US Agency for International Development and NPR PBS cuts?\nAnd if it does, will Democrats join Republicans in crafting a budget for the next fiscal year, or are talks officially off?\nWell, we are working.\nI'm on the Appropriations Committee.\nWe are working on the budget for the upcoming year.\nWe already passed two bills out of the Appropriations Committee, agriculture, where I'm the ranking member and the programs that fund the operations of the Capitol and the legislative branch here.\nSo I think that's positive progress.\nAnd the fact is, our Republican colleagues, in a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats, have expressed concern about the threat that China poses to the United States.\nIt's an economic threat.\nIt's a military threat.\nAnd if we want to compete with China, as this report shows, then we need to be much more strategic about what our vision is.\nWe need to stop rolling back our diplomatic efforts around the world, the soft power, the foreign assistance that has been the hallmark of America's foreign policy for the last 60 years.\nWe need to stop putting tariffs on our allies and partners who help make us as strong as we are.\nThere are significant national security and economic implications for what this administration has done in terms of rolling back our ability to compete with China.\n",
