  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nBloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\n\nThe Stock Movers Podcast, your roundup of companies making moves in the stock market, harnessing the power of Bloomberg data.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the stocks on the move today.\nI'm Paul Sweeney alongside Norah Mulinda.\n\nI do want to turn to Tim Craighead and he's based in London.\nHe's joining us via Zoom.\nHe's a research director for content for Bloomberg Intelligence.\nAnd I'm looking at this story that's out right now and lots of really interesting illustrations, but the story is called Banking Booze and 007 wheels.\n10 companies to watch right now.\nPaul, I have no idea where this is going.\nI'm so curious just based off the headline alone.\nLet's do it.\nLet's do it.\nBut Tim, contextualize this for us.\nTell us what is this list.\n\nThese 10 ideas are all part of a broader list of what we call Focus Ideas.\nFocus Ideas are where our analysts around the globe, across regions, cross sectors have high conviction fundamental points of view that they think are different from what the market thinks, anti-consensus.\nAnd importantly, they're catalyst coming up that we think can change market perceptions.\nAnd these 10 all have important catalysts coming up during the third quarter.\n\nTim, what I like about these ideas, you know, because people are always looking for ideas, long and short.\nYou guys have the ideas and what I really like about this research format is you have the triggers.\nWhat has to happen in order for this call to work on a particular stock?\nAston Martin.\nWhat's the call here on Aston Martin?\n\nThe call on Aston Martin.\nAs much as I like the cars, and obviously this is where the 007 reference comes from, they've got a really interesting new lineup of vehicles, but they're short on V12s.\nAnd notwithstanding the the world of EVs and all that sort of stuff, V high-end V12s from Ferrari and Lamborghini are hot.\nAnd you look at the inventory levels of Aston Martin on the lots.\nThey're too high.\nWe think that there's a capital infusion that's likely needed in coming months.\nAnd so we actually have a a cautious view on Aston Martin from that perspective.\n\nUh booze Dagio, what's the story there?\n\nDagio, it ties in a little bit with a couple of of ideas here.\nYou know, I mentioned Aston Martin.\nThat's obviously a high-end consumer idea.\nAnd even though we're concerned about Aston Martin specifically, the high-end luxury vehicle market is good.\nSimilarly with Dagio, high-end booze, high-end spirits, they are the world's largest spirits manufacturer, is doing relatively well.\nYou know, their recent sales trends have been robust.\nUm, we think that's going to continue to show through.\nThere has been concern about things like tariffs and what could be the impact, especially from a US consumer base.\nWe're less concerned and we're optimistic.\nAnother consumer higherend idea you guys know and love in the States is Dick Sporting Goods.\nUm, you know, this is a classic good old consumer's growth story where not only do you know the store, but you might have been in one of their new bigger formats where they have, you know, that much more kit.\nTheir sales trends continue to be quite good despite concerns about what are tariffs going to mean for consumer here or there.\nSo, you know, those are all those are all consumer ideas.\nThere's certainly a common thread there.\nYou mentioned Dix and I'm looking at EasyJet, which of course we know is a lowcost British airline and we have a sunny outlook here, but what do you think will be the most surprising call here for readers?\n\nYeah, it's interesting in this instance, obviously, this is not the high-end consumer.\nThis is everyday consumer.\nThis isn't so much about the demand, which actually demand for travel and experience continues to be pretty good.\nUm, this is more of a story on an operational basis.\nThey're replacing a lot of older planes with newer planes that have bigger capacity.\nThey're much more fuel efficient.\nSo, this is a margin story.\nEasyJet has historically lagged behind Ryionaire, the other lowcost carrier here in Europe.\nWe think that that's set to change.\n\nTim, you live and work in London, but as most of our listeners uh can tell, you're not an Englishman.\nYou're from uh the great Commonwealth of Virginia.\nTalk to us.\nAre the tourists is it as crazy in London this year as it's been in in recent years?\nWhat's the tourism factor there in London these days?\n\nI the quick answer is yes.\nNotwithstanding the fact that the pound is actually pretty robust as of late.\nStreets are busy.\nIt's true in the city.\nWalk out the door here Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or the new Friday.\nUm and it has been a warm summer.\nBut you know this is also the time for Wimbledon and beyond that it's just been busy with people coming from all over the world whether it's China whether it's the US this seems to be a a hot ticket still feels pretty good\nyou mentioned the pound sterling but the boy the euro 117 that gets your attention\n\nyeah it does from our perspective this is a weak dollar story as opposed to stronger other currency story and we think that there's more legs to this you know one of the big themes that comes up in all the investor discussions or events that I'm at is is the longstanding uh premise of American exceptionalism.\nYou pop money in US bonds, US stocks, and they take off.\nYou know, is that holding?\n\nThe Stock Movers podcast from Bloomberg Radio.\nCheck back with us throughout the day for the latest roundup of companies making news on Wall Street and for the latest market moving headlines.\nListen to Bloomberg Radio Live.\nCatch us on YouTube, bloomberg.com, and on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\n",
