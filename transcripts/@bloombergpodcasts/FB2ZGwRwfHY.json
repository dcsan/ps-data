  "cleanText": "Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\n\nJoining us now to get out to the tech earnings and the tech space, Deepwater Asset Management, Gene Munster. Can't say enough about Gene's commitment to Bloomberg Surveillance in combination with Dan Ies. Eyes Munster Eyes we saw on July 4th with Gene. Thank you for that commitment to doing that program.\n\nGot it. Love it. Gene, I brought up Microsoft, which I never look at, and they got a they're modeling 12, 13% revenue growth. Do you have a conviction on Mag 7 blended revenue growth, does it sustain or is there a direction to it?\n\nWell, I can tell you what the numbers are that basically if you look at everything with the exception of Nvidia, the street expectations for this year is 13% growth and maybe as expected a similar growth rate for 2026. Now, typically when you see rising numbers, the comps get more difficult and the street anticipates a deceleration in growth. And what we're seeing is kind of the opposite. This is kind of a rare chapter. My sense is that next year calendar 26 is going to surprise to the upside and I just want to caution is when I the markets at all-time highs. I think that that kind of gets people a little bit more enthusiastic and I'm I'm backing out what the market's doing. I just want to kind of zero in on what the fundamentals are, right? And the bottom line is that these companies are just fundamentally having more success in squeezing juice out of their existing business and just adding additional spice to their growth. And so, Tom, I feel really good about how these companies are going to play out. The one I would mention that I'm less optimistic, you mentioned Microsoft. That is one that I don't think has the dynamic upside that a lot of the other big tech companies do. Using that as a model, you had a COVID recovery, you had a 2022 pause and then up up and away with the Yardeni and Compora October 2022 bottom. Gene Munster, do you as a tech guy, do you extrapolate that trend from the autumn of 2022?\n\nI do. I think that when you there's going to be es and flows in terms of kind of optimism and pessh skepticism skepticism the liberation day back in April optimism where we're at now but if you if you step back and look at the broader trend over the next three years let's say I think that this is going to continue to be a bull market. I think it's going to go materially higher and ultimately I think it's going to end in a in a bursting of a bubble. And the reason why I mentioned that kind of that that that rough edge of of kind of how this plays out is that if I'm right about what the next three years look like and we get just across the board optimism. I mean, levels that, I think are hard to kind of comprehend, I think that ultimately there probably is some sort of bubble bursting. But Tom, to answer your question, I think that, you know, we're we're very optimistic. Deep Water, we are about 70% of our investments are AI related. Wow.\n\nAnd I sleep well at night. Gene, you you said you were maybe a little bit cautious on Microsoft. I look at the ANR function for Microsoft. 65 buys, seven holds, zero sells. What's your current view of Microsoft here?\n\nYou just have better places to invest and they've steady revenue. There is a lot of that predictability which is attractive. I just maybe to give some context to why the stock is working. That piece is attractive. And second is Microsoft has probably been the most forwardthinking company when it comes to using AI to save cost. They've talked about this $500 million in annual savings just in terms of coding moving that over to the machine. And so I think that investors are are expecting some margin expansion. So I think that you know that's the reason why it's moving up. The reason why I'm just think there are better places to be is that ultimately the the upside to the numbers if you look at across the rest of the mag 7 I think there's just more upside to you know Microsoft for example is not going to grow at 20%. might grow at 14 and a.5% whereas you have a company like Apple surprisingly the street's looking for mid-s singledigit growth next year and you could see 8% growth.\n\nGene, I was in the acclaimed Bloomberg food court the other day looking at the Red Sox box scores. I don't know if you're aware, Gene, but the Red Sox have won 10 in a row and one of our fancy artificial intelligence people walked up to me and said, \"You know, Tom, you need a brief.\" So, I got briefed. Do you parse a difference between chat GBT Google Gemini? Help me here. Anthropic perplexity is something. Are are these all equal things, Gene Munster, or for our listeners and viewers, do we need to learn nuances of them?\n\nWell, the the answer is it's nuance. And this is something we're actually working on a a bigger project right now. We're going through and testing these different models. And there are there's like broadly accepted testing benchmarking like chatbot arena for example which is is widely recognized but there's a lot of gamification in terms of how the companies go up against those those those those benchmarks and then there's just the coding side how well there's a code and then there's just like the real world like does it give you the answer you're looking for and it turns out that each of these models with the exception of llama llama is pretty weak and so but if you look at the other four primary models they all have kind of different strengths. And so, ultimately is that, um, think of AI as more of like a personality is that the world isn't going to be centered on one personality. We wouldn't want that. And so, each of these models has a slightly different personality and slightly different strengths. And so that's what we are seeing is if you're going to say what's like the best model kind of putting everything all together it's it's probably open AI GPT today and then Grock and and Gemini kind of close behind.\n\nSo Gene today the news is on the chip side the US government says I don't Nvidia AMD they can start sending some of these advanced AI chips to China. What's the backstory there? What stocks are trading up on this news?\n\nWell, it's big news obviously for Nvidia and they talked three months ago about this impact being a negative 15% to the overall growth. So if you think about the street numbers maybe just to Paul to kind of zero in on what's going on with Nvidia is company 3 months ago says we can't sell these H20s to China and that's going to cost us 15% of our revenue. Um the reason why that the street numbers are not going to go up by 15% today is twofold. Number one is the 40 analysts that cover Nvidia. About eight of them had anticipated that these curbs be released in this current quarter. And so you saw some of the analysts already expecting this announcement. And then separately is that this is good news. It's good news for Nvidia, but like the whole geopolitical conversation around how chips play into rare minerals and all that that hasn't been solved. And if one thing we've learned over the last three months is that you really can't take one development in a day and extrapolate it over the next couple years. So that's why the stock's up 5% today, not 15%.\n\nQuickly, let's do that with Apple. Why not? Okay. Gene Munster on Apple. Are they going to surprise people with a plus+ here in the announcement?\n\nUh, you know, as far as like the geopolitical side um like announcements there, I I I don't know if anything's going to happen there. I can say this is that if you look at the mag 7 and look at where is the the likely most upside in the September quarter so pretty narrow near-term focused Apple's at the top of the list. The street's looking for flat revenue growth in the September quarter. They're contin they're going to benefit from that huge 37% growth back in 2021. Those upgrades are going to be coming in, right?\n\nIt's it's not flashy. It's not AI. But in terms of going into this print and the commentary about the September quarter, I think Apple's going to show well.\n\nJean, thanks for the brief. Gene Munster with deep water and technologist.\n",
