  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\n[Music]\nHello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast.\nI'm Joe Weisenthal.\nAnd I'm Tracy Alloway.\nA former OddLods guest is very likely to be the next mayor of New York City.\nThat's right.\nSo, we interviewed Zohran Mamdani.\nI think it was in early May.\nAnd right after that, I'm not saying I'm not going to take credit for this, but right after that, he really started to surge in the polls and he went on to win the Democratic nomination.\nI think we take very, very minor credit.\nI'm sure it was a coincidence.\nThe thing actually that struck me after that episode was hearing from a lot of people who were basically like I don't like any of his ideas at all but I still like the guy and uh I still found him impressive and intelligent and very uh you know strong understanding of policy and look I don't think his victory is attributable to us but I did think that was telling in the sense that a lot of people who maybe on paper shouldn't or wouldn't really like some of his views, didn't seem particularly threatened by him, which I thought was like really interesting and may have contributed to his sort of extraordinary margin, his extraordinary victory.\nI do think what's interesting about this whole story is the tension between New York City as this hub of capitalism, this hub of business.\nYou have a lot of money here, a lot of billionaires obviously with their own interests.\nAnd now you have this Democratic socialist candidate who's proposing something a little bit new.\nAlthough some people would say we had something more similar to that in say the 1950s, 1960s New York.\nBut that tension is what I find really fascinating right now.\nYeah.\nSo we have to uh we have to learn more.\nI mean, again, in the run-up to the election, like what are New York City's business, financial elites thinking right now?\nWhat do they think of a possible Mamdani mayor?\nWhat do they think about New York City in general?\nAll of this stuff.\nThere's a lot to there's a lot to learn.\nThis is going to be a rich vein of interesting stuff for us for a while.\nWe're going all New York local politics, I guess.\nBut I do think it has national consequences.\nSo, we should talk about it.\nWe should definitely talk about it.\nAnyway, I'm really excited.\nWe do have indeed the perfect guest to talk about how the city's business elite billionaires etc. are thinking about the city, thinking about the election, the possibility of Mamdani being the mayor.\nWe're going to be speaking with Kathy Wylde.\nShe is the president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, which is an organization, a business leadership organization here.\nAll kinds of uh major employers.\nIf you read any article about Kathy in the media described as sort of one of the ultimate power brokers of New York City, yeah, words like power brokers, power player comes up in every single one and so truly the perfect guest.\nSo, uh Kathy, thank you so much for coming on OddLots.\nThank you for having me, Joe and Tracy.\nAbsolutely.\nWe're really excited.\nWhy don't you just before we move on, describe what the Partnership for New York City is and what you basically do there.\nThe partnership is business working in the interests of the city.\nIt's not a chamber of commerce.\nIt was organized after the city's 1975 physical crisis by David Rockefeller who was then the chair of Chase Bank and other CEOs of the major corporations that were not just businesses headquartered in New York but were real citizens of New York and trustees of its hospitals and museums and real contributors to the city as philanthropists.\nSo it is very much a business organization that is designed to tap the expertise and the influence of the business community to support New York City and to maintain it as the city of great economic opportunity.\nWhat's the partnership's relationship like typically with the mayoral administration?\nAnd are there examples where you've worked together to effectively do something or maybe change the path of policy?\nWell, absolutely.\nThe partnership's relationship to government is really as an intermediary between business and government.\nAs I said to provide expertise, to provide advice, to give feedback, really to be a resource more than an adversary of uh with the local government in particular, local state government and some extent the federal government when there are overriding issues that make a big impact on New York that are being considered in Washington.\nWhen did Zohran come on the radar of the people that you talked to, of the CEOs, etc. like in the runup like was it a month before?\nWas he were they thinking about him at all?\nThree months before the election.\nI'm sort of curious like when it may have flickered in their minds that the Democratic party could nominate a socialist.\nI would have to say that it was primary night about 10:00.\nReally?\nYeah.\nIncredible to me.\nThat's incredible to me.\nWell, I I had forewarned them that it was a possibility, but I think Cuomo had been a figure in their lives as Mario's son, as attorney general, as governor for 20ome years.\nAnd it was kind of a foregone conclusion is the guy we know who's now running for mayor is going to be mayor.\nYeah.\nAnd especially after NYC mayor Adams announced he was not going to be in the Democratic primary.\nAnd so they had kind of zeroed in on accepting that it was going to be Cuomo and really no one had met Zohran.\nWhat was the mood like on primary night?\nDid everyone immediately go home and start looking up socialism on the internet on chat GPT?\nWell, I I would say hysteria would be a good word for it.\nShock was first.\nShock first.\nAnd what happened and who is this person?\nAnd so I tried to provide some reassurance.\nWe had for the past 20 years led efforts to bring congestion pricing to New York City to both manage traffic, but to really make the city a more efficient place.\nExcess traffic congestion was costing the city $20 billion a year with lost time, lost productivity.\nAnd what makes New York a great place to work is the productive workforce.\nSo we'd been an advocate of congestion pricing.\nAnd I had actually met Zohran in that context at the writers alliance which is a group of subway riders advocates and had found him to be a very smart interesting young man.\nSo I had known him and then he reached out to me last September and said I'd like to talk to you about my mayoral prospects when he was polling at 1%.\nAnd so I uh met him for coffee at the LPQ at 85 Broad and we had a conversation and I found him to be smart and I took him seriously from then on.\nH I mean I'm impressed from his perspective that that early on he wanted to sort of build that connection or make that connection with you.\nBefore you talk more about him, a friend of mine described you as a therapist to the New York City billionaires.\nThey were hysterical on or they're experiencing hysteria on primary night.\nDid you feel like that was your role in that night?\nDid you feel like a therapist to the members of the partnership to provide reassurance to the business community?\nI mean, number one, to remind them that many of the things they were most worried about from a so Democratic socialist candidate were things that he has absolutely no capacity to execute on.\nSo, for example, raising corporate and income taxes is not something that the city or the mayor can do.\nUh, free buses is not something the mayor can do.\nand figuring out where you make up that 800 million in um in revenues.\nSo, that was number one, reassuring them that we have a moderate governor who's watching out for business interests, who says she's not going to further raise taxes in New York, which is the highest tax city in the country and in most cases the world for both individual income tax and corporate tax.\nSo that was number one, providing reassurance that as mayor he would have an agenda, but there are a lot of checks and balances to work through in New York and it's not a unilateral post.\nNow that was more difficult with the real estate community because their concerns having to do with land use proceedings and approvals and uh construction permits etc. that the mayor does control basically a huge amount of control over that process.\nThat is the one thing that's local and real estate taxes uh where the mayor has significant influence.\nSo it was more difficult with members of the real estate community who after the primary quickly pivoted to remembering what a good friend NYC mayor Adams was.\nSo, I want to talk more about the concerns of the business community, obviously.\nBut before we do, I can't resist asking, when you first met Zohran over coffee, what advice did you give him?\nWhat did you actually say to him about a mayoral run?\nNumber one, I said that you can't lead New York City unless you have a constructive relationship with the Jewish community because that was the most obvious source of concern that he seemed not able to address that worried me a lot.\nNumber two, that the solution to affordability is not for government, local government to spend more money.\nThat the money that local government spends has to be accounted for.\nThat you need to raise taxes to support it.\nAnd ultimately, that just ups the cost of living and the cost of doing business in New York.\nAnd that all ends up getting passed along to consumers.\nSo the affordability question, which he was absolutely right to emphasize and emphasize from the beginning, that we've got to make New York more affordable to not just poor people, to the middle class, to uh those people who rent an apartment.\nAnd now the average rents almost $4,000 a month.\nThis is the big concern of employers.\nAnd I said this is their number one concern.\nHow do we keep and retain young talent if they can't afford to rent an apartment in New York City?\nBig frustration.\nSo, that was that was kind of the conversation that we had and he was open to that conversation and and interested in learning.\nI mean, he impressed me right away as somebody who is interested in learning more, but who has um has very strong opinions and is very committed.\nAnd I mean he's 33 years old and the world is his oyster.\nYeah.\nYou mentioned the importance of relations with the Jewish community.\nAnd I saw I watched that I didn't watch the whole debate, but I did watch the last debate and there was that question about which country are you going to visit first?\nAnd every candidate Bud Sauron said he was going to they were going to visit Israel.\nHe said he wasn't thinking about was going to visit.\nCan you explain from the perspective of the business leaders, New York City, why do they perceive that good relations with Israel is such an important aspect of the job of Yeah.\nWhy does the mayor of New York have to have a foreign policy?\nWell, their fear is that he has a foreign policy.\nI I don't think anybody thinks the mayor of New York has to have a foreign policy, but he has a record of speaking out on issues that impact the Jewish community about Israel that they're very concerned about.\nAnd so their concern is not having New York City has uh has a long history of values that are very strong on supporting a diversity of people are very tolerant of various religious beliefs and a long history with Israel.\nI mean when Cornell Technion partnered on uh Technneon's the university in Israel that really led the startup nation movement in Israel and did so much to propel their economy and they were selected under the Bloomberg administration to establish a firstass engineering school in New York on Roosevelt Island which has been very successful and is producing a great number of PhDs.\nAnd so at the time that they came in, Technon came in, they told me how they had been funded originally.\nIt was New York Jewish philanthropists that funded that effort.\nSo there's this long-term relationship.\nAnd obviously we have many people in New York who are family of Holocaust victims and survivors and for whom the fact of a Jewish homeland a safe space for Jews around the world is of top area of importance.\nI think that that that they are very concerned that the mayor of New York City respect and understand the importance of Israel and our long-term relationship.\nAnd that that worries them a lot.\nAnd that's an issue that I think he has yet to resolve.\nI think it's difficult because he has strong support in the young Jewish community and so I'm sure he feels that he's got a lot of people who are with him on the issues of protecting the rights of the Palestinians and concerns about that.\nSo, it's um this is an area again where the fact that he ran a campaign and had built relationships that are a piece of New York City.\nUh he expanded the electorate to folks who have not participated, but he really did not develop much of a relationship with the historic electorate.\nHe was running against the Democratic establishment, not with it.\nAnd so the communities where much of the Jewish population is concentrated were not communities he was necessarily reaching out to except for the young people and the social media crowd.\nAnd that's not the people who are most concerned.\n[Music]\nSo on the topic of the campaign, I mean this was one of the really surprising things of him winning.\nHe had this sort of grassroots campaign which was very much focused on social media.\nLots of merchandise with really interesting designs.\nI've seen the hot girls for Zohran t-shirts, people wearing those around town, usually young women, as you mentioned.\nAnd I'm curious, are any of the people you're speaking to perhaps thinking differently about campaign donations going forward if they donated billions of dollars for Cuomo and Zohran?\nWhat?\nWell, not billions, but millions.\nOkay.\nUm, yes.\nYes.\nI would say that for the most part what I'm hearing is that people feel that they contributed to Cuomo and that they don't feel they got a very good campaign out of it.\nThey want to meet Zohran and I think they're making there are many particularly in the real estate community that are stepping up to transfer whatever donations they were making to Cuomo to Eric Adams, if you will, the somebody that they know they can do business with and who has been supportive of tremendously positive growth in the city from the uh nater of the pandemic and what where our economy was, where our real estate situation.\nUm, Eric Adams, it should not be ignored that he has, his administration has led rezoning efforts and really changed the zoning code for the first time since 1961.\nSo, he's made a tremendous investment in trying to begin the process of making it easier and less expensive to develop housing in the city and supported economic growth overall.\nSo there was concern.\nI mean, obviously he's the first mayor that's been indicted and when he dropped out of the Democratic primary, I think that solidified most of the money going to Cuomo, but Eric is back in the general and in in uh in good form.\nI noticed you said something in I think your first answer that the um the business elite had accepted Cuomo as who was going to be the nominee.\nThat accepted it does not sound the same as enthusiastically support.\nI hear that as sort of resigned\n\n\nYeah. Okay.\nStatus quo.\nYeah. And so I'm curious, like,\ncome on, you have to laugh at that. Good\nlines, right? Status. That's a good one\nactually. Thank you. Thank you.\nThat was good. But how did they feel\nactually about Cuomo and also, like, I\nknow there are some questions. It's still\nunclear whether he's going to run\nactively in November, but if they do\ncoalesce around someone, does it\ndefinitely seem like it's going to be\nAdams?\nSo far, I think yes, I think it's going\nto be Adams. If, and again, it is, um,\nthe real estate community that's most\nconcerned. You understand that the\nfinancial industry in New York basically\nis prohibited by federal regulation, SEC\nand FINRA, and other regulation from\ncontributing to state and local\ncandidates beyond a nominal amount of a\nfew hundred dollars. So they are not for\nthe most part money players in state and\nlocal elections, which has really\ndisadvantaged New York's business\ncommunity, which represents like 40% of\nour tax base, who can't participate in\nsupporting candidates of their choice.\nWell, they can knock on doors like the\nZohran Mamdani volunteers did. They just\ncan't donate gobs of money\nand that would be great, but not\nhappening. Okay. Um, it's, uh, most of\nthem are beyond the doorknocking age.\nSure.\nBut your question about Cuomo, Cuomo was\nattorney general during the financial\ncrisis and was not very friendly toward\nthe financial industry and did not\ndevelop relationships that were very\npositive during his tenure as attorney\ngeneral with the business community. So,\nand that was his job to be an enforcer.\nAnd during his term as governor, he came\nin with a very strong agenda to try and\nget state spending under control and get\ntaxes under control. But having made\nsome, some real progress there on\nMedicaid reform and pension reform as\nthe political winds changed, uh, there\nwasn't that same relationship with the\nbusiness community. So, with the\nexception of real estate, where he was\nvery pro-growth, investing in\ninfrastructure, supporting real estate\ndevelopment. So I would say that he had\nrelative enthusiasm in the real estate\ncommunity, but not broadly based in the\nbusiness community.\nSo on this note, you've emphasized a\nnumber of times that a lot of business\nleaders obviously want to talk to Zohran.\nThey want to get in the room with him.\nAnd you are organizing, I believe,\ndiscussions between the business\ncommunity and the mayoral candidate, I\nthink, next week. We're recording this\non, let's see, July 9th.\nHow do you decide who gets to be in the\nroom with Zohran? Well, the first meeting\nwe're doing, and I set this up with\nZohran, he called me right after the\nelection and said he wanted to\nestablish those relationships. And I\nsaid, \"Well, let's.\" So, we set up a\nmeeting with the CEOs of the Partnership\nfor New York City that's on Tuesday. And\nso, there'll be some will join virtually,\nbut it's going to be mostly an in-person\n150 maybe CEOs of major companies, major\nemployers in the city who have never met\nhim. And we'll be for the first time\ngetting the opportunity. That's going to\nbe a conversation with our co-chairs, Rob\nSpire of Tishman Spire and Dr. Albert\nBurla of Pfizer. And so they'll be having\na conversation with Zohran and then\nwe'll have some Q&A with our members.\nAnd so that's that's number one. And\nthen, um,\nyou'll come back next week, right? And\nwe'll do a follow-up to this episode and\nyou just tell us.\nIt'll be interesting. Yes, I'm I'm\nlooking forward, I'm looking forward to\nthat conversation. But I think again,\nit's an introduction, and I have full\nconfidence, as you know, having met him.\nYeah,\nZohran is pretty good at presenting\nhimself and very fast in terms of his\nthoughtful responses on issues. So I'm\nlooking forward to that because it'll\nsave me a lot of time reassuring him\nthat he's not the devil. He's okay. And\nthen on Wednesday, Kevin Ryan, who is\nkind of the father of Silicon Alley, Ali\nCorp is the name of his corporation and\nhas has a prolific history of creating\ntech companies in New York. Kevin is\ngoing to moderate a conversation with\nhim, which will be heavily tech focused,\nmore entrepreneurs than corporate\nfinance types. So that'll be on\nWednesday. And then I should add that on\nThursday we'll be doing breakfast with\nNYC mayor Eric Adams.\nOkay.\nAnd speaking to him about his path\nforward, and as I said, there's been a\nlot of support for the policies that Eric\nAdams has. He started out as mayor. I\nhad the same conversation with Eric. I'm\na Brooklyn person. So I've known Eric\nfor many years and most recently in his\ncapacity as Brooklyn burough president.\nBut when we started out, he didn't know\nanybody in the New York business\ncommunity either. But he introduced\nhimself as saying, \"My number one\npriority is public safety. And my number\ntwo priority is a thriving economy, and\nI'm with you.\" And having lived through\neight years of Bill de Blasio as mayor,\nwho had nothing to do or to say to them\nexcept, \"You're awful people.\" And as\nJamie Diamond famously said, \"For eight\nyears, I never got a call from Bill\nde Blasio when he was mayor and have never\nhad a conversation with him.\"\nSo Eric immediately reversed the de Blasio\nbig business is bad for New York and\nEric said, \"I want wealthy people in New\nYork. I want big business in New York.\"\nSo I don't expect that from Zohran, uh,\nnext week. I, I don't, I think that that\nhe's not going to have the same\nunbridled enthusiasm for billionaires,\nbut I do expect that he will come across\nas a responsible person who's thinking\nseriously and is open to learning, which\nis most important to listening and\nlearning. And I think that that that the\nnumber one concern is, is this a dogmatic\nideological person who is just going to\nis, is going to be, um, not interested in\nwhat we can contribute to the city or\nwhat employers contribute.\nYou mentioned Kevin Ryan. I used to work\nfor Business Insider, which one of the\nAlley Corp companies. So I'm a\nbeneficiary of his New York City\ninvestments. You know, when the night of\nthe primary, I got some random messages\nonline. They're like, \"Are you going to\nleave New York City? I'm never going to\nleave New York City.\" Like, it's the\nbest city in the world, obviously. But,\nyou know, people do leave, and in 2021\nand 2022, people pretended to think that\nMiami was a better option for them. I\nthink a bunch of them came back or they\nspent just the, you know, minimum amount\nof time there so they could, you know,\nqualify for their local taxes, etc. In\nyour view or in the view of the\nemployers of New York City, what are the\nthreats, the substantive threats that\nwould say, okay, this would meaningfully\nchange the desiraability of doing\nbusiness in this town?\nNumber one is public safety, and that's\nagain, they've appreciated, particularly\nunder Commissioner Tish and originally\nunder Commissioner, uh, Kan Su, they have\nappreciated that the Adams\nadministration has focused on public\nsafety and that we're\nand that's more important than things\nlike taxes for them. Yes, absolutely.\nBecause the whole basis of business\nbeing here is the talent pool. And if\ntalent doesn't want to be here, if\nthey're scared to leave be in New York\nCity, if they're worried to go on the\nsubway because they might get mugged or\npushed in front of a train, that's the\nworst thing that could happen to New\nYork. So, and and importantly, Zohran has\nacknowledged that keeping New York a\ndestination for talent is a priority for\nhim. So, I think that message is is very\nimportant. So that that public safety\nnumber one and then as I said before,\naffordable housing and affordability\nthat again allows talent to be here and\ndoesn't have a premium cost. I mean\nalready in most sectors, New York City\nsalaries have a 20% premium at least\nover if you're going to locate in Texas\nor Florida, whatever. When it gets higher\nthan that, it becomes hard to explain to\nshareholders why you're here and why\nyou're creating jobs here. So that's the\nthat's the other consideration. So it's\nit's really having a safe city and\nhaving an affordable city are the top\ncriteria and at least in terms of having\nan affordable city, they've got common\ncause with, uh, Zohran's campaign.\nThis is what I was going to ask you. Are\nthere any areas of I guess overlap or\nagreement between Zohran's agenda and the\nconcerns or the desires of the business\ncommunity?\nYeah, absolutely. As I mentioned, one of\nthe big questions that'll come up next\nweek, probably the first question\nthat'll come up is what is your\ncommitment to public safety? You know,\nsymbolically, would you keep Jesse Tish\nas police commissioner? And she\ncertainly won't stay if he's going to\ndefund the police because she's looking\nfor more officers, more resources to\nreally make sure that we stay the safest\ncity in America and the world hopefully.\nSo that'll be public safety. And then on\naffordability, it'll be hoping that they\ncan communicate that just having city\ngovernment increase its budget does not\nimprove affordability. We've got to be\nmore creative than that.\n[Music]\nWhat do you see as the main constraints\nto affordability? What do you, from your\njust from your perspective, how many\nyears did they were they debating about\nputting up some houses at the Elizabeth\nStreet Garden? Like these the process\ntake forever, but like I know that's\nlike the most hot button topic in the\nworld, but just broadly, what do you\nperceive as the main constraint towards\nmaking rent cheaper in New York City?\n30% of rent is real estate taxes in rent\nregulated buildings. So, government\nspending that depends on real estate\ntaxes, that's where the majority of the\ncity revenues come from, is driving high\nrents. Uh, it's not that developers in\nthese older rent regulated buildings are\nmaking a huge profit. It's that their\ncosts have gone up. Their water bills,\netc. All these are on water and sewer.\nThese are under control of the city. So\nthere are things government can do very\nquickly to reduce costs as an example.\nWhat about just sheer volume of housing\nproduction? Because right in the end,\nlike most people, okay, rent is very\nexpensive. It's also scarce, and that\ncontributes to the fact that rent prices\ngo up and that landlords can yeah\ncollect a lot of rent. Do you think\nthere are meaningful levers that could\nbe pulled to rapidly increase the pace\nin which we build, whether it's\naffordable housing or market rate\nhousing, etc.? Like what would you\nidentify?\nAbsolutely. Again, it's reducing\ngovernment bureaucracy. Right now I'm on\nthe city charter revision commission\nwhich is going to put resolutions before\nthe public, I believe, in November to look\nat how we can cut down on the time and\ncost associated with development\napprovals, especially for smaller\nprojects. The other thing I want to\nmention that affects the cost of\nconstruction\nvery much, but also it affects all other\ncosts is the cost of litigation\npassed along to consumers through high\ninsurance costs. We have the highest\nclaims and settlements. We have the\nhighest degree of litigation in the\ncountry. It's almost impossible to get\nanything through the legislature that\ndoesn't include a private right of\naction. The trial lawyers are the\nstrongest lobby in Albany. also have a\nlot of influence within the city and we\nhave to get down our litigation costs.\nOur insurance costs are substantially\nhigher than anywhere else in the\ncountry. Our car insurance costs are 49%\nhigher than the average in the country.\nOur health insurance costs are 12%\nhigher. These are all costs that we\ncould absolutely contain and control.\nAnd the city, which is basically\nself-insured, ends up paying this out of\npocket. So they pay billions of dollars\na year in medical malpractice in other\nfund a lot of free buses\nthat would fund a lot of free buses.\nAren't the higher litigation costs\naren't they just a reflection of I guess\nthe higher cost of living and materials\nmaybe and things like that?\nThey're they're a reflection of a system\nwhere our jury awards are much higher\nthan any place else. They call them\nnuclear awards. Uh, no, it's all because\nof laws. We have one law on the books in\nAlbany. It's part of the labor law. It\nwas passed a hundred years ago, and it\nwas passed before we had workers\ncompensation and other protections for\nconstruction workers. If you have a\ngravity related injury, and many of these\nare staged, that one law can add 5 to 7%\nto the cost of construction, just that\none law. And so when we say why, why does\nit cost a million dollars to produce a\ntwo-bedroom rental apartment in New York\nto build it? When you look at it, you'll\nsee that a big chunk of that is the\nresult of the litigation insurance costs\nand the time that it takes to get\nanything done, the carrying costs for\nthe time.\nI want to ask a sort of social question\ngiven your role as therapist to, uh, the\nwealthy, but I get a sense sometimes\nthat there is a feeling out there among\nmaybe a lot of people that billionaires\nare less charitable than they once were,\ncertainly going back to earlier in the\ncentury, perhaps, and I think back to,\nlike, Rockefeller, who you know or knew,\num, and worked with, and him bailing out\nthe city in the 1970s, like that was an\nact where he decided I am going to spend\nmoney in order to save New York and\ncontribute to New York's future. Is that\nan accurate portrayal of billionaires\nnowadays? Are they less engaged in\noverall society?\nWell,\nin many cases, the family wealth, like\nin the Rockefeller family, has\ndiversified. So, you don't have one\nperson who is as wealthy. It's spread\nout. But the commitment to New York, to\nits hospitals, its museums, its\nuniversities, its institutions. We have\nby far the most philanthropic city in\nthe world. I get visitors from all over\nthe world, from Paris, from London, from\nLA, from San Francisco, all of whom say,\n\"How does New York create a culture\nwhich is so giving, which is so\ngenerous?\" And the Rockefellers and the\nAers and many of the families that, you\nknow, the key families of New York did\ncontribute to this. But then you saw the\ntributes to Leonard Lauder who died a\nfew weeks ago. They were all for from\nevery nonprofit institution. The\ngenerosity of New Yorkers is huge. The\nlabel billionaire\nis often attached to\nself-promoters who are promoting\nthemselves as billionaires. I would\ndistinguish that. None of the people\nthat I'm talking about want to be known\nor proclaim themselves or position\nthemselves as billionaires.\nRight.\nYeah. That definitely resonates. I want\nto go back to something. You know, you\nmentioned the generational divide among\nNew York City's Jewish community and the\nidea that the under 40 crowd may have a\nvery different perception of the\nrelationship that New York City should\nhave about the state of Israel or state\nof Israel, period. And you also mentioned\nthat, you know, for many of the people\nthat you work with, it only dawned on\nthem that a socialist could be the, uh,\nDemocratic nominee at 10 p.m. on\nelection night, which makes me wonder\nlike how plugged they are in because\ncertainly in at least the month prior to\nthe election, it became very obvious to\nme that this was like a very real\npossibility that he could win. Like is\nthere a persistent problem of sort of\nlike generational awareness?\n\n\nAnd I'm thinking also about affordability and housing and some of these other issues where I don't want to say like out of touch, but I guess out of touch between the business elites, the CEOs, etc., and what's on the mind of younger voters, period, across a range of issues.\nI think that's a very fair comment.\nMost of the mature business world is not living on social media.\nWell, they're not they're not plugged into that world.\nAnd that's that's a great contributor to the generational divide.\nI mean, I still read a paper, a real paper, and that's that's a differentiator.\nAnd the other thing is that the globalization of the economy has meant I mean New York is a center of world industry leadership and they are focused and spending their life traveling all over the world.\nSo the fact that we're a headquarters city in all these diverse sectors in fashion, in media, in means that the focus is global rather than local.\nPolitically especially the focus is Washington, which is where most of the regulatory activity is coming from, not local.\nCity and state are sidelines compared.\nSo, it's just the nature of our changing economy over the last 50 years, which has gone from being a local 50 years ago industrial economy to being a service economy to today being a global digital economy.\nAnd all of that means that the attention of business leadership has been largely externally focused on the world business world markets and on Washington that just there's only so many hours in a day.\nMhm.\nI mean, what we try and do at the Partnership for New York City is synthesize for those global leaders what's happening locally and who's who and what's what.\nThat's what we're doing with regard to the mayoral election now.\nIt's trying to bring them into the conversation at a point where they're taking it seriously and they have to prioritize it.\nBut these are these are people who are running global businesses and that's the that's what's changed.\nIt's not anything else but the focus of attention has to be global and well I I would just mention because we sit here in Bloomberg Podcast world that Mike Bloomberg changed that when he was NYC mayor he brought the attention of our global leaders back to New York which was extremely useful.\nI started as CEO of the partnership in uh 2000, right before 2001, before Mike was elected.\nAnd I took advantage of re-engaging you.\nIf you went to a cocktail party in New York that Mike Bloomberg is going to be at, you had to talk New York.\nAnd he was a thought leader.\nHe was the leading philanthropist.\nWhen people ask me who replaced David Rockefeller as the leading philanthropist in the city was Mike Bloomberg.\nSimple.\nI have to do the disclaimer here which is of course Bloomberg News.\nBloomberg Media is part of Bloomberg LP which is owned by Mike Bloomberg.\nSo we didn't tell our guest to describe our boss as the uh the new David Rockefeller.\nNo, we did not.\nUm I I just have one This isn't the first time I've said it.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nI just have one more question which is have you noticed or seen at all I guess moments of introspection among the business community this idea that like oh maybe we missed something about Zohran Mamdani, maybe we missed why he's resonating so much in the city, maybe we should start doing something different, maybe we need to you know actually build more housing or lower rents or whatever or are they still committed very much to uh this not the status quo but the Eric Adams status quo and they want him to win.\nAgain, distinguishing between the real estate community that sees the potential of an existential threat to private development.\nPutting that aside in terms of the general business community, I think your point that they're feeling a little out of touch with uh what's been happening on the ground and they want to plug in.\nThey are really interested.\nI mean, we've had tremendous interest in meeting Zohran, speaking with him.\nHe's made calls to some businesses.\nYeah.\nWhat do they say after like the after those phone calls?\nBecause the they've, you know, you mentioned the meetings that are coming up, but some have already they've already chatted.\nLike what is what what is their response?\nTheir response is that he is um you know, they said he's the politician of a generation.\nI mean, he's a generational figure.\nThey're they're impressed.\nUm, after a 10-minute phone call with him because he is he's a very effective communicator and he listens.\nAnd, you know, business leaders like to be listened to.\nKathy Wylde, that was fantastic.\nSo glad we made this happen.\nAnd uh, like I said, maybe we'll maybe we'll have you back at some point or would love to have you back on at some point.\nThank you.\nNice to be here.\n[Music]\nTracy, I really like that conversation.\nThere was a lot to pull from.\nThis idea, there are a number of things.\nThis idea that the CEOs who are headquartered here in New York City just by the nature of the changing economy are less New York City focused themselves to me is like something I hadn't really thought about but makes a lot of sense to me.\nYeah, I thought that was really interesting.\nThe other interesting point that Kathy brought up was, I guess, the divergence between, you know, Wall Street CEOs and perhaps other businesses versus real estate, which really seems to be freaking out about the prospects of a Mamdani mayorship.\nYeah.\nNo, that's really interesting.\nThis idea that it's uh not monolithic.\nI said it in the intro or I said it early on.\nYou know, I think a lot of people who are on paper, they're like, \"Oh, you look down the list of his policies, maybe not something that they're too into, but the fact that they don't like find him to be threatening or they don't find him to be repellent in some way.\"\nAnd so it's striking that already he's having these conversations.\nAlso like it is just striking to me that you know people see him as you know potentially this extremely ideological person and yet from the very beginning of his campaign in September was reaching out to Kathy and like making these connection.\nI mean it's a it was a really savvy campaign.\nWell, the other thing on that note, first of all, I'm really fascinated to see whether or not this starts to change campaign finance and the way it works because again, Cuomo had all the money and terrible ROI.\nYeah, exactly.\nAnd the other thing I'm really interested in is okay, the business community, Kathy was saying one of their primary concerns is attracting talent into the city.\nWell, you know, that talent presumably a lot of it is young.\nThere's probably a large portion in there that is, you know, of a progressive event.\nYeah.\nAnd so a candidate like Zohran might appeal to them and actually bring more people into the city.\nSo it's also interesting.\nI mean the safety and crime thing is the number one thing, right, that would cause people to leave because and again there's a lot more talk about leaving New York City than there is actually leaving New York City.\nAnd it is true that I think a lot of those people who thought they were going to decamp to Miami during the post-pandemic period have come back for obvious uh for obvious reasons.\nBut it's interesting that it's not even like any of the economic stuff.\nIt's not the uh socialism stuff.\nIt's just the basic safety stuff.\nAnd there is I know there's a lot of the question about whether Mamdani if he wins will keep the police commissioner.\nThe crime stats have improved quite a bit in recent years.\nThe idea that this is like the really big thing more than you know the rent freeze or taxes or anything else I think is just going to be an interesting um executive question for uh Mamdani.\nLots of interesting questions thrown up by this whole election.\nShall we leave it there for now?\nSure.\nLet's leave it there.\nThis has been another episode of the OddLots podcast.\nI'm Tracy Alloway.\nYou can follow me at Tracee Alaway.\nAnd I'm
