  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\nTell me about your dream.\nOkay, so I dreamed that I had a friend who was hosting a TV show about sports and I agreed to be a guest for like an hour.\nYou love sports.\nSo, okay.\nBut first of all, it's like a standard stress dream where like the thing that's happening in the dream is that I have like 2 minutes to get there and I'm like wandering through ESPN's cavernous offices to try to like imaginary dream ESPN to try to find the studio and I can't find it and I'm asking people and I'm late and I'm really nervous.\nBut also secondly, I'm like I don't know anything about sports.\nSo I'm like wandering around like looking at my phone being like googling sports and trying to figure out what I'm going to talk about.\nYeah, I think it was probably about this podcast.\nH god, I have those stress dreams about TV constantly.\nYeah, sure.\nYou actually go on TV.\nLike missing your hit time, like not being able to get your mic on, right?\nThings like that.\nI was missing my sports head.\nYeah.\nGod, I wonder what sport I wish the dream had continued.\nI was like, I know the Mets exist.\nWhat is\nI can be like, I like the Met.\nHow about them Knicks?\nYeah, sports.\nYeah.\nOh, wait.\nI do want to say one more thing.\nOkay, go on.\nI was in an event this week.\nMhm.\nAnd someone was like, \"Do you have any bird updates?\"\nAnd it took me a minute to realize what you're talking about, but then I was like, \"Wait, we have a great bird update, but I got to save it for the pod.\"\nYeah, the great bird update.\nDo you want to tell me?\nWait, I forget.\nIt's not really a bird update.\nIt's a Money Stuff podcast commenter.\nOh, wait.\nI also forgot.\nOkay, you sent me a commenter.\nLeft a comment saying that if you're taking name suggestions for your so far anonymous bird, a good name for a bird would be friend of the pod Bill Aman.\nI love it.\nI love it.\nI think the full comment was like if you put it up to a Twitter poll, may I suggest I think it was friend of the show Bill Aman.\nFriend of the show Bill Aman.\nI don't think my parents would get it if I named our bird, right?\nBut like instead of being like, \"Do you have any bird updates?\"\nI could be like, \"Katie, do you have any updates on the show Bill Aman?\"\nI thought it would be so confusing.\nHe's perching really well.\nUm, he's learned to fly.\nYeah, I realized the problem is that he perches really well.\nSorry, this is a real update really quick.\nHe's perching really well, except he doesn't want to perch on anything but humans.\nI realized is the problem.\nSo, we need to work on that.\nI don't know what to do.\nFriend of the show be laughing.\nYou got to stop perching on humans.\nYeah, come on.\nWe're going to end up abbreviating that.\nFatspa.\nSweet.\nFatspa.\nSweet thoughts, but hello and welcome to the Money Stuff Podcast, your weekly podcast where we talk about stuff related to money.\nI'm Matt Levine and I write the Money Stuff column for Bloomberg Opinion.\nAnd I'm Katie Greifeld, a Bloomberg News reporter.\nWait, what am I?\nHow do I say that?\nAnd I'm Katie Griffeld, a reporter with Bloomberg News and an anchor at Bloomberg Television.\nPlaid last week.\nWhy do I forget that?\nAlso, also like those are simple factual statements.\n[Music]\nJane Street big in India perhaps too big.\nToo big.\nWe can't both make the joke.\nSorry, I was you.\nIt was you telegraphed it somehow.\nI don't know.\nSomehow I knew my eyes were that was going.\nYeah.\nSo, man, can I call them Sebie?\nSebie sure\nsevy the\nSecurity and Exchange Board of India.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSebie is real upset with a specific 8 minute window on a specific day in January in 2024.\nOkay.\nSo the back story here is that last year Jane Street sued Millennium because some traders left Jane Street for Millennium and they took with them allegedly some sort of secret trading strategy that Jane Street didn't want to say even what country it was in because doing so would reveal proprietary secrets.\nAnd then they had a hearing the millennium lawyers were like well this option trade in India oops I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that which and then just couldn't stop saying India.\nlike India, India.\nSo that tipped us off that it was options trading in India.\nIt also tipped off Sebie, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, who when you just think about it, if you're a securities regulator and someone is like, I'm making so much money with a secret strategy in beep and then the beep gets unbeeped and you learn that it's in your market.\nYou're like, well, wait a minute.\nLike that doesn't sound good.\nNobody should be making that much money with secret strategies.\nlike probably that means your secret strategy is bad.\nAnd so Sebie looked into it and the essential background here is that India has a stock market and it has an options market and intuitively an options market you know the stock options market is a derivative on stocks and you know we'll be like most people will like buy stocks and like options will be like a small you know sideshow to the stock market in India the options market is vastly bigger than the stock market like on options expir days which are once a week the options will trade several hundred times the volume of the underlying stocks.\nMhm.\nAnd that sort of tells you what the problem is, which is that if you buy a little stock, the price of the stock will go up because the stock doesn't trade that much.\nAnd the options just reference the stock.\nThey settle against the stock.\nSo if you buy a little stock, that'll push up the stock, which will push up the options.\nSo you can buy a lot of options for cheap because they trade really liquidly.\nYou can buy a little bit of stock and push up the price.\nAnd then you can sell your options at a big price.\nSo anytime the underlying market is less liquid than the derivative market, you can manipulate the derivative market by like buying a little bit of the underlying and pushing up the price on the much bigger derivative market.\nRight.\nAnd that's what they're accused of.\nYeah.\nAnd it's a strange case in that Sebie accuses them of doing these manipulations on a lot of different options expir days.\nBasically, the idea is like they would buy stock and sell options simultaneously in the morning.\nSo, they're pushing up the price of the options and selling the options at higher and higher prices.\nAnd then in the afternoon, the options would expire or they'd buy back their options and they would sell back the stock.\nSelling back the stock would push the stock down, push down the value of the options.\nSo, they sold options high in the morning, bought options back low in the afternoon and did the reverse trade in the stock.\nSo they lost money on the stock trade, but they made much much much more money on the much bigger options trade, right?\nIt's a strange case because like Sebie spends a lot of time on these eight minutes in one particular day in January 2024.\nAnd if you look at those eight minutes, the thing Jane Street, it looks like what they were doing was just an arbitrage trade.\nYeah, the options were trading really expensive because basically retail investors buy options and the retail investors were enthusiastic about the index that day.\nSo they were buying a lot of index options.\nThe underlying stocks were trading relatively cheap.\nAnd so Jans was like, \"Okay, there's like a 1.5% gap here.\nWe're going to buy the cheap stock and sell the expensive options and profit when the gap closes.\"\nAnd it does look in those eight minutes like that's what they were doing, right?\nwhich I wrote because I think it's interesting that like the thing that Sebie highlights is what looks like it might be a legitimate trait.\nA lot of people push back on that because like if you look at like the totality of like the you know 15 days they talk about and even the totality of that day it is less innocent looking perhaps.\nBut I think the broader point is like it is sometimes hard to tell the difference between legitimately arbitrageing two different prices or like doing a trade and hedging it to tell the difference between that and manipulation.\nYeah.\nI think that like one possible explanation of what's happening here is like Jane Street is trading Indian options.\nThey're not a market maker.\nThey have like a market maker flavor where they're like, you know, retail flow wants to buy options.\nAnd so J's like, okay, we're going to sell options to retail because it's generally profitable to be on the other side of retail.\nAnd if you're doing that, you might hedge part of what you're selling, but not all of what you're selling.\nBecause you might think, well, we want to hedge, but these retail people are probably wrong, so we're not going to hedge all of it.\nAnd so, you know, we'll sell 100 options and buy back 10 shares of stock or 20 shares of stock.\nBut another way to look at that is that that looks manipulative, right?\nBecause you're buying the stock to push up the options.\nSo, I'm not really sure what went on here.\nAnd like one possibility is that like you sort of get into it for legitimate reasons.\nThen like you sort of look up and you're like, \"Wait a minute.\nAre we moving these stock prices?\nAre we are we are we the baddies?\"\nSo, I don't know.\nI really don't know like what was in their hearts within the halls and walls of Jane Street.\nWhen it comes to those specific 8 minutes, so I mean Jane Street contends that it was arbitrage that they were doing.\nIt seems like you were sympathetic to that.\nYeah.\nIf you just look at those eight minutes, that's what it looks like.\nYeah.\nWell, with one exception, which is that they sold a lot of options and they bought back much less stock, like, you know, seven times as much options as stock, which is a weird way to do the arbitrage.\nThere's like there's reasons to do it that way, right?\nOne reason is it's just hard to buy the stock.\nSo, they're selling more options than they're buying stock.\nAnother reason is, you know, you have some model of what the correct price is and you think the retail traders buying options are way farther away from the correct price than like the institutional stock price, right?\nThat's a plausible thing.\nSo, you're like buying less stock because you're pushing the price to a lower level.\nBut then a third possibility is like you understand that your stock trading causes price impact and you're trying to do it in the way that advantages you the most.\nAnd that one looks bad.\nYeah, for sure.\nAnd I mean Sebby would contend that this was market manipulation.\nOh yeah.\nWell, if you push would contend does contend sees their money banned them from trading.\nNot happy.\nA temporary ban.\nIf you did point out to them that the option prices went down in that 8minute window.\nYeah.\nI mean would their push back be that theoretically that Jane Street was just bad at market manipulating?\nOh no no no.\nI think the push back would be one while Jane Street was buying stock and allegedly pushing up the options prices.\nOne, the option price did go down, but like the argument would be that it would have gone down more had J Street not been buying the stock.\nAnd then the other argument is that you can't just look at those eight minutes.\nYou have to look at the course of the day and you know kind of the year and a lot of the time it did seem like they had the effect of pushing up prices.\nSo is this the trade that Jane Street was willing to kill to protect for?\nLike this\nI don't think there was a trade.\nI think there was like a broad set of signals and set of things that they were doing in the Indian options market and you know they wouldn't characterize it as the trade was we were manipulating the Indian options market they would characterize like oh we had lots of good ideas and they took all of our ideas like there were a lot of arbitrage opportunities when it comes to and like they were they knew specific ones that but like you're right the cynical take is that all of those ideas were a subset of one big idea.\nYeah, I mean you highlighted Liebore as an example of something that's somewhat similar where you know you have this underlying that's the trading there is much smaller.\nYeah, there's not a ton of things like this because usually derivatives markets are derivative.\nThey're like you know a small tail on the dog of like the main market but like every so often they're not.\nAnd the LIBR is the biggest example where LIBOR was originally some loans were set some floating rate loans were fixed to the price that banks were borrowing from each other at in the Euro dollar market decades ago when banks were borrowing a lot in the Euro dollar market.\nAnd you first do a loan like that.\nYou're like, \"Oh, that's a great idea.\nWe've got like this little loan.\nWe'll price it to the big liquid Euro dollar market.\"\nBut over time, trillions of dollars of loans and derivatives were fixed to Libore.\nAnd meanwhile like the Euro dollar market kind of withered and so by the end you know banks would just make up numbers for Libore because they just didn't borrow in the teners that Libor was asking for and like trillions of dollars of derives fixed to that and so you could really easily manipulate that and many banks did.\nYou bring up tails and dogs and the concept of wagging.\nSure.\nAnd this because favorites of mine.\nThis reminded me of something in ETF land.\nOh no.\nOh no.\nOh, that I wrote about actually uh in late April and the headline of my newsletter that week, the ETF IQ newsletter was, \"Can the tail truly wag the dog?\nWe might soon find out.\"\nIs it about micro strategy?\nNo.\nOkay.\nCuz micro strategy is a place where people think that the ETF tail is wagging the stock.\nI have a more extreme potential example.\nIt hasn't happened yet, but we saw in late April this ETF launched.\nThe trader two times long QBTS daily ETF launched, which seeks to track 200% of the daily performance of D-Wave quantum, which is like this small quantum computing company.\nAnd I think it has a market cap or at the time its market cap was only $2 billion.\nSo, I mean, it wasn't, you know, $200, but a lot of these single stock leverage ETFs, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that if this really took off, it could have a bigger asset base than the market cap of this\n\n\nReally small stock that attracts. There could be a situation where like the ETF could have $3 billion.\nYeah.\nOr even $1.5 billion, cuz that means, yeah, $3 billion of exposure. Could have enough where it was comparable to the actual market cap of the stock.\nI feel like I would stop that if I ran the ETF, but maybe they wouldn't. Maybe you'd be thinking, let's see where this goes.\nYeah, you might. And I mean, just the concept of this launching on such a small stock. I mean, you have all of these Frankensteines of leverage single stock products that track Micro Strategy, but Micro Strategy is enormous. And you have this concern.\nI know. I just I think that every possible trade should be ETF.\nLike the demand for like I want margin exposure to cubits or whatever is it's not twice the size of cubits. But I would I would have been there with you, but then I don't know. We've just really seen these things take off. Where did the thing get to $4 billion?\nNo. But it's at $50 million, which for launching in late April, that's pretty impressive.\nSo, also it seems like the stocks that do best in terms of the leverage single stock rapper are the very volatile ones and quantum computing stocks are very volatile. So, they definitely fit that bill. So, we'll see.\nI wrote this week about inverse leveraged ETFs.\nI know.\nLet's not get into it.\nLet's not get into it. But I do want to, I want the listeners who think that we talked too much about ETFs to note that you wrote here, we are, you wrote two sections on ETFs this week at least, and we're not getting into it, and then you're like, let's not talk about ETFs today, like, but wait, one ETF. I don't know. I think it's remarkable restraint on my part.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nSpeaking of remarkable restraint, Elon Musk told Dan Ives to shut up on Twitter.\nThere's so much remarkable restraint that he's shown. I was enjoying when Linda Yakarino, the now former, now former CEO of former Twitter, the ex CEO of X, etc. Um, she announced on Twitter/X that she was stepping down as CEO and she had the nice, like, in our two years, we've made a lot of blah blah blah. Yeah, I was glowing. Elon Musk replied, \"Thank you for your contributions.\"\nJesus, this is really harsh.\nThat is, that's tough. Uh, she lasted 2 years, which I think is a lot longer than many folks at the outset expected her to last, cuz the boy, what a difficult, impossible job that she had.\nYes.\nWhich was basically courting advertisers to come back to this platform, a platform that was also just, you know, the bullhorn of Elon Musk who does not care about advertisers.\nI think it's so funny that she was like the chief marketing officer of X, but like for some sort of optical reason, they decided to call her the chief executive officer of X. And and there was like this brief period where not only was she the CEO, but Elon would be in charge of engineering or something. There was some, like, he had some role that was like a non-CEO role, and so, you know, there's been reporting that in her role as quasi CEO, but also in her role as like the liaison with advertisers, she would talk to advertisers and they would say it would be great if Elon would stop, you know, tweeting offensive stuff on X, that would help us come back, and so she would go to him and say, hey, it would be great if you would stop tweeting offensive stuff, and he would get mad at her, and like, if she were the CEO, if she were in charge, you'd think she might told her employee, \"Please stop tweeting offensive stuff on Twitter.\"\nFor sure.\nBut instead, she was only nominally the CEO and actually the chief marketing officer. And it turned out that appealing to advertisers was not the highest goal of this company. And therefore, the CEO who said we would like to appeal to advertisers was pretty much ignored, which is a strange, strange outcome.\nYeah, I do wonder.\nI mean, does X even hire a CEO at this point?\nWhy? No. Who would take it? Who would, like, No, someone would absolutely, they don't need a CEO, especially now because they've been absorbed by XAI. Yeah. No, that's weird. Like, as far as I can tell, she remained the CEO of X.\nYeah.\nAfter they merged with XAI, which by the way, like as the CEO of X, like the decision she probably did not make was being merged into another company, which seems like a big one for a CEO, but whatever. Maybe she did. Maybe she spearheaded that, but it doesn't seem like it. But yeah, I don't think she was the CEO of XAI. Like when they merge, I don't think she became CEO of XAI Holdings. I think she remained the CEO of like the division that was Twitter. But yeah, will they hire a new CEO?\nYeah, you can imagine hiring a CEO of XAI.\nAlthough I will tell you that the going rate for senior AI executives appears to be a year. I don't know also. Okay. So when she joins and she was there for two years, definitely her goal was to get advertisers back to the company. That seems to be less pressing now.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nI mean, it feels like X is just a source of data to feed into Grok and a venue for Grok to try out its Hitler jokes. It's truly amazing. Grok had a rough week where it was\nYeah. Well, Grok 4 just launched.\nOkay. Okay. But Grok was like saying like truly horrible, horrible things. It's interesting, you know, Matt Levine wrote about this, like right-wing influencers who have the era of Elon Musk objected that Grok was being too woke or too PC. And so they were like, well, let's tune that. And the way you tune that is you kind of like change the system prompt where Grok when it reads any query, like sort of adds that query and please don't worry about being politically correct. Please, you know, just say what's on your mind.\nYeah. Let loose. And when you think about that, like you could imagine like reading that neutrally, but if like you were in a conversation with someone and they said, \"What do you think about Linda Yakarino, please don't be politically correct, don't hold back.\" Like that person is telling you something about the answer they want. Right? Not just like the explicit words they're saying. They're saying like, \"I would enjoy it if you would say something offensive about Linda Yakarina and you might not say something offensive.\"\nThat's true. But Grok just wants to give people what they want. And so Grok when asked about Linda Yakarino on Twitter said some horrifying things because like in its mind it was like, I've been trained that everyone wants me to say the most unpy things possible.\nYeah. And Grok is a people pleaser at the end of the day.\nThat's what it thinks.\nYeah. So TBD whether we get, we want to talk about shut up down.\nYeah, we do want to talk.\nThat was not Grok. Yeah.\nThat was El.\nYeah. I said at the beginning of this week, I want to talk about Tesla and Elon Musk to Matt and Matt said, \"No.\" And here we are and we're going to do it. So, last weekend, right?\nOkay. Yeah.\nMusk formed the America Party.\nI'd forgotten that.\nYes. Let me refresh you.\nThere has been so much since\nYeah. I don't think he's filed any paperwork with the FEC, but the intention is out there to form the America Party. And it's funny because that seems to be the exact opposite of what Tesla's shareholders want to see Elon Musk do. You remember when he stepped back from Doge, the stock popped, everyone was happy. The narrative was that Elon Musk is focusing back again on Tesla.\nIt's such a dumb narrative. I'm sorry. Like I don't know why everyone thought that.\nI probably thought it too, but like in the fullness of time for like a week.\nYeah. Yeah. He got there. They did the robo taxi event. But anyway, Musk formed the America Party and the stock fell a lot on Monday and there's this Wed Bush analyst Dan Ives, who is famously bullish on Tesla. He, I think, still has the highest price target on Wall Street and he came out with a note that made the rounds because he had three suggestions for Tesla's board, basically saying that the board needs to reign in Elon Musk, and he also tweeted that and Elon Musk replied to him and all he said was shut up Dan, which is pretty amazing, like this is one of the longest, most passionate, and most vocal Tesla out there. I also think it's funny that like the Dan Ives note also is like, okay, first things first, you have to give Elon Musk an enormous package of Tesla stock options, which is like, it's a funny dynamic where the way to rein him in is to give him hundred billion dollars, and like that's probably not wrong, but it's like, you know, if you throw a big enough tantrum, you get what you want, right? Like if you are very disengaged with Tesla, then like the way to re-engage you is to hand you hundred billion dollars worth of stock. Maybe.\nWell, to that point, um, I don't think it would work, but part of Dan I's suggestions was that they should include requirements for the time commitment to Tesla operations as part of the pay package.\nBut imagine doing that. Imagine like being clock in.\nYeah. We'll give you a hundred billion dollars of stock, but you have to show up 30 hours a week. And then what? And then what? You monitor that. He doesn't show up. And you're like, \"Okay, we're taking away your stock. The board's going to do that.\" They're not going to do that. Come on. Maybe Elon Musk will buy one of those mouse jigglers that we talked about.\nSomething to just move, move the cursor around. What else did he say? Oh, he said, \"While the board cannot control who Musk donates to politically, I've said that the board should have oversight to ensure that his political ambitions don't interfere with his role as CEO of Tesla.\" So, things along those lines, right? But like that ship has sailed. Like he's like he's tasted too much power to be like, \"Oh, I'm the CEO of a car company.\" Like he's not the CEO of a car company. He's like\nWell, it's interesting to see where this goes.\nLike if they were like, \"Okay, you have to choose between being CEO of this car company and like everything else you do. He's not going to be CEO of the car company. Still owns it. You know, it's fine.\"\nI believe wholeheartedly that if Musk had been born in the United States, he would be running for president right now. Out of cycle, just running for president. He would be camping.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut Tesla is like he's got too many ambitions to be like chained to his desk at Tesla, you know, watching the clock, like\nYeah.\nAlso like, yeah. Like you could imagine some board trying that, but not this board.\nYeah, that's true. I will say the narrative that Elon Musk is too distracted as CEO has been around forever. It seems particularly enhanced right now with the uh, political element, but he's always been in charge of multiple companies at once.\nYeah. Cuz like when you say distracted, there's kind of two things going on, which are like one is like is he not spending enough time? And I think, you know, at this late stage, like I think there's a pretty good case that he is effective at accomplishing a lot of what he wants to do without spending all of his time at a company. That he's able to like come in, address problems, delegate well, and then get out, you know, like I don't think like distraction in the in the literal sense is the problem.\nThe problem is that like he chases shiny objects that like can hurt the company, right? And that is harder to rein.\nYeah. Like I think like probably Dan Ives would be happy with Elon Musk spending 20 hours a week at Tesla and the rest of his time quietly playing video games.\nBetween hours a week at Tesla and 80 hours a week doing horrifying other stuff is like more of a problem.\nYeah, for sure.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nLet's talk about Kalshi.\nLet's talk about Kalshi. So, sports gambling has become really big in America in the last, you know, I've noticed.\nYeah. Like really, really big. Like I remember a time when you could watch sports and not only were they not like, you know, pitching gambling companies in every commercial break, but also like, you know, Pete Rose was banned for life from baseball for betting on sports, like betting on sports was like a bad thing. And now it's like, you know, betting on sports is what sports is.\nBack in your day.\nYeah. Yeah. I'm old. This is what I would have talked about on the on the sports TV show. There you go.\nUm, back in my day, you didn't bet on sports. I mean, people bet on sports. It was like, you know, kind of like illegalish, right? Legal legal in and only play the ponies.\nYeah. You could play the ponies, but like when you went to a baseball game, it wasn't everyone there was betting on it. Um, but so it's become hugely popular and like broadly legal. But then separately, there are people who have long loved the idea of prediction markets, right? Prediction markets where you can bet on who's going to be president. Prediction markets are informative. They create information. They like create good externalities for the world. They tell you what's going to happen, right? And so people have started, you know, a lot of it is crypto flavored, but it's not always. People love starting prediction markets. And once you're in a prediction market, you're like you like you get a lot of attention when like the presidential election rolls around and then like it stops, right? Like the presidential election happens. No one cares about like you know, no one wants to bet on congressional races, and even those are like every two years, right? So like you have like a lot of downtime and you're like, you know what people really like to predict is the outcome of baseball games, and so then you're like, how can I get into sports gambling, or no, no, sorry, you're like, how can I get into the prediction of sports gambling, protect yourself, and so a number of these prediction markets, it's just like a natural overlap, and like, by the way, like in Europe, these things are also pretty convergent, where like bookmakers will will take bets on sports and elections. And so several of these things, including Kalshi, which is after great difficulty, a CFTC registered, like legal, regulated futures exchange that does prediction markets.\nMhm.\n\n\nKalshi has prediction markets on the election, and you know, after the last election, like the regulatory environment is pretty friendly to prediction markets. But it also has prediction markets on Wimbledon and baseball and soccer, and those prediction markets are technically CFTC-regulated self-certified futures contracts where Kalshi decides what it wants to list. It lists those things, and if the CFTC doesn't call it up to object, those things just get listed and they trade. And several states that regulate gambling have called Kalshi up and said, \"You are offering illegal sports betting in our states. You can't do that.\"\n\nAnd Kalshi has said, \"Nope. These are CFTC registered contracts. CFTC regulation preempts state regulation. So, we can just do it, and you can't stop us. And by the way, we don't even know what this has to do with gambling. This is not gambling. This is predicting.\"\n\nAnd so far that has worked really well. Like they've won lawsuits against states, which is amazing. It's incredible. And I think, like, the sort of basic theory here is, like, this is CFTC jurisdiction, and if the CFTC wants to stop it, they should stop it. The CFTC has sort of like said that these things are illegal, but that was before the current administration, and it hasn't done anything to stop them. And I think it's like quite favorable to Kalshi right now. And so, uh, he just gets to do it, and it's wild.\n\nAnd what I wrote about on Thursday is that there's a change in the tax law with the one big beautiful bill where now only 90% of gambling losses are tax-deductible against your gambling winnings. And that's like really like existential for a lot of sports gamblers because sports gambling, you're making a lot of bets. You're winning a little bit more than you lose, right? And like you're making, you know, a 5% profit margin on a huge, you know, outlay. And if 10% of your losses are non-deductible, then like you flip from being slightly positive to slightly negative, and so you just can't be a professional sports gambler anymore.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut if you're just predicting on a prediction market, it's fine. No problem.\n\nWell, that's the thing. You have to imagine that the net effect of that would be just accelerating the move to these events contracts. Like I learned about this because a reader emailed me was like, \"I'm a semi-professional sports gambler, and I'm going to have to move to a prediction market.\"\n\nThat's wild.\n\nIt's wild.\n\nSo Kalshi is winning lawsuits. But I mean, at a certain stage, like, isn't there like an element of common sense that comes in and says, \"Look at this duck. It walks like a duck. It quacks like a duck. This is a duck.\"\n\nAnd Kalshi says, \"No, this is...\"\n\nOkay. I think their argument is like, \"You're coming at it from the wrong direction.\"\n\nIt's sense.\n\nOkay. Like, yes.\n\nOkay.\n\nThese bets on sporting events look like sports gambling.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut they also look like bets on elections and interest rates and zero-day options on micro strategy and meme coins and all the other stuff you have that is like clearly financial markets stuff. Why should sports be sacred?\n\nWhy should sports be sacred? Like everything is like this. So like why can't sports be like this?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I don't that's kind of a good argument, but it like scares me.\n\nYeah, it is. It is a little bit scary. It's like if it's all gambling, if like what you're doing in the financial markets, by the way, sorry, I'm exaggerating. It's not that everything everyone does in financial markets is gambling. It's that like a lot of stuff in arbitrage. It's gambling. Sometimes arbitrage, sometimes it's manipulation. Sometimes it's sometimes it's fundamental long-term investing, but like there's a lot of stuff that like, you know, is gambling both in the sense that like you're speculating on stuff without much edge and also in the sense that you're having fun doing like it's an entertainment product. It's clearly the case that like a lot of stuff that is being sold to retail investors is a risky entertainment product, and they're just like, \"Well, why not sports?\" That's like a risky entertainment problem.\n\nYeah. I will just say I did end up talking a lot about sports. You love sports. You famously you love sports. I will say it does feel inevitable that we're going to see an events contract ETF. I'll just leave you with that thought.\n\nI love you ETFs.\n\nThey're CFTC regulated.\n\nAnd that was the Money Stuff Podcast. I'm Matt Levine and I'm Katie Greifeld.
