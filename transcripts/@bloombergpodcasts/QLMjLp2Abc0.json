great point, Tom, and especially with regards to goods.\nWhat we've discovered is that we really don't know the price elasticity of demand of a number of these goods that are going to be impacted.\nSo, we're triangulating all sorts of different data sources um and really kind of trying to get under the hood.\nBut your point is well taken, right?\nWhat what is even the point of going out to two decimal points uh if you uh if you have this level of uncertainty?\nNevertheless, um we try to be as precise as possible so we can learn from uh our actions.\nDo you do you see substitution of products going on because of tariffs?\nOh, absolutely.\nI mean, and and I think what'll be interesting to see is is again how price sensitive are consumers once these price increases really start to feed through.\nLet's remember we had an extraordinary amount of front-loading um in the in the beginning of the year and and really at the end of the fourth quarter last year where consumers pre-bought and suppliers pre-bought ahead of these tariffs, right?\nAnd so we're still waiting for that pig in the python to move its way through.\nConstance, when do you think we'll see that?\nIs that something that we're going to see maybe today or is we're not going to see any inflation impact if there is any and a lot of folks say that there may not.\nIs that something we may have to wait till the fall to see maybe in the data?\nYou know, I think you're right, Paul.\nI think it's I think it's taking a lot longer and and what we see from some some alternative sources like Cavalo, for example, um which really it does work on on uh real time prices and they gather information from four different retailers.\nWe can guess who some of those retailers are.\nUm Amazon, Walmart.\nUm and when you think about Amazon and the the troves of PhD economists they have working on how to price goods, right?\nThey probably have better information about the price elasticity than anybody else right now in the US economy.\nUm and what they show is actually that domestic prices while they increased in the beginning have really leveled off.\nSo domestic suppliers are aware of that price sensitivity I think and are keeping their prices competitive so that they can gain market share.\nC just to get narrow here 45 seconds.\nAuto insurance is 3% of our inflation picture.\nIs there anybody listening who's paying less in auto insurance?\nI don't think so.\nConstance.\nNo.\nWhen you talked earlier about all the the flash floods and and rain that you know the New York area experienced over the last 24 hours and that destroys automobiles.\nIf you get stuck in a flash flood, your car is totaled, right?\nUm and so we look at the incidence of perils and they're increasing and then what happens is that that gets transferred to the entire auto market, right?\nEverybody autoinsures price.\nSo that they make up losses in areas where they're experiencing higher catastrophes.\nWe're trying to give constants 32 seconds here to look at the\nYeah.\nPlenty of time.\nConstance with DIU.\nIn the 90 second glance, you've had constants.\nWhat do you see?\nWell, it's not showing up in goods, right?\nIf you go to the commodities less food and energy, you're not seeing it in apparel, which was down month over month.\nYou're not seeing it in new vehicles, which um you know, it was also down.\nUsed cars and trucks have a little more complicated uh pricing in them.\nUm medical care commodities were up 0.6 month over month, but you're really not seeing that.\nTobacco and smoking products are up 0.8, but uh I don't know if that constitutes a trend.\nUm and I I you know I don't know how much we import of China.\nBut the answer is K is before we let you go.\nI don't mean to interrupt but this is too important.\nAfter hearing from Bessant then Hunter the president's going to come out and say show me the inflation and tariffs.\nRight.\nOf course he is.\nYes.\nThat's that is the issue.\nAnd and the reality is it is not in the current data.\nWe do know of course that inflation is somewhat of a lagging indicator.\nRight.\nIf you're a firm, you're you're going to wait as long as you can to raise prices because you don't want to lose market share.\nSo, we just need to keep in mind this is a lagging indicator.\nIs there a scenario where the companies actually by and large do take it in the margin and we don't see it necessarily at the consumer level?\nIs that a a scenario?\nI know a lot of folks are suggesting that might be the case.\nWell, there was an interesting article.\nI think it was in the Wall Street Journal from my morning scan of the news.\nHow Levis's is reducing the number of SKUs in order to manage their costs so that they don't have to pass on the price increases, right?\nSo they're they're um they're reducing the the variety of things that they're producing.\nAnd so I think firms are really, you know, when you think about the data and analytics that's been deployed over the last 6 years in companies, firms have a lot more capacity to control their supply chain and to control their product mix and we're seeing some of that productivity gain from that those data enhancements coming to bear as firms try to manage through this.\nCass, thank you so much.\nJust wonderful to have you here uh at 8:30 for the National Inflation Report.\nConstance Hunter with EIU.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Surveillance Podcast.\nCatch us live weekday afternoons from 7 to 10:00 a.m. Eastern.\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App or watch us live on YouTube.\nWe turn to banks.\nIt's been Helter Skelter today with the Treasury Secretary.\nThis is a more important conversation for global Wall Street.\nAlison Williams joins us with Bloomberg Intelligence.\nAllison, the way I read it as a complete hack is we go, there's four big banks.\nNo, there's JP Morgan and there's these three other banks.\nAm I off the mark?\nWell, there's JP Morgan.\nI always say covering JP Morgan is like covering, you know, four big companies, right?\nOr um, you know, depending on how they they've done their division.\nI guess it's three big companies now.\nSo um you know really the net interest income guidance very strong about 600 million upside to the ratios were sick.\nI went back and forth with Valerie Titel in London.\nThey did a tangible equity of 20% plus.\nAm I right?\nCitygroup's half that.\nUh you are right.\nI mean if you look at you know so if you look at Croup it's a very different story.\nRight.\nSo Citygroup is still in a story of transition.\nUm, we've been talking about that transition, as we say, ever since, uh, Sandy built the house.\nIt's been being taken apart and I think Jane Frasier is making a lot of tough decisions there and really solid quarter out of Croup as well.\nUm, you know, they're upping their net interest income guidance.\nTheir fixed income trading up 20%.\nSo that's it.\nThat, you know, JP Morgan and Wells were up 13 to 14%.\nYou know, Cityroup has an amazing rates and currencies trading business as you know, Paul and that is really where the strength is this quarter.\nThat's where the volatility is and they are really um executing in that business.\nUh again, cordet interest income going up for both of those banks.\nWells Fargo a little softer, but Wells Fargo is looking at the overall number.\nKeep in mind that there's core net interest income and then there's a number that includes uh trading.\nAnd so the trading net interest income tends to be offset in fees I think for but from a headline perspective people are sort of going to be less positive on those Wells Fargo results.\nWells Fargo also not getting um this huge benefit.\nSo as I said they saw some growth in fixed income trading but well um you know JP Morgan and city much stronger in those businesses.\nJP Morgan delivering a billion dollars of upside uh in their uh trading and fee.\nI haven't done the calculation yet for cityroup, but the trends also better for city.\nAre what are the banks saying about loan origination?\nAre they writing loans?\nWe were just talking to Huw van Steenis and Oliver Wyman about private credit and I just think back to my Chase Manhattan days.\nWe were killing it doing the leverage loan business, making money upfront, making money on the spread, syndicating by risk out to every other bank around the country.\nWhat are they making loans these days?\nSo, so they are making loans.\nI mean, you know, that that the the card business, which was probably not your concern back then or now, but yeah, the card business is is very profitable for these banks and that's where the loan growth has been.\nAnd again, that's benefiting city and JP Morgan.\nWe have seen a little bit of pickup in the commercial numbers in the, you know, in the Fed data.\nWe're going to hear what Bank America says tomorrow on that.\nI think with regard to privates, you know, it it is a change, but I think if you look at, for example, Goldman's business, so Paul, you know, Goldman, you know, their merchant banking business, you know that they, you know, back in the day made a lot of money from making these proprietary investments.\nVulkar uh rule came along and said, \"Please don't do that on your balance sheet.\"\nBy the way, investors don't like the balance sheet, right?\nBecause when you make those kind of investments and you're recording gains, people don't really give you a lot of credit because they view them as volatile, etc.\nBut you have someone like Goldman who's now said, I'm going to be an alternative asset manager.\nAnd now instead of putting my balance sheet at risk, I'm going to, you know, take the client's money.\nSo, and I'm going to earn fees.\nAnd investors like that.\nThey like asset management.\nIt's a high multiple business.\nAnd so, it's a higher return on equity business.\nAnd that's been a longterm story, Goldman.\nSo I think the banks are fine and that so that's a Goldman specific, but I think all the banks are doing that.\nOkay, I want to go to the gossip of the moment, folks.\nOut in the Hamptons over a beverage of her choice.\nAllison Williams is getting hammered by fancy people over the reorg under Mary Erdos at JP Morgan.\nThey're first of all, I'm going to say they're the most successful bank asset manager, the only one really competing with BlackRock and the others.\nSo Mary's built a franchise and now they're saying geography doesn't matter anymore.\nThe Wall Street Journal had this great summary of it.\nExplain to us how JP Morgan and Mary Erdos is blowing up asset management, private wealth.\nWell, I think that, you know, Mary Erdos is first and foremost thoughtful about the talent across her business and, you know, is is consistently talking about the strength they have as an active manager.\nUm, but one of the more interesting uh things that Eric Baltunis, as as you know, who's the expert on EATF, has been talking about is that they are really gaining share in the active ETF business.\nAnd so, um, so that's not your that's not your question, but that is something that that I want to highlight that I think is something happening over there.\nWe're we're in a bull market.\nThey're minting more money than God.\nAnd JP Morgan is saying, \"We got a problem.\nWe got to blow up private wealth management.\"\nWhy are they blowing it up and what's the goal?\nWell, again, I I don't know.\nI think that Mary Erdos is a very thoughtful leader and I think that again, it's it's sort of like as we're as we're going through the future, we've been through a long period of what uh we call US exceptionalism.\nY um but I think that JP Morgan has always uh focused on the world at large, focused on emerging markets, focused on um these different growth opportunities.\nAnd I think it's just a way and and by the way JP Morgan I think is always as I alluded to earlier, you know, looking at things differently.\nWhen you're a global organization, you have products and you have regions.\nI think sometimes you have to find a way to focus on on both.\nAnd I again I just I go back to the fact that they're very focused on talent and I think that you know they're thoughtful about the way they run their business.\nWe're seeing so many good results coming out of these US global banks.\nIt just makes me think next week we're going to hear from the European banks and they're just nowhere nowhere relative to where the US banks are.\nWhen will Europe say we need to allow consolidation here?\nI mean I they're they fall so far behind every single year it seems.\nIs that not an issue for them?\nThey do.\nAnd I think that I mean I think that the the biggest change Paul over the last you know let's call it decade or a couple of decades right time flies is that you know first of all the US has benefited from a virtuous cycle of having sort of a better economy for a long period of time but really you know they've they've benefited from the virtuous cycle of investment.\nThey had the money to invest, they invested the money.\nSo that's led to better revenue, better market share, etc.\nWhereas I think for the Europeans, you know, they tried to sort of cut their way to profitability and that ended up um you know, as you know, invest in banking and trading, these are not businesses where you go bargain shopping, right?\nAnd so I think that they didn't invest um that hurt them.\nUh they've had to exit businesses, etc.\nBut it's difficult because each of the\neveryone agrees we really should consolidate merge some of the best together but no one wants to be the seller.\nEveryone wants to be the buyer.\nEverybody wants the the champion in their home market.\nCome on.\nThere's a price.\nThat's the that's price.\nAre we at the point where the shock of the later this year quickly here Allison is we get one big industry roll up because they find price and is the sellers say enough?\nLet's go.\nI mean I you know we could have had this conversation 14 times a million you know I just think that those political sensitivities\nit's it's very difficult and it's hard to say\nright\nwhat\n\n\nEver would change their mind.\nOkay, what do we see tomorrow?\nThings that make sense on paper, you know, politics get in the way.\n10 seconds tomorrow.\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they do better than good.\nI, you know, based on the trading and fee numbers we saw today, based on all the trends we saw in the quarter, we think that it's going to be a solid quarter for trading.\nWe're going to want to hear what their CEO clients are saying with regard to the investment packing.\nThank you so much for this brief, particularly on, you know, where we are on the reorg of JPMorgan in private management and of course over to the other banks, particularly Citigroup here.\nThis is the Bloomberg Surveillance Podcast.\nListen live each weekday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nYou can also listen live on Amazon Alexa from our flagship New York station.\nJust say, \"Alexa, play Bloomberg 11:30.\"\nWe're going to get the private credit here with Huw van Steenis.\nPaul's going to bring that in, but I got to first do an audible here, folks.\nIt's a surveillance audible in a two-hour conversation with Huw van Steenis.\nYou go, \"Okay, where's this guy come from?\"\nAnd it's not Oliver Wyman or his work with the Bank of England with at the time Governor Carney, or he did this as UBS da da da da years ago, like think Queen Anne.\nHuw van Steenis was at Morgan Stanley and he was absolutely definitive on EU finance.\nJoining us now with Oliver Wyman.\nHuw van Steenis audible.\nI saw the French tresor, not the oat hue, the trussor roll over yesterday with acceleration.\nHow fragile is French debt given Mr. Trump's shenanigans?\nOh, Tom, thanks for having me on again.\nLook, I think there's a lot of pressure from investors for on the on the French situation.\nUm, a lot of fixed income investors are struggling with the lack of debt consolidation.\nAnd look, you know, let's play the history here, Tom.\nYou know, I think the French throughout the last 30 years have somewhat struggled with reigning in public debt.\nIn fact, if you go back to 1981-83, you know, actually Mitterrand had to do a huge pivot because he just wasn't controlling the public debts back there.\nAnd so, I think there's there's real pressure here.\nAnd look, the fact the spreads already trading outside Portugal and Spain, and there's a lot of debate about whether trade outside Italy and Greece tells you how stressed and and unhelp nervous folk are.\nThe jargon, he's he's all jargon.\nI mean, he was at the state dinner and he brought the conversation to a halt with his jargon.\nWhat he's saying there is French credits trading worser folks in Portugal, Greece, and all here.\nOne final question on this.\nI'm beginning to see real yields, inflation adjusted yields in Europe come up as well.\nCan President Trump with his tariff debate pull up EU real yields to bring Europe to a standstill?\nIt's a great question.\nIt's certainly possible.\nI think look isn't the issue with tariffs at the moment that the short-term pain is not there and it's a question more about how it impacts investments and the longer-term business and just like you've seen the resilience in the states, you're seeing real resilience in the European earnings and particularly the opening of the fiscal debt.\nSo, I'm not sure that it would necessarily drag it up immediately, but I think that tension over a 1, 2, 3-year period, that's where you're going to start seeing is there going to be more friction in the system from lack of competitiveness.\nAnd let's hope certainly by then we're going to see a deal.\nSo, I'm not as convinced on that, but you know, anything's possible.\nYou were starting to hear from the big banks today and one of the areas of questioning for the banks will be kind of how they view private credit visa v their core lending business.\nHow do you guys view what has been a just a phenomenal growth story on global Wall Street which is private credit?\nOh look, so I think the private credit train continues and as we've discussed many times, you know, that sector is growing 20 to 25% compound because it's not just about leverage lending and mid-market lending.\nIt's also now about replacing investment grade either through asset back lending.\nSo you know, so like private securitizations or it's going for these jumbo deals, you know, these really large complex deals.\nAnd under current bank regulations, if it's risky, if it's very large or very complex, it goes to the private markets rather than the public.\nSo I think there's two two games here.\nI think the first is the banks are clearly fighting back and you saw the news from one of the big banks yesterday which you ran showing a new group to try and come up with solutions for more complex deals.\nMaybe the bank takes part, maybe it slices up and gives part to private credit, but the banks are very much back.\nBut I think the other story, and I think you'll see it through this earning season, is banks love steep yield curves.\nAnd so the net interest income for the banks, I think, will continue to beat and beat and beat because these steep curves will translate through to higher earnings.\nAnd therefore, even though they're seeding ground to private credit, the core engines are still doing really well.\nSo Huw, for the private credit business, are there opportunities for retail investors to get exposure to this asset class?\nY, this is a great question.\nSo we've been digging into this.\nSo there's been a two and a half-fold increase in the investments by wealthy in private credit in the last three years.\nThat's four times faster than from traditional institutional investors.\nAnd we think something like $350 billion or about 12% of private credit assets now come from the wealthy.\nNow the wealthy though, it's still the very it's the ultra wealthy and one of the biggest areas of innovation in partnerships new products is trying to think about expanding this to a much broader range of clients through you know evergreen funds and you know just one stat um evergreen funds are probably the single fastest growing part of the investment universe at the moment um interval funds are growing 70% from a low base so I think this is an area where there's there's quite a lot of room to to run uh from Yeah, with us.\nHuw van Steenis with Oliver Wyman.\nHe's too modest.\nLet me put it to you.\nIt's a It's a really I hate him.\nThere's a 21-page document, Oliver Wyman.\nPrivate credit is reshaping wealth portfolios.\nGet it through Oliver Wyman.\nWe protect the copyright of all of our guests, Huw van Steenis, Ben Phillips, Laura Watkin, and Parth Agarwal as well.\nWhat's the risk factor here, a wise one?\nIs it too much money chasing too few private credit opportunities?\nIs that the credit quality is going to go down?\nIs the IRR gonna see how I did that?\nIt's impressive.\nAs I'll get out, what's the major risk factor here?\nUh, look, it's great.\nWell, look, I I'd say so in the near-term, the biggest threat is just too much money chasing and credit spreads continue to compress and compress.\nAnd look, we've already gone from, you know, if you were trying to buy a single A private credit bond two years ago, you might be getting two 2% more than a public single A.\nLast year, it's probably 150 to 175 basis over basis points over.\nToday, it's probably only a point.\nSo, it's probably the the excess spread is probably halfed in less than 24 months.\nAnd so there might be if there's a lot of money coming through.\nSo therefore the constraint is really about originating more assets.\nAnd so you're seeing more deals with private credit team up with banks for partnerships but also looking to generate their own assets.\nAnd I think that's the gate for me.\nIf they don't originate enough assets then the spreads will will compress.\nI think longer term clearly there's always going to be a credit cycle and so that you know and there'll be some good decisions and bad decisions but I think at the moment it's the weight of money.\nHuw, I mean the the dollars are getting just really substantial there over the last decade or so.\nUm, we're starting to get more and more retail exposure there.\nDoes there need to be some type of regulation on the private credit business, do you think?\nSo, I think it depends what kind of regulation.\nSo, I don't see the sector as systemic.\nI mean, let's remember um banks get regulated partly because they hold everyone's deposits, but also um they're very leveraged.\nAnd so when credit leaves a bank, which maybe is 10 times levered, maybe going to an institutional account, which may be zero to one times levered, less leverage means it's less risky uh when when you hit a speed bump.\nUm so I don't see it systemic.\nBut the more you put private credit into retail portfolios, the more that then you know the SEC and and regulators looking at the products and protecting investors will need to think about is this the right product?\nHave we got regular marks?\nYou know, and I think we discussed this last time I was in New York, the pricing convention.\nSo, the way you think about pricing private credit, you can't just do it once a quarter.\nYou do it every month and if not more frequently.\nSo, there's a lot of regulatory stuff which we'll need to play catch up.\nI promised Dan Tanibal I'd read your private credit report.\nHuw, I'll get a pimps in my hand and read that this weekend.\nHuw van Steenis is definitive on private credit with Oliver Wyman.\nThis is the Bloomberg Surveillance Podcast.\nListen live each weekday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nYou can also watch us live every weekday on YouTube and always on the Bloomberg terminal.\nWe're not going to turn this into a history lesson, but the bottom line is at LSE in the 50s, Carl Pauper sat with a young student named George Soros and said, \"The way we think about history, the way we digest past tense data is maybe not as productive as it could be with something called reflexivity, which is a different approach.\nIf AI is about a large language model data dump, how are we going to move artificial intelligence onto what Soros and Popper were talking about?\nThat's a great question.\nFirst of all, thank you for having me on the show.\nI think as what we're seeing currently, what is really exciting about the technology that we're witnessing right in front of us is that it has this capability to digest huge amounts of data and start to make sense of it, help us make sense of it.\nAnd I think that we have always looked to the past to try to understand the future because that's the only data that we had, right?\nAnd what is different this time versus before is that we seem to have been accumulating more and more data but didn't have increased bandwidth to process it.\nIn my mind, AI is going to resolve this.\nOkay.\nAI is going to resolve it, but it's just nothing more than a richer, deeper back test.\nEverybody did back tests on a difference equation.\nWe went back to T minus one or T minus 20 whatever is AI going to change how global Wall Street the pros listening to the show how they back test it is going to change it because actually I'll I'll let you know that the experience that we have had so reflexivity platform is used by a number of top hundrants and what we have found as they start to incorporate this into their workflow is that they are amazed by the speed with which the system is able to answer their questions by going straight to the data.\nIn fact, often they run out of questions because you were not used to being able to tap into the data so powerfully and so quickly.\nAnd so we seem to now be limited only by our imagination.\nSo the way I think about AI helping investors on Wall Street is giving them this superpower where they can keep thinking about scenarios that could unfold and have the AI back that up or dispute it through the data.\nIt's a very objective arbiter.\nCan you give us and this is so new to so many of us, our listeners, our viewers.\nWhat is a typical query that you would get from an investor client that maybe AI could be helpful with?\nWell, it started with things that were extremely basic in nature.\nSomebody might just say like, oh, you know, I'd like to really understand if when somebody talks about the inverted yield curve, how accurate has that actually been in predicting recessions?\nIt then became a lot more complex when you might say, \"Look at all of financials for a specific company, be it Tesla, Microsoft, JPMorgan, whatever.\nTell me what is the market not appreciating?\"\nAnd suddenly it's pulling together things it's able to glean from analyst reports, news outlets, and financials and say, \"Well, actually, here are some parts of the business that are growing extremely fast, but get no mention from the analysts.\"\nAnd so you could have a rerating.\nThe dream here is that, and this is what Reflexivity purports to do, is if you were the first to know that AWS was going to be a big deal for Amazon, you would have made a lot of money.\nWow.\nSo I I I this is such an amazing part of the investment process.\nHow are your clients using it today?\nI mean, how is that evolving?\nBecause I'm assuming this is an education process for some pretty smart investors, some savvy investors, but maybe they don't understand the logic behind artificial intelligence.\nHow are they using it today and how do you want them to use it?\nHonestly, our first advice to the pioneering clients that come to us and start using it and there have been an increasing number in the past few weeks is just dip their toes into it.\nTry it.\nI think trial and error is very important because I think working with AI is unlike any other software that you would have used before, right?\nUm where does it get data?\nHow does it calculate?\nHow does it reason and so on.\nOnce you get the hang of it, however, it becomes extremely exciting and you can see people just get engaged with it.\nOkay.\nYou grew up in the milieu of Harvard, MIT and all the fancy people up in Boston.\nBlack Scholes came out and I I never met Fischer Black to my great regret.\nHe died tragically early.\nBut what a joy I've had in discussing Myron Scholes and picking up the pieces of 1998.\nHow does a modeling that's new wrapped around reflexivity?\nHow does this tested model work given substantial leverage shocks the discontinuities that are brought out by leverage as a pro would use?\nSo again, I think here the calculations that the system will do fall back on the traditional statistical methods.\nIt's not reinventing the way you're calculating things or the way you're calculating correlations.\nWhat it's able to do, however, is understand\n\n\nThe analysis that you're trying to achieve, right? And then potentially do that analysis in three or four different ways. Which side of the lognormal curve is the sign on? I can see you were Schlifer and Rogoff in some PhD ballet going Gaussian to log normal to pon distribution. On a vanilla lognormal distribution, Colin, I'm doing this for you. It's jargon. On a lognormal distribution, the short side's more difficult to manage than the long side. Do you get better alpha pickup short in the market versus a long market?\nActually, I think it's quite symmetric. It's true that generally when you look at how investors perform in buying versus getting out of positions, they're generally worse at getting out of positions. They're quite good at picking them but not so good at getting rid of them. They typically do it when they have to. So here the AI can be helpful because it's able to actively, this is what reflexivity does, spot something in the market. Let's say that interest rates are starting to move much faster than they have been, and it'll point to your banking stocks and say you should pay attention to this because it could be that there is a lot more downside risk than you realize.\nThis is great. Thank you. So Jan, please don't be a stranger. Yan Salagi with us with Reflexivity. This is a tool that's being used for a lot of sophisticated investors to get out front to create an edge. Uh his work in academics with Ken Rogoff at Harvard is uh noted.\nThis is the Bloomberg Surveillance Podcast. Listen live each weekday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App. You can also listen live on Amazon Alexa from our flagship New York station. Just say, \"Alexa, play Bloomberg 11:30.\"\nOut of newspapers. It's like a truncated version. She came in a little parched, I think. You know, I mean wet, I should say. Yep.\nAfter the floods yesterday. Lisa Mateo made it into work uh today after serious floods in New Jersey. What do you got?\nOkay. Uh Paul, you have to still have that big European trip coming up, right? Okay. Okay. So, this one's for you. I saw this in the Wall Street Journal. It stood out. American travelers have less buying power this summer because of the weakening dollar. So, the Wall Street Journal said the dollar weakened 13% against the euro this year, 6% against the Japanese yen. But the thing is, it's not stopping travelers from booking trips, as you know. Okay. People say they just might buy less while they're there.\nProbably.\nI don't know if you plan to buy less while you're there. I might go down a little bit lower on the wine list maybe when I'm in Italy. I might not go for the highest end. Uh but we'll be fine. We'll be fine.\nYeah. And then they also point out to on the bright side, it's made kind of exports cheaper, open up opportunities for Americans to invest in those foreign stocks as well. But an interesting take on the weekend and I'm hearing, you know, like you hear from the airlines, I you know, the airlines took up their guidance and reintroduced their guidance saying that the air travel is strong including US to Europe. So I, you know, if you talk to our friends in in London or Paris, they're like there are Americans everywhere. Like I'm not sure they're happy about it.\nI mean, I'm looking at the Bulgari menu at Lararss of the deck there overlooking the famous new monuments that they just reopened. The Carpacio Diggnola on Alio Lemon. Boy, I can't read the rest. €22. I mean, well, that's that's what you expect at the Bulgari. That's going to cost you a couple dollars more.\nI know it is. We'll be there. We'll be there. But do you cut back on the souvenirs? Maybe you don't get presents for everyone, right?\nThere's a gauntlet. You come down the Spanish Steps and there's a gauntlet of souvenir stores called Called like Gucci, Hermes, Prada. It's a G. That's a souvenir. You're looking at next.\nOkay. Uh Starbucks corporate managers who are working remotely currently, they're going to have to pack their bags, relocate. They have one year to do it. um they have to go to Seattle or Toronto within 12 months. So, they put out this back to Starbucks plan. Um corporate employees are now having to come back four days in the office a week, up from three days starting September 29th. But what's ironic? They were still on the three. I know they were still on the three days.\nPut a surveillance cork in my mouth.\nYeah, exactly. But the thing that was ironic to me too was that Starbucks CEO Brian Nickel like he wasn't required to relocate when he first started. But the company says he does have a residence and an office in Seattle now. So yes, so he has come back. Are they still doing that?\nAre they doing well?\nI mean, no, they're not. The thing is like sales, they posted five consecutive quarters of same store sales declines. The stock has gone nowhere during the pandemic. Essentially, he's trying like they're trying to overhaul the cafes, make them more welcoming, trying different things. But I mean, I have seen a change. I mean, they're actually writing on the cups again.\nYes. Yes.\nOh, really?\nYes. That's a big putting a little smiley face on. I am a sophisticated analysis there. So, you know, it's not just But people are just the drive-thru line is out the and there's nobody in the store.\nI could tell you Allan Ducas Benois, they're not ready.\nExactly.\nWhat do you got next? the next one.\nOkay, you're going to have to help me with this, okay? Cuz so the NCAA, right? They want to expand March Madness, but the tournament might not be enough to pull in more money by growing it. So, they have another option on the table, and that is going to booze. We're talking beer, wine, alcohol. These are things that the NCAA has kind of steered away from. But here's where it gets a little confusing for me, too. But the NCAA can't sell those sponsorships themselves. So they have to persuade the broadcasters CBS and Turner to do it and then increase their own annual payment to the NCAA. So it it's this weird position that they're in, you know.\nSo we're going to have I mean Paul drinks Budweiser, folks. The 17-year-old new superstar Duke has to have a Budweiser lapel patch out of So I guess CBS will, you know, start taking ads for booze and stuff like that. They're on NC. I don't know. It's weird because they're tied to this contract through 2032, you know, fixed payments. So, but I think they're going to expand the NCAA the March Men is to like more teams and everything. So, they're going to go beyond 64 teams. They want to go to 76 was what they're saying from this article, but\nWell, that doesn't Paul help me here. That doesn't sound like a dumb idea. I mean,\nwell, I mean, I don't know what the right number is.\nLike the NHL or MLB, but just more teams. I mean, yeah, I guess I guess any more exciting. I don't I think it kind of waters it. I don't know.\nYeah, I like it at the beginning. Am I right? Well, I like it at the beginning of the tournament because I haven't been thrown out, right? I never watch the final four cuz I don't have anything there. But that first weekend is what it's all about, you know? Uh you got all the teams playing and that's what makes March Madness great.\nLisa, you're going to be able to get home. We got rain tomorrow, rain Thursday.\nOh, I just got to keep checking my sump pump. I go to the basement and I still kick that thing, make sure it's still going. Lisa Matteo the newspapers.
