Vladimir Putin.\nWell, at the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, it's going to be uh too bad.\nShould Zalinski get more aggressive?\nYeah, the tariffs are going to go on and other sanctions go on.\nShould Zalinski target Moscow?\nShould Zalinski target Moscow, sir?\nShould Zalinski target Moscow or deeper into Russia?\nHe shouldn't target Moscow.\nIs that why you gave him four weapons though?\nNo, we're not looking to do that.\nMr. President, why are you giving Why are you giving Mr. 50 additional days to prosecute his?\nOh, I don't think 50 days is very long, and it could be sooner than that.\nI don't think 50 days is very long.\nMr.\nYou should have asked that same question to Biden.\nWhy did he get us into this war?\nYou should ask that question.\nYeah.\nAnd what did he tell you?\nWhy did he get us into this war?\nYou know why he got us in?\nBecause he's a dummy.\nThat's why.\nAnd you don't And you don't cover it right.\nBut you should be asking that question to Biden.\nWhy did he get us into this war?\nBecause he's incompetent.\nIt would have never happened if I were president.\n\nIndonesia.\nSo we made a deal with Indonesia.\nI spoke to their really great president, very popular, very strong, smart, and we uh made the deal.\nWe have full access to Indonesia, everything.\nAs you know, Indonesia is very strong on copper.\nUh but we have full access to everything.\nWe will pay no tariffs.\nUh so they are giving us access into Indonesia, which we never had.\nThat's probably the biggest part of the deal, and the other part is they are going to pay 19% and we are going to pay nothing.\nUh it's going to I think it's a good deal for both parties, but we will have full access into Indonesia, and we have a couple of those deals that are going to be announced.\nUh India basically is working along that same line.\nWe're going to have access into India, and you have to understand we had no access into any of these countries.\nOur people couldn't go in, and now we're getting access because of what we're doing with the tariffs.\nSo, they're paying 19% and we are not paying anything, and they're going to have they're going to give us full access into Indonesia.\nNow, Indonesia has some great product, and they also have some very valuable earths and various other materials.\nOne of the things, as you know, they're known for is very high quality copper which we'll be using.\nMr. President, Texas, sir, Do you believe your tariffs might have led inflation to increase last month?\nDo you think they had any role?\nWell, we had very little inflation.\nUh, I don't know.\nWho do you work for?\nUSA Today.\nWhat?\nUSA Today.\nOh, well, they wrote me a beautiful article the other day, so I can't get angry at you.\nUSA Today just wrote a very good article about me.\nWhat's that all about?\nSo, I can't get angry at you.\nOn Texas, sir.\nNo, there was very little inflation, as you know.\nThe numbers were very good, very much inside the margin.\nSo, we've had no inflation.\nAll we have is we're making a fortune.\nWe are taking in hundreds of billions of dollars.\nYou saw we had a surplus of 25 billion dollars last month, which we haven't had in many, many years.\nMr. Texas,\nuh, we are do because I got to because I'm able to do it.\nNobody else would be able to do it.\nWe have tariffs going on because we want tariffs, and we want the money coming into the United States.\nBut more important than the money, there's two aspects of tariff.\nThere's the money which comes in.\nThe other aspect is that rather than paying the tariffs, the country or the company will build in the United States, make their product in the United States, and that creates jobs.\nAnd I would say of the two, probably the more important to me is that yeah, Texas.\nAre you Are you Are you on Ukraine's side now?\nNo, I'm on nobody's side.\nI'm no I want to You know who the side I'm on?\nHumanity side.\nI want to stop the killing of thousands of people a week.\nI want to stop the killing.\nI want the killing to stop in the Ukraine Russia war.\nThat's the side I'm on.\nMr. President, Mr. President, your daughter, Mr. president, your daughter-in-law said that there that there should be transparency in the Epstein case.\nDo you agree with her, sir?\nUh the attorney general's handled that very well.\nUh she is uh she's really done a very good job, and I think that when you look at it, you'll understand that.\nUh I would like to see that also.\nBut I think the attorney general, the credibility is very important, and uh you want credible evidence for something like that.\nAnd I think the attorney general's handled it very well.\nHow many more Honestly, the attorney general briefed you on the DOJ and FBI review.\nThe findings of that review.\nThe attorney general briefed you on\nOn what?\nOn the on the DOJ and FBI\non what?\nOn what subject?\nEpste on Epste\nvery quick briefing.\nDid she tell you what did she tell you about the review?\nAnd specifically, did she tell you at all that your name appeared in the file?\nNo, no.\nShe's uh she's given us just a very quick briefing.\nAnd in terms of the credibility of the different things that they've seen, and I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden, you know, uh we and we went through years of that with the Russia Russia Russia hoax with all of the different things that we had to go through.\nWe've gone through years of it, but she's handled it very well, and it's going to be up to her.\nWhatever she thinks is credible, she should release.\nYeah.\nOn Texas.\nOn Texas, how many more seats do you want the Republicans to draw?\nAnd then what if California, New York, Illinois, and other blue states?\nWell, that's okay, too.\nBut five, I think we get five.\nAnd there could be some other states.\nWe're going to get another three or four or five in addition.\nTexas would be the biggest one, and that'll be five.\nAre you calling them for a complete redrawing of the congressional map?\nNo, just a very simple redrawing.\nWe pick up five seats, but we have a couple of other states where we'll pick up seats also.\nWhen was the last time you spoke with him?\nWell, when he was in my office.\nWhat did you tell him when he was in your office?\nUh, I told him he's doing a very bad job.\nHe's way late.\nThat's why I call him too late.\nJerome Powell is too late.\nHe's way late.\nInterest rates should be coming down.\nWe're We have a very, very successful country.\nWe should have the lowest interest rate anywhere in the world, and we don't.\nJerome Powell has done a terrible job, and frankly I don't think he could do a worse job.\nHe's called everything wrong.\nSo they had a report come out the other day 71 different economists and me.\nYou know who was right?\nMe.\nDid you know that?\nI was right.\nMr. President, are you going to appoint Mr.\nYou must be kidding.\nAndrew,\nwhat's your thought?\nWhat?\nMr. President,\nMr. President, what are your thoughts on Andrew coming?\nYou had to waste a question like?\nNo, we are talking to the EU and we're making progress.\nBut look, you know, we already have a deal with the EU.\nIt's called the letter that was sent out.\nI think it was 30%.\nThat's the EU.\nBut we uh at the same time we are talking Andrew Cuomo.\nMr.\nPresident, go ahead.\nWell, Mr. President, your reaction to Andrew Cuomo staying in the New York City mayor's race.\nAndrew Cuomo staying in the New York City mayor's race.\nI think he should stay.\nI think he has a shot.\nWould you prefer him over?\nWell, I don't want to say.\nYou know, I'm a Republican.\nHe's a Democrat or an independent.\nNo, I think Andrew would have a good shot of winning.\nHe's got to run a tough campaign.\nHe's, you know, he's running against the communists.\nI would think that he would have a good shot of winning.\nTell us about your trip to Scotland, sir.\nWhat What are you going to do on your trip to Scotland?\nWe're going to be meeting with the British prime minister, very respected, and uh we are going to have a meeting with him probably in Aberdeen.\nAnd we're going to do a lot of different things, and we're going to also refine the trade deal that we've made.\nSo, we'll be meeting mostly with the uh at probably one of my properties or maybe not depending on what happens.\nBut uh we'll be in Aberdine in Scotland meeting with the prime minister.\nMr.\nMr. President, give a message for the EU if they retaliate affairs.\nWell, I don't know how they can retaliate.\nYou know, they've made a lot of money.\nThey've treated us very badly, but now they're treating us very nicely, and I think we'll end up I think everybody's going to be happy with the EU.\nIs there any plans?\nAny plans to meet with Pope Leo in the near future, sir?\nNot a plan.\nI would do it.\nI have a lot of respect.\nI really like his brother.\nHis brother is a major serious Trumper.\nYou know that.\nHe's MAGA all the way.\nI like the Pope's brother, and I think I'd like the Pope, but the Pope's brother lives in Florida.\nI met him and he is MAGA.\nHe's got MAGA signs all over the house.\nHe likes Trump and I like him.\nMr. President, what's the latest on Iran?\nHow about you?\nTo meet President Putin to discuss his race and death.\nWell, we're going to see what happens with President Putin.\nSo far, I've been very disappointed with President Putin.\nI've solved a lot of wars in the last three months, but I haven't gotten this one yet.\nThis is a Biden war.\nIt's not a Trump war.\nI'm here to try and get us out of that mess.\nAny messages for what?\nYeah, go ahead.\nDo I have a what?\nBrazil.\nFor the Brazil, they ask for the people of Brazil.\nYes.\nAre you from Brazil?\nUh, he's going to trial now, right?\nYeah.\nWhen is that trial starting?\nWhen is the trial for Bolsinaro starting?\nHow is it going?\nThey are asking him to find him guilty.\nBut they haven't found him guilty, have they?\nBut have they found him guilty?\nNo.\nIran.\nPresident Balsinaro is a good man.\nI've gotten to know a lot of prime ministers and presidents and kings and queens.\nAnd I know him, and I'm pretty good at this.\nPresident Bolsinaro is not a dishonest man.\nHe loves the people of Brazil.\nHe fought hard for the people of Brazil.\nHe negotiated trade deals against me for the people of Brazil.\nAnd he was very tough.\nAnd he was tough because he he wanted to do a good deal for his country.\nHe was not a dishonest man.\nAnd I believe it's a witch hunt, and it shouldn't be happening.\nAnd it's not that I know him that look, he's not like a friend of mine.\nHe's somebody that I know.\nAnd I know him as a representative of millions of people, Brazilians.\nThey're great people.\nAnd he loves the country, and he fought hard for those people, and they want to put him in jail, and I think that's a witch hunt, and I think it's very unfortunate and nobody's happy with what Brazil is doing because Bolsinaro was a respected president, very respected.\nYou want Adam brought to justice to see him brought to justice?\nI think I'll tell you what I think Adam Ship is one of the lowest of the low.\nI would love to see him brought to justice.\nUh he is a dishonest, crooked guy.\nI don't know about the individual charge if that even happens, but Adam Shiff is a serious lowlife.\nAnd tomorrow morning here in Washington for breakfast.\nAdam Ship, I believe.\nI I'd love to be.\nI'd really love to go.\nI mean, I look forward to meeting them both.\nI know him both very well through what I read and through what I see.\nUh, look, he's a communist.\nI don't think our country is ready for a communist, but we're going to see.\nAnd I don't think that race is over yet either.\nYou do have a couple of people running against and I it'll be an interesting thing.\nThings are coming out about him which aren't good.\nAnd uh you know AOC look I think she's very nice but she's very low IQ and we really don't need low IQ between her and Crockett we're going to give them both an IQ test to see who comes out best now I took my test I took a real test at Walter Reed Medical Center and I aced it I got every one of all those questions right now it's time for them to take a test anyway have a good time\nI like Dan Bino.\nYeah.\nMr. President, do you think respects you and takes your country?\n",
