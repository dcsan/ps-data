  "cleanText": "Bloomberg Audio Studios podcasts, radio, news.\nYou're listening to Bloomberg Businessweek with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on Bloomberg Radio.\nHappy Friday, everyone.\nI'm Norah Mulinda here with Tim Stenovec.\nI'm in for Carol Massar today.\nTim, let's talk logistics.\nI love talking logistics.\nOkay.\nUm, it's Omair Tariq's.\nUh, he's a specialty for this.\nThis is his specialty.\nHe's the founder and CEO of Cart.com.\nThat's a logistics firm based in Houston, Texas.\nAnd it provides services for B2C and B2B companies.\nThink about online store management, fulfillment, marketing, and customer support.\nHe's joining us now from Houston.\nOmair, talk to us a little bit about Cart.com.\nSeems like you all have done a lot over the past four years since your inception.\nWhat exactly is Cart.com and what inspired you to launch it?\nThanks for thanks for having me first of all.\nUm, look, we started the company to build the world's largest infrastructure as a service.\nUm, the problem we're trying to solve is we have billions and billions of dollars of GMV flowing through our operational infrastructure.\nWe power the technology services and operational capabilities for brands of all sizes.\nUh, about half a billion dollars in revenue, about $10 billion of GMV, 1,200 employees globally, and we're just four years old.\nWow.\nOkay.\nThat's pretty impressive stuff, Omair.\nOne of the reasons we like to talk with people like you is because you have a good idea of what's happening in the economy right now based on your customers, what you're seeing on the B2B and B TOC level.\nHave you seen a significant difference in order fulfillment uh given the uncertainty around tariffs post April 2nd?\nYeah, I mean look, there has been a volatility of uh things going up and things going down for the last two years.\nUm consumer sentiment has been shifting almost every quarter.\nUm the last couple of quarters we've definitely seen a couple of very interesting trends.\nUh the first was you know in Q1 we actually saw a pretty big influx of consumers flying to get ahead of the tariffs and the retailers kind of you know build up the warehouses to have the inventory to take care of the consumers that are shopping.\nUm Q2 as the sentiment sort of continues to be around inflation and tariffs and uncertainty uh there's a little bit of slowdown that we're seeing across the retail landscape.\nOmair, bring us into the boardroom.\nWhat are conversations like right now?\nWhat types of changes are you all having to implement given the uncertainty?\nYeah, I mean, look, I think u in times like this, uh we are uh doubling down.\nUh because if if you think about it, right, um scale is something that's going to become so much more important as you think about economies that these brands are now looking for.\nUm the larger we are, the faster capabilities that we can provide to the brands we work with, the better off they're going to be.\nUh by working with us.\nSo uh we're actually you know we've just announced a couple of acquisitions in the last nine months and we're actually going to announce a couple of more acquisitions in the next uh six to nine months.\nSo uh we're going both organic and inorganically uh pretty aggressively towards the next couple of years.\nWho who would you say when you know when you were when you were building this company when you founded this company what was the problem that existed that wasn't being solved?\nUh think about a company called Janie and Jack.\nThey, you know, make beautiful uh dresses for girls and if you think about them selling through their website, selling through their stores and their end consumer continuously shopping in other channels outside of just online and their stores.\nSo, think Tik Tok, think Amazon, uh think eBay, think Walmart, think Nordstrom, uh everywhere the consumer is going.\nUh for a mid-market retailer to be able to provide their product cataloges, their inventory, their pricing across multiple channels, across a pretty complex permutation of product categories is really hard, especially when you don't have billions and billions of revenue and scale to kind of fulfill that, right?\nSo, um what Cart.com does is makes that easy.\nUh if you're a brand wanting to sell in every channel in the world, we enable that technologically and operationally.\nAnd you know, today we're obviously North America focused, but very soon we're going to be international where if you want to add Italy or France as an international market, um, you can just come to Cart.com and within 24 hours you can start selling there.\nOmair, you mentioned acquisitions.\nWhat types of companies are you targeting?\nWhat comes to mind when you guys are thinking about the companies that you'd like to acquire?\nYeah, I mean, look, I think we're looking for uh very interesting categories that are growing really fast.\nUm, you know, logistics companies, software companies, services companies.\nLook, the thing about Cart.com is that we're we're uh we're known as a logistics company, but we're really the broadest infrastructure company and the deepest infrastructure company as a you know, as a service in the world today.\nUm we do logistics, we do order management, we do services.\nSo uh when we think about acquisition targets, we're looking at categories uh not just product categories but you know companies that are doing software, companies that are doing services and companies that are going to help you know sort of augment our operational infrastructure and scale.\nSo uh we're very very broad.\nWe're essentially trying to replicate uh the infrastructure that Amazon has built uh except in a not marketplace format where we're partners with them not competitors.\nSo, speaking of scaling, where are you all currently positioned and what are you thinking about in terms of regions that you could potentially scale in?\nYeah, look, I mean, today we're we're, you know, we're shipping about 350 million units a year.\nUh, that's our our last year numbers.\nUm, uh, in the US alone.\nUm, you know, we're looking at the UK, we're looking at Europe, we're looking at, uh, the Middle East and and Asia and Latam.\nSo, in that order, right?\nSo the idea is to sort of start moving uh eastwards into one geography at a time over the next couple of years.\nWhat are some of the challenges that come with uh expanding into international markets especially given the volatility right now and the uncertainty regarding tariffs?\nYeah, look, we're in the business of making it easy for the mid-market brands that we work with, which means that we have to do the hard work.\nSo when you enter a new market, you're not only thinking about localized supply chain, the mid-market challenges that occur, the you know regulatory challenges that are now being thrown because of tariffs.\nYou also have to think about okay, it's not just about procuring, it's also about selling.\nIt's it's about increasing demand for these brands.\nSo you know, we we we sort of solve a threepart problem.\nOne, we help consumers drive to these brands.\nUh two we make sure that they have the technology to basically sell in the languages and geographies that were enabling the infrastructure and then three we have to help with the procurement which is the last mile delivery of those packages right so now we are actually taking over the complexity of the problem so that the brands don't have to um essentially we do all the hard work around the complex infrastructure from technology to logistics brands can just connect and integrate into our infrastructure and sell in these geographies\nhow are you thinking all artificial intelligence right now and implementing it into the work process.\nI mean look uh AI has been uh in our DNA from day one.\nUh one of the first three hires we made was a chief data scientist at Cart.com.\nUh we have been leveraging AI very significantly over the last four years and things like uh figuring out how to connect demand with inventory management.\nHow do you predict demand?\nSo if you think about it right um the logistics problem actually starts with the consumer clicking yes that they want to buy something and if you can have very large data sets that connect the demand problem with the supply problem then you're essentially optimizing the entire value chain so we have forecasting models that are using and leveraging AI today we predict demand before it occurs and we're continuing to invest very heavily in that technology so that we can give the brands we work with uh an upper and a much upper hand you know there seems to still be this disconnection between what companies know about me and I and look I I I think consumers value privacy, no question.\nUh but I also think that it's like kind of weird when you're um browsing the web and you get an ad for something that you just bought because the browser doesn't understand that you have just bought this this good.\nIs there a way that your your software can and your solution can actually help companies understand consumers online and offline behavior better?\nYeah, absolutely.\nI mean, look, we're we're big believers of privacy and and security and and you know, consumer preferences.\nSo, this is a this is like a very important topic that we talk about almost on a daily basis.\nUh we use very large anonymized data sets to you know do and power the analytics that we ultimately end up providing for the brands we work with.\nUm so you know once the consumer feels comfortable that you know the the way their data is being used is only to help them not to invade their privacy they then become more willing to actually have you know allow you access to it.\nUm the way we're connecting uh for these brands, the data from the time that the consumer starts thinking about a product to the time the product actually shows up to their doorstep.\nWe're the only company in the world that has that breath of information, right?\nBecause we sort of connect the demand side with marketing services and marketplace services and we obviously have the operational infrastructure, you know, tens of millions of square feet of space.\nHow do you think about sustainability as it relates to AI implementations?\nI mean look the first thing is that you have to prevent uh AI from running running a nuk, right?\nYou have to keep control in tabs of how artificial intelligence is being used.\nI think uh too many companies are either using AI as a buzzword and not really using it or they're using it in a way that's maybe abrasive and and not actually what consumers really want.\nSo you have to find the sweet spot of using artificial intelligence in a way that you're optimizing for the profitability of these brands, for the growth of these brands.\nAnd obviously there are lots of internal use cases that we're using AI for, but ultimately what we're really trying to do is help these brands grow faster and make more money.\nOmair, how do you how do you make it so that your order book grows?\nI mean, you you you mentioned a couple of your clients, Janie and Jack, authentic Brands is also another Tom's pack son.\nCertainly brands that that our audience is familiar with.\nHow do you grow that number?\nYeah, I mean look, uh, we are, uh, we're known as a company that, uh, does a lot of work in the B2C space for mid-market retailers, but the the the interesting story about Cart.com is that about half of the business, half of our revenue is actually with B2B companies.\nSo, um, you know, first of all, you've got a virtually almost a trillion dollar addressable market in the mid-market retail segment, and then you've got another trillion half dollar addressable market on the B2B side.\nSo, we actually do a lot of work with B2B companies.\nUm, Charismatics brands is one example where uh they're the providers of scrubs uh for doctors and they work with a large number of uh shops across the United States where uh small mom and pop shops where they provide their scrubs to and we're powering their order management and and logistics platform.\nUh we actually do a lot of work with the federal and state government.\nUm so we are uh we're actually doing a lot of work in health and pharma.\nSo when you think about the infrastructure that we've built for the B2C segment, that's only about one/ird of our uh overall customer segment, but you know, the other one, you know, 2/3 is actually B2B and the government.\nSo um growth is virtually unlimited when we think about the addressable market and what we're going after.\nThat's why we have, you know, gotten so big so quickly.\nOmair Tariq, thanks for joining us.\nReally appreciate appreciate it.\nFounder and CEO of Cart.com, the logistics firm joining us from Houston.\n",
