  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\nThis is the closing bell on the Stock Movers report.\nThe company's making moves at the close of United States trading with Carol Masser, Tim Stenovec, Romaine Bostick, and Scarlet Fu.\n\nAll right, on the gainer side, a new all-time high for Fastenal.\nThe company reported earnings earlier today.\nShares 4% higher at the close.\nThe company reported net sales for the second quarter that were up 8.6% over the same period last year.\nIt did meet the average analyst estimate.\nWe had Daniel Florness on the show, the company's CEO.\nHe said that his industrial customers are starting to see business turnaround.\nHere's what he said.\nQuote, \"The knife has stopped dropping.\"\nWhat he was referring to is the trying to catch a falling knife over the last few years that really in the United States has been industrial production.\nI did ask him and Norah asked him too about the impact of tariffs and he said they tried to move their supply chain back in 2018 during this first round and they were able to make some changes not necessarily bringing anything back to the United States, just not possible right now.\nUh too early to say for his customers though whether this new tariff regime will prompt them to move manufacturing back to the United States.\nIt's just a reminder of how long it takes to actually move your supply chain back to the United States.\nThey were talking about this back in 2017 and, you know, weren't able to to get very far.\nYeah.\nI mean, do you remember the move back in 2017 and 2018 was to move everything out of China and like go to Vietnam or Indonesia or India?\nWell, now it kind of doesn't matter where you are if you're not in the United States because all of those countries are getting tariffed as well.\nHey, did any of you guys see Superman over the weekend?\nNo.\nWas it good?\nI didn't see it either.\nA lot of people did see it though.\nWe look at you when we see Superman.\nI was going to say, wow, you guys, you guys are the best.\nUh Warner Brothers Discovery shares up more than 2%.\nUh this after the company did say uh that they brought in at least $115 million domestically.\nIt did take in $220 million worldwide.\nThis according to a statement from Warner Brothers, excuse me, $125 million in ticket sales in the United States.\nSo that did beat expectations of $115 million.\nThis is just the opening chapter in a 10-year plan dinner weave movies and TV shows based on DC comic book characters such as Batman and Wonder Woman.\nWouldn't they have done this before?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nI'm just\nThey've done this.\nSo, I mean, I don't know.\nDo you think DC is going to get it right this time?\nI mean, everyone's saying, \"Okay, you had a decent box office domestically, though, don't look at the international numbers, Tim.\nWas not as good.\"\nBut this idea that maybe they could finally build off this and and actually truly build up something that's comparable to the Marvel universe.\nLook, I don't know what it takes to have a successful franchise.\nNo, I don't either, but I like but but we can we can look and see what you know what what the Marvel universe has done, right?\nPeanut gallery speaks.\nYeah, exactly.\nI think James Gunn knows a little more than we do when it comes to what makes a successful movie.\nUh and finally, I do want to talk about Shen View real quick.\nUp they finished the day higher today by more than 2%.\nIt's the company behind Tylenol, Neutrogena, and Listerine, formerly the consumer healthcare division of J&J.\nThe company said that CEO Thiba Ming Mongol is going to leave the company as it continues to revamp.\nThe board director Kirk Perry will take over as interim CEO effective immediately.\nThey faced push from activist investors for changes on how the company is structured and run ever since it was spun off from J&J just a couple of years ago.\nOnce again, Keny shares up by more than 2.2%.\nNora, well, a couple decliners that I'm keeping an eye on right now.\nWe had Waters, uh, that is a life sciences company about $18 billion in market cap.\nIt fell for double-digit losses when we ended at the close today after saying that it'll merge with Becton Dickinson's Biosciences & Diagnostic Solutions business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction that's valued at about 17.5 billion.\nWe had Jefferies analyst saying that they expect the stock to trade down due to the deal size and variables added to a clean replacement cycle story.\nBut if you look at the stock on a year-to- date basis down about 18%.\nI know it's Monday, but I did want to talk about an alcohol company.\nI'm looking at Constellation Brands, and we're seeing shares that also fell at the close today after President Trump declared a 30% tariff for Mexico and the EU.\nUh, which of course we know these are key markets for those drink makers.\nSo, tariffs are really the story here.\nBut, uh, this is a $28 billion company.\nThey own Medela, Corona, a lot of the names that we know here.\nBut, shares are down about 26% this year.\nSo, not great news here for the brand.\nMaybe people are going to healthier alternatives.\nWe'll see.\nI like the fact you picked an alcohol company because you really truly are filling Carol Masser.\nHave to live up to it the best I can.\nAlso, Fluence Energy, that's uh an energy per uh this is an energy company and we saw energy is the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 today and this was one of the names that was in the red.\nMissou cut the stock to neutral from outperform.\nThey're also pointing toward this tariff impact and additionally the Republican tax and spending bills effects on the clean energy sector.\nThe company's about $1.4 billion dollars in market cap, but I'm looking at the year-to- date as well down 50%.\nNot looking good.\nAll right, let's get a quick check on yields.\nContinue to see a steepening of the curve.\nUh treasuries overall falling for a third straight day.\nThat's pushing yields higher, but two interesting dynamics are playing out.\nOne is obviously that you're seeing much greater moves in yields on the longer end of the curve to the upside.\nBut on the short end of the curve, take a look at that.\nA one basis point move, one and a half if you want to be uh particular on that two-year yield.\nAnd that has been the narrow range that we've actually seen on the shorter end of the curve now for quite some time.\nIn fact, the past three sessions, we basically had one basis point, one basis point, and then three basis points.\nAnd then if you keep going out, it really doesn't get much wider than that.\nAnd I think it is kind of telling uh Tim and Nora this idea uh that maybe you have a market at least in the Treasury market with a lot of folks right now on the sideline.\nThe Stock Movers Report from Bloomberg Radio.\nCheck back with us throughout the day for the latest roundup of companies
