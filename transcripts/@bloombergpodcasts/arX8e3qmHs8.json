  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\nThis is Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.\nReporting from the magazine that helps global leaders stay ahead with insight on the people, companies, and trends shaping today's complex economy.\nPlus, global business, finance, and tech news as it happens.\nThe Bloomberg Businessweek Daily podcast with Carol Masser and Tim Stenovec on Bloomberg Radio.\nPresident Donald Trump threatened to impose stiff financial penalties on Russia if it does not end hostilities with Ukraine.\nThat's within 50 days while pledging fresh weapon supplies for Kyiv.\nTrump said the levies would come in the form of secondary tariffs without providing details.\nThe president has used the term in the past to describe duties imposed on countries for trading with American adversaries.\nAngela Stent is senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nShe's also the author of Putin's World, Russia against the West and with the rest.\nShe's a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council.\nAlso served in the office of policy planning at the US Department of State.\nAngela, good to have you with us this afternoon.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick followed up afterward.\nHe said it would be a secondary sanction or secondary sanctions, I should say.\nWhat exactly does that mean for a country that has had sanctions on it for years?\nSo the actual tariffs or sanctions on Russia wouldn't mean very much tariffs because we we barely trade with Russia.\nI think $5 billion last year.\nBut what that would mean is sanctions on China, sanctions on India, they're the two largest purchases of Russian oil.\nProbably a country like Turkey as well which purchases a lot of Russian oil.\nSo they are threatening those countries.\nI believe that President Trump said 100% tariffs.\nThere's a Senate bill which would impose 500% tariffs, secondary tariffs on these countries that purchase Russian hydrocarbons.\nSo that's the real threat, not so much to Russia.\nAngela, how meaningful would it be for these countries?\nSo I mean it would be meaningful because they are the largest purchases of Russian oil.\nBut then we don't know how they might retaliate.\nIndia of course is a country that's being drawn closer to the United States.\nSo to have that kind of tariff on India would also I think affect other aspects of the US-Indian relationship.\nSo I think they're kind of all waiting.\nI should say that, you know, saying that Russia has 50 days to end the war, you have to realize that Russia is now in the middle of a very brutal summer offensive.\nAnd if you give them 50 days, the summer will be over by then.\nSo, Russia can still do an enormous amount of damage to Ukraine in those 50 days.\nWell, in terms of moving the needle on actually ending this conflict, Dr. understand.\nIs this enough in your view to actually push Russia to stop its bombardment of Ukraine?\nWell, the most important thing at the moment are the weapons supplies.\nI mean, the Ukrainians desperately need air defenses.\nThey need those Patriot batteries.\nAnd today, President Trump said that there's 17 of them available.\nSo, what's going to happen is European allies are going to purchase American Patriot missiles and other weapons.\nThey are then going to give them to Ukraine.\nSo that enables President Trump to say to his base, well, we're not spending any more money on Ukraine.\nWhether that's enough to help Ukraine really give the message to Putin that he cannot win this war, I think that's doubtful.\nI mean, Putin's not going to stop until he believe really believes that he's not going to win this.\nAnd for that, the Ukrainians need an enormous amount of weapons, including in the end weapons that could strike Moscow.\nBut we haven't said that we're going to provide those yet.\nWell, let's listen to exactly what the president said earlier.\nHere he is in the Oval Office with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nWhere we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them.\nWe the United States will not be having any payment made.\nWe're not buying it, but we will manufacture it and they're going to be paying for it.\nThis is a very big deal we've made.\nThis is billions of dollars worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States going to NATO etc.\nAnd that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield.\nUkraine will take it up and you know say what you want about Ukraine.\nWhen the war started, they had no chance.\nAnd they still would have had no chance if the equipment they had the best equipment because we do make the best planes and missiles and we make the best military equipment in the world by far.\nThat was President Trump.\nEarlier today, he was in the Oval Office with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nDr. understand.\nI want to talk about the weapons portion of this and the significance that you see in an environment where many in the Republican party were happy not to provide Ukraine with any aid.\nI how do you view this politically for President Trump and also whether or not you think this is enough of a move by the United States and again the president saying the United States is going to provide them NATO's NATO member states are going to pay for them.\nIf that's enough to give Ukraine the edge against Russia.\nWell, so first of all, this certainly has split the MAGA base because there's still significant numbers of people beginning with Vice President Vance, who think that we shouldn't be supplying Ukraine.\nAnd then you had the under secretary in the defense department, Elbridge KBY, apparently order the end of supplying Ukraine with weapons because he thinks only the Europeans should do this.\nPresident Trump reversed that order that apparently he hadn't heard about before.\nSo yes, I think this is still a contentious issue within his base.\nIs that enough to help Ukraine?\nI mean, Ukraine just needs an enormous amount of these Patriot batteries.\nIf it gets 17 extra ones, that's terrific.\nUkrainians themselves are manufacturing their own drones now.\nThey're also making deals with European countries to co-roduce them.\nBut we really don't know whether that is enough because the Russians are also stepping up their production of weapons and they're also using their drones in very creative ways to try and get round some of the barriers that the Ukraine have Ukrainians have put in their way.\nSo at the moment things are very difficult for Ukraine and I think only very significant numbers of weapons can help them push this back and they also do have a mobilization problem.\nThey you know Russia has many more people that can mobilize.\nIt's got North Koreans fighting for the Russians.\nThe Ukrainians do face this shortage and you know they they are so far refusing to draft 18 to 25 year olds but they are under pressure from some of the western countries to do so.\nAngela, we saw a report last week that North Korea is supplying as much as 40% of Russia's ammunition.\nJust how much of an asset is this for Russia?\nOh, North Korea is an enormous asset for Russia now.\nWe now hear they may send as many as 30,000 more Korean troops to Russia to help and with the ammunition.\nSo without North Korea, it would be very difficult for Russia to do what it's doing.\nIran is less important now by the way because the Russians are producing their own drones.\nBut I would say the single most important country in terms of weapon supplies right now is North Korea.\nDr. Angela Stent, we always appreciate you taking the time and joining us on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.\nDr. Angela Stent is senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, also the author of Putin's World, Russia against the West and with the rest.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Businessweek Daily podcast.\nCatch us live weekday afternoons from 2:00 to 5 Eastern.\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App or watch us live on YouTube.\nLet's talk about the world of Elon Inc.\nThe money behind Elon Musk's trillion dollar empire is increasingly flowing in one direction, and that's toward AI.\nMusk said on Sunday that he plans to hold a vote by Tesla shareholders on whether the company should invest in XAI, the cash burning AI startup that he founded 2 years ago.\nCome shortly after SpaceX, his mammoth rocket launch company, agreed to invest about $2 billion into the AI firm.\nThis according to people familiar with the matter.\nDan Hull and Ed Ledllo write about Elon turning to Tesla and SpaceX to fuel his AI ambitions.\nDan Hull is Bloomberg News senior technology reporter.\nShe's also a contributor to the Elon Inc. podcast.\nYou can catch new episodes of that every single week wherever you get your podcast.\nShe joins us from our San Francisco bureau.\nDana, Tesla is I know it's not a car company because we're told it's not a car company.\nI heard you chuckle there.\nWe're told it's not a car company.\nThey do Optimus.\nThey do the self-driving stuff.\nBut listen, what moves the company's stock?\nHow many cars they delivered?\nDo they have any business according to the folks you talked to making an investment in this money losing AI company?\nYeah.\nSo, the the money needs of XAI are enormous.\nI mean billions of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence.\nThere's huge need for compute and data centers and you know XAI is building out this big data center in Memphis called Colossus.\nAnd as we've seen so often with Elon Musk, you know, he doesn't I mean he he runs five companies but they're not really separate.\nThey have overlapping investors, engineers, management, sometimes boards.\nAnd Musk like often I don't want to say robs Peter to pay Paul but like he will he will you know co-mingle his companies in a way that is very unlike any other corporate CEO that we've seen and I think in his mind AI is the future.\nTesla is also an AI company.\nIf they can invest in XAI they maybe get preferential access to Grock.\nWe're already seeing that Tesla is now integrating Grock the chatbot into its cars.\nWe know that Tesla has sold mega packs to XAI for that Memphis data center.\nSo, they already are working together quite a bit and I think, you know, a lot of investors, particularly the retail investors, see this as a way to get in on XAI.\nI mean, so there probably is a fair amount of shareholder support for this idea, at least from the retail side.\nYeah.\nAnd speaking of support, so of course Musk is planning to hold a vote by Tesla shareholders on whether or not the make EV maker should invest in XAI.\nDoes Elon usually let other people including his shareholders and supporters weigh in on his decision-m?\nYeah, I mean something like for so Tesla is a publicly traded company and so this would be a management proposal that would likely be spelled out in the proxy.\nWe know that Tesla is having its shareholder meeting on November 6th.\nWe have not seen a proxy yet, but this idea is something that Musk has floated for over a year now.\nI mean, I think he first pled people on X, like should Tesla invest $5 billion in XAI like a year ago, and so it sounds like now it's likely to be in the proxy.\nSo I mean, because it is a publicly traded company, yeah, shareholders have to weigh in.\nIt would be a sizable investment for Tesla.\nI want to read a post that you linked to in the piece that you and Ed wrote.\nIt's from Grock on X.\nFirst off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced.\nWe have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse.\nThis was on Friday Dana and it was about the horrific behavior.\nIt was referred to itself as Mecca Hitler and it had posts that praised Adolf Hitler and appeared to call the Holocaust quote effective.\nThis is this is the chatbot for XAI.\nIs this thing ready?\nLike like if you're a Tesla investor, do do you have pause about sending money from Tesla to a company that has made a mistake such as this in the in the AI race?\nI know right.\nThat that is a very good question.\nWell, I think like when you say Tesla investor, you know, there's sort of two camps of investors.\nThere are institutional investors, a lot of index funds.\nYou know, Tesla obviously joined the S&P 500 back in December 2020.\nAnd then there's this very rapid, you know, retail shareholder base that is wildly enthusiastic, very on board with Elon, and they're really betting on, you know, Elon in the future.\nAnd if the f if the future is not car sales, it's got to be something.\nAnd so I I see that this is all part of Elon's big plan to really position himself as a leader in AI.\nRemember that XAI was founded after open AAI by his rival Sam Altman came out with chat GBT and so you're seeing Grock try to be a big player in this field.\nYes, they have absolutely made mistakes.\nThe whole Hitler thing from last week was horrible.\nI think it's notable that that Grock apologized or XAI apologized and like they seem to be sorting it out.\nBut yeah, I mean the other question I have is like do Tesla owners want Grock in their cars?\nI mean, I I I'm assuming there's a way to opt out or not act not, you know, enable that if you want, but I don't think that when people buy a Tesla, they necessarily signed up for Grock.\nSo, Musk has of course really stepped away from that whole political sphere that he was in for a little while, but except when he tweets,\nI was going to say, is it fair to say that that's the case?\nHe's trying to step away.\nWe'll we'll say I don't I don't really buy that to be honest.\nI mean, he had to step away from Doge because his time as a special government employee had like a limit, like you can only serve X number of days per year as an SGE.\nAnd so, like that came to an end, but he just can't help himself.\nLike, if he feels strongly about something like he cannot keep his mouth shut.\nSo, we saw him tweeting over the weekend about the Epstein files.\nI mean, and he is still talking about creating a third party.\nHe has, you know, for all intents and purposes, quote unquote, stepped away from Doge, but I think he still has ambitions to be a player in the midterms to potentially really start this third party.\nAnd you know, he has poured so much money into American politics already.\nI don't see him going quietly into the night on that.\nAs we think about X AI, I mean, is there still a conversation about his head being in too many places right now with too many business ventures?\nI mean, that's an ongoing perennial criticism of Elon, that he's spread too thin, that he's distracted, that he's got too many things on his plate.\nBut like, that's the way he's operated for years.\nI mean, you know, he simultaneously ran Tesla and SpaceX for decades, and SpaceX is the most valuable company in the world right now, and Tesla still has a\n\n\n$1 trillion market cap. So, I feel like a lot of long-term investors see past that, and they think that, you know, Elon is a genius who can hyperfocus where he needs to and when he needs to. And, um, you know, that criticism hasn't really held up. He is able to execute when he's hyperfocused, and he hyperfocuses a lot, like every day. How can we look to Tesla's acquisition of Solar City close to a decade ago as sort of a blueprint for a private investment or an investment in a private company such as XAI?\n\nWell, it was the same kind of deal, right, where Solar City was struggling and really needed a bailout, and so Tesla bought Solar City, which was rife with all of these conflicts of interests because Elon was the chair of the board and was the largest investor. So it was like, you know, some people forget like Tesla acquired Solar City. I mean, Solar City was a company that Elon founded with his cousins. Um, so this was, and you know, and now, I mean, Tesla still has a solar roof division somewhat, but, um, it's the same thing. Like Tesla has money, XAI needs money, Tesla, you know, Elon's going to go to his board and say we should invest. They're going to bring it to the shareholders. I'm sure there'll be a campaign around it. Like, I would imagine that it could pass unless there's really strong institutional opposition, and you know, the Solar City deal was rife with all these conflicts, and it went to court, but like, ultimately Tesla prevailed, and it ended up being okay for shareholders. I mean, they took a bath initially, but like the company has still achieved great heights.\n\nChief investment officer Nancy Tangler said that an investment into XAI will further dilute the declining EV business. Is this something that you're hearing from sources as well?\n\nI mean, absolutely. Like Tesla, you know, Tesla used to be all about selling cars. The company used to say that it was going to make 20 million cars a year by 2030. They've completely abandoned that. You know, Elon now tweets things about how like owning a car will be like owning a horse. Like the future is all about shared mobility and ride sharing and AI and Optimus, and you know, we haven't heard anything about the Mexico plant in months. I mean, I think that that plant is basically dead for all intents and purposes. So, yeah, I mean, you know, Tesla has got to find a way to make money, and if they can catch the AI wave and get a return on their investment in XAI, ultimately that's seen as a good thing.\n\nMhm. In about 30 seconds or less, how's SpaceX doing in regards to the everyone trying to do the space race right now?\n\nSpaceX is the dominant launch provider in the US. Full stop. I mean, there's no other way to get to the International Space Station, uh, except for on SpaceX in the US. So, I think that they, and they have Starlink. So, I mean, even though they've had some setbacks with Starship, they are the dominant provider in the US. So, next time the president, uh, threatens to cut off contracts with SpaceX, just remember what Dana said, full stop. They're the dominant provider of this technology.\n\nAnd the Pentagon just gave XAI a contract today with some other AI companies as well, up to $200 million per each to do, you know, AI for the government. So, those contracts keep flowing.\n\nDana Hull, Bloomberg News senior technology reporter, also contributor to the Elon Inc. podcast.

I don't know that he's going to, but, uh, he should. Jerome Powell's been very bad for our country. We should have the lowest interest rate on earth, and we don't. Uh, he just refuses to do it. And yet he's spending $2.5 billion rebuilding the Fed.\n\nThat was President Trump just yesterday in Maryland. This construction project offers the clearest example yet of how Trump and those in his orbit are looking for every opportunity to scrutinize Jerome Powell's leadership at the central bank, even beyond his economic stewardship. Bloomberg News Federal Reserve reporter Amara Omeokwe joins us now from our Washington DC bureau. A $2.5 billion, uh, renovation. The topic of the renovation coming up when Jerome Powell defended the renovations as necessary during his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee late last month.\n\nSome of those are just flatly misleading. The idea of elevators, you know, we, it's the same elevator. It's been there since the building was built. So that's a mischaracterization, and some of those are no longer in the plans. They, you know, that's, that's earlier. We, we've, the plans have continued to evolve.\n\nI do want to bring in Amara Omeokwe. She's been writing about this. She's Bloomberg News Federal Reserve reporter. She joins us from Washington DC. $2.5 billion is what is at issue here. What exactly is the Federal Reserve renovation happening right now, and who started planning this? Like, like give us the details here.\n\nYeah. So, the Fed is currently renovating two historic buildings here in Washington DC, and they've said those renovations are basically meant to consolidate all their operations in one place and really restore these two historic buildings that are very old and that the Fed says haven't been like comprehensively restored in quite some time. And so, that's kind of the Fed's rationale for these renovations. They were approved by the Fed's board several years ago. So, this project is not a new project. Uh, the Fed, the Trump administration scrutiny of it is new, but this project has been going on for quite a while. Um, and so what we're seeing here is President Trump and those in his administration now taking issue with the overall price tag of the project, which has increased in recent years, and then also taking issue with what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said about some of the design features in the renovation when he was on the, on, um, on the, on the Hill last month talking about these renovations. And some of the administration officials are basically alleging that Powell was not truthful in that testimony. And that seems to be what they're using to kind of lay the groundwork to say that perhaps President Trump has cause to remove, uh, Chair Powell from his position on the Fed's board of governors. Because of course, to remove someone from the Fed's board of governors, you, you have to meet a very high legal standard, which is cause, something like malfeasance or neglect of duty. And so some administration officials seem to be trying to use this renovation issue to try and establish that cause.\n\nAmara, as you mentioned, this is not new. This renovation has been going on for quite some time now, but is this the first time that the magnitude of the renovation is really being questioned?\n\nYeah, I would say so. And what kind of set this off were was media reports about some of the features in the renovation. Basically, there was a media report that sort of characterized some of the features in the renovation as, um, very lavish, very extravagant. And so that led to Republican senators when Chair Powell was on the hill last month, that that led them to sort of question him over why there are some of these features, why the costs for the project have increased over the years. And so that is what kind of sort of brought this issue into the forefront recently, and then we've really seen the administration kind of seize upon it and use it as part of their overall sort of criticism of Chair Powell's stewardship of the Fed, both, you know, when they're talking about his interest rate, his stance on interest rates, and then also when they're talking about how he has managed this construction project.\n\nWhat are observers of the Federal Reserve saying about this, and and and to what extent this could be, you know, this is not, this is not part of the Fed's dual mandate by any means, right? Stable prices, maximum employment. The Fed chair has laser focused on that mandate that comes from Congress. He tells us that when we hear from him every few weeks. What are observers saying about this sort of, I'm not going to call it a sideshow because that's, you know, that's editorializing a little bit, but it's not core to the Fed's mission by any means, and it's it's very political.\n\nIt is very political. And I think what Fed observers are saying is that this is just a part of this pressure campaign that President Trump and many in his administration are putting on Chair Powell and Fed policy makers to lower interest rates. It's like Fed observers don't see these things as separate issues. They see it as part of the same pressure campaign. And it also really matters because of course we know that Chair Powell's term is up next year, next May. And the search, President Trump's search for the next Fed chair is also on. And so it really does raise questions about what that search will look like and who President Trump will ultimately pick. Is he going to pick someone who is going to be more receptive to his views and the pressure that he puts on them when it comes to to monetary policy and some of these other issues about the institutional management of the Fed? And so I think even beyond Chair Powell, it really does raise these questions about what the Fed looks like when the next chair takes over.\n\nOmar, in regards to this renovation, what can really be done at this point? I mean, the builders are building. This has been going on for some time. Does the president then have the authority to come in and just cancel the entire thing, scale it back? How does that look?\n\nI mean, I think the Fed has said that a lot of, a lot of different input went into, uh, getting approved for this project. Um, including the National Capital Planning Commission. Like, there are a lot of different bodies that sort of weighed in on this project. And I don't think it's within the president's purview to, to sort of stop the, stop the project. Like in the law, the Fed has, um, authority over its own buildings because the Fed in so many ways is an independent agency. But I think what the administration and what President Trump are really trying to do, they're trying to sort of question the optics around this, right? Bill PE, one of the administration officials who have really, who has really focused in on this renovation, will say things like, you know, Jerome Powell is keeping interest rates high, um, and making affordability difficult for Americans while he builds himself a $2.5 billion, uh, palace, right? Essentially, I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially like some of the lines of criticism. And so, what you really see administration officials doing is really calling into question the credibility of Chair Powell. And again, you can't separate those efforts from the efforts that the administration is is putting forth to try and make the Fed follow their lead on interest rates.\n\nAmara, what, what happens to a Federal Reserve if to the Federal Reserve if Fed Chair Powell is forced out in some way? There's a Deutsche Bank analyst who essentially says that we could see a drop of at least 3 to 4% in the trade-weighted dollar. This is George Saravellos of Deutsche Bank. Uh, there would be 30 to 40 basis points sell off in fixed income. He essentially argues that all this is underpriced.\n\nYeah. I mean, I think any economist you talk to, any investor who, who you talk to will say, \"Look, if, if Fed Chair Jerome Powell is pushed out or if there's any sort of inkling that the Fed is bowing to President Trump's pressure and any questions start to arise about whether the Fed is continuing its independence, like that is, that is not good for the economy. One, and then that is not good for sort of the buy America trade, right? We could see pressure on the dollar. We could see pressure on treasuries.\" And so to be clear, President Trump has continued to say that he's not going to, that he's not going to fire Chair Powell. But I think these sorts of questions again sort of raise, um, the stakes when it comes to what's going to happen with Chair Powell's replacement because any feeling that the Fed's independence is being compromised or that we have a person who's more likely to listen to Trump could be bad for sort of the by America trade.\n\nAmara Omeokwe, Bloomberg News Federal Reserve reporter joining us from Washington DC.

They're up right now 3.4%. It's a new all-time high for the company after they reported net sales for the second quarter that came in in line with estimates from analysts. Up 8.6%. 6% over the same period last year. This is a $52 billion market cap company. They distribute construction and industrial supplies. Think nuts, bolts, screws, anchors, rivets, and other fasteners, as well as industrial, janitorial, and safety supplies, cutting tools as well. The company sells to builders, manufacturers, governments, and more. So, really, it's a great read on the entire industrial and manufacturing economy, specifically here in the US. We've got with us the CEO of Fastenal, Daniel Florness. He joins us from Winona, Minnesota. Dan, welcome to Bloomberg Business Week Daily. Shares up today. Shares up more than 25% so far this year. New all-time high. In the earnings release though, you said that quote, \"The market conditions remain sluggish. What conditions specifically?\"\n\nYou know, we sell to a wide range of customers and industries as you, as you mentioned, AC across North America and and in 26 countries in total, but mostly in North America. Um, our customer base has been relatively subdued for the last several years. In the fall of 2022, we saw some indicators saying it was going to slide, and we felt that as we moved into the second and third quarters of 2023, and and it's been really weak since then. About 30% of our business is very production centered business within manufacturing.\n\nSo are there any signs that that part of the business is improving, that those customers are seeing sentiment improve? Are you hearing anything from them?\n\nI think the biggest sign that we're seeing is the the the knife has stopped dropping. You know, we were trying to catch that falling knife for a 2-year period. What, what, when I talk to our district and regional leadership throughout the, throughout the world. Um, the feedback I hear is, you know, they're not\n\n\nTalking about this $200,000 a month customer whose business is off 60 to 70%. Um, you have a much more stability. Now might be stable at a lower level than it would have been two years ago, but it's much more stable, and so it allows our inherent growth to shine through.\n\nSo we've really been in this prolonged downturn, especially in the industrial economy. Are you seeing any particular green shoots or signs of inflection? And if so, which markets are you most optimistic about?\n\nYeah. So, uh, we're seeing some green shoots for us. We're seeing some, we are seeing some impact in energy. Um, however, I would say that's probably more us taking market share than it is a lift in the tide.\n\nUm, about uh, 25% of our business is outside of the industrial, and within there, we're selling, we're doing quite well. I hear a lot of commentary from our folks with data center builds, with uh, you know, even warehousing customers, and, and we've made really good inroads over the last three years into the government sector, and that primarily was an offshoot of COVID. During COVID, when supply chains blew apart, we stepped in to serve a lot of that market when they were not being served, and those folks have remembered that, and we've grown our business there.\n\nSo, we need to, of course, talk about tariffs. How have tariffs really changed your thinking about product sourcing, particularly for fasteners, which we know, of course, are primarily sourced in China, Asia? What other options are you evaluating to mitigate the tariff impact here?\n\nYou know, so back in 2018, we, we did some short-term moves of our supply chain, but it was fairly limited because you just can't change. There's so much QC involved with vetting out cut suppliers that you couldn't move it fast enough. What we had done quietly over the last five, six years is continue in that progress because the tariffs that were put in place in 2018 were sticking, and we expected more of it to happen, and we wanted to better diversify the supply chain for our customer. We did look at a lot of options. There aren't a lot of options within North America. We looked at some options of doing some manufacturing ourselves. The problem is the economics still didn't work. So it was really for us more about diversifying supplier base in general.\n\nAre the economics of that going to work now in this new tariff regime? I think during the first Trump administration, the goal was to move things out of China. But as many companies are learning right now, it doesn't matter if it's China, Vietnam, or India. If it's not in the US, there is going to be a tariff on it. At least that's what it seems like is going to be the case.\n\nYeah. Um, the economics still do not work. And uh, and, and, and part of the challenge there isn't just the economics, it's the amount of time when we were researching it, um, very in depth, uh, two and a half years ago. One of the challenges is it's easy to find a site. It's relatively easy to get a building up and get a supply chain set up. When I say relatively easy, I mean time frame of what it takes to do it. The most challenging aspect was the equip, the production equipment of how many, how many months it would take to get that. And so that aspect really pushed us to look more at geographic dispersion of supply chain sourcing, uh, because, because the economics are still very challenging. So, how much of what you sell right now is actually made in the US?\n\nIf I look across, um, what we're sourcing, what our, our supp, our branded suppliers are sourcing, we've always estimated, um, less than 50% is coming from the US.\n\nAnd is that going to stay stable in this new tariff regime?\n\nI suspect it will.\n\nOkay. So, I know Fastenal raised prices back in April, especially as a result of tariffs. Historically, I mean, the company has been able to pass on pricing costs. What's really been the feedback here from customers? Has there been much push back in terms of the ability and appetite for customers, frankly, to take on additional pricing, especially as we head into the second half of the year?\n\nUh, first off, we sell into a very competitive market. Um, there is always push back. The, the, the real, the real challenge in the equation is communication. And one thing that helps in our supply chain, we're directly sourcing from the manufacturer that's producing the product more so than most of our competitors in the marketplace just because of our scale. And so we have the ability to, to see into the future farther than a lot of our competitors, and it puts us in a position to communicate very well. Um, it, it puts us in a position to take steps as the inventory is turning. Uh, unfort, the one unfortunate part of that, it also can create fatigue for your customer, and I would say our customer is at the fatigue point right now of where it, it has, it's become challenging, but it, it always is, and it's all about communication and trust. We're speaking with Fastenal CEO Daniel Florness. Company reported earnings earlier. Shares are higher, reached a new record today. Shares up right now by about 3.7%.\n\nI want to talk a little bit about the one big beautiful bill act that became law on the 4th of July this year. In the press release for your earnings, you did mention it, but big picture, what does it mean for your customers and for your business?\n\nYou know, big picture, what it means for our customers is if you look at some of the depreciation rules and the timing, it's, it, it makes it very advantageous to make capital investment. And so that's, that's the biggest piece that we see, uh, impacting our customers because our customers have, especially on the manufacturing side, an incredible amount of infrastructure that they're investing in. And so anything that allows them to depreciate faster and, uh, um, to improve their return profile, um, is advantageous for our marketplace. And that's a, that's a key element that we talked about in the release.\n\nI know that you talked a little bit about to us manufacturing your own products in the US and and your suppliers doing it, but I'm wondering about your customers and the way that these so-called America first policies might help them reshore manufacturing back to the US. Are you seeing any evidence or hearing discussion of your customers beginning to move manufacturing back to the US?\n\nYou know, um, I would say it's fairly limited, but again, that, that's not something that happens in six months that you set up. Um, we've had some customers set up uh, assembly operations, which you can do in a much shorter time frame as opposed to pure production where you're manufacturing components yourself or you're, you're changing your supply chain to more domestic uh, type supply. But uh, but uh,\n\nwhat we've seen is a lot more willingness of making investment even beyond the manufacturing capacity in the short term. Fastenal has refocused on growing with larger customers. What are the key drivers there and what additional investments do you need to make to enable growth with those customers?\n\nYeah. So, a position we've put ourselves in for a number of years is we, we, we have very aggressively made investments, and this was starting back 15 plus years ago of slowly building an infrastructure to, to move the supply chain closer and closer to the point of use. And what that involved for us is investing in a tremendous amount of vending infrastructure and in more recent years a lot more RFID type infrastructure to measure product movement within a facility so that you don't have to, to, um, with human capital, um, physically observe, um, product being diminished. You can monitor it electronically and remotely, and, and so we've made extremely large investments over the last 10 plus years in vending technology, and, and I'm pleased to say that vending technology is all manufactured, um, in the United States.\n\nYeah, I was surprised when I went to your website earlier today as I was preparing for this to see those, those vending machines. It's not something that I've run into in certainly in my life, but it's pretty cool to see that. Not just soda.\n\nIt's a snack machine.\n\nYes,\n\nthat's what I was, that's what I was thinking. It's like it's a snack machine, but you can't eat what's in there. So,\n\nexactly.\n\nOkay. Hey, um, we just got about a minute left, and I just want to talk numbers real quick. Gross profit up 45 to 45.3% up from 45.1% over the second quarter of last year. You said it was partially offset by higher import duty costs and higher fleet and transport costs. Are those costs in your view going to stabilize?\n\nThey, uh, they're going to continue to rise because, because of the way our supply chain works, we carry a fair amount of inventory because we have such dispersion in our locations. So, we carry quite a few months of inventory. So, that's going to keep ratcheting up as we're on a Fifel basis inventory. So, as that inventory continues to turn, that will continue to ratchet up a little bit as we move into the third and fourth quarters and into 2026. The uh, what, what really helped us during the quarter and what drove the in improvement our gross margin, set aside tariffs for a second. We put in place uh, a faster expansion starting last summer to to widen our inventory, and that's really what drove our margin this quarter.\n\nDaniel Florness, CEO of Fastenal, and really appreciate you joining us.
