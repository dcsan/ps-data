  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\nLet me tell you, we have a new star. A star is born. Elon pumped up on Mars juice and ketamine. He is the Thomas Edison plus++ of our age.\nProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy.\nI would say 98% really appreciate what he does. But those 2% that are nasty, they are out there in full force.\nWe were meant for great things in the United States of America. And Elon reminds us of that.\nI'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.\n[Music]\nWelcome to Elon, Inc. I'm Max Chaffkin and coming to you with a very special emergency podcast today on Wednesday, July 9th. It's about 1:00 and just a couple of hours ago we learned some shocking news. Linda Yaccarino, friend of the show and longtime CEO of X, company formerly known as Twitter, is out. She has left the company. And we wanted to talk about that because it's coming at a time of just incredible chaos within Elon Musk's empire with all that's going on. And I've got Sarah Frier, Bloomberg's big tech boss on the other line. Sarah, how are you doing?\nWell, another big news day here and you know what? It never stops. And and this morning I got a call from the Bloomberg Television producers. This is how I learned about this who who wanted to talk about they also sent me this tweet that Linda posted at 10:40 a.m. I'm just going to read a little bit from it. After two incredible years, I've decided to step down as CEO of X. When Elon Musk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew and it goes on and on. She's praising X. She's talking about how it's the everything app. Um, it feels like a pretty amicable breakup. Sarah, let's just start. What do you make of this? Do what do you think caused Linda to step down? Do we think she was pushed out? Do we think something else is going on?\nWell, I I mean, if you look at the at the situation she's in right now, um, when she took this job, you I wrote at the time, she's not really the boss. like she's the CEO, but Elon Musk holds the strings about how this company acts and her job is to bring advertisers back to the platform. She has this great background at NBC Universal, these really tight relationships with advertisers. Um, and if if X was committed to returning advertisers to the platform, she would be the person to do it. But then she's dealing with with her boss, you know, posting all these things that make advertisers concerned about whether their content is going to show up next to um anything that he says that's that's erratic or controversial. And so she's in this tough spot. And besides not actually being fully in charge as CEO, although she does run the day-to-day because Musk, you know, he got busy this year um and is busy in general. She does run the thing. But then you know earlier this year um there's this transaction whereby X gets acquired combined with XAI turns into this company called XAI Holdings and her future's a little unclear in that she's not even like you know in charge of that new group CEO of one of two companies that emerged clearly the more junior of the two companies you would so almost sort of expect that that person in a normal company which of course none of Elon Musk somebody's are, you'd almost expect that person might be headed for the exit at that point.\nAnd and you might imagine that she got some sort of financial benefit from that deal. You know, there there was some concern for the the debt holders for X that they wouldn't see a a return on that debt or or be able to offload it. That transaction was a way to um help out those those ex investors as the company is really struggling. I mean, this social network has not been able to bring advertisers back effectively. They're doing a little bit better this year. And then there there continues to be just tons of of crazy things that happen every day, including yesterday.\nYeah. To that point, yesterday, as we're recording this on Wednesday, there was news, and I guess this really started on Monday, but Grok, Sarah, Grok went Nazi again. There were there were like dozens maybe more hundreds I don't know posts where Grok was like talking about how great Hitler was and using these like kind of white nationalist um memes. It kind of hearkened back to the an earlier incident that we talked about on this podcast when um Grok started talking about white genocide quote unquote in South Africa. If your job is advertising right like there's one thing I know that advertisers are not crazy about and it's like Nazism. That's definitely one of one of the bright lines that they draw. So you could just imagine that that would have that I mean maybe that could have crossed a line or maybe\nEU is is not happy today. There are a lot of countries in Europe that are, you know, even talking about fines or bans for for X. Yeah, it's really crazy too that as that was happening with Grok. Grok, by the way, is is the chatbot that XAI makes. Um,\nright.\nAnd by the way, you can use X to post at the chatbot and the chatbot might reply to you. So, that's how all these people were seeing in public in real time the chatbot responding and and it's really a testament to how much chaos there's been on X that a lot of us didn't realize whether this was intentional or unintentional, right? And after this bubbled to the surface and became the subject of news stories about the anti-semitic content, X did take action and and work to remove the post. But there was really a question for a while like is this is this something that they intended um you know for the chatbot to just go all white nationalist. Um it was really crazy to see and the chatbot said and we don't know because the chatbot is an AI. It's not a human, but the chatbot said that it was updated manually last week by Elon um to have to have a little bit more of a based attitude, which I don't know if we should credit that. I think I believe also the chatbot at one point over in recent days was responding as Elon. I mean, again, these these chatbots are are prone to hallucinations and so on. So, take that with a grain of salt, Sarah.\nExtreme grain of salt.\nYeah, we will do this in a more full way. I think at some point on this podcast, especially once we get Kurt Wagner on the show. Kurt of course wrote a book all about Elon Musk takeover of Twitter. But but just quickly, I just want to talk about like why we were so fascinated by Linda because of course there are other CEOs in Elon Musk's orbit and I'm trying to think about why she was sort of this kind of funny, interesting, really impressive but also kind of comic figure within the orbit. I think it's because she was in the most extreme position where on one hand there is the craziness of Elon and all the edge lord stuff and his weird associations and the racism and on the other side are like the most square people in the world advertisers and Linda is the buffer because and there would be these amazing moments Sarah which I'm sure you remember where Elon would be doing something crazy Linda would go on Twitter and be like yay NFL or whatever just like something that just felt so far removed from what where the actual zeitgeist was and it was like just amazing to watch.\nYeah. I mean, it would be like something insane. The world was exploding and Linda would be like, \"I love shoes like JS Jets.\" you know, she'll just do like like enthusiastic posts that are brand safe. Almost has like the most extreme um caricature of like a counterbalance to Musk himself. Like she just really is like go team. We're changing the world. We're all about free speech. And in fact when um there was that first scuffle where um Musk remember he he endorsed that anti-semitic post in 2023 and then at that conference he told marketers who are boycotting X to go f themselves.\nYeah. Of course. Then Yaccarino tells staff that, you know, she's all about the free speech mission and the principles do not have a price tag, nor will they be compromised ever. You know, she just really is all in even when Musk goes to the extreme. So, I just want to note, you know, we said we talked about the craziness of Grok. We h we do know that Linda Yaccarino was considering her exit since before. Got it. yesterday's events from a source familiar. Um, so Got it.\nSo it it's it's not necessarily tied, but it does make the timing seem more like space saving.\nDo we have any sense of how long she's been considering um her exit?\nFor a while? It our source says uh her decision to resign was in the works well before the\nI guess we could take that a lot of different ways. So, another thing another thing to think about is, you know, we talked about her really strong relationships with advertisers. She was just at Can Lions in um in the south of France. That's the really big advertising conference. You you heard Kurt Wagner talk about that um Elon, Inc. recently where, you know, everyone comes together, touts their products, uh meets, has rosé on yachts, all of that. um she was there but she wasn't really much of a public presence. She was doing a lot of like private meetings and you can imagine in these private meetings her her buddies might be telling her hey look like Musk isn't even tight with Trump anymore like what are you still doing there?\nYeah. I mean for me like what Linda was trying to do and I I use the word impressive not you know seriously because I think especially early in her tenure she really did help navigate the company from chaos to something that actually started to feel like it hung together as a vision. You know it was it started to feel like okay this is like going to be a real conservative media platform. Linda of course had some connections to Trump world before coming into um into X. I believe she was on some kind of fitness panel or whatever. But in any case, like she strikes me as a a sort of mainstream conservative, not you know maybe a Fox News conservative, not necessarily a burn it all down America party conservative for those who have listened to yesterday's podcast with Nancy Cook. Um Sarah, before we wrap, I just want to talk to you quickly about kind of what this means for the future because at while this is going on, I believe tonight, it's Wednesday as we're recording this later today, um Elon is going to unveil Grok 4, this new version of his large language model, the large language model that XAI made. It is assumably trained on data from X. what really feels like here is a pivot away from advertising altogether and towards AI and I'm wondering to whether number one you buy that and number two do they have can that succeed even though um you know despite all of the the issues that we talked about the the fact that Grok still has a tendency to spout offensive stuff from time to time?\nWell I think you got to look at the financial picture advertising is a small business but it's a real source source of revenue for a company that is um that we've reported is burning through a billion dollars a month.\nYeah. Yeah. I believe our report said they were take they plan to take in 500 million in revenue. I assume that's AI revenue. Meanwhile, Twitter I mean our understanding is this is a couple of billion dollar business even in its very diminished form. Like the advertising business is still way bigger than the chatbot business.\nOh, it's way bigger but the chatbot business is going to drain through that in in weeks, right? like that this the the the cost of of a buildout of data centers. Um they're burning through a billion a month and they're planning to raise 9.3 billion in debt and equity. The financial picture is getting extremely complicated for this company. And and if you're Elon Musk, you see the world is full of endless money um because you can just get it from maybe even from one of your other companies.\nRight.\nRight. Right. Yeah. Well, that's and that's potentially where some of that revenue is coming from for sure.\nSo, I think it's it's just a complicated time if you're not trying to bring the X business back to health through advertising. Like now it's part of this XAI thing, which is like a much more complicated financial picture. Maybe maybe better upside, right? Because it's an AI business. Um, but it is one that is bleeding money like all of these AI companies are.\nAll right. Well, we'll have more to say about this in future episodes. Sarah, I feel like at some point we need to sit down and do like a retrospective. Like, I'm craving a montage of like the greatest Yaccarino tweets, the greatest sound bites. Like, there were so many great moments. And then we'll have to talk about the guy that many people think is going to run X. this uh the new the newly hired product uh manager or product head of product or something uh Nikita Beer. Uh so lots to discuss, but we'll have to save that for next week.\nI just want to ask you a question, Max. What do you think she does next?\nI mean, I feel like was it you or or our producer Magnus who suggested just before we got on that maybe she's getting a job inside the Trump administration, right? That that could be. Or or do you think that the um or do you think that the the bridges have been too far burned? like maybe maybe her association with Musk um even even with the exit means that like she's going to be frozen out of that world forever.\nI think she could easily find a role in the conservative political world.\nYeah, 100%. that new those new media that conservative new media space is booming and she really did I mean to her credit like she did hit that a little bit like that Tucker Carl like Tucker Carlson got tossed from Fox News and like you know obviously he's very controversial and and everything but like he gets a lot of viewers and some of that had to do with the ex partnership.\nSo we'll see. I mean, I I'm just kind of curious if she keeps posting through it, like if she even continues being just this bubbly personality on X. Um, it's where it happens, Sarah. It's where it happens. And let's leave it. All right,\nSarah Frier, thanks for being here. Uh, see you soon.\nThank you, Max.\nThis episode was produced, created, conceived, dreamed up, and tweeted by Magnus Hendrickson, our supervising producer. Big thanks to Sarah Frier.\nSage Bowman is the head of Bloomberg Podcasts. and we will see you next week. Unless something big happens, in which case we'll be right here in your feed.\n[Music]\n",
