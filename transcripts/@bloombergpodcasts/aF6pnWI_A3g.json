  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\nWe begin this hour in Washington.\nPresident Trump leaving the door open for trade talks and piling on the pressure for the Fed to cut interest rates.\nWe're still willing to talk.\nLiterally, every country wants to make a deal.\nWe have no inflation.\nOur stock market hit record highs.\nWith no inflation, we should be at 1%.\nThanks as well to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who's doing a fantastic job.\nHe goes on television and he calms the market.\nI go on television, I rile the market.\nIt's time for some calm.\nJoining us now the 79th Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent.\nMr. Secretary, welcome to the program, sir.\nLet's pick up on that theme.\nNot you calm in the markets, but on inflation and where rates should be.\nAs Annmarie Hordern pointed out, we've had a string of softer than expected inflation reads in this country.\nWe've had four.\nWe might get five at 8:30 Eastern time.\nWhy do you believe that's signal and not noise?\nWell, I mean there there's some persistence there, Jonathan.\nAnd look, I I do have access to the the number of the night before, but when I'm coming on TV, I don't look at it.\nSo, I don't know what the number is going to be at 8:30.\nAnd I I wouldn't, you know, I I don't know whether it's going to be down, up, or flat, but I wouldn't put too much emphasis on one number.\nI I think it's the trend.\nAnd I think one thing that Wall Street, a lot of economists, market in general got wrong early on was that tariffs were going to cause a substantial price level rise, which just hasn't happened.\nAnd there are some people on the FOMC, the Federal Reserve, still worried about the prospect of that happening through the summer.\nWe've all sensed the frustration from the White House across the administration with Fed Chair Jay Powell.\nAnd a lot of confusion, I think, at this point that maybe we can address in this conversation.\nIs firing the Federal Reserve chair under active consideration in the White House, in the Treasury, in your administration?\nUh, President Trump said numerous times he's not going to fire J. Pal.\nYou know, he's working the refs.\nAnd you know, I I've said before, I'm a basketball fan.\nThere are two schools of working the refs.\nThere's the Bobby Knight school and there's the the Dean Smith school.\nPresident Trump uh seems to prefer the Bobby Knight school.\nAnd I'll tell you, I went back over the weekend and looked and Bobby Knight won three NCAA championships.\nMy hero Dean Smith only won two.\nThe NEC director, Kevin Hasset, I'm not sure what you'd call him, but he was asked over the weekend, can the Fed chair be fired?\nHe said that's a thing that's being looked into.\nHow should we understand those comments?\nUh, look, I I u and I will point out Kevin was a collegiate basketball player.\nUh, and I I I think as President Trump said, he he's not looking to fire uh Chair Powell.\nAnd as I've said, I'm not going to comment on future policy or future mistakes the Fed will make.\nI'll only comment on past mistakes.\nAnd look, they they've had some big forecasting errors, and this may be one.\nNow, is there a reason for not firing Kim?\nAnd I asked that question because the president's also said that his term is about to expire in May of next year.\nIs that the reason to ultimately just wait, or is it something else?\nAre you convinced by the negative consequences associated with such a move?\nLook, I I I think a an independent central bank is very important for the conduct of monetary policy and we we can see that in in terms of the both the financial markets, the term premium and longerterm debt.\nYou said previously the interview process would begin later on in the fall.\nThere's been plenty of speculation as to whether that process would be brought forward.\nMr. Secretary, do you still, as far as you understand, believe that's when the interview process to replace the Fed chair will begin in the fall, or is a formal process already started?\nWell, look, there there's a formal process that's already starting.\nThere there are a lot of great candidates, and you know, we we'll see how rapidly it progresses.\nIt's President Trump's decision and it it will move at his speed.\nDo you see any merit at all in selecting maybe a candidate that's already on the committee on the FOMC versus taking a look at someone outside of the Federal Reserve?\nAgain, there are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.\nJonathan, has the chairman himself, the Fed chair Jay Pal given you any indication whatsoever as to what he would do once his term has expired?\nWill he vacate his seat as the governor at the Federal Reserve?\nWell, traditionally, uh, the the Fed chair also steps down as a governor, and there's been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance uh, of his or her nomination, and I can tell you, I think it'd be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on.\nAlso, Mr. Treasury Secretary, I'd love to talk to you about what's going on in Invidia this morning.\nJensen Wang, the CEO, out in a blog statement saying that the company has quote provided an update to customers, noting that Nvidia is filing applications to sell the H20 GPU again.\nThe US government has assured the company that licenses will be granted and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.\nCan you attest whether that that's true or not?\nThe United States is willing to let Nvidia sell H20s once again in China?\nWell, again, Annmarie, I think that'd be a judgment that the Chinese indigenous uh manufacturers namely uh Huawei and some others already have an equivalent chip.\nSo, you know, if there's an equivalent chip, then the Nvidia H20 could be sold cuz I I can tell you uh the one thing that we do not want is a digital uh belt and road uh springing up around the world because other countries or China are substituting for our American chip manufacturers.\nThis is the same chip though that the Trump administration blocked with export controls in April.\nSo why the change in policy now?\nUh Annmarie, you you might say that that was a negotiating uh chip that we used in Geneva and in London.\nSo this was part of the trade talks when it comes to Washington and Beijing.\nYes.\nWas it a quid pro quo then?\nAs you said it wasn't, but was it potentially to make sure that you can get the licenses when it comes to rare earths?\nUh, yeah, I think it it was all part of a mosaic.\nUh, they had things we wanted, we had things they wanted, and you know, we're in a very good place.\nI expect to meet my Chinese counterpart, the vice premiere, in the next few weeks.\nSo, when and where will that meeting take place?\nWe're we're still working on that.\nThe Chinese leadership has a big conclave at the beginning of August.\nSo, we're trying to work out whether that could be in a third country before or after that conclave.\nWill the administration release the framework of the Geneva and London talks?\nWell, we we have released some of it and you I'll I'll tell you that now having settled on tariffs on the export controls we can move on to the next stage of talks and I think it's very important both for the global economy for the US economy and for the Chinese economy for uh us to move on and talk about China uh opening its markets and the increase domestic and consumer production there.\nAre you hoping to get to that next phase before August 12th when that's currently the day taunt between these two economies?\nYeah, I look I I think we're in a very good place and I I tell market participants not to worry about August 12th.\nShould they worry about what's happening with Europe with respect to the 30% tariff rate?\nThey don't seem to be worrying, but I'm just curious whether that's the final rate or whether the letter was part of a negotiation that Europe received from President Trump.\nUh well, Lisa, you know what I what I would say is uh President Trump's able to create a lot of leverage here, a lot of leverage because he he's indifferent.\nHe's indifferent whether we take in the 30% rate or whether the Europeans come to us with a much better deal.\nAs I've been saying for a while that if countries or trading blocks don't come with their best deals, then the rates could boomerang back.\nSo, uh, President Trump's leading this.\nAnd what I what I will tell you is that a lot of the deals, and this this is where he his leadership's been invaluable, a lot of the deals that I thought were excellent deals keep getting improved upon every time he takes up the maximum pressure strategy.\nThere is a theory in markets and you don't even have to calm them.\nThey're pretty calm.\nThey're watching all of these rates and they're not freaking out in parlance uh on Wall Street.\nThey're taking this in stride.\nWe're close to all-time highs if not at all-time highs.\nDo you see this is giving a green light to Trump to President Trump to keep going to take hardline approaches and to keep trying to get better and better deals?\nLook, I I I think this this narrative of this obsessive focus on the market isn't right.\nPresident Trump views this as a generational opportunity to reset trade in a fair and sound manner for the American people.\nSo the the idea that some some market ups or downs are are going to be the deciding factor here.\nWhat we uh are concerned about and President Trump is laser focused on is getting the best deals because uh we were not having fair trade and now we're we're seeing with these countries coming to the table the the quality of the deals gets better and better.\nSo we're not going to rush just because of some market deadline.\nNow I think what the market's saying is market's willing to look forward three, six, 12 months and this is going to be good for the US.\nIt's going to be good for the global economy.\nIf you do get some sort of signal from the market though that this isn't going to be good for the US economy.\nIs there a trigger point?\nIs there sort of a sense at which it it acts as a gut check and sort of pulls back some of the negotiating tactics?\nLook, I I I think that the market understands what we're doing.\nSometimes individual market people don't.\nSometimes the television personalities don't.\nBut you know, good good thing about President Trump is he always tells you what he wants and what he wants is fair trade here.\nI won't take that as a slight on me and my colleagues around the table, Mr. Treasury Secretary, but you did tell me on April 2nd on Liberation Day that this was the ceiling when it comes to those rates.\nBut since then, we have actually had some tariff rates.\nThe president announced in letters higher than those rates he announced on that big chart on April 2nd.\nSo is there no longer a ceiling when it comes to tariff rates when you are dealing with trading partners?\nUh I I think that uh I I said if they if they come and they negotiate in good faith then those are ceilings and uh some some of the talks got off to a very slow start.\nSo who's negotiating good faith at this moment?\nWho's not?\nAgain I congratulated the UK the other day as I told many of our trading partners and Annmarie I may have said on that day or a few days after April 2nd I'd advise countries to move quickly because with President Trump the first deals are usually the best deals and and the UK came in early they got a great deal and everybody else is kind of dragging right now.\nWell, when it comes to uh Japan, you're headed there at the end of this week.\nDo you expect to come back with a deal?\nUh I'm going to Japan to represent uh the United States government and the American people at the international expo, which we used to know as the World's Fair.\nSo, this coming Saturday is going to be America's Day, and I'll be taking a delegation includes the labor secretary, deputy secretary of state, will be representing the US.\nSo th this is a celebration of the US more than trade talks.\nMr. Secretary, before you go, just a final question.\nI'm embarrassed to say that my knowledge of college basketball is nothing like yours, but I can tell you back in the '90s in English football, there used to be a concept of player managers.\nThere used to be certain managers of football teams that also put themselves on the field and they play too.\nEffectively, they had two jobs.\nAnd I'm wondering from your perspective whether that's something you'd be interested in.\nWe've seen that throughout the administration.\nIs that something you think that you could pursue?\nBoth the Treasury Secretary and the Fed chair.\nUh, look, I I I think I have the best job in town.\nUh, I will do what President Trump wants.\nWe got a lot of great Fed candidates and um, you know, I I'm confident it's going to be a robust process.\nJonathan, has he asked you?\nWhat's that?\nHas he asked you?\nAre you part of the process?\nUh, I I am part of the decision-making process, but again, it's the fin final decision is going to be President Trump's.\nMr. Secretary, appreciate your time.\nThank you.\nThe Treasury Secretary there, Scott Bessent, on a range of issues, including trade and the future of this Federal Reserve.\n",
