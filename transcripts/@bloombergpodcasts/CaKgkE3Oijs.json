  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts,\nradio, news.\nWelcome to the Daybreak Asia podcast.\nI'm Doug Krer.\nWe begin with a story dominating much of the news cycle, tariffs.\nToday, President Donald Trump seemed to be sending mixed signals when it comes to levies on European goods.\nHe said there's still room for trade talks with the EU.\nBut Trump also insisted the letters he recently sent outlining new tariff rates are final.\nWell, markets seem to look past the rhetoric, US equities pushed higher.\nAnd in a moment, we'll look at the tariff story from the Asian perspective and part of our conversation with the CEO of Mizuho, Masahiro Kihara, but we begin here in the States.\nJoining me now is Carol Schleif.\nShe is the Chief Market Strategist at BMO Private Wealth.\nCarol is on the line from Chicago.\nGood of you to make time to chat with me.\nCan we look ahead to the earnings that we're expecting this week from the big banks?\nI'm curious as to what you're expecting.\nExpecting good earnings because you actually saw it in the first quarter already.\nYou saw trading volumes doing very well.\nYou've seen M&A pick up.\nWe'll be listening closely too for the commentary around the health of the consumer and I think there'll be a lot of great data coming out this week and having the banks kick things off will be really interesting to watch that.\nBut you've also got loosened capital requirements.\nSo you've basically got a lot of money burning holes in big bank pockets and I'll want to listen to and see how they're intending to use that.\nWhat about the trading revenue side of the equation given a lot of the market volatility that we had in Q2?\nI would imagine that some of these results will be pretty robust.\nYeah, I would think that because we saw surprises already in the first quarter and that was before the April 2nd and all of the subsequent trading.\nAnd when you think through, if you remember back to that time, there was one point in time where we went down 5% to up 5% all based on rumor and take away the rumor all in the same day.\nAnd that trading revenue will all come into this quarter.\nSo I mentioned the tariff story a moment ago.\nTomorrow we get CPI here in the US and the big question is whether or not we're going to begin to see evidence that companies are passing along those higher cost of imported goods merchandise associated with the tariffs.\nWould that be your expectation?\nI would think we're going to see it more in the PPI than the CPI at this point.\nAnd we might be a quarter or two or not necessarily a quarter or two, we might be a month or two away from seeing it creep through into the CPI because you've got in a big way because you've had a lot of companies do they brought it over, they hoarded it, they've absorbed it pretty well, but that's wearing pretty thin.\nAnd so as opposed to looking to the aggregate numbers for it, I think we'll be looking over the next couple weeks and listening really closely to what the companies are all saying, particularly the consumer goods companies and how they're able to either absorb it or pass it on.\nThere was some new research today coming out of 22V research about what investor expectations are for the average effective tariff rate when the dust settles.\nThat number is 17%.\nThat seems pretty high.\nWould that cause you to kind of take a closer look at a lot of the holdings that you have on the equity side?\nNot necessarily a closer look, but we think it's pretty absorbable and markets may not be quite that high.\nThey might be more like 12 or 13%.\nBut, you know, it's just it's important that we don't lose sight because I know the administration is very positive about look at all the tariff revenues that are coming in and it's important we not lose sight that those tariff revenues are coming out of either consumer or business pockets in the United States and sooner or later that's going to wear away at the margins even if it's in slightly slower growth or or moderately slower growth.\nI think the issue would be the market is not prepared for broader sectoral tariffs and we have a shot at getting some of those.\nI think maybe there's partial expectation too that the longer we push out these full country tariffs, the likelier we are to see some sort of legal overturning because the testimony in those in that case starts in I think it's July 31st.\nSo, I'm wondering whether the uncertainty around tariffs and the impact in terms of the inflationary impact or the inflationary pressure that these tariffs may create really keeps the Fed on the sidelines for perhaps longer than a period that would take us through September.\nOur expectation is still in September and you may see enough continued wear and tear on the economy by then that the Fed feels compelled to go ahead and move because they're not necessarily going to wait for hard data to come through.\nAnd by the time we get to September, you will have you'll have a couple more CPI prints, a couple more PPI prints, you'll have some data for the Fed to start looking at.\nAnd we do think you'll see a continued deceleration, if you will.\nWe're not looking, we don't think it's recessionary, but we do think that you're impacting the strong growth we came into January with.\nI want to focus a little bit, if we can, on one industry in particular, artificial intelligence.\nToday, Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta is going to be building massive data centers to power AI.\nElon Musk saying that Tesla shareholders will be voting soon on whether to invest in Musk's startup XAI.\nAnd tomorrow in Pennsylvania, President Trump will be announcing a $70 billion investment package that will focus not only on AI but energy generation as well.\nAre you still playing this?\nAnd if so, how is that unfolding in your portfolio?\nI think it's hard not to play it, if you will, in terms of I mean just owning a plain old index fund and any of the technology names and you're you're at least market weighted if not overweighted in in that play.\nAnd yeah, we do think the combination of that and some of the more progrowth, pro businessfriendly aspects of the one big beautiful bill that was passed last week or the week before, those things do put some nice support underneath.\nSo that's one of the reasons why we're not out there with a massive recessionary fall.\nAnd that could help surprise relative to employment, too, because you've got tighter labor markets in there.\nAnd if you get some support where companies are hiring again, because they need to hire for construction workers.\nThey're going to need to pay those workers a little more than they historically have, if you will.\nWe're going to put up those data centers, leverage AI across a variety of industries, and we don't think it's close to the final innings.\nIt's definitely in the early innings still in terms of the build out there in much the same way as you're probably in the mid 90s, not the late 90s when we were building out the infrastructure for the internet to begin with.\nThe other thing that's happened under the Trump administration is this embracing of cryptocurrencies.\nHouse Republicans have declared this week as crypto week.\nWe've got three bills on the agenda on the House side.\nMaybe a regulatory framework begins to emerge and maybe some institutional investor appetite begins to occur around crypto.\nAnd as I'm speaking to you, Carol, Bitcoin is above 120,000, which is hard to believe because when President Trump was elected to his second term, I think Bitcoin was under 70,000.\nSo, this has been a pretty phenomenal run and I'm curious as to how you're feeling about it.\nIt's interesting.\nIt's something we've watched.\nIt still feels like it's in the speculative zone pieces of it, but build again building out the infrastructure of it, watching it play, having a regulatory framework of it will help.\nAnd I think we need to pick a handful of industries that we want to make sure we stay at the forefront of.\nAnd you know trying to bring some battery technology back whether it's restarting some of the nuclear energy because it's one thing all of this stuff is going to take energy on the grid and we're not going to get there just by pumping oil and drilling coal.\nOkay, Carol, we'll leave it there.\nThank you so very much.\nCarol Schleif, she is the Chief Market Strategist at BMO Private Wealth joining us here on the Daybreak Asia podcast.\n[Music]\nWelcome back to the Daybreak Asia podcast.\nI'm Doug Krner.\nThe CEO of Japan's third largest bank says the US will continue to be an important trading partner for Japan even with tariff uncertainty.\nStill, Mizuho CEO Masahiro Kihara says Japan will need to diversify away from its second biggest trading partner.\nKihara spoke with Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua in London.\nHere is part of their conversation.\nMr. Kihara, thank you so much for speaking to us here at Bloomberg.\nNow, how confident are you about reaching the ¥1 trillion profit within a few years given all of the global uncertainty and given what we heard on tariffs and trade?\nThank you very much for having me.\nUh, in fact, I think from current earning profile, I think we have almost reached ¥1 trillion actually.\nUh, we had 800 last year, we had 880 billion.\nUh, we took one-time losses around somewhere around 120 billion actually, so I think in reality we reached one trillion thanks for all the you know circumstances.\nBut what does the uncertainty do the uncertainty surrounding some of the Trump policies and trade and tariffs?\nYes, yes.\nSo before April 2nd, we were aiming somewhere around ¥1.1 trillion for this year actually.\nHowever, because of all the uncertainties, we uh sort of shrink it down from as a conservative base to uh 950 trillion, uh I'm sorry, 950 billion again.\nBut I think you know when things get certain the corporate action will come back which means that we can ratchet up a little bit.\nYeah.\nOr guidance.\nSo where are you seeing that uncertainty play into right now?\nIs it loans?\nIs it chief executives not spending, not deploying cash?\nYes.\nRight now the CEOs are very, very on the sidelines actually, but uh but for example if it is a domestic deal even in each region if it is a domestic deal things are happening which means that we don't see a lot of crosswater happening right now.\nAll of them are we have a big chunk of pipeline but they they're not executed but from a domestically perspective people are moving a little bit.\nSo I think you know there is a good chance that people will get confident at some point.\nYou've also built up a US investment bank basically franchise.\nHow's that going?\nSo we starting from building the capital markets by oursel we went to equity capital markets.\nM&A was missing for us but we purchased Green Hill and I think at this moment we have the necessary pieces on the ground actually.\nSo I'm very very looking forward to see the synergies between our former Mizuho platform and the Green Hill platform to materialize actually.\nBut do you plan to take the model of the successful investment bank that you built and actually apply it elsewhere including in Asia?\nYes.\nSo we would like to uh sort of use our US capabilities transplanted to Europe, Asia and so that the re also even in Japan so that there will be cross regional collaboration between regions and so that and that I think that will bring our next growth actually.\nHow much of your growth will be organic and how much will be through mergers and acquisitions?\nFrom now on, I think we did the Green Hill deal.\nIt's very important that we make sure that the synergies will be built out and and and for us the next growth will basically be organic.\nOkay.\nBecause you've said in the past that you weren't used to or you didn't want to for example interested in buying some you know traditional commercial banks with a physical branch network.\nSo that's still the case.\nThat's still the case.\nBut how do you see Mizuho changing actually in the next four to five years?\nYeah.\nSo I I mean there are a couple of areas that should be interesting for us.\nUh just as I said investment banking regional collaboration that will bring a lot of synergies inside our institution also as as you may know asset management wealth management is growing in Japan and this will be another area and also one of one more area that will be very interesting will be Japanese midcaps actually.\nOkay.\nSo the midcaps are keen to grow or if they cannot grow they they might delist.\nAnd these there are couple many corporate actions happening in that space.\nSo I think this will be another interesting area for us.\nIs competition very fierce in wealth management?\nYes.\nUh it is very a high competitive but but I think the thing is is that the overall market is growing and that is beneficial for all of the banks I think.\nYeah.\nAnd on the midcap is there something specific?\nWill it be basically lending that they need or all services as they grow?\nThere will be advisories.\nYeah.\nAnd also lending.\nSo both.\nHow do you see the you know Japanese landscape for businesses changing?\nHow much will they look?\nI mean Japan has been a great experiment right in terms of financials for a long time.\nYes.\nIs it companies that will then grow also abroad as the economy stabilizes?\nI would say that if right now there's many uncertainties but I think as things get clearer the corporate action will come back.\nUh these couple of years we have seen many corporate actions happening investing outside Japan, you know changing their business portfolio risk, selling parts of the business that they are not doing well so concentrating the areas that have strength banks.\nSo I I would say that once things get clear corporate action will come back and many you know Japanese corporates will try to invest in outside of Japan too.\nAre you confident in the Japanese economy overall?\nOverall I think we still have strengths in the economy sectors that we have.\nSo I think overall we are very I am very confident in that.\nUh the thing is that we we have to concentrate our resources in the area that we have strength.\nUh we have high quality manufacturing, uh high quality you know products.\nUh so I think we need to figure out where the strengths are and try to sell it to the world.\nDo you worry or are there dangers actually to Japan given the spike in long-term interest rates?\nYes.\nSo 20 years, so for the long end, I suppose 20 years, 30 years, there has been spike and there has been volatility but I think the government said that they will try to shift the issuance to a 10 years or below.\nI think the BOJ is a little bit shrinking it QT.\nI think that will help.\nBut is there a point\n\n\nWhere it actually starts hurting your business and starts hurting the real economy?\n\nWell, I think uh, BOJ is saying that the neutral rate is somewhere around 1%, to 1.5%. And on top of that, uh, 10 years will be somewhere around 2% to 2.25%. Then I think that that's the level that is uh, okay. But if it goes beyond to 3% or so, that will then hurt the budget, I think.\n\nAre you expecting more turmoil in, you know, in yen, but also not in the bond market?\n\nNot at this moment, actually. I think the current level of 1.4 before 1.5 for 10 years is very uh, it's okay, I think uh, you know, and we have, I, I, I haven't seen any turmoil in the 10 years zone, so as long as the 10 year is fine, I think it's fine.\n\nThat is Masahiro Kihara, the CEO of Mizuho, speaking with Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua here on the Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia Edition podcast.\n\n[Music]\n\nThanks for listening to today's episode of the Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia Edition podcast.
