Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nListen on demand wherever you get your podcasts or watch us live on YouTube.\nHope you had a great weekend and welcome indeed to the Monday edition and more specifically the early edition of Balance of Power here on Bloomberg radio, satellite radio channel 121, Bloomberg Originals, and YouTube.\nSearch Bloomberg Business News Live to find us on YouTube.\nWe keep the stream up all day for our programming from Washington to New York and back again with the president not wasting time in making some news today.\nAnd I'll let you know lawmakers are coming back to town.\nThere's going to be a lot of talk about sanctions on Capitol Hill as well as recisions, and we'll get to all of that in a moment with Laura Davidson.\nToday it's about Ukraine, and the president told you this was coming, right?\nWe sat here Friday knowing that the president was planning a major announcement as it was termed on Monday.\nThere were great questions about this, what this might include, and whether it would be offensive weapons.\nThe answer is kind of yes.\nThe news here really is more not just American weapons reaching Ukraine, but the fact that NATO is going to pay for them.\nThis answers the question we were asking about whether there'd be a major emergency supplemental request coming from this administration.\nSomething we couldn't imagine, right?\nThe idea of spending more money on Ukraine would go against the grain for this president.\nBut he's clearly upset with Vladimir Putin, and he's found a new way to get American weapons in the hands of Vladimir Zilinski.\nPresident Donald Trump from the Oval Office a short time ago sitting next to the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nBut we're very, very unhappy with him, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days.\nTariffs at about 100%.\nI'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there.\nSo based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days.\nIt's very simple, and they'll be at 100%.\nAnd that's the way it is.\nIs there more gold in there than there was on Friday?\nAre you seeing this on YouTube?\nThe gilding never stops in the Trump White House.\nThat was that big gold eagle there on Friday.\nLaura Davidson is our deputy bureau chief here at Bloomberg in Washington DC and is of course helping to man all of our coverage here from the White House to the Capitol and back.\nAnd she's with us right now.\nGreat to see you.\nThey're adding to the gold as we go here.\nAre they not?\nThere was a certain glow in that clip in particular.\nMy God, that was, it was like Liberace's office.\nUm, he did, by the way, mention the Resolute Desk, which I guess has been cleaned up and returned.\nI've been waiting for the update on this.\nRemember when Elon Musk's son X drooled or something on the, they brought the desk out of the oval.\nThey were going to have it refinished, and I never heard that it came back.\nAnd this is clear.\nYou know, even at the cabinet meeting on Friday, Trump was talking about the decor.\nHe's been spending a certain amount of time picking, uh, picking different frames, picking different clocks, including stealing some apparently from, from, uh, the State Department from Marco Rubio.\nThis is of course not why you're here.\nUm, we're talking about Ukraine, and this is really interesting watching the evolution here when it comes to President Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and this war because it was just weeks ago he was talking about his great relationship with Putin.\nIt was weeks before that he was yelling at Vladimir Zalinsky in the Oval, and it was weeks before that he predicted that he could finish this war on day one.\nWhat does he think at this point?\nThis is a total reversal.\nAnd even go back, you know, even further a year ago he was talking about abandoning NATO partners that really caused a stir on the campaign trail.\nNow you have a meeting in the Oval, a very, uh, cordial meeting with the secretary general of NATO.\nUm, you know, he, you know, he even mentioned that he's really be, uh, become very friendly with this organization, especially at the NATO meeting a couple weeks ago.\nUm, you know, part of this is that Mark Rud has been very strategic in how he's courted this relationship with President Donald Trump, and he's arranged this deal, uh, that that Trump very much likes, that that the US won't be giving weapons, that they're going to be purchased through NATO and then given to Ukraine.\nUm, this is very much the way he has always wanted to structure these deals going back to day one, um, of his terms.\nHe didn't want some sort of aid, he wanted some sort of financial deal.\nRemember there was the, the, uh, rare earths deal that he was trying to cut, and this is, uh, you know, very much kind of where he sees, um, kind of the role he wants to play of making these financial deals, these business deals versus sort of a diplom diplomatic solution.\nIt's like the military version of, \"We're going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it,\" right?\nHe gets to do something that is maybe controversial, giving weapons to Ukraine, at least with his own base, but as long as we're not paying for it, we somehow don't have our fingerprints on it.\nIs that the idea?\nYes, and it's also makes it, um, an easier sell for Trump because he doesn't have to go to Congress and get them to approve additional money.\nUm, you know, it's not clear if Congress is going to approve this Russia sanctions package that has been, uh, debated for several weeks.\nYou know, these at one various versions of this bill have, you know, sanctions of 500%.\nThose are, those are massive.\nUh, you know, Lindsey Graham has been talking about scaling that back.\nBut the bill right now has pretty significant support, and it's possible, as Trump mentioned in the Oval Office earlier, that it could pass, you know, in the coming weeks, even with the help of Democrats.\nIt's interesting.\nI'm glad you mentioned that in that, uh, that sound cut we just heard of the president.\nHe's talking about tariffs.\nIs 100% tariffs?\nHe means sanctions.\nThat's what this bill is.\nYes, this is, um, and Trump seems to really be talking about two things.\nOne, perhaps some sanctions that he would impose unilaterally in addition to whatever Congress decides to do.\nSo, he's talking about these 100% secondary tariffs, which we understand to be sanctions.\nThese would be essentially levies on, um, trading partners that buy Russian goods.\nSo, especially Russian oil.\nSo, this would be hitting other countries essentially trying to further isolate Russia and further dampen any, uh, demand for their goods.\nWe've got a great conversation coming up, uh, a little bit later in the hour with Max Bergman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who's looking at what the effect would be here.\nAnd if you're a country like India, that could be a real problem if that's passed, right?\nYes, there's especially if it's, you know, 100% or even, you know, forget 500%.\nThose are, you know, uh, tariff levels that just completely cut off or sanction levels that cut off trade entirely.\nSo, we're speaking about tariffs, and the president actually made news about tariffs over the weekend.\nHe was asked about this, and I'm not sure it's even top of mind with the Ukraine stuff here, but he threatened another 30% on Mexico.\nUh, USMCA excluded.\nWe spoke to Peter Navaro here on Friday talking about Canada, 35% that also is USMCA goods excluded.\nSo these aren't terribly meaningful at the moment, are they?\nDoesn't that cover the vast amount of imports from both countries?\nThat really does.\nSo that really lessens the scope there.\nAnd of course, you know, the Canada and Mexico are the US's largest trading partners, though.\nNot far down the line is the EU, which has a 30% tariff rate, much to the surprise.\nSo that's the real news this weekend, right?\nKeep going.\nYeah, that, and that really came as a surprise because the US has been in talks with the EU for weeks, if not months, about cutting a deal.\nUh, the EU leaders at one point thought they were going to be able to keep that tariff level at 10%.\nWhich while, you know, wasn't their preferred outcome would be, uh, you know, a level that could support much of the trade that is ongoing.\nBut at 30%.\nYou have a lot of companies in the EU saying, \"Look, this just doesn't, the math of these, uh, trade deals don't make sense anymore, and we're going to have to suddenly find other countries to export our goods.\"\nWow.\nThe idea not to retaliate is pretty interesting here as well.\nIs this, \"Don't poke the bear,\" or just give us time to cut deals with other countries?\nI think the next three weeks will really be a key sign here.\nYou know, do they get to August 1, and are they able to either, you know, stave off, uh, that implementation, push it back a couple weeks, get a lower deal, or, you know, is it August 1, and suddenly 30%, that's when you could really see countries start banding together, putting on some of these retaliatory tariffs and sort of daring Trump to, uh, you know, back down.\nYour calendar must look like a riot.\nSo, we've got, what is it now?\nAugust 1 is the next deadline for reciprocal tariffs.\nWe just dropped a 50-day waiting period on Russia sanctions, he said.\nI don't know why 50.\nWe seem to be in two-week increments.\nAnd didn't we already have something else we were waiting two weeks on here?\nWhat, what else is, what's the other deadline on your calendar right now?\nWe've got a lot of different things percolating between all the copper tariffs and all these sectoral tariffs.\nThose are all, all due at various points in the fall.\nUm, one nice thing about that 50-day, uh, deadline for the Ukraine territory is that gets us past Labor Day, so people can enjoy their Labor Day vacations and then come back, uh, to Washington and deal with the next, uh, turn of the screw.\nSo, all right.\nI, I waited till the end to ask you this.\nI don't want to put you in an awkward situation, but I have to ask you about this Jeffrey Epstein story.\nThe president talked about it last week.\nHe called out the reporter for asking about it.\nYou've got the deputy director of the FBI not showing up for work now, calling out the attorney general.\nUm, is this real?\nThis MAGA split, does it spill over into anything policy related that a Bloomberg audience should care about, or is this a tabloid story?\nThis certainly could mean, uh, you know, shakeups at the FBI and the Justice Department at the highest levels if you know some of, uh, what we're seeing comes to fruition.\nAnd this is really sort of a cautionary tale of when you make promises, when you are not in government to then you are suddenly in control of things, you control all the levers of power.\nUh, if you get your side really amped up that something's happening, you have to be able to then, uh, you know, show something on the back end.\nSo this is really, uh, sort of the insider outsider, uh, dichotomy of, you know, all these people from the outside were railing against government are now in key positions and you have to deliver.\nThere's a lot of tape on Cash Patel, Bonino, JD Vance talking about this list and how they're going to expose it, and those things don't go away automatically.\nI'll be very curious to see how they manage to do this.\nUh, CC, I think you might be on to something there.\nLaura, it's great to have you back.\nLaura Davidson helps to run our coverage here in Washington, our deputy bureau chief at Bloomberg.\nAnd always great to spend some time when we can pull her away from the desk.\nProducer James is back today.\nDid I tell you that America's producer is back with us?\nAnd we'll have much more straight ahead as we consider the impact of these Russia sanctions if they were in fact implemented.\nNot just sanctions, but secondary sanctions that could ricochet around the world.\nOur conversation ahead with Max Bergen at CSIS coming up on Bloomberg.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Balance of Power podcast.\nCatch us live weekdays at noon and 5:00 p.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nYou can also listen live on Amazon Alexa from our flagship New York station.\nJust say, \"Alexa, play Bloomberg 11:30.\"\nWith big thanks to CC Cherind, Justin Miller, and Elizabeth Sedan for helping us out last week while producer James was off golfing.\nHe's back with us today here in the nation's capital, and we were raring to go with news coming from the White House.\nWe started early today, Secretary General at NATO in the Oval Office.\nPresident Trump talking about Ukraine as promised.\nThis is going to carry us largely through the day here in the news flow as lawmakers in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and John Thun for that matter, craft a sanctions package against Russia.\nThe president's tapping the brakes on this.\nHe says 50 days, give Vladimir Putin 50 days to cut a deal, and then we'll talk about sanctions.\nThat of course has been on the table for weeks now.\nThe president even altering the language in that sanctions legislation before it ever sees the light of day.\nBut it looks like the news today is about weapons specifically.\nThat's why the NATO boss was in the Oval Office.\nMark Ruda sitting next to Donald Trump as he announced this plan.\nSomething we touched on last week.\nIf you listen to this program, you might have seen this coming.\nA deal in which American weapons get to Ukraine, but we don't go to Capitol Hill and spend a bunch of money to do it.\nThey'll be bought by NATO from the US, from US contractors.\nIn some cases, European countries will send their own weapons and will backfill them.\nBut in the end, our NATO allies will pay for this.\nHere's Donald Trump speaking earlier about the Patriot missile batteries that are on the way to Ukraine.\nIt's everything.\nIt's Patriots.\nIt's all of them.\nIt's a full compliment with the batteries.\nAnd would you expect them to arrive in Ukraine, sir?\nWell, we're going to have some come very soon, within days actually, because a couple of the countries that have patriots are going to swap over, and we'll replace the Patriots with the ones they have, and Matt will coordinate with NATO.\nBut so it's going to be, they're going to start arriving very soon.\nThis was just last hour at the White House as we bring the voice of Max Bergman to this story, who is director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at CSIS, the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nMax, it's great to have you, and I'm curious to hear more about your research into the impact of sanctions and secondary sanctions on Russia and other countries around the world.\nI wonder your thoughts initially.\n\n\nThough on this deal to continue providing weapons without going back to Congress with an ask, is this a smart angle for the White House to get NATO involved financially as we heard today?\n\nWell, I think it's good news, especially for Ukraine. Um, I think we should be clear about what the baseline here was. You know, the uh the administration a week or so ago announced that it was going to suspend deliveries of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine. Now, these are vital to protecting Ukrainian civilians. Uh and right now, it just looks like the White House is sort of turning that back on and that future deliveries then are going to be paid for by the Europeans. But really, a lot of this money had already been paid for by the Biden administration. What we're looking at are just sort of the deliveries of future systems. But I think what it does represent is kind of a real shift in the burden of supporting Ukraine from the US to Europe, where the Europeans effectively pay us to provide weapons that we were previously providing. At the very least, it is a good thing for Ukraine. Someone is going to pay for this, looks like Europe, and that the supply of uh very precious Patriot missile systems will continue to flow to Ukraine, uh which is really vital for their security.\n\nI'm glad you mentioned these Patriot missile systems. You used the word precious. How many of these do we have? Because when weapons to Ukraine were halted by the defense secretary and another official in the Pentagon a couple of weeks ago, that was the justification that we've run out of stuff like this.\n\nYeah. And part of it is connected to events in the Middle East where the US has used a lot of uh Patriot missile interceptors uh to to shoot down Iranian drones and other missiles. Uh and every winter it has been a big test for the United States about whether it could supply Ukraine with enough air defense to get through because Russia started uh targeting uh Ukrainian power plants and other uh facilities. And there are some reports that the US is really low in stockpiles, perhaps uh down well below 50%. Uh and this is a big problem and it's a big problem for our defense industrial sector that really can't produce enough, and there's just been uh big orders by the US army to try to ramp up production of of these missile interceptors used by the Patriot system. So this is a problem. It has been a problem throughout this war that not only does Ukraine need a lot, but that our defense industrial base and Europe's defense industrial base can't really meet the mark in terms of production.\n\nReally makes you wonder, Max, how many years we are going to have this conversation for. It's just endless, and everyone seems to know that it's something that's badly needed, yet we never get down to actually increasing the capacity of the DIB, as they call it. I know that your expertise though is in the sanctions package that we're talking about, your economic acumen here, and the research that you've done is something that I'd like to ask you about because sanctions are one thing, and that's another bit. Secondary sanctions, something else we talk about a lot, but we never quite get to. This was on the table for the Balance of Power of the Biden administration, but we're looking at some pretty hefty numbers here, whether it's 100% or 500%, Max. What would this mean for the likes of India or other countries doing business with Russia?\n\nWell, it could be really significant. And you know the president is going about uh secondary sanctions in sort of a different way by using tariffs as opposed to sanctioning the companies or countries that are then uh acting as workarounds uh for the main sanctions target. What's happened uh for Russia is that the Russian oil uh oil sector has been diverted to India and China in particular uh and the United States has been very reticent in particular to uh sanction India. We are trying to develop uh close ties with India. We see India as a strong potential partner visa v China, and we've also been reticent in some ways to go after a number of Chinese banks and other uh Chinese entities. Uh so I think you know with this tariff play, we'll see, uh it could have real ramifications, I think, for Russia's oil sector. Um, but it would also have real implications for uh the United States bilateral relations. And the thing we have to remember is part of what the Biden administration was trying to do was to keep Russian oil on the global market. We wanted uh Russia to take a haircut in terms of how much profit it was getting in terms of sales, but we didn't really have a problem with Russia selling oil. We just wanted it to sell it at a haircut because we wanted Russian oil on the market to keep global prices low. Uh the Trump administration, I think, is taking a bit more of a blunt approach, and and so we'll see if this begins to really uh lead to a spike in in oil prices.\n\nWhat would this mean for China as well, Max?\n\nWell, I think what we've seen is that China has means of retaliating. So, it could lead to an escalation of the US-China uh trade war, which has sort of already been rekindled. China has demonstrated its willingness to use rare earths and other things to hit back at the United States. Uh so you know China does recognize that its oil dependence, its dependence on Russia as well as the Middle East represents a real strategic vulnerability. It's part of the reason why they are going uh whole hog into renewables and clean technology. But for China, I think this could be really significant if if the US does impose this, and I think we would see China try to retaliate against us. So I don't think it would just be we set these, China stops buying Russian oil and moves on. Uh I think it would try to find other ways of responding.\n\nWell, so I guess what comes out the other end of the pipe here if this is in place for some time, Max, are we on the phone with OPEC about how this is going to work and what would it mean for crude oil prices? Yeah, I think there's some real potential that we get on the phone with the Saudis and others in the Gulf States and say, \"Hey, uh we want you to uh offset some of the shock that this could cause. Uh we want you to open up the taps, uh put more oil on the market. Uh we shall see if if they do that.\" The Biden administration, I think, uh didn't feel that it had the uh political relationship to actually do that, and the Saudis, I don't think, were willing to. Uh but with Trump, maybe maybe it's different. I think the bigger broader question here though is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift. The US is now looks like it's going to continue military supplies, but there's no indication Trump is going to go to Congress, try to ramp up our production for Ukraine. Uh and then the economic question is how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb uh to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? Uh there's limits to what the Biden administration would do. So I do have some uh some doubts about how far we are willing to go, and I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here, and then it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction. But there could be a good outcome if we just simply get India to lower uh what lower the amount it's buying and maybe there's some way to negotiate something with the Indians to reduce the amount of Russian oil uh and other Russian uh military goods and things that it's purchasing.\n\nThat'd be very Trumpy, wouldn't it? You put 500% tariffs on the line or sanctions on the line, and in the meantime you just crank back India a little bit to try to increase the pain knowing that those sanctions were never going to take effect. Max, what happens over the next 50 days?\n\nWell, I think what happens over the next 50 days is Russia keeps pummeling Ukraine. Uh what I think we're seeing with the statement on especially the arms deliveries is simply the preservation of the status quo in terms of the west is going to keep supporting Ukraine and supplying Ukraine with supplies. Now that's not quite enough, and Russia thinks it can win this war now and is going on another military offensive and has been going on a military offensive because it sees a light at the end of the tunnel of the US sort of drawing back support. Now I what I hope happens over the next 50 days is that there's a ramp up on European efforts uh to to support Ukraine militarily. I think that's happening. But then also that the US begins to negotiate with India and perhaps even with China to reduce oil oil flows from Russia in into India and that maybe there's talks with the Saudis about offsetting any any cuts to Russian uh Russian supplies on the global market. I would hope to see that. I'm not sure we're going to see all of that. Um, but I think we may see some progress perhaps with India. That's that's at least my hope.\n\nThere you have it. Remember this conversation in 50 days when this comes around. Max, it's great to see you. Thank you for the insights today. Max Bergman, CSIS. He's director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Just a stable of smart people at CSIS who we tap on a regular basis here. Um, clarifying the remarks on tariffs versus sanctions here. Howard Lutnik, the commerce secretary, uh saying that uh it's economic sanctions. You can also make an economic penalty. If I catch you doing it, then you have to pay. You can do tariffs, you can do sanctions. Those are both tools in the toolbox. So, I guess those are interchangeable. Now, you learn something every day on this program.\n\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Balance of Power podcast. Catch us live weekdays at noon and 5:00 p.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App. Listen on demand wherever you get your podcasts or watch us live on YouTube.\n\nAnd we want to get more on these weapon systems that are going to be heading Ukraine's way, whatever the route is, of course, this route through NATO. And turn to retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, who's joining us now here on Bloomberg TV and radio. He's a former destroyer squadron commander, now senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Admiral, thank you for being here on Balance of Power. When we consider these Patriot missile systems uh themselves, the idea that the US will be backfilling countries that send these systems to Ukraine, how quickly can we actually do so? What kind of capacity exists in this regard right now?\n\nWell, thanks for having me. You know, this is the real challenge that the president's language was a little um non-specific as was Rutte's and conflicting, but I will tell you we can get them there quickly through either of the two routes that were mentioned. The one route of the Europeans transfer their pack two, that's a lower level type of Patriot missile to the Ukrainians, what the Ukrainians could use very easily and then order backfill and order them from the United States to re to to refill the European armory or the United States could transfer them and then NATO pays the European countries pay the United States for the United States to replenish itself. Either of those methods gets them there much quicker than a Ukrainian order from the United, you know, from a defense industrial based country, which would be years.\n\nEither of these cases, he says, could be weeks to months to have missiles and batteries transferring to Ukraine.\n\nAdmiral, we're really glad to have you with us today because before you were on the USS Nimitz, the USS McCellbell, the USS Elliot, the USS Banebridge, and I can keep going, the Teddy Roosevelt, you were on the National Security Council at the White House, late '90s. And when we look back a couple of years here, how do we rationalize the fact that we've been having this conversation about our defense industrial base for decades and we really don't have a greater capacity to show for it? Was this not something that you were talking about that many years ago inside the White House?\n\nNo, you're exactly right. I think we've got about a 20-year deficit, particularly in our munitions, and that's what we're talking about here. Whether it's Patriot missiles here, the standard missiles the Navy was using to shoot down Houthi uh rebel uh cruise missiles or the uh offensive weapons that we were using against the the Houthis or have used in other loces. We were running at about 25% of the proper level of munitions order. In other words, when we needed four, we ordered one. When you do that over 20 years, you really create a deficit. And worse, you tell the defense industrial-based companies, I'm not going to do major orders, and they reduce their ability to produce. So what you've seen over the last three years are pretty consistent from the supplemental, the Ukraine supplemental, Taiwan supplemental a couple years ago, this year's budget and next year's budget, actual investments in the defense industrial base where the United States is contributing to defense industrial base companies like Lockheed and Rathon and North of Grin to expand their ability, their capacity to produce. They obviously contribute, and so we are beginning to grow our capacity, but we this is a 20-year um deficit. The only deficit that's worse is the European one which almost went to zero.\n\nWell and now of course Europeans are trying to step up uh in their own uh defense spending category, which is one of the main aims of this administration, and that was a point emphasized by Secretary General Rutte in the Oval Office with the president earlier. As we consider uh the kind of allied capacity, if you will, I also would like to ask you, Admiral, about Russia's capacity and specifically the supply of weapons that Russia is still getting from countries like North Korea. How should we be considering uh Russia's ability to continue to replenish its own stocks, continue striking uh Ukraine, often civilian targets, and how it's matched against the assistance Ukraine is now getting in terms of air defenses?\n\nWell, that's a great question, Kailey, because you're exactly right. Ukraine is fighting four countries: Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China. And in fact, Russia today is firing more artillery from North Korea than their own. In other words, the majority of the artillery being used by Russia is North Korean. North Korea gave about 6 million rounds, which is 20 years of US production uh to the Russians. Um Iran has give has built a Shahed drone factory in Russia after giving them thousands of their own Shahed drones or selling them. They now have a factory, they're producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increase you know with increases in imports\n\n\nand exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles.\nSo all three of these countries as axis of authoritarians are supporting the fourth, Russia, in this fight, and that's who Ukraine's been going against.\nSo that's probably why it's appropriate for the United States and Europe to assist with at least with equipment, but not forces.\n\nThat's incredible to consider four countries.\nYou know, Bloomberg interviewed the head of Ukrainian military intelligence admiral who said North Korea is now supplying as much as 40% of Russia's ammunition in this war.\nYou mentioned the shells that were having trouble manufacturing as quickly, but they're prepared at least to send a lot of other stuff, ballistic missiles, artillery systems.\nRussia, of course, providing money and technology to North Korea in return.\nWhat's the weapon system you're most worried about?\nAnd could we see them include nukes coming from Pyongyang?\n\nSo, um, well, certainly not nukes because, you know, not that Russia would use them, but they have their own tactical nukes already.\nBut I'm I'm glad you mentioned that because that's something we should always be sensitive to.\nBut the um the the North Korean thing that the the North Korean weapons that bother me the most are in fact the artillery rounds.\nYou're exactly right.\nBut what bothers me even more than those are those Shahed drones.\nDrones from Iran and the factory that was built in Russia are really putting pressure on the on the Ukrainian air defense system and they're causing civilian casualties and damage to critical infrastructure.\nYou know, energy, water, you know, the financial systems of Ukraine are hit every night.\nAnd so to me, that Iranian drone and that North Korean um artillery are really making a difference uh in hurting the Ukrainians.\n\nWell, and as you point to the targets that Russia is taking aim at in Ukraine, obviously part of the objective here, Admiral, is to wear on Ukrainian morale, do you sense that we reach a point where that is effective, where Ukraine's kind of desire to keep prosecuting or defending itself in this war is going to diminish?\nIs Russia being effective in that regard?\n\nSo, I I don't think so.\nAnd here here's why I say that.\nI I go to Ukraine every quarter for a couple weeks to do training with their military and their general staff and I I am convinced the Ukrainians won't lose.\nThat doesn't mean they can push Russia out.\nIt doesn't mean they can recapture Crimea, but they won't lose.\nThey're losing incrementally a kilometer here, a kilometer there of land, but they will they will they have the societal resilience to stay in this fight and win.\nThey just need access to weapons.\nAnd that's what President Trump gave them today.\nHe gave them access to weapon systems that they need.\nThe one thing I wish he had gone one step further and given them access some of our offensive weapons again the attackums long range artillery.\nUm that would have been great because then they could they could break up Russian formations when they're coming together in Russia by waiting till they're very close to the Ukrainian lines.\n\nYeah, we want to stay in touch with you, Admiral.\nLet us know when you're going back to Ukraine.\nRetired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, senior fellow, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nWe thank you for the insights, only here on Bloomberg.\nThanks for listening to the Balance of Power podcast.\nMake sure to subscribe if you haven't already at Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.\nAnd you can find us live every weekday from Washington DC at noon time Eastern at bloomberg.com.\n",
