  "cleanText": "Live from Washington, D.C.\nThis is Balance of Power with Joe Mathieu and Kailey Leinz.\nPresident Trump takes the shackles off in video.\nWelcome to the Tuesday edition.\nAs the White House allows in video to sell its H-20 Jeeps in China, sending the stock to a new all-time high.\nI'm Joe Mathieu alongside Kailey Leinz in Washington.\nThanks for joining us on Balance of Power.\nThis coincides with a series of investments in AI and energy that the president is making today in Pennsylvania.\nHe's just on his way out of town now and making some news as he departs Washington, specifically on something he teased earlier today, posting on social that there was a trade deal with Indonesia and that details will follow.\nHe is now providing those details, Joe, as the U.S. will be imposing a 19% tariff on imported Indonesian goods.\nThe president said the tariff on U.S. goods going into Indonesia will be 0%.\nInteresting way to transmit this information as opposed to a piece of paper.\nThe president right now is talking with reporters in the driveway of the White House on his way out.\nSo we'll let you know more as we learn it.\nBut yeah, redhead on the terminal, 19% Indonesia.\nI guess we have another box to check, which leaves 70 some odd others.\nYeah, roughly.\nAnd we should keep in mind as well that Indonesia was on the receiving end of one of the letters from the President last week, and the tariff rate set out in that letter was 32%.\nSo this is lower, though 19% is still nothing to sneeze at.\nSo this is a story we will follow not just on Indonesia, but when we consider the trade landscape and the export controls landscape more broadly when it comes to China.\nWe'll have Anna Ashton joining us shortly.\nAnd Ashton and our scoop machine, Michael Shepard, will be with us as well.\nRemarkable turn here for India and AMD, we should note.\nWe'll look at the stocks and check out what this means for these two companies.\nYeah, we'll look at them and Charlie Pellet is probably looking at them, too.\nSo let's get a check on those stocks that markets overall with Charlie up in New York.\nHow's it going?\nThank you very much.\nHere's what's going on both here right now.\nWe've got in video up by 4.1%.\nAdvanced Micro Devices surging 6.3%.\nOne of a number of major stories that we are following for you right now, CPI Tuesday, we have got the S&P 500 index retreating.\nThat's stock rally sputtering as bond traders trim their Fed bets.\nAlso, the 30 year 5.01%, a write to the equity markets.\nS&P down 12, down 2/10 of 1%.\nThe Dow down 367, now down by about 8/10 of 1%.\nNASDAQ composite index up 102 points, up 5/10 of 1%.\nOur max seven index, of which in video, of course, a part up 8/10 of 1%, a ten year, 4.47%, the two year, 3.95%.\nAnd again, that 30 year bears repeating 5.01% gold lower by 5/10 of 1%.\n3328 The ounce West Texas Intermediate crude now down 1.1%, 6627 the barrel and Bitcoin now down by 2.4%.\n117,303.\nOn Bitcoin earnings news this morning from big banks.\nAnother big story that we're watching, JPMorgan Chase down 8/10 of 1% after earnings.\nCitigroup up 2.9% after earnings and Wells Fargo after earnings now down by 5.7%.\nSo again, recapping S&P lower by 12, down 2/10 of 1%.\nAnd as we have been reporting, as you heard from John Kelly, President Trump to impose a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods on the Balance of Power continues right now.\nBack we go to Washington once again, your host, Joe Mathieu and Kailey Leinz.\nAll right, Charlie Pellet checking out markets on the move and stocks on the move, including in video, as Charlie mentioned, up more than 4%.\nAs we've got news that Nvidia is going to be able to start selling at least certain chips in China again, specifically the age 20 chip, which of course from the jump was designed to work around what were existing export controls that the U.S. had put into place in order to restrain China's ability to access advanced semiconductors.\nThis is something that had been tightened, though, and now it's getting loosened back.\nAnd Joe, it's quite a reversal and noteworthy that the reversal comes that Nvidia is going to be granted licenses to sell these chips once more after Jensen Huang has been spending some time with President Trump as of late, including at the White House last week.\nYeah, he sure was.\nAnd you wonder exactly what was said in that conversation that turned fortunes not only for Nvidia but its rival AMD, whose 308 chips will also be apparently allowed for sale in China, which is why we're seeing both of these stocks jump on an otherwise kind of blah day on the markets.\nMike Shepard's a big reason why we know about this, and he's been very close to this whole story for weeks now and joins us now in Washington.\nMike, you're the one who broke the news that Jensen Huang was at the White House.\nWas it as simple as sitting down with Donald Trump?\nIt really is a question of him meeting with the president again.\nAnd it's not his first sit down face to face with the president at the White House, but in a sense, it's the most consequential.\nJensen Huang has really been railing against these increasingly tight export restrictions aimed primarily at his chips.\nAnd it's not designed to hurt his company, but it ends up doing so.\nThe idea is to prevent this technology, which has potential dual use.\nThe idea is that you want to keep advanced semiconductors out of China's hands.\nSo the argument goes, and when China hawks here in Washington to prevent China from deploying in its military or national security apparatus.\nBut for Jensen Huang, this imposes a big cost on the company and on its bottom line.\nIn the first quarter of this year, they've reported a $4.5 billion write down just from those H-20 restrictions.\nAnd for this coming quarter, they were looking at possibly $8 billion in lost sales.\nSo there is a consequence there.\nAnd this was an important meeting he had with the president.\nWell, so talk to us more about the actual capacity of this chip, what it could allow China to do, because I can't imagine many China hawks are super thrilled with this decision.\nThe early sense that we get is that, no, the China hawks are not happy at all with this.\nBut it remains unclear just how forceful they will be in trying to push back against this, Kelly.\nAnd when you hear from U.S. officials and we spoke with David Sax, the White House A.I. czar, earlier today on the Bloomberg Tech Show with Ed Ludlow and Howard Lutnick on another network.\nThey each were pointing out that, look, this age 20 chip is a few generations behind.\nNow, the latest that Nvidia has to offer and it is on par with perhaps the best that Weiwei, Nvidia's chief rival, is trying to offer now within in China.\nThe idea is this if you talk to Jensen Huang that you want American technology to be sold around the world, but if the U.S. is not selling it to China, which is the world's largest semiconductor market right now, you allow Weiwei free reign potentially there.\nAnd that gives Weiwei perhaps a springboard to start selling into some other markets.\nAnd that's a risk for in video.\nYou know, we talk about computer chips.\nPeople think about intel inside these microchips.\nThese are massive.\nThese GPUs are hardware stacks that require proprietary software to run them.\nYou were talking about this age 20.\nIt weighs about £70.\nMike.\nYou've held them with your own hands.\nCan you stack enough of these to replicate the effectiveness, for instance, of a BLACKWELL?\nIs that what a China hawk would suggest?\nWhat they would suggest that there are ways to stack these and put it together and run.\nInference Learning for A.I. models to gain, to gain ground.\nAnd maybe you don't need the perfect when it comes to, you know, these accelerator chips.\nBut even if you have something pretty good, you're handing something to China that, you know, in the U.S. view, especially among some in the national security establishment, that is not something you want to be giving, you know, our top geopolitical rival here.\nWow.\nAll right.\nMike Sheppard, senior editor for technology and Strategic Industries for us here at Bloomberg.\nThank you, as always, for joining us on this important and market moving story and such an important story.\nIt's one that our colleagues on Bloomberg Surveillance had the chance to speak with the Energy Secretary, Scott Bessent, about earlier today, talking about chip manufacturing.\nYes, but also how it fits into the wider picture in ongoing trade conversations with China.\nHere's what he said.\nI can tell you the one thing that we do not want is a digital belt and road springing up around the world because other countries or China are substituting for our American chip manufacturers.\nThis is the same chip, though, that the Trump administration blocked with export controls in April.\nSo why the change in policy now?\nEmery, you might say that that was a negotiating chip that we used in Geneva and in London.\nSo this was part of the trade talks when it comes to Washington and Beijing, yes.\nWas it a quid pro quo then?\nAs you said, it was in, but was it potentially to make sure that you can get the licenses when it comes to rare earths?\nYeah, I think it was all part of a mosaic.\nThey had things we wanted.\nWe had things they wanted.\nAnd, you know, we're in a very good place.\nI expect to meet my Chinese counterpart, the vice premier, in the next few weeks.\nSo when and where will that meeting take place?\nSo we're still working on that.\nThe Chinese leadership has a big conclave at the beginning of August, so we're trying to work out whether that could be in a third country before or after that conclave.\nWell, the administration released the framework of the Geneva and London talks.\nWell, we have released some of it, and I'll tell you that now, having settled on tariffs on the export controls, we can move on to the next stage of talks.\nAnd I think it's very important both for the global economy, for the US economy, and for the Chinese economy, for us to move on and talk about China opening its markets and the increased domestic and consumer production there.\nAre you hoping to get to that next phase before August 12th when that's currently the detente between these two economies?\nYeah, Look, I think we're in a very good place.\nAnd I tell market participants not to worry about August 12th.\nNation with the Energy Secretary, Scott Bessent, our colleagues on Bloomberg Surveillance.\nWhen you add that to what we just learned from Mike Shepherd, we want to talk about all of this with Anna Ashton, the founder of Ashton Analytics, a specialist in US-China trade, which is why we bring Iran so often, former China analyst with the Department of Defense.\nAnd it's great to have you.\nWelcome back to Bloomberg TV and Radio.\nI'm wondering your thoughts on this about face when it comes to chips from India and AMD.\nIs this in the best national security interest of America?\nWell, you know, I think it's important to note that not only are these not the only things that the Trump administration has recently rolled back in terms of export restrictions, but all of the things that they brought back so far are things that they themselves imposed this spring, either in April or in May.\nSo when Treasury Secretary percent indicates that these were, you know, chips that were part of the London negotiations, I take that at face value.\nThey imposed more restrictions on exports of certain goods that they believed to be strategic for China in order to have bargaining power, to try to get China to speed up its exports of rare earths.\nWell, so when you talk about the walk backs we've seen from this administration on various fronts when it comes to China, how much of a turn would you characterize it as?\nAnd I and it is indeed a dovish turn.\nHow upset do you think China hawks in and around the administration and elsewhere are about these moves?\nWell, look, I definitely think that China hawks are going to be upset regardless of whether the roll backs are of restrictions that were imposed recently by the Trump administration or of previously imposed restrictions, because from a change of heart perspective, none of this technology should be going to China at all.\nBut I also think that in terms of trying to measure whether or not this is a dovish turn by the Trump administration, we still have to wait and see because at the end of the day, this will only be a truly substantive change in U.S. policy towards China when it comes to export controls and access to critical U.S. technologies.\nIf we see a rollback in Biden era export controls, I certainly think that that is something that China wants and it maybe it's possible China will get something like that because we know that rare earths exports have, you know, the licensing approvals have picked up and there's some evidence to indicate that shipments are are beginning to flow more smoothly.\nBut certainly there's no approval of anything to go to military end users, for example, things could always be faster than they already are, and they're not as fast as they were prior to these restrictions on exports of Chinese virus and magnets being imposed.\nSo, well, we'll have to see whether or not the Trump administration is willing to give ground on any Biden era policies.\nHmm.\nWell, do you worry more about the next deep seek emerging?\nOr do you go back to your role at the Department of Defense and worry about what China might do with this technology when it comes to building weapons?\nI think that whether or not China gets this technology from the U.S., I think that this is the Spice China time to continue developing indigenous technologies without losing the ability to apply these technologies in various ways that are important for them in the near term.\nBut China has been throwing enormous amounts of money towards indigenous development of its own technologies so that it won't have to rely on the United States anymore.\nIt's been doing that for a number of years now and it's been doubling and tripling down on that.\nI think it's only a matter of time before China doesn't need US technologies in order to accomplish the various ends that that it's trying to accomplish.\nAnd and so that's happening regardless.\nWell, speaking of matters of time, Anna, we just heard from the treasury secretary moments ago suggesting that August 12th should not be viewed by market participants, participants as a deadline they should be worried about.\n\n\nDoes that suggest to you that there is a lack of forward progress in reaching more of a trade agreement between the U.S. and China? Should we consider any of these deadlines to be real at this point?\n\nSuper fair question. It does suggest to me that they have yet to make it past serious discussion or may get to serious discussion of things beyond rare earths. I feel like rare earths has been the hair on fire crisis for the Trump administration, particularly because of the heavy, rare earth magnets that are so important not only to electric vehicles but also to traditional combustion engine vehicles and to so many electronics. And I think that, you know, that that will continue to be something that China can use as leverage to get the U.S. to the table. And until that is satisfactorily resolved in the U.S., mind, it will be hard to move forward on negotiation of other issues.\n\nI think it is worth noting that a couple of key heavy, rare earths that are used in these magnets that have been in short supply, like Dysprosium, for example, and neodymium, those also are not. They're primarily sourced from Myanmar. And the state in Myanmar that they're primarily sourced from has been incredibly unstable due to domestic conflict for the past 6 to 8 months. And China itself is having a hard time getting these things. So it's just worth keeping in mind that China is not necessarily simply using these rare earth export licensing restrictions to gain leverage vis a vis the U.S. It is also thinking about its own supply security.\n\nAnd that means that maybe you wonder how much you can negotiate. Do you want to see President Trump, President Xi, in the same room? Do you want to see a summit? And is that, in fact, where the president might be most likely to give up the ghost on this and lower export controls to your point from the Biden administration?\n\nI'm from the perspective of somebody who would like to see a more functional and healthy U.S. relationship. Yeah, that sounds like a really nice thing when I'm thinking about it. In terms of U.S. strict U.S. interests there. Things that can certainly be gained there. If I put on my hat and look at it through the lens of security concerns, these are really difficult tradeoffs. And a meeting that caused President Trump to relax export controls, you know, bigger and more fundamental export controls on advanced technologies to China might not be in the U.S. interest.\n\nMm hmm. And we learned from President Trump yesterday that if no cease fire agreement is reached between Russia and Ukraine within 50 days, that he will look to impose 100% what he described as secondary tariffs on countries that help Russia, including big buyers of Russian oil. REED China. How do you expect Beijing would respond if indeed something like that were implemented? What would their behavior be?\n\nOkay. Well, here we to stop buying cheap Russian crude and exports or we're going to potentially retaliate against the U.S. with tariffs in kind. And certainly can't stop buying Russian crude or gas. And that's because it gets an even bigger percentage from Russia than it did before the Ukraine war started. And, you know, it's pretty it's pretty heavily reliant on Russia. Russia is one of its main suppliers. So that's that's not in the cards. What is essentially on the cards is use of smaller companies instead of their main oil and gas companies, which is already, to a large extent the case to move that oil and gas and therefore sort of shield China's broader economy from any secondary sanctions that are imposed. If if the secondary sanctions don't hit the big banks that are you know, if the big banks aren't processing these transactions, then, you know, China can kind of prevent calamity from ensuing as a result of the sanctions. And we've seen them kind of we've seen them do that with their purchases from Iran as well. That's what I would expect that to be their first move.\n\nWell, so, Anna, if I read you correctly, if China's not going to be able to actually adjust its purchases of Russian oil, would that mean that these these secondary sanctions, tariffs, whatever you want to call them, would not have the intended effect the president wants here, which is to put the squeeze on the Russian economy and stop them from being able to fund their war machine?\n\nI don't think that they would have the intended effect, because I think that I mean, you know, other countries that are buying from Russia might not have the same safeguards in place to protect them from secondary sanctions. But China certainly has safeguards in place and China is the biggest buyer. So, yeah, I mean, I think that we've been learning the hard way for a few years now that there are limits to the power of U.S. sanctions and they don't always achieve what we want we hope that they will achieve. And I don't think that secondary sanctions on all sales of Russian oil are necessarily going to achieve what Trump wants.\n\nAll right, Anna, we appreciate you joining us as always. And Ashton is founder of Ashton Analytics, a specialist in US-China trade and economics, of course, a former channel China analyst at the Department of Defense, here with us on Bloomberg TV and radio. And as we discussed with Anna, the threat of secondary sanctions and the deadline, Russia is now facing down. Perhaps that deadline to Joe is a little bit squishy, as the president suggested to reporters, that it could be sooner than 50 days for the Russia deadline deadlines. We remember there was a two week deadline, I think, for Iran, and strikes just plays only days into that period of time. So it might be a case of as many as 50 days when it comes to this administration.\n\nYeah. So that headline and others we've gotten from President Trump as he spoke with reporters upon departure from the White House, we are expecting to get some tape rolled back on. His remarks will, of course, bring that to you here on Bloomberg TV and radio when they begin. But we also want to check in on financial markets on this CPI day. So for that, we turn to Charlie Pellet, who has a look from New York.\n\nHi. Thank you very much. CPI to the API tomorrow. And right now we are trading at just about the lows of the session. Right to the numbers here. A relatively tame inflation data failing to ease Wall Street's worries about the impact of tariffs. The S&P now lower by 12 6256, down 2/10 of 1% as of now, worth pointing out. So that briefly during this morning session, we did trade as high as 6300 on the S&P. The Dow now down 357, down 8/10 of 1%. NASDAQ composite index, oh, on the China chip news up 96 points, up 5/10 of 1%. Nvidia up 4%. Advanced Micro Devices up now by just about 6.1%, ten year, 4.48%. The two year 3.95%, the third year back about 5%, 5.01%. Gold down $12. The ounce, 3331 down 4/10 of 1%. West Texas Intermediate crude down 9/10 of 1%, 6638 a barrel. And Bitcoin now down 2.4%. 117,310 on Bitcoin. So again, stocks lower in video and Advanced Micro Devices planned to resume sales of some air chips in China after securing Washington's assurances that such shipments will get approved. Shares of both companies and other chip makers. Higher end video of 4.1%. Advanced Micro Devices up 6.1%.

Once again, your hosts, Joe Mathieu and Daily lives.\n\nAll right, Charlie, many thanks. Charlie Pellet, live from New York, watching Wall Street for us. And we'll get another check on the markets a short time from now as we follow President Trump in his travels. He's just left the White House and we do expect to be hearing from the president some tape coming from a conversation he had with reporters on his way to Marine One, which just touched down at Joint Base Andrews. The president on his way to Pennsylvania, Kelly, to talk about air and energy, a series of investments that will be announced a little bit later on today. Of course, he also, before he left town, wished everyone a happy crypto week and called on all Republicans in all caps on truth social to vote yes for the Genius Act and the Clarity Act.\n\nIndeed. And of course, there's a third piece of legislation that's going to be considered as well, the anti Cbdc bill, essentially the three of them together comprising crypto week. The question is, can all three of them actually pass in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate for those that had originated in the lower chamber? So we want to get a look at that now as we turn to Republican Congressman Mike Flood, who is with us. He, of course, represents Nebraska, its first district, and as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. In addition to being vice chair of the Republican Main Street Partnership.\n\nCongressman, thank you for being here. Of course, the Genius Act, the stablecoin legislation passed the Senate. It does seem there's a lot of optimism that you will be able to pass that in the House. But what about the Clarity Act, the market structure? Bill? Are you as optimistic about its fate?\n\nI really am. You know, Patrick McHenry, when he was chair, worked hand-in-glove with French Hill on digital assets. Our chairman, Dow French, is taking this to the next level. This in the House has been a leader in this space. We know what we're doing. We have been at this for several years. The Clarity Act will pass. In fact, last year when we did market structure in the House of Representatives, I think we got about 71 Democrats. So I don't know if we'll get that many this time. But this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that meets with the favor of a great majority of folks in both chambers. And I'm confident that crypto week will be a success and we will finally have a bill signed into law on Stablecoins. Now, we have to urge the Senate, after we passed the Clarity Act, to do the same in the upper chamber so we can move this forward.\n\nHow do you close the deal on that, Congressman? And welcome back. It's good to have you on. Bloomberg The genius act is one thing, but indeed, the Clarity Act appears to be something different. And if you need Democrats to make this happen, a lot of them say that they'd like to see language that removes President Trump and his family from crypto investments. That appears to be the cause of the allergy that many Democrats have here. Would that help it get done? Is that possible?\n\nI'm sure that's what they're asking for. I know that French Hill, our chairman, has been working with Senator Scott in the Senate. Listen, we're worried about anything that gets us over the line. I'm hopeful that the Senate will prioritize market structure like we have in the House because, yes, it is a win to have stablecoins, but you can't have one without the other. There's no clarity. There's the reason we named that bill that is right now under Gary or under Gary Gensler, when he was in charge of the SEC, he thought everything was a security. The CFTC obviously should have authority over Bitcoin. We have to pick a lane, know where you're going, and that's why the Clarity Act getting done this year will send the signal to every other country in the world that the United States will remain the world's reserve currency with the dollar and transactions in Africa, transactions in South America. They will built be built on the strength of the dollar. And that's why we're so about getting this done in a quick manner.\n\nIt's Congressman Mike Flood, Republican with us here representing Nebraska's first district. Congressman, it's great to have you. And I hope we'll have more time when you join us next.\n\nOn the trade front when it comes to Indonesia, suggesting Indonesia is going to face a 19% tariff on its imports into the United States. While the United States will face no tariff on its exports to Indonesia. A good deal, I suppose, for the United States. I don't know if we've heard from Indonesia on this. There's been no paper on. It seems to be an interesting way to roll out a major trade deal in the driveway of the White House. But let's get into it with Anna Wang, who is with us now, of course, Bloomberg economics chief U.S. economist. Anna, 19% Indonesia, assuming that this is confirmed, means what, for our trade relationship?\n\nWell, I think I think it means that that that the aggregate tariffs would go down a little bit. But I think generally it doesn't really it's just a drop in the water. The main trading partners who we really want a trade deal with, which is really Japan, EU, China, Canada, Mexico, and those are really the ones that that will make a dent on the aggregate tariffs and inflation ultimately.\n\nWell, the president did talk about the EU saying that we're making progress with Europe, but we already have the letter knowing that he's suggested that these letters in and of themselves are deals which would suggest a 30% tariff on the EU, which he's threatened for August 1st. The question, though, is to what extent tariffs already. Not just the ones that are threatened, but the ones that are in place are feeding through the U.S. economy. When we look at what was once again a more muted print on CPI, at least on the headline, it would suggest that not yet. But to talk us through what's actually going on underneath and whether or not we actually may be seeing more tariff effects than meets the eye.\n\nYes. So today's CPI is the fourth straight soft report. However, in the details, it shows a much brisker pace of tariff pass through. In fact, I think market participants all pretty much agree that this is the first real tariff print of the CPI. Print that's littered with tariff affects appliances, washing machines, clothings, men's clothing, women's dresses, everything, audio equipment. You could see a pretty broad based tariff effect. However, at the same time, hotels costs went down and and shelter costs went down. And as a result, the overall print is not as as as high as it would be. So I think the take away of many people is that going forward we may see even more tariffs passed through.\n\nI guess that was my question. If this is the start of a trend, what are we going to look like six months from now?\n\nYeah, so I think six months for now critically depend on what happens on August 1st. And if Trump were to make real many of these terror threats, it means that aggregate tariffs can\n\n\nGo up as high as low twenties, which could deal a shock to S&P 500.\nAnd because I think right now markets are not really priced in for a big rebound on the tariffs level.\nAnd I think in that shock, if it generates a repeat of liberation day type of shock, could lower consumer sentiment once again.\nSo because we just saw a little brief rebound that could be short lived if tariff levels were to rebound.\nOkay.\nSo if we're thinking about the tariff level six months ago, I feel like you can't answer this next question without knowing what that is or six months from now, where could the Fed funds rate be depending on where tariff levels are?\nBecause the president once again argued just now that rates are still too high, he wants to see a cut.\nDoes this data suggest that the Fed is going to be prepared to do so?\nYes.\nSo the Fed really cares about core PC inflation.\nAnd I think that the core PC reading for this month will be much hotter than the CPI today.\nIn fact, our estimate is for core PC inflation to be around 0.34 in that vicinity, which is almost twice as high as the last month.\nAnd I think from the Fed perspective that they might look at this and think that they have been correct in holding rates constant.\nThe president just said as part of that conversation that the U.S. should have the lowest interest rates in the world.\nIf we did, wouldn't that mean we were going into we're coming out of a recession?\nWell, you know, there are many reasons why rates could come down.\nBut certainly I think the current macro situation, with so much uncertainty and unknowns about where trade policy could go, the Fed was acting in a cautious way and not cutting rates in case that tariffs were to increase or and cause inflation to flare up.\nSo that's the Fed's perspective.\nAll right.\nAnd I want chief U.S. economist for us at Bloomberg Economics reacting to President Trump's remarks from moments ago, as well as the inflation data we got today.\nThank you so much.\nAnd we want to check as well on how the markets are interpreting this data and what it may mean as we get a check on those from Charlie Pellet up in New York.\nHey, Charlie.\nHi.\nThank you very much, Kailey Leinz.\nLook.\nWell change on the S&P 500 index in the red, down by six points right now.\nThat is a drop of 1/10 of 1%.\nRelatively tame inflation data failing to ease Wall Street's worries about the impact of tariffs.\nInitial rallies in stocks and bonds have sputtered on bets that the Fed will keep rates on hold for now.\nThe Dow, though, down 335.\nThat is a drop of 7/10 of 1%.\nNasdaq pushing higher on China.\nChip news.\nRight now, we've got Nasdaq up 121, a gain there of 6/10 of 1%.\nThose chip names, by the way, Nvidia, up 3.8%.\nAdvanced Micro Devices up 6.4%, ten year, 4.48%.\nThe two year on this CPI Tuesday, 3.95%, and the 30 year at 5.01%.\nGold now down 5/10 of 1%, 3328 the ounce West Texas Intermediate crude down 9/10 6636 a barrel.\nBalance of Power continues right now.\nAnd back we go to Washington once again, your hosts, Joe Matthew Lila.\nAll right.\nCharlie Pellet in New York, thank you so much, Joe, Matthew and myself, of course, in Washington.\nPresident Trump, however, is no longer in the nation's capital.\nHe is on board Air Force One bound for Pittsburgh, where he will be attending the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit later this afternoon.\nIt is underway, in fact, right now as we speak, and that's where we find our colleague Tyler Kendall, Bloomberg, Washington correspondent, who is in the field for us today.\nAnd Tyler, of course, this Energy and Innovation Summit is really all about artificial intelligence.\nAnd you've been having conversations around that all day today.\nTell us more.\nYeah.\nHey, Kelly.\nExactly right.\nWe're here to talk about the future of the U.S. trying to keep an edge when it comes to AI, but a big part of that is finding the energy to fuel it because it's actually kind of difficult to pinpoint just how much energy artificial intelligence uses.\nBut we know that it uses a lot and that the demand is only growing.\nA recent analysis from Goldman Sachs shows us that energy from data centers is expected to increase by 160% between now and 2035.\nSo there is this huge surge in demand.\nSo that's a big focus of the conversation here today.\nAnd I actually had the chance to speak with the Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, about this idea that the administration is trying to use deregulation as a way to boost energy production in the United States.\nBut I also was asking him about costs and how tariffs come into the picture, in particular, as you're about to hear how that 50% tariff on copper that's set to go into place on August 1st will impact the industry, considering that copper is really essential when it comes to getting this power over to the AI data centers.\nWell, I think the biggest impact of that 50% tariff on copper is going to speed up copper mining in the United States.\nWe have enormous copper resources here.\nWe have some huge mines that have been trying to get going for years.\nWe want to get copper production growing rapidly in this country.\nCopper like steel is just essential to everything that happens in the world.\nShould we expect the energy industry to get some sort of tariff carve out moving forward?\nI believe the president plans no special carve outs.\nHe wants to re industrialize the United States of America.\nThere's a lot of tools to do that.\nMake it easy to invest in the United States, make it attractive to invest the United States and tariffs are an additional element of that toolbox.\nI'm sure you're talking to industry, though, is a carve out on the table.\nAre there any negotiations underway for, say, the oil industry to get a carve out when it comes to the equipment that they use in the field, like copper or steel, for example?\nNo discussions right now.\nWe are hearing from the industry and of course, this is true if you incrementally raise the cost of projects, that hurts the economics of them.\nWe want to do everything we possibly can to maximize investments in the United States.\nSo jobs and opportunity come here to our country.\nLastly, I just want to ask you a geopolitical question, because we did hear from President Trump yesterday threatening 100% so-called secondary tariff on countries that import Russian energy supplies.\nIf that were to go into effect, what would that do to prices in the global energy market?\nSomething like that would likely drive oil prices up.\nI think President Trump's strong agenda there is to end the war in Ukraine.\nOur hope is that that large pressure will have an impact on Russia and we can bring just a brutal war in Eastern Europe to an end.\nThat's President Trump's goal is prosperity at home and peace abroad.\nAnd the old formulas weren't working very well in that respect.\nSo, yeah, President Trump has very different tools, very different negotiating skills and very different level of boldness.\nI think we're going to see tremendous growth in peace abroad and prosperity at home.\nJill and Kaylee.\nI want to point out something there, which is that he said that carve outs aren't really on the table at this point.\nBut I did speak with the head of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the industry, and they said that they are lobbying the administration for some sort of carve out, even if it were to be short term in particular, to help get some sort of relief when it comes to the supplies and the materials that go into the infrastructure that helps them move the energy such as copper or steel.\nTyler, I want to ask you about this summit that you're attending for.\nThe president's on his way to you right now, $70 billion, as you've been reporting, in corporate investments, the likes of Blackstone Corps.\nWe've.\nWhat else is happening there on the ground that we're going to learn about today when we connect the dots between air and energy?\nRight.\nSo, Joe, this these investment announcements really are spanning where the money is going.\nIt could be for data centers or the energy infrastructure, of course.\nSo we're discussing perhaps more money behind drilling in order to get the energy energy levels up to meet the production demand.\nBut it's also about this idea of training the AI workforce in AI apprenticeships, for example.\nThose are some of the themes that we are expecting the President to touch on.\nThe administration really has taken sort of a broad approach when it comes to trying to maintain this edge in artificial intelligence.\nIt's that part of engaging with the private sector that we often hear President Trump talk about this need for investment to come into the United States in order for the US to compete, paired with the other part of their deregulation agenda and of course, deregulation we talk about with energy, but it is a really big topic when we are discussing artificial intelligence.\nWe saw basically this play out during the reconciliation package when some of these big tech companies weren't happy with how that ultimately shook out with one of those provisions being stripped out that would impose that moratorium when it comes to state regulation.\nSo these are all some of the big questions that are being debated here today as we really do see this coming together of the administration, but also the private sector.\nWell, and Tyler, just quickly on that deregulatory effort, is there a sense that that can happen quickly enough, that energy supply specifically can be unleashed with demand rising exponentially to power, artificial intelligence?\nWell, it depends on who you ask.\nAnd I actually pose that exact question to the Energy Secretary who said that.\nYes, but it's going to be difficult.\nA lot does need to happen in order to get this up to the sort of levels that we need to see.\nAnd I mentioned it before.\nRight now, there's not really a number of just how much energy uses.\nWe just know that the demand is going up.\nBut if you ask the private sector, they say that they are ready, willing and able.\nThey just need to see the deregulation environment behind it.\nFor example, I spoke to the Constellation Energy CEO who has in some pretty big deals with Microsoft and Mehta, for example, to have nuclear come into the picture.\nAnd he told me the same exact thing, that they are ready to go, but they really just need the regulations out of the way.\nOf course, this poses other issues for why the regulations were in place, and that's a whole other debate that we could get into.\nReally interesting.\nWell, you're keeping good company, Tyler.\nSpending time with the stakeholders today in Pennsylvania.\nBloomberg Washington correspondent Tyler Kendall in advance of the president's arrival at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation summit.\nPretty interesting stuff, Kelly, that we'll be talking about.\nMore on the Late Edition here of Balance of Power with President Trump on True Social saying the U.S. will be the undisputed king of artificial intelligence, something that he's been leaning into for months now.\nIndeed, as he leans into other things as well, encouraging Republicans to pass the various crypto bills that are coming to the floor this Crypto Week.\nWe're going to have more on that in the Late Edition.\nA Balance of Power actually be joined by two members of the U.S. Senate.\nSenator Tina Smith will be with us, the Democrat, of course, and Republican Senator Thom Tillis.\nHe was, of course, not seeking re-election.\nI'm looking forward to that one.\nHe can speak freely now and he will on Bloomberg TV and radio starting after 5 p.m.\nEastern.\nSo we'll meet you back then alongside Kailey Leinz.\nI'm Joe Matthew.\nThis is Bloomberg.\n",
