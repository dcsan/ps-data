  "cleanText": "[Music]\nBloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\n\nWhat a way to end the day.\nJane Fonda, this is amazing.\nSo, we have so much to talk to you about, Jane.\nMeg and I are so excited.\nI know the audience is excited.\nAnd I want to start by asking you because I guarantee you there are people in this room who are climate activists who think about the environment because of you.\nFair.\n[Applause]\nThat wasn't as enthusiastic as I was hoping for, but we'll get you there.\nAnd I'm sure I think of climate because of some of the people in\nRight.\nProbably true.\nSo to that end, what ignited you?\nWhat made you think about this back in the day?\nI think the fact that I was born in 1937 and spent the first 10 years of my life in California was important.\nThere were only two billion people on earth then.\nIs this working?\nYeah.\nUh, two billion people and guess what?\nTwo billion people is the caring capacity of earth when it comes to us guys.\nSustainability means there can be two billion of us.\nWell, as has already been mentioned, there are more than eight billion now and demographers say that there'll be 10 billion by the middle of the century.\nYou know, what are we going to eat?\nWell, we'll eat cell grown fish, I guess.\nBut, um, no, really, we're destroying our So, you all know that as better than I do.\nUm but what that meant for me was you know most people in the 30s they lived in in the country they didn't live in cities and that meant there was a lot of nature you I lived on on the top of a mountain overlooking kind of like this overlooking the Pacific Ocean only not so close farther away and there was no smog there were no freeways there was no plastic and we did just fine we did it was maybe more difficult, but it was just fine.\nUm, but you know, I grew I woke up and went to sleep to the sound of coyotes.\nI heard morning doves and and and night and gales and meadow larkarks and bobcats and mountain lions and I grew up with animals and I was always outside like a lot of you probably, you know, it was the solace for me.\nIt was not so great inside the house.\nYeah, there's something wrong.\nOh well.\nUm, anyway, I came back.\nI moved away.\nI came back 40 years later, lived near the beach, and people were getting cancer.\nLifeguards were getting cancer.\nThis ocean that I swam in every summer, I didn't want to go in.\nPeople's eyes were burning.\nMy kids got asthma.\nIt's like this was not the same.\nAnd then I was married to a man named Tom Hayden who was a a movement leader at the time.\nAnd and he we focused a lot on prochemicals.\nThere was the hole in the ozone.\nThere was there was the cancer.\nThere was Dowo Chemical was was one of the main villains at the time.\nUm, anyway, I so I've always cared about the environment.\nI've always cared about the creatures, the wildlife.\nAnd then we discovered through the work against prochemicals that corporations were running the government.\nYeah.\nActually, my husband interviewed Jimmy Carter when he was in the White House and and Carter said to him, \"One of the things that I've realized now is the corporations are running this country.\"\nThat was the president that said that.\nSo, um, so I've always cared.\nI've always, you know, loved nature and the environment and didn't like what corporations were doing to it.\nAnd then, but I didn't really follow the science.\nI didn't really know until like 2018 the degree to which the climate was being challenged primarily by the burning of fossil fuels and that wasn't being talked about then.\nall the most of the big green organizations with the exception of Greenpeace and Oil Change International and a few others, they talked about the the alternatives, the you know the the things that we were working for, but they never said what was the primary cause of the climate crisis.\nAnd you can't solve the climate crisis unless you talk about what's causing it primarily.\nAnd it wasn't until I started reading um Naomi Klein's couple of books that she wrote um that made me realize this is this is existential.\nThis is different than anything that we have ever faced before.\nAnd um and I got very very depressed.\nI know what that feels like because I knew I wasn't doing enough.\nAnd I called Annie Leonard who was running Greenpeace at the time.\nShe's here.\nShe's the bravest, smartest, most strategic person I know.\nAnd I said, \"I want to move to DC and create a ruckus.\nI want to camp in front of the White House and and I'm going to really, you know, cook up some good trouble.\nI was worried about where to poop.\"\nI've done this before and I'm going to do it again.\nYeah.\nPooping was a problem.\nI didn't know how do you do what do you I you know I know what to do in a blizzard or in the country or in a forest but well how what do you do with your poop when you're camping and and protesting in a city.\nThink about that gentlemen.\nBut but she said you don't have to worry about pooping because it's not allowed anymore.\nYou're not allowed to camp out.\nAnd so long story short camping not pooping.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nUm we created fire drill Fridays which meant every Friday we we you know we would focus on a particular topic involving the climate crisis and then we would engage in non-violent civil disobedience.\nI mean th this is what changes history.\nYou people if you look at the history of nonviolent civil disobedience it's what's really changed things a lot.\nUm and so we did that and it changed us a lot.\nUm, our goal was not to pressure the government.\nTrump was in office.\nWe wanted to We knew that about 65 to 70% of Americans were concerned about climate.\nWe wanted to move from concern to action.\nAnd I was I turned 82 in jail that that fall.\nAnd I knew that was very important because a lot of people said people said, \"Well, if she can do it,\" you know, people people came from all over the country, mostly gay-haired women like me, and they came, they'd never been at rallies before.\nThey'd never uh been arrested before.\nAnd and it really mattered.\nIt made a big difference.\nWe we there were a lot of new activists came out of that.\nAnd when COVID hit, we took it online and for a year we had nine million people that would join us on across all platforms.\nWhen when COVID ended and Annie and a very small team, the board that we have, it's a small group of people.\nCoven?\nNo, it's not a coven.\nUh um so we've all for decades marched and protested and lobbied and written books and and we have not gotten the legislation that we needed that was commensurate with what science was saying that we needed.\nWhy?\nBecause so many people that we elect to office take money from the fossil fu fuel industry and they they won't move.\nAnd so we said, \"Okay, if you can't change the people, change the people.\nWe're going to kick them out and get climate champions elected.\"\nAnd we decided to focus down ballot because that's where you have a lot of influence.\nThat's where a lot of the struggles for climate justice and fossil fuel infrastructure and and all this.\nThis is where it happens.\nI mean, you can't imagine how down ballot state and local officials have such power when it comes to to um the fossil fuel industry, to saving uh properties, to stopping fossil fuel infrastructure.\nPlus, it's less expensive.\nWe can't we did we were just new and we couldn't make a dent in the presidential election.\nIt's not strategic.\nWhat what we did I think that what we're doing is the most strategic thing.\nall over the country, governors, mayors, city council, state legislatores, counter county executive, school boards, public utilities, these things make such a difference.\nSo, we've had I don't know something like 170 candidates that have won.\nWe have a 2:1 rating uh ratio.\nWe we win 2:1.\nWe have 44,000 donors around the country.\nUm, we have thousands and thousands of volunteers that we can get to come out to to local campaigns.\nAnd can you tell us a little bit more about what are the key issues you're focused on right now with the pack climate?\nClimate.\nWe focus on climate.\nWe we we study the candidates a lot.\nWe work with local people on the ground because they know the best about who are the good potential candidates.\nCan they really win?\nWe're not a protest c uh pack.\nWe we're in it to win it.\nCan they win?\nCan Jane PAC make an appreciable difference if we endorse?\nUm is this in a in a heavily industrial area where people are sick and dying and have absolutely no help from city councils or supervisors or governors.\nYou know, um that wonderful presentation by the woman, what's the name of the river?\nPaulina Lopez.\nYeah, that place.\nAs you all know, there's places like that all over the country.\nAnd we go there and and try to help them get an electoral um advocate for them, you know, get get people elected that that are going to help them.\nThese are the the kind of things.\nAnd so, so Jane, how often are you finding the candidates and how often are they finding you?\nHow is that evolving?\nWell, we're, you know, when we started, none of us had ever done anything like this before.\nWe we built the plane as we were flying it.\nAnd we didn't know whether candidate, I mean, I'm, you know, I'm popular now, but I'm not all I've been not so popular.\nAnd I didn't know whether, you know, they would come.\nThey're coming.\nYeah, they are.\nThey were coming because when I show up, you know, instead of getting seven people to to volunteer canvas, they got 50, right?\nYou know, or they raised triple the amount of money.\nThey and the morale is boosted and it's very it's really strategic what what we're doing.\nWe're building a firewall against what Trump is is attempting because th this is the place where people are going to be able to say, \"No, we're not going to do that, you know, or fight back on developing public land, anything.\"\nAnd when you say this is the place, you're talking about at the local level and with the utilities and and things like that.\nIs there a surprising place that you found?\nIs there an example of one where you thought, \"Oh, this is this is how this is going to work.\"\nWell, they teach us what's going to work.\nI mean, we we um and we've had a a we we flipped the the Virginia legislature.\nWe had 14 candidates running for the this is in 2023 for for the Virginia uh legislature and 13 of them won and it flipped Democratic.\nWow.\nYeah.\nSo that's the kind of thing that we try to do is is you you all know what a what a now I've forgotten the word trifecta.\nIs that what it is?\nWhen you you get governor, state senate, and state house, you got a trifecta.\nWe're going for the trifectas.\nAnd there's a lot more tri there's many more.\nI have the numbers down here someplace.\nMany more Democratic trifectas since Trump's first.\nThere's all kinds of reasons on the ground on in state and local levels why we're in a very better much better shape than we were the first time he was elected.\nWe've got more good people in office.\nWe have more trifectas.\nWe have more Democratic governors and so on.\nI mean, we're I see I'm not depressed.\nYou seem good.\nI am.\nAnd it's because you know Greta Greta Tunberg says everybody goes looking for hope.\nNo, look for action and hope will come.\nAnd I know personally in my heart and soul that that's true.\nThe more you do, the less depressed you're going to be because there's a lot of reasons to be hopeful.\nYeah.\nJane, have you seen a moment like this before in your over six decades of activism?\nAnd and how did you get through it?\nI have never seen.\nNo, we've ne never in human history has a situation like this existed where the Trump stuff is this working.\nOh yeah.\nOh yes.\nWe got you.\nUh I mean it's just y'all are facing this way, but we're facing this way and we're looking at that.\nI mean I'm from Los Angeles.\nThis is like wow.\nThis is why we have to fight this.\nYeah.\nUm, what was the question?\nIn historically, I mean, you've you've been through some bad moments where the country has gone in a way that you didn't agree with.\nNo, this has never happened.\nYeah.\nI mean, we b we have two crises, two essential crises.\nAnd for both, it's now or never.\nDemocracy and climate.\nAnd they are absolutely interlin.\nand we have to solve them together.\nWe're we're losing the de democratic infrastructure and norms to deal with the climate and we're losing the climate stability that is essential for a democracy.\nWe have to solve them together.\nAnd we've never faced, especially in America, we've never faced a threat like this to our democracy at a time when it's a perfect storm.\nat a time when we're being told by climate scientists, some of you may be in this room, that we have to cut our emissions, fossil fuel emissions, in half in 5 years.\nNow, you know, when I started to realize what was happening, it was 12 years.\nAnd we haven't done it.\nAnd now it's 5 years.\nBy 2030, we're supposed to cut our emissions in half and then gradually, not suddenly turn off this picket, but gradually phase out to zero by midentury.\nAnd we can do it because the alternatives are it's not just that they're there, but they're ready and they're being used all over the world.\nI urge you all to read Bill McKibben's new article in the New Yorker.\nIt's about the sun.\nIt's about the how robustly solar energy has taken over the world and no Trump is and his minions are going to be able to turn it around because it's safe, it's cheap, it's forever and it's job intensive.\nThere's way more jobs in that sector than in the fossil fuel sector.\nSo, I mean, what's not to love?\nWe just have to love it to life.\nNot love it to death.\nLove it to life.\nOh, that's a good slogan.\nYou saw it happen right here.\nBut this is great.\nJane, I feel like, you know, everybody in this room, I'm speaking for myself, but I would also think everybody in this room that's been working in climate for years is probably feeling a little bit depressed right now.\n\n\nUm, and just the shift that has happened. What advice can you give to us all to keep us all going and make us continue to fight the fight? And what can we do in times like this that are the most effective?\n\nWell, I think that the most important things to do very specifically is elect climate champions up and down the ballot all over the country starting yesterday. You know, there's we've already got about 28 special races this year and it's an off year, right? You know, we don't we can't just deal with elections, you know, like after Labor Day on the year of the election when the election is November. We have to, this is a year-round thing. Find out who's good. Let us know. Let the other organizations know that are working in this sector. Run yourselves. I mean, God, imagine if all of you were elected to office. Woo. It'd be a title, a tsunami coming at the fossil fuel people.\n\nBy the way, this is totally nons I mean, whatever. But Toyota, I bought my first Prius from Toyota. I thought Toyota was a good guy. To Toyota is the biggest funder of anti-climate work. They fund disinformation and they stop any progress that can happen. Did you know that most people don't know that? So I'm telling you.\n\nSo Jane, you know, it was interesting to we're listening to the session when we were backstage with the Paradise folks about um climate storytelling. You're a storyteller. You have been a storyteller for a long time. You're obviously an Academy Award-winning Actor, filmmaker. How does being a creator as the kids say? How does that influence your activism? And how does your activism influence the choices you make in terms of roles that you take or thing projects you decide to pursue?\n\nWell, I' I've always wanted to to support and fight for working women. So, I made 9 to 5. I don't like solar energy. Solar en I mean nuclear energy. I don't care what they tell you about these new small modular reactors. I've done some research. It's not the solution to the climate crisis. Okay. Okay. No, it's not. Time is of the essence. And these things the fastest take 10 years. Most of them take 20 years. And guess who ends up paying for it? Us.\n\nSpeaking of, you ask me what to do. Okay. Vote. Vote for climate champions. And the other thing is make people aware that in that horrible bill that just passed is I think around $20 billion dollar of our tax money goes to the fossil fuel industry and the form of subsidies and tax rebates and things like that. Most people don't know what's in the bill. And when they know that their Medicaid is being taken away and their food stamps are being taken away and the prices are going up because of the fossil fuel industry and at the same time that that's all being taken away from them, we're giving $20 billion to the people that are killing us. People have to know this. If we can, we have to raise the heat under the under them by letting people know what it is that he's done and he's getting away with it. The other thing speaking of not get we have to keep him from getting away with it. We have to protest all the time constantly. All kinds of protest including civil disobedience. You know, I don't know about you, but but every time I see a documentary about the civil rights movement, for example, or anti-aparttheid, where people are really being, you know, their batons and the dogs and the hoses and and I, you know, I ask myself, would I be brave enough? Could I have stood up to that? And I've realized, I don't have to ask anymore. This is it. This is our documentary moment. And so I'm sure you have people, young people, whose lives, you know, you'll die and they'll go on and what it's going to be like. So you want to do everything you can so they'll know that you tried that you fought for them and for their future. This is our documentary moment. So we have to and and we have to talk about what's in the bill. We have to let people know. We have to make them mad. we have to call their attention to the fact that that we're being made to pay for the things that are making us sick. Um I I think that those are the those are the the things that we have to do. And if we we do them, we won't be depressed.\n\nWell, that is at least that's my my and I know a lot of other people too. Hope is a muscle, you know. It's like the heart. It's the it's different than than optimism, you know. When optimism says everything's going to be fine and they don't do anything to make it so. Hope is the opposite. Hope is you're doing it and you're working hard and you're giving it your all and then and you don't you don't get depressed.\n\nWhat keeps you the most hopeful?\n\nMy my activ and my team. See, I've I've been through hell in terms of people hating me and being attacked by the government and everything. I know what it feels like. It's going to get worse than that though. Nixon, you know, he's like kindergarten. Come here. I mean, Nixon, you know, the first Earth Day was so huge that Nixon created the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the EPA. That was Nixon, a Republican, who did that. So, things are worse. Um, what was it that you asked me?\n\nWhat keeps you hopeful?\n\nWhat I do and the fact that I'm not alone. I'm part of a movement. I have a a board of of of people here and and then people believe in in in what I'm doing. That keeps me Michael Bloomberg. I mean, I guess it's appropriate to talk about him for a second. I've I've known some billionaires up close and personal and and they're different. You know, some people are billionaires and give away a lot of money because they want to go to heaven and they wanted to be considered a good guy. And then there's Michael Bloomberg. And it blows my mind. Here is this white male billionaire in New York who understands that in the climate space, what's strategic is listening to black women on the ground in Louisiana. It's unbelievable what his prochemical philanthropies have has done in the area which is the hot spot of the climate crisis, the Gulf of Mexico [Laughter] um along Texas and Louisiana where our shrimp and clams and oysters and fish come from. Don't eat them if they come from there. I mean, I've seen it up close and personal. They're killing people. They're wiping out entire communities. Like, every house has somebody in it that has cancer. And Michael Bloomberg is doing something about it. He is really, it just blows my mind. And another group that I think is represented here is Patagonia and Holfast and their CEO. And they've been very generous to the pack, too. So, that gives me hope. and um being with you know with with with a great board. My pack has a small board of experts and then just listening to the people that have talked here. There's so many people that are involved in this and I just don't think that we're going to let it I don't think we're going to let it go.\n\nI I have no doubt you're going to you're not letting it go. We I think\n\nWell, that doesn't matter.\n\nWell, I think it matters a great deal and I know that I I speak on behalf of the audience. We can pick those up on the way out. Um, we really appreciate your time, Jane. Thank you so much for coming up.\n\nBut everybody rise up, protest, make yourself heard, make people understand what's in that bill. You know, let's just not sit around talking about it. Let's really do it. Okay. I don't know how how many Raise your hand if you come from this area. Okay. I wish I could take all of your names cuz we're coming back. We We have to do something really brave here. This This is worth saving. And I I I learned from my friend Jay Ensley, you've already lost that tremendously important kelp forest that was here. That's gone. I mean, there's so many things going. So if I come back and and we put out the word, I hope all of those people who raise their hands will join us in doing something fun trouble, good trouble. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate you everyone. Thanks same time.\n",
