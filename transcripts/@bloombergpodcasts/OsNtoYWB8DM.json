has been a surge in energy consumption?\n\nI think we will.\nYou're right.\nIt's a challenge.\nI mean, our the agenda of President Trump is to unleash American energy.\nThe last four years, the Biden administration was more to shackle American energy.\nUm, but you're right, there's rapidly rising demand.\nAnd what we as the government need to do is enable private businesses to build the things they want to build and invest in the things they want to build.\nWe're not going to do this building ourselves, but we're going to enable private businesses to do it.\n\nWell, I'm glad that you brought up private businesses.\nAnd to kind of put a a finer point on this idea of urgency, we actually heard from Mark Zuckerberg yesterday pledging billions that Meta is going to invest in data centers, but it is raising concerns about an energy crisis to fuel it.\nI'm wondering, have you spoken to Mark Zuckerberg or Meta about their plans?\n\nOh, we speak Meta extensively about their plans and yeah, there's a number of the hyperscalers that have huge investment opportunities.\nWe're excited about that.\nThis is the the newest energyintensive industry to arise.\nThat's what artificial intelligence is, energyintensive industry.\nTaking the most sophisticated, most expensive form of energy, electricity, and turning it into intelligence to transform our world and protect our nation.\nUm, so yeah, Meta has huge investment plans as does Amazon and Microsoft and Google and the other players in that space.\nAnd we need all all of them will invest.\nIt'll it's a few hundred billion dollars this year.\nIn fact, you'll hear at the conference today announcements.\nIt was 70 and I think now $90 billion just in the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen you hear big investments though and how much energy that is going to take, what's your level of concern though that there is going to perhaps be such a great demand, can the US really keep up with it?\n\nAbsolutely.\nYou know, United States energy production because of the shale revolution just exploded in the last 10 or 12 years.\nPennsylvania is a massive energy producer today.\nPennsylvania exports more energy out of its state than any other state except for Texas.\nAnd P Pennsylvania could massively grow its energy production, just doesn't have enough pipeline capacity to move that natural gas out of the state.\nSo what's going to happen is more of that gas or additional gas will be consumed in Pennsylvania, turned into electricity, generated intelligence, and keep the United States ahead of China in the AI race.\nSo, I want to I want to talk about oil and I also want to welcome in our audience that has just joined us.\nWe are talking to the US Energy Secretary Christopher Wright.\nI'm Tyler Kendall.\nI want to show you some of these statistics that our analysts at Bloomberg pulled that the US oil rig count has dropped 13% since late February.\nIt's in the midst of its longest contraction since 2020.\nI know that there were some incentives in the reconciliation package, but what further incentives is the administration considering to help in uh uh get forward these these oil rigs to to continue drilling?\n\nMostly it's get out of the way.\nYou know, we had the Biden administration had four years all of government approach to try to, as they said, end fossil fuels.\nNow, that didn't work very well.\nWe went from 82% of American energy coming from fossil fuels before Biden took office to 82% exactly the same when he left office.\nThat those are just simply the energy sources that power our country and our world today.\nBut it's get out of the way of the marketplace.\nRight now, US production has grown so fast as has other places in the world that prices are maybe at the low end of profitability for producers here.\nSo you see a pullback in activity.\nYou're going to see with the these new investments and economic growth in the United States, we're going to see growth in demand for oil.\nAnd of course, that'll probably bump prices back up a little bit, keep drillers active.\n\nWell, you you mentioned there perhaps a lower price environment.\nAnd part of this also when we're talking about costs that these companies are facing has to do with tariffs, and I wanted to ask you about copper in particular, which is essential to data centers and getting energy to help power AI.\nWhat sort of impact is a 50% copper tariff set to go into effect on August 1st going to have when we're talking about the cost for energy infrastructure?\n\nWell, I think the biggest impact of that 50% tariff on copper is going to speed up copper mining in the United States.\nWe have enormous copper resources here.\nWe have some huge mines that have been trying to get going for years.\nWe want to get copper production growing rapidly in this country.\nCopper like steel is just essential to everything that happens in the world.\nShould we expect uh the energy industry to get some sort of tariff carveout moving forward?\nUh I believe the president uh plans no special carveouts.\nHe wants to reindustrialize the United States of America.\nThere's a lot of tools to do that.\nMake it easy to invest in the United States, make it attractive to invest in the United States, and tariffs are an additional uh element of that toolbox.\n\nI'm sure you're talking to industry though.\nIs a carveout on the table?\nAre there any negotiations underway for say the oil industry to get a carvette when it comes to the equipment that they use in the field like copper or steel for example?\n\nNo discussions right now.\nWe we we are hearing from the industry and of course this is true.\nIf you incrementally raise the cost of projects that hurts the economics of them.\nWe want to do everything we possibly can to maximize investments in the United States so jobs and opportunity come here to our country.\nLastly, I just want to ask you a geopolitical question because we did hear from President Trump yesterday threaten a 100% so-called uh secondary tariff on countries that import Russian energy supplies.\nIf that were to go into effect, what would that do to prices in the global energy market?\n\nUm, something like that would likely drive oil prices up.\nUm, I think President Trump's strong agenda there is to end the war in Ukraine.\nOur hope is that that large pressure will have an impact on Russia and we can bring just a brutal war in in Eastern Europe to an end.\nThat's President Trump's goal is prosperity at home and peace abroad.\nAnd uh the old formulas weren't working very well in that respect.\nSo yeah, President Trump has very different tools, very different negotiating skills, and very different level of boldness.\nI think we're going to see tremendous growth in peace abroad and prosperity at home.\n\nAll right, we have to leave it there.\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright.\nThank you so much for your time.\n",
