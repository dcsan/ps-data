  "cleanText": "The focus is Nvidia and AMD's ability to now sell in a limited way chips back into the Chinese market. Just your reaction generally to that.\n\nWell, and we still have a policy of not selling our state-of-the-art advanced semiconductors to China. And the H20 is not that. It's a heavily deprecated chip. And that's why the Biden administration allowed the sale of the H20 to China. And this is a continuation of that policy in the larger rubric of the trade negotiations that Secretary Besson was talking to you about. So this is a heavily deprecated chip. I think that like Secretary Besson said, there are some things that China wants from us. There are other things we want from China, and this was all part of the overall trade negotiation.\n\nDavid, you advised the president on AI policy as well as crypto policy. Do you have any sense of when he met with Jensen Huang last week at the White House, what case Mr. Hong made to the president that it was the right thing to get the American technology stack back into China?\n\nWell, Jensen's been making the case publicly for competing in China, and I think there are a lot of merits to the argument. If you look at developments over the past year, Huawei has advanced very rapidly. They have a new technology called cloud matrix, which networks together 384 of their Huawei Ascend chips. Now the Huawei chip is not as good as the Nvidia chip. The Nvidia chip is three times more powerful. But if you network together enough of those chips, you can brute force your way to a similar kind of result. And that is what Huawei has been developing as this cloud matrix 384. So, and there have been reports including from Bloomberg that they've started exporting that technology or they've been seeking to export it. So, Huawei is becoming much more competitive. And if you give the whole Chinese market to Huawei, it's a huge subsidy for their R&D, right? And it basically forces Chinese companies that might be willing to use the H20 to use the Huawei chip and to basically figure out basically to figure out the bugs, work out the kinks of the cloud matrix system and help Huawei scale that up. So I think there is a compelling argument here that you just don't want to hand Huawei the entire Chinese market when Nvidia is capable of competing for a big slice of it with a deprecated less capable chip. Again, we're not selling our latest greatest chips to China, but we can deprive Huawei of basically having this giant market share in China that they can then use to scale up and compete with us globally. So, I think this policy is nuanced, and I think it makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe report you were referring to that Bloomberg had was that Huawei was going out to some of the Gulf nations and also some of the Southeast Asian nations and offering prior generations of their chip, but also the cloud matrix that you mentioned. The concern being that in dealing with third countries, you know, that there be some Chinese access to other nations technology.\n\nHow involved have you been, David, in these kinds of talks in framing that the president's thinking that actually just having direct access to lower performance compute is okay with China right now?\n\nWell, look, I I don't want to I'm not going to discuss what I talked to the president about, but I mean, I can tell you what what I think, which is that the Bloomberg story discussed how Huawei was basically trying to make available the Huawei Ascend chip, which is their current chip, which is basically put together an Iraq system with cloud matrix to create a viable competitor to Nvidia. And I think it is a viable competitor. I think Nvidia and AMD and other American companies have a better product. But if we don't compete across the world, then we will hand the market to China. And one of the reasons that the president went to the Gulf States on that trip is to encourage business relations between the US and the Gulf state. He signed massive investment deals. And one of the deals that we signed was this new AI acceleration partnership where we want to create a pathway for the Gulf States like UAE to buy American technology, to buy American chips, and to create data centers on the American tech stack. And I can tell you that this I I I don't quite understand why this has proven to be so controversial in Washington. But where these these nations like the Gulf States, they have two choices. They can go with an American technology or they can go with a Chinese technology. And if you don't let them buy the American technology, you're pushing them into the arms of China. And a lot of people said, well, China won't be ready to sell for years. But now we see that there are reports that Huawei is out there trying to sell and export the the the Huawei Ascent chip. So I think it's very important that we enable our American companies to compete in the global market, that we don't tie their hands, that we don't hobble them, because again, it's a zero-sum game. That market share will either belong to our companies like Nvidia or it's going to belong to Chinese companies like Huawei. There's a very simple test for this. Just look at market share. If 5 years from now we look across the world and we see that Nvidia or other American companies have 80% market share, it means that we won the AI race. But if we look across the world in 5 years and see that Huawei has 80% market share, then it means that we lost the AI race. So, I think it's very important that we do everything we can to encourage American exports to be sure we can name our security standards, but this is a very easy trust but verify situation. The chips that we're talking about are really mainframe computers. They're 8 ft tall. They're 3600 lb. It's very easy to send inspectors into data centers and count the the server racks to make sure that they're where they're supposed to be. So, the security concerns can be addressed. I I understand that there are some security concerns, but I think they're very easily handled. And what we need to be doing is making sure that we win the AI race globally by making American technology the global standard and not letting not creating a Huawei Bolton Road.\n\nLive on Bloomberg Television and Radio worldwide, we're in conversation with David Sacks, senior policy adviser for AI and crypto, the AI and crypto Czar.\n\nDavid, I wrote my newsletter earlier this week about the analogy that Jensen Huang has been using that the American technology stack should be akin to the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. That's how he would like the administration to approach it. Do you share that view and and see some truth in that analogy?\n\nWell, here's the way I see it, and this is really, I think, a Silicon Valley view because I'm ultimately I've been a founder and investor in Silicon Valley for 25 years. And what we see is that the winning technology companies are always the ones that create the biggest ecosystem. They have the most developers on their platform. They have the most apps in their app store. And so, they work very, very hard to create a partner ecosystem. And I think that the United States needs to do something similar with the American technology stack. We want the most other countries using our technology because again it's a zero-sum game. And it's not just the chips, it's the operating system that runs on those chips. It's the AI models that then are run in these data centers. We want all of that to be American-made and American-powered. And you know, look, to be sure, there are security concerns and we can address them. I don't think that's that hard. But if we hobble our American companies and don't let them participate in the global market, again we are creating we are playing into China's arms and playing into their digital silk road. So I think to me this is a pretty easy question. I think we do want American technology to be the global standard. It is a little bit like the dollar. There is a network effect there. The reason why everyone loves the dollar is because they know that everybody else will accept it as well. So we do want to have the strongest dollar. We want to be the reserve currency and we do want our technology to be the global standard.\n\nDavid, Bloomberg reported this morning that on July 23rd, the president's going to speak in an event titled Winning the AI race, which you and the rest of the All-In Pod team will be hosting essentially. I guess that's going to be a moment where we'll have a more a fuller sense of what the president and this administration's big picture AI policy is going to be, what the big goals are going to be.\n\nThat's right. So the president will be giving a keynote address at that it's a one-day AI conference in Washington DC on July 23rd. It's co-hosted by the All-In and Hill and Valley Forum, which is also a DC and Silicon Valley policy group. And the president I think will be giving his first major address on the topic of artificial intelligence, building on the remarks that he's giving here in Pennsylvania today, which are also AI related and related to energy investment. The kinds of investments we have to make to power the next generation of AI.\n\nDavid, you've been speaking there in Pittsburgh this morning. What's the main focus on the energy side of this AI story? Energy security is a national security priority, but just simply whether enough whether we will have enough energy resources to power the goals of Meta and the other hyperscalers.\n\nWell, Pennsylvania is a huge energy producing state. I think it's our second biggest energy producing state. They're they have abundant natural gas, which I think in the near term is going to be the power source for these data centers. I think you know in about 5 years we could start seeing nuclear scale up and the administration believes in that too. We want an all of the above approach. But Pennsylvania is very big in natural gas and there are major investments being announced here for more for more basically fracking, for more grid infrastructure, for more power generation, all those things are are needed to power data centers. AI runs on GPUs that are incredibly power intensive and those these data centers of the future are going to need more power and the one area I think where America is a little bit behind. I mean I think we're winning the AI race pretty much at every level of the stack except that the size of our power grid has not increased very much over the past decade. If you go over to China, they've roughly doubled the size of their electric grid over the past decade where ours has only gone up by a couple of percent a year. So, this is an area where we need to make major new investments and the president is coming to Pennsylvania today to announce many of those investments. And I think you're this has been a major priority of the administration and I think you're going to see a lot more of.\n",
