  "cleanText": "Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio, news.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Intelligence Podcast.\nCatch us live weekdays at 10 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nListen on demand wherever you get your podcasts or watch us live on YouTube.\nWelcome back, Bloomberg Intelligence.\nI'm Lisa Matteo alongside Paul Sweeney.\nBig day for bank earnings.\nSome mixed reports though.\nTaking a look at the stock.\nWe have JPMorgan.\nThey're down, their shares down about half percent.\nWells Fargo down 5%.\nWe have Citigroup up about 1 and a.5%.\nSo here to break it all down for us and what happened with each bank is Alison Williams, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst, Global Banks and Asset Managers.\nAlison, thanks for joining us here in the studio.\nGood to see you.\nUm, so let's start with JPMorgan, right?\nThey had some surprise deal making gains.\nI mean, is that a sign that tariff fears are easing or how do you take it?\nYeah, I mean, they had a solid quarter.\nThere's always a high bar for JPMorgan, but I think a really good quarter, strong returns, uh, good organic growth, and I think, you know, about a billion dollars of upside with trading and fees.\nAnd so, I think that we, you know, we did see that that fee pick up.\nWe saw April stall, then we saw fees really did pick up in in May and June.\nAs you said, it really is the advisory business was big upside um you know for both JPMorgan and Citigroup and um we also saw IPOs better and so we have seen that improving sentiment.\nI think there is going to be a little bit of a lift in terms of some of the expectations for those banking fees going forward as well.\nRed headline crossing the Bloomberg terminal.\nTesla's top North America sales executive Troy Jones exits.\nThat's according to the Wall Street Journal.\nSo when it rains, it pours there.\nAll right, here we go.\nSo we had JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Report today.\nGuess what?\nI worked at all of those firms.\nChase Manhattan Bank, now part of JPMorgan.\nSolomon Brothers, now part of Citigroup.\nAnd Wheat First Securities, which is now part of Wells Fargo.\nThat's where Wells Fargo got its original broker dealer license by acquiring my firm, Weat Securities, Richmond, Virginia.\nSo I got I'm biased all over the place here.\nLet's start with Citigroup.\nI think that's got the most upside cuz I think it's underperformed for such a long time it was just begging for really really really good management.\nIs this I mean the stock's hitting 52- week high today.\nIs this the turnaround that everybody's been waiting for?\nDo you think?\nI think yeah Jane is getting it done right.\nSo, um, and and and to be fair, you know, her predecessors made some changes, but I think she's she's made some tough decisions, you know, especially the the sale of the, you know, the Mexico business where uh she really uh cut her teeth.\nI think that is a a sign that she can be objective in terms of deciding what's right for the business and they are working their way up um to some better returns.\nSo, you know, we there's a lot of talk about the evaluation for Citigroup.\nWe know that they trade at a discount to their book value.\nThey trade at a discount to their peers.\nWow.\nThat's what happens when you don't um earn your cost of capital and your returns are below peers.\nYum but I think the changes that they're making are moving them in the right direction.\nSo when I look at Wells Fargo because I'm trying to go through the the information.\nUm so the big thing that kind of stands out to me is that it crossed the 1.95 trillion asset mark.\nIs that a big milestone?\nWell, the removal of the asset cap that is really I think that the big structural benefit and I think that goes to the number that you're talking about where you know for years they had to limit their balance sheet growth.\nThey finally got the go-ahad that you know we don't have to be so concerned about what that exact number is.\nI think the stock has really um priced in a lot of the optimism around uh getting that asset cap removed.\nI mean basically has been um you know a huge gainer since the U.S election.\nI think the shares are responding today to the lower net interest income outlook.\nAnd I think there's a couple things there.\nThe the core net interest income that's what people focus on, right?\nbecause the the income that you get from trading generally has an offset to fees and but if you're just focusing on top on you're just focusing on that number people are disappointed in that outlook for Wells Fargo.\nWhat are you hearing from these banks uh today and and over the coming days about loan growth because it seems like with the you know yield curve steepening um it's a good time to be making loans.\nHow's the demand out there because all they hear about is private credit here, private credit there.\nHow about the banks?\nI mean we are we did see like things a little bit better.\nI would say that you know the the own grow loan growth is is still a bit modest but the expectation in terms of reduced risk to the economy is really a positive for these banks going into uh the second half.\nAnd so I think there's there's certainly room for improvement in the loan growth but I think things were fine.\nWell there's been the the loosening of regulations capital requirements for the banks.\nI mean, did this show up in the results or or or when will it?\nI think that's that is something that is going to come over time.\nI mean, we did see some some some good buybacks um at Wells Fargo, for example, but I think the big news was the stress tests that we saw in June basically are signaling that their capital hurdles are going lower.\num further a proposal out there that um you know there we're going to have sort of average results over time.\nSo that for this year means that the the you know the decreases might not be as much and they might come a little bit later but we think that's positive over time because what that means is that there'll be more stabilization and not sort of these ratios moving around a lot.\nSo, lots of excess capital at the banks, even more as those ratios go lower.\nThat means uh more buybacks, especially since we expect that any further regulations are not going to be as drastic.\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they report tomorrow.\nI always love looking at, you know, the way you guys analyze kind of league tables and how people are doing competitively.\nWhat do you expect to hear from those two investment banks?\nI mean, so we expect strength.\nI mean this the the the results that we saw today in terms of uh fixed income trading better than expected equities trading better than expected fees almost across the board better than expected.\nWe talked about the IPOs like that's a really good sign for uh Morgan Stanley and Goldman the M&A you know uh Goldman is typically an M&A leader there although JPMorgan has really been catching up.\nSo those are all very positive signals.\nI mean, 27% growth year-over-year in uh Citigroup's rates and currencies business.\nThat is a really strong result.\nAnd, you know, Goldman and Morgan Stanley lead in the equities.\nThey earn the most from these businesses.\nSo, I think that, you know, the bar is definitely higher for them tomorrow.\nAll right.\nGood stuff.\nWe appreciate it.\nAlison Williams, senior analyst, Global Banks, Asset Managers, Bloomberg Intelligence.\nShe's been doing it for a long time.\nShe worked on the buy side at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, investing in uh these big banks.\nSo, she knows what she's doing.\nShe's got a great team uh there at Bloomberg Intelligence on a global basis looking at some of the big global uh banks around the world.\nSo, I appreciate getting a couple minutes of her time.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Intelligence Podcast.\nCatch us live weekdays at 10 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nListen on demand wherever you get your podcasts or watch us live on YouTube.\nwant to turn our attention to healthcare company uh managed care company UnitedHealth Group.\nIt's a big company, $267 billion, uh in market cap.\nIt's down 40% year to date, but it's had a distinction of having, I think, 60 consecutive quarters that kind of beat earnings estimates out there.\nBut I think analysts are starting to take another look at some of those earnings numbers and taking a look at how this company put those numbers up.\nAnd I remember this kind of story back in the day from General Electric where they would just beat by a couple of pennies every single quarter.\nUh but that turned out to be a little bit of a mirage when you go back and look at some of the the data there.\nUh Michelle Davis joins us here, Bloomberg senior deals reporter.\nMichelle, what'd you find when you're looking at United Healthcare?\nHow are they making some of those numbers recently?\nSo yeah, as you mentioned, they had kind of a pristine record for more than 60 quarters.\nThey beat estimates.\nAnalysts love them.\nAnd at the end of last year, that got a bit harder for them to keep up.\nYou know, medical costs were rising.\nThe government's been cracking down on on reimbursements, and that was eating into profits.\nAnd so, what we reported is that at the end of last year, they approached several private equity firms and asked them if they wanted to buy stakes off of them of their businesses.\nAnd a couple interesting things happened here.\nNot only did they quietly do this, but the deals were structured such that United Health can be forced to buy the businesses back down the road.\nSo, it's temporary in nature.\nAnd um United booked the gains in an interesting place.\nThey booked them as part of operating earnings, which is or adjusted earnings, which is normally where you look to see kind of how a business is doing, you know, excluding one-off gains or one-off events like this.\nAnd so it was just interesting to see not only the fact that they stealthily did this but where they put them and and without these gains they would have missed estimates and profit would have dropped uh in the last quarter of last year.\nSo as I'm going through this article this this certain quote stands out for me from an analyst that you spoke to.\nHe said if the company is manufacturing earnings by chopping up their furniture or selling their assets that's not exactly a great business model.\nOkay.\nSo, is the risk that it might be kind of masking this weakness in the operations?\nThat's the concern.\nAnd just to be clear, you know, there's nothing illegal about what they're doing per se.\nYou know, they disclosed that they did this.\nMost people didn't see it.\nIt was in a footnote in their 10K that kind of went under the radar.\nThere are no details about what exactly they sold.\nThat's what we're trying to, you know, report on here.\nBut yeah, the the concern is it clouds, you know, your ability to see how the business is actually performing.\nand and we heard from sources that there's a culture inside United Health of, you know, kind of there being this pressure to do whatever you can to meet targets every quarter.\nYep.\nUm so again, the stock, it's a huge company, huge player in the managed care business, but stock's down 40%.\nWhat's the underlying concern for investors out there, do you think, around this company?\nUnited Health has been dealing with a lot of things.\nI mean, even before we knew about this, uh there was obviously the the tragedy of, you know, one of their executives being um murdered last year and then, you know, there was a Wall Street Journal investigation this year about potential Medicare fraud, which they have denied.\nThey also in the first quarter reported their first earnings miss in, you know, more than 60 quarters.\nSo, that shoe finally dropped.\nThey ousted their CEO.\nSo, investors are just concerned about the story here.\nYou know, what what is the United Health story?\nI think that's what the big concern is.\nSo, are there any other companies like maybe other health companies or or or something like that where this same story that you've been talking about kind of plays out?\nNot that we could find.\nIt seems like United Health is really, you know, unique in its um ability and and history of, you know, really carefully managing um its reporting every quarter.\nSo, new management team here.\nWhat's kind of the focus now of the company?\nWhat's kind of the message to Wall Street about how they're I guess going to try to turn this thing around?\nSo, they brought in their former CEO who is a accountant by by nature and it seems like the market's pretty uh they've been put at ease by him.\nThe view or the hope from analysts is that the last quarter was kind of an anomaly and they were just bleeding out all the bad stuff and now they'll have a lower base to kind of beat off of.\nThey report earnings later this month.\nSo, so we'll see, you know, how the business is actually doing.\nThe big surprise in the first quarter was that um you know medical costs were a lot higher than than they say they they anticipated.\nThat was confusing to people because their job is to anticipate that.\nBut that's what I when we when we're reporting on that story a couple weeks ago I said isn't that the job of the company to know how that's going to go.\nAll right.\nI'm looking at the ANR function on the Bloomberg terminal that had tracks analyst recommendations.\nAnd if you're not at health there 21 buys, okay, six holds and two sells.\nSo, you know, I think the streets still generally buying off on this maybe this turnaround story, but maybe they'll take a look at your your story here today.\nMichelle Davis, thank you so much for joining us.\nUh Michelle Davis is a senior deals reporter for Bloomberg News joining us live here in our Bloomberg Interactive uh broker studio.\nUh but it's interesting to see on that on the healthcare space.\nAnd again, I always you come in here every Monday, Lisa, and it's like there's an M&A deal coming out of the healthcare space, which keeps the likes of Michelle Davis busy on the deal front.\nBut it's again, we see it time and time again in the healthcare space.\nIf you can't come up with that next drug or that next, you know, procedure, whatever in your R&D lab, you got to join up.\nYou got to go buy somebody, you know, you got to go go buy somebody.\nAnd that's how the that business has played.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Intelligence podcast.\nCatch us live weekdays at 10 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nListen on demand wherever you get your podcasts or watch us live on YouTube.\nAll right, Lisa, Matteo, Paul Sweeney.\nWe're live here in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio streaming live on YouTube.\nSo check us out there.\nUm, you know, to the extent I've had any\n\n\nLuck in meeting other people.\nIt's been at a bar and no dating apps here.\nI know.\nI know.\nI met my husband at the grease trucks at Ruckers after who doesn't having burgers.\nThere you go.\nNow, dating apps must evolve as Gen Z redefines romance.\nThat's according to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey.\nWe're going there, folks.\nWe're going down that rabbit hole.\nNicole D'Souza joins us here, internet and software equity analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.\nNicole, what's your survey?\nWhat are the questions that asked and and what did you find?\nYeah.\nSo, uh, we at Bloomberg Intelligence conducted the survey to better understand how people are navigating dating, how they use dating apps, and then also how they feel about AI within dating apps.\nUh and so some really interesting findings.\nFirst, that, you know, specifically Gen Z tends to be single but not dating.\nGen Z is what age again?\n16 to 28.\n16 to 28.\nAll right.\nSo, I got single.\nTwo of my four are into that one.\nOkay.\nGo ahead.\nAnd so, they're not using the apps.\nThey're not even dating.\nUh, single and not dating.\nSo this is I mean there's a few reasons.\nStudies have kind of shown they do have higher rates of loneliness.\nUh, but they are also prioritizing independence.\nThey are also uh, you know, feeling a reduced stigma around being single.\nUh, so it could really change dating patterns generationally.\nI can kind of say my son was on a dating app and then he stopped because he got tired of it and it just and he's in that Gen Z kind of group.\nUm, and they're not going to pay for them too.\nSo, how does that change for these different, you know, dating apps out there?\nHow do they have to change their approach?\nSo, right now, uh, a lot of what we're seeing from Gen Z is that even though they are dating less, they are looking for long-term relationships.\nThose that are dating, they are looking to form meaningful connections.\nSo, you know, some of the products we've seen from these dating apps that really introduce AI are more around how to create a profile, how to make it easier to talk to people, you know, using AI to generate prompts.\nThat might not necessarily, you know, correlate with what Gen Z is looking for in terms of forming a meaningful connection.\nI'll tell you, Lisa, go to the Parker House in Seagirt, New Jersey on a summer Saturday, New Jersey.\nThousands and thousands of kids of Gen Z type are there at like 4:00 in the afternoon.\nThey're not on the beach.\nThey're all made up dressed to the nines.\nI think they're looking to hook to, you know, meet somebody.\nI know.\nI've been there.\nI had to wait on my dress.\nSo, I mean, I don't know what's going on.\nHow about millennials?\nHow do they fare?\nSo, millennials are they kind of came of age during the time of dating apps.\nSo a lot of dating apps are really created to target dating patterns of millennials.\nSo millennials have a more favorable relationship with dating apps and they also are much more like comfortable with AI in dating apps uh versus Gen Z which was surprising to us.\nNow what about Okay, people always forget about Gen X.\nThe Gen X folks.\nWhat about Yeah.\nSo what about Gen X?\nAnd then you know my my mom you know single like she wants to find out about these apps.\nI'm telling you.\nWhat about the older generation?\nThey're on dating apps.\nUm, so they're on it.\nThere are Yeah, there are a lot of Gen X and baby boomers on dating apps.\nAnd there are a wide variety of dating apps to kind of address different age groups, different, you know, things that people are looking for.\nSo, they're they're available.\nHow does AI have to ask the AI question because because we had a guest on earlier about I walked out of there thinking AI is going to take over Wall Street.\nHow about AI and dating apps?\nthat I would think could be helpful to better select somebody who might be a good match or something.\nSo, we've seen dating app companies roll out a lot of AI products.\nUm, I would say right now it seems, at least based on our survey, that they haven't been that well-received.\nIt seems like people don't necessarily need AI to build a better profile.\nThey don't need AI to help them engage in conversation.\nI think where it has been helpful is user safety.\nSo to weed out profiles that are fake or you know potentially send people who are sending harmful messages.\nUm, and that is a common complaint but um as of right now it doesn't seem that you know at least Gen Z and even some millennials are really really adopting these new AI products.\nSo are there certain a dating apps that are more popular than others?\nI mean which are the hot ones right now?\nSo right now at least um by users Tinder has by far the most users.\nowned by Hinge is actually one of the few dating apps that is continuing to grow users.\nAnd that's probably because Hinge focuses a little bit more kind of long-term relationships, building meaningful connections.\nTinder still has a reputation of kind of a hookup app.\nYes.\nUm, which one is that?\nTinder.\nYeah, that's what my son was on.\nA hookup app.\nOh my god.\nAnd I mean, I'm looking at uh uh Nicole's research report.\nI mean, she's got graphs here of like, I'm in a monogamous relationship.\nI'm single and currently dating.\nI'm in an open relationship.\nSingle but not dating.\nIn a casual relationship by demo by baby boomers, Gen X millennials.\nI mean, who knew?\nThis is a lot of research here, dudes, on dating.\nI mean, go to a bar, you know, have a cocktail, relax.\nI don't know.\nI don't know.\nIt's good stuff here.\nBut Nicole, thanks so much for joining us.\nGreat research again at BI's cutting edge research.\nBloomberg Intelligence uh using some survey data here to go out and take a look at how some of these um these apps are working out there.\nNicole D'Souza, she covers all the uh internet stuff and all the uh software stuff for Bloomberg Intelligence.\nYou're listening to the Bloomberg Intelligence podcast.\nCatch us live weekdays at 10 a.m. Eastern on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.\nListen on demand wherever you get your podcasts or watch us live on YouTube.\nBlack Rockck.\nUm, you know, the stock's down, but I mean, it's Black Rockck.\nI mean, 1.5 trillion in assets under management.\nI can't get my mind around that.\nUh, it's just an extraordinary st uh story.\nAnd by the way, it's separated from Black Stone.\nI mean, imagine if those two were together.\nHoly cow.\nAnyway, I mean, it's got a market cap of 160 billion.\nBlack Rockck is down 6% today.\nUm, up about 1% for the year.\nUh, Neil Sipes is in studio.\nHe's got to explain to us what's going on there.\nHe covers all the asset managers for Bloomberg Intelligence.\nNeil, talk to us about Black Rockck Gear.\nThey never seem to have problems getting money in the past.\nWhat's going on?\nYeah.\nUh, and I think what you're seeing a little bit in the second quarter is the net inflow figure was about half the first quarter.\nUh, so perhaps a little bit slower than than the analysts were expecting.\nUh, but what I think is encouraging and and sort of what we're seeing with the transition, you even mentioned Blackstone.\nBlack Rockck is trying to enter some of those businesses in a more meaningful way that Blackstone is involved in the private markets.\nWe saw the handful of transactions last year, global infrastructure partners, HPS.\nUh, and what this is going to do is really sort of improve the organic base fee growth.\nSo, while we're seeing a little bit slower on the net inflow figure in terms of broader asset growth, uh, what it means is as we push further into those private markets, those higher fee products, uh, that organic growth is actually more meaningful to the fundamentals of the business.\nSo, we're going to see a little bit of a transition here.\nI think perhaps that's what you're seeing uh in the second quarter results today is that sort of slower inflow growth uh but perhaps still pretty robust base fee growth.\nAnd let's not forget the second quarter was uh really a tale of two stories.\nA rather unique quarter with a very challenging April and an incredible May and June.\nSo uh that is also sort of balanced in the results.\nUm, now a lot of investors look to what the executives are saying.\nSo what kind of tone did did CEO Larry Fink take?\nYeah, I I think he struck a generally positive tone especially considering the sort of broader macro uncertainties that are still out there.\nIt feels like we've certainly moved back from some of the the more worst case scenarios, we'll call them, but there's still certainly quite a bit of uncertainty, but when you look at equity markets, uh you don't necessarily see it, right?\nAll-time highs uh pretty much in the global equities uh landscape.\nAnd so that's generally a positive for asset managers, particularly someone like Black Rockck.\nAnd what they've talked about is they experience momentum exiting the second quarter and into the third quarter.\nUh, clients continue to remain engaged.\nUh, they haven't necessarily pulled away in sort of the volatility that we saw and some of the uncertainty that we talk about.\nUm, so that sort of creates a solid setup for Black Rockck moving forward.\nAll right.\nSo for the asset managers you like when I grew up in the business the biggest customers on Wall Street were the mutual funds and then hedge funds became big.\nNow it's ETFs.\nHow do the asset managers that you deal with, you know, think about it?\nJust seems like all the money is going to ETFs.\nHow do your asset managers deal with that?\nYeah.\nUh, well well there's the way you deal with it is enter the ETF space to sort of capture that flow.\nBut that is a business where scale is paramount because you talk about ETFs, you're thinking about average 10 basis point fee rate, right?\nYou're not going to earn quite a bit.\nThe margins are going to be razor thin unless you're the size of Black Rockck who garners 30% of the market in US ETFs.\nThat can be a profitable business.\nYep.\nThought it was Vanguard.\nAnd that's actually been shrinking from over 40%.\nVanguard's the one that's sort of nipping at the heels, but again, it's sort of an oligopoly with Vanguard, Black Rockck, and Fidelity in the ETF space, but how do you complement that in a business where the flows are increasingly going to ETFs?\nWell, they're also going to private markets, and that's why you saw again Black Rockck push into that space last year.\nAll right, Neil, thanks so much.\nWe appreciate it.\nUh, Neil Sipes all the banks and asset managers for Bloomberg and Tons.\nThis is the Bloomberg Intelligence Podcast,
