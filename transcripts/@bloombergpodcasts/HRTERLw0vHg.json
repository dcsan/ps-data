  "cleanText": "Whether it's JPMorgan, I always say covering JPMorgan is like covering, you know, for big companies.\nRight?\nOr, you know, depending on how they've done their division.\nI guess it's three big companies now.\nSo, you know, really the net interest income guidance, very strong, about 600 million upside to the franchise.\nI went back and forth of Valerie title in London.\nThey did a tangible equity of 20% plus.\nAm I right?\nCitigroup's half that.\nYou are right.\nI mean, if you look at, you know, so if you look at Citigroup, it's a very different story.\nRight.\nSo Citigroup is still in a story of transition.\nWe've been talking about that transition, as we say, ever since Sandy built the house.\nIt's been being taken apart.\nAnd I think Jane Fraser is making a lot of tough decisions there and really solid quarter out of Citigroup as well.\nYou know, they're upping their net interest income guidance, their fixed income trading up 20%.\nSo that's it that, you know, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were up 13 to 14%.\nYou know, Citigroup has an amazing rates and currencies trading business, as you know, Paul, and that is really where the strength is this quarter.\nThat's where the volatility is and they are really executing in that business.\nAgain, coordinated interest income going up for both of those banks.\nWells Fargo a little softer, but Wells Fargo is looking at the overall number.\nKeep in mind that there is corn at interest income and then there's a number that includes trading.\nAnd so they're trading net interest income tends to be off set and fees.\nI think from a headline perspective, people are sort of going to be less positive on those Wells Fargo results.\nWells Fargo also not getting this huge benefit.\nSo as I said, they saw some growth in fixed income trading.\nBut Wells, you know JPMorgan and said a much stronger in those businesses.\nJPMorgan delivering $1,000,000,000 of upside in their trading in fee.\nI haven't done the calculation yet for Citigroup but the trends also better for Citi.\nAre what are the banks saying about loan origination?\nAre they writing loans?\nWe were just talking to Chris Van CNS and Oliver Wyman about private credit.\nAnd I just think back to my Chase Manhattan days.\nWe were killing it on the leveraged loan business, making money upfront, making money on the spread, syndicating my risk out to every other bank around the country.\nWhat are they making loans these days?\nSo.\nSo they are making loans.\nI mean, you know that that the card business which is probably not your concern back then or now, but know the card business is very profitable for these banks and that's where the loan growth has been.\nAnd again, that's benefiting Citi and JPMorgan.\nWe have seen a little bit of pickup in that commercial numbers in, you know, in their Fed data.\nWe're going to hear what Bank of America says tomorrow on that.\nI think with regard to private, you know, it it is a change.\nBut I think if you look at, for example, Goldman's business.\nSo, Paul, you know, Goldman, you know, their merchant banking business, you know that they, you know, back in the day made a lot of money from making these proprietary investments.\nVolcker Rule came along and said, please don't do that on your balance sheet.\nBy the way, investors don't like the balance sheet, right?\nBecause when you make those kind of investments and you're recording gains, people don't really give you a lot of credit because they view them as valuable, volatile, etc..\nBut you have someone like Goldman who's now said, I'm going to be an alternative asset manager, and now instead of putting my balance sheet right at risk, I'm going to, you know, take the client's money.\nSo and I'm going to earn fees.\nAnd investors like that, they like asset management.\nIt's a high multiple business.\nAnd so it's a higher return on equity business.\nAnd that's been a long term story at Goldman.\nSo I think the banks are fine and that so that's a Goldman specific, but I think all the banks are doing that.\nOkay.\nI want to go to the gossip of the moment.\nFolks out in the Hamptons over a beverage of her choice, Alison Williams, is getting hammered by fancy people over the reorg under Mary Erdos, JPMorgan there.\nFirst of all, I'm going to say they're the most successful bank asset manager, the only one really competing with BlackRock and the others.\nSo Mary's built the franchise and now they're saying geography doesn't matter anymore.\nThe Wall Street Journal had this great summary of it.\nExplain to us how JPMorgan and Mary Arrow's is blowing up asset management, private wealth.\nWell, I think that, you know, Mary Erdos is first and foremost thoughtful about the talent across her business.\nAnd, you know, is is consistently talking about the strength they have as an active manager.\nBut one of the more interesting things that Eric Balchunas is, as you know, who's the expert on this you're talking about is that they are really gaining share in the active ETF business.\nAnd so.\nSo that's not your that's not your question.\nBut that is something that I that I want to highlight that I think is something happening here that we're in a bull market.\nThey're minting more money than God.\nAnd JPMorgan is saying we got a problem.\nWe got to blow up private wealth management.\nWhy are they blowing it up and what's the goal?\nWell, again, I don't know.\nI think that Mary Erdos is a very thoughtful leader.\nAnd I think that, again, it's sort of like as we're as we're going through the future, we've been through a long period of what we call U.S.\nexceptionalism.\nBut I think that JPMorgan has always focused on the world at large, focused on emerging markets, focused on these different growth opportunities.\nAnd I think it's just a way and by the way, JPMorgan, I think, is always, as I alluded to earlier, you know, looking at things differently, when you're a global organization, you have products and you have regions.\nI think sometimes you have to find a way to focus on on both.\nAnd again, I just I go back to the fact that they're very focused on talent.\nAnd I think that they're thoughtful about the way they run their business.\n",
