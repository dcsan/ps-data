don't want anyone to see that.\nThis is the first time.\nI mean, it was just a glimpse.\nJust a glimpse, but I feel like I caught a flash of some shorts, short pants.\nIt's super inappropriate for work, obviously.\nI'm even wearing flip flops, which I would...\nOh, no.\nPlease no.\nI don't need to see that.\nThat's going too far.\nThat's an HR violation.\nBy the way, do you know that I have, um, I don't wear shorts much in public because I have a huge skin graft on my leg.\nIs that from your motorcycle accident?\nYeah.\nI did not know that.\nWhen I got hit, um, I got hit by a truck, basically, that crossed over the double yellow line, and it hit me, not head-on, but almost just to the side, and so my left leg was crushed between the truck, which ironically was a Dodge, and my motorcycle, and, uh, that caused so much swelling that they had to open up my leg in a few places in what's called a fasciotomy, and I had to leave it like open and swollen for a month in the hospital before they closed it.\nAnd when they did close it, they didn't have enough skin.\nSo, they had to take a big patch of skin, basically, from my upper thigh and and close it on, uh, so now I have basically what it looks like, a split top loaf of bread on my calf.\nWhoa.\nAnd I'm thinking about getting it tattooed into a shark.\nI was just going to say it sounds like a fertile ground for some ink.\nIt would be perfect, but I'm, I think it would hurt a lot.\nIt definitely, I feel like that would definitely hurt.\nIt would definitely hurt.\nWow, that seems extensive.\nI had no idea.\nNo wonder.\nNo wonder you're always in pants at the office.\nI knew that was suspicious.\nOh, yes.\nUm...\nSo, you're in Italy.\nYou've been there for a minute.\nSounds like...\nI'm in Italy.\nUh, it's been, it's, obviously, it's amazing.\nWe're in the countryside outside of, uh, Sienna and Tuscany, and, um, but I rented, I think, I'm not sure if I rented the right car for the whole situation.\nI, I desperately wanted to get a big van, and I was talking to, to a lady at Hertz, and I was like, you know, for me, a van screams like family vacation, and when my parents took us for the first time to Europe, they rented a big white, you know, like Mercedes Sprinter or I don't know what it was, uh, Ford Transit.\nIt could have been.\nAnd it was like a almost like a school bus van.\nIt wasn't fancy.\nAnd we had a great time in it.\nSo, I wanted to do the same thing.\nBut the church lady talked me out of it.\nInto what?\nWell, so since she talked me out of it, I looked and I saw, I looked at sixth, because there wasn't anything else.\nYes.\nI've used six.\nYeah.\nAnd I love they have like really nice cars.\nYes.\nSo, I saw that they had an Audi A6 Avant that was fully electric, and I thought, let me try this because it has 400, like, massive amount of range, 420 mi of range.\nOkay.\nAnd I love, you know, a wagon, and the A6, um, you know, looks, you know, looks like you're doing well if you're driving A6.\nAnd...\nthis is what we want.\nExactly.\nYou know, and so, but I went to pick it up and they said, \"Here's your BMW i5 E40.\"\nAnd I was like, \"That's not the same thing.\"\nBecause...\nI mean, it's the E40, so it wasn't even the, if it was the 50 or the 60, maybe, but it had far less range.\nAnd...\nyou know, there's not a lot of...\na bit of a bait and switch.\nSo, exactly.\nSo, then they said, \"How about an iX?\"\nBecause the Audi A6 isn't fully charged.\nSure.\nSo, I have enjoyed the EX in the past.\nIt just doesn't have the same kind of rugged vacation feeling.\nIt doesn't have the gravitas.\nI remember.\nYeah.\nIt, it, to me, the EX, it seems like it was a concept car that they were like, \"All right, let's just release it.\nMight as well, you know.\"\nYeah.\nWe're already at this, this far down the road.\nI think I remember the same thing, and I know I reviewed it.\nIt was like, it was good, but it doesn't, it's just like...\nSomething's missing.\nYeah, it's weird.\nI mean, the doors are so light, and I get that the whole thing is a carbon fiber monocock shell, and so it's technologically advanced, and that's great for an electric car.\nYou want it light, but when you close it, it feels like a toy, or it feels like they, they weren't finished, you know?\nYeah.\nYeah, I get it.\nI get it.\nWell, how has the range been for you while you're driving around Italy?\nThe range has been really good.\nIt started at 531 km, and, uh, we got here about 300, 300 km away, and I was only 330 down.\nSo now it's just 200.\nUh, obviously, I drive like a bat out of hell, but...\nI would hope nothing less.\nWhere are you charging it?\nThat's the big problem.\nThat's the problem.\nSo now we've gotten to this remote, um, villa in Tuscany, which is the point of going to Tuscany.\nYou go, you want a remote villa.\nExactly.\nAnd there's no place to charge it here.\nSo, when we go into town, we're going to go into town tonight to watch, um, this, this mini paleo, so a little horse race or the beginning of the ceremonies, uh, for it.\nAnd I'm going to hope to find an electric charger while we're in town that I can use to charge the car, but also in Europe, the electric charger parking spots are kind of a cheat code.\nSince nobody else has an electric car, nobody can park there.\nSo, that's the only place that's open to park.\nSounds good.\nThat is a good cheat code, actually.\nYou get better parking that way.\nWe should, we should really talk about, um, I feel like there's so much going on in the car.\nWell, Goodwood is happening this weekend.\nObviously, you and I are not at Goodwood, but there's a lot of car stuff happening.\nThat's a huge bummer that we're not there.\nThat neither one of us is there.\nI know.\nI...\nWhy aren't you there?\nUm, honestly, and you know, I was just in the UK this entire week.\nI've just returned from being in England.\nUm, but decided not to stay over, honestly, because...\nI didn't need to.\nIt's, look, Goodwood is, is great.\nI think everyone should go at least once.\nI've been a couple times.\nIt's kind of the same every year.\nUm, it's not my favorite event.\nThere's no real huge news.\nIt's really good for networking, and it's great for car fans, and it's fun.\nUm, also the logistics are really challenging and complicated.\nIt's tough to find places to stay and park.\nSpeaking of parking, so I don't know.\nI just decided not to go.\nI didn't want to be gone that long.\nBut you were in England.\nI saw.\nWere you driving a Defender?\nAn old Defender?\nUm, sadly, that was not my car.\nOh, I see.\nThat was, that was a...\nI wished I was driving a Defender.\nNo, I was driving in a Honda Jazz visiting all the stately homes.\nI saw that too.\nI saw the Honda steering wheel.\nThe Jazz is the tiny one, right?\nBeing fied around by an 81-year-old woman for days.\nIt was...\nAnd I...\nAnd it was great.\nAnd she's a great driver, I have to say, too.\nThat was my mother-in-law, by the way.\nSo, what do you think about that little car?\nAnd we should talk at some point, not now, because I haven't done any research about tiny little cars because we both love the Fiat 500.\nYes.\nAnd the Honda Jazz is, I feel like maybe even smaller.\nI think it's comparable.\nIt's pretty small.\nHonestly, by the end of the week, you know, I'm, I'm around six feet, um, in my heels.\nI was in pain.\nBack, the back seat of that car.\nThe seats are about as thick as cardboard, and they don't necessarily recline.\nThey're not especially supportive in your lumbar region.\nUm, so it, it was, by the end of it, yeah, it felt really small.\nBut all that to say, I really like small cars, and they really make sense on those tiny roads in Yorkshire, which are about one and a half lanes wide, you know, and you really kind of hold your breath when you pass people if you pass people.\nAnd I, I really found that the Brits kind of just drive in the middle of the road up there because the road's so small anyway, you know, they, it's, they don't drive on the right or the left.\nThey just drive in the middle.\nIt's pretty.\nAnd if you're an 81-year-old woman, it's a great car.\nLike, it's a...\nYes, for her.\nShe loves it.\nIt's perfect for her.\nUm, Harry, her boyfriend, who is 92 or 93, he has a Kia station wagon that he still drives.\nAnd in fact, he met us at the pub one night and drove himself home.\nAnd actually, you know, we're all kind of holding our breath evaluating him as he pulls out from the parking lot.\nI think he's solid.\nI actually think he's doing a good job after like a three or four pints.\nNo, no, he, he had a half a pint.\nHe had a, and this is on the record.\nHe had a half a point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point, p, point of some IPA, and, uh, so he was under the, he was, he was within his, his legal limits, and, uh, 90, he's either 92 or 93, you know, a prince of a guy, and he was killing it, and speaking of estate, no, what estate car, I think they call him estates, yeah, um, he was, he was doing great.\nWell, that's fantastic.\nI hope I'm still driving when I'm 93 years old.\nYeah, there...\nThere was some...\nI'm sure we may get letters about this.\nI'd actually love to know what our readers think about how you navigate when your parents get to be in their 80s and still want to drive.\nAnd so I have that, I have the, the problem that my dad's only 76, but...\nOkay, tell me.\ndeclined in some, um, senses of capability.\nMental or physical, like reaction times?\nNo, not physical.\nUh, you know, he has decided that stop signs don't apply to him, you know, and, um, he literally just breezes through them.\nSo, and it's just new behavior for him.\nIt's new behavior, and it's like a, um, a moral and legal problem for my family because we are all, we've taken the keys away.\nWe've literally hidden cars, you know, taken his car and cared to other people's houses.\nOh, no way.\nAnd he frankly shouldn't be driving anymore.\nBut there's, there's nothing you can do, uh, especially if the, um, subject is a lawyer, um, gosh, who's still, you know, ready to wage a suit to, to stop someone from driving, except for have a doctor demand a test.\nAnd if, you know, said lawyer passes that test, because on that day, for those minutes, he's paying great attention, um, you can't tell a grown man or woman, um, he or she is not allowed to drive, and that is a problem if you think, you know, because we're intimately associated with him, we know he shouldn't be driving, but he refuses to acknowledge that, and I think you should have to retest, um...\nyes...\nyou know, every few years or, or whatever, after you're 70, and not just a written test, a, a physical driving test is what you're saying.\nYeah, we, we talked about it, and I think, um, England may have some sort of mandatory testing, but you're right, sometimes people, you, you can pass the test on a given day and still not be really at in peak driving performance form.\nBut you're right, it comes down to like personal freedom.\nYou can't tell a, uh, someone who doesn't want to give up their keys, you got to give up the key.\nIt's a freedom thing.\nI get it.\nYou know, and then, of course, the other side is, if they're not driving themselves, who's going to drive them around, right?\nThankfully, thankfully, um, you know, even in Granville, Ohio, where I'm from, there's a plethora of Uber...\nOh, that's good.\nServices.\nSo, as you know, as I think in my dad's case, at least, he's growing more and more aware of his capabilities and incapabilities and has decided for the most part to use the local, it's not Uber, but, you know, the town, uh, taxi guy.\nOh, that's good.\nUm, but I'm sure a lot of people face real problems with that.\nI think it's a, I really think it's a thing.\nIt's interesting to think about, you know, it's tough.\n[Music]\nYou want to talk about, uh...\nI want to talk about Rimac.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI was just going to say that speed record.\nSo, I don't know anything about these cars.\nAnd the only time, and the only time I ever see anything about Rimac is when I'm either reading stories that you've written or looking at Rob Report or, um, you know, or it's usually some F1 driver who's, you know, bought himself one.\nAnd those are, I feel like it's only retired F1 drivers that are Mate Rimac clients.\nIs that wrong?\nNo, I don't think that's wrong.\nIn fact, I think some of their first clients were, um, were F1 drivers.\nUm, I mean, first of all, like, who can afford it?\nAnd second of all, I feel like if you can afford it, and Mate Rimac has said this, a lot of people really aren't looking for electric hypercars right now.\nI mean, the, the Rimac Nea, just to get everyone on the same page, um, when I drove it a couple years ago, it was $2.1 million.\nI think I drove it in 2022.\n2.1 million was the starting price.\nThen, um, that car had about 1,900 horsepower.\nUm, they have said they're going to make 150 of them.\nLast year, Mate told us they had sold 50 out of 150.\nSo it's a really high performance supercar, all electric.\nAnd of course, Rimac Group is partially owned by Porsche and Hyundai and a couple other investors.\nAnd then also in turn owns Bugatti.\nSo, it's all, it's all connected.\nUm, and to answer your question again, Matt, and we talk about this all the time, uh...\n\n\nInternal combustion seems to be more alluring for people who are spending a lot of money on cars than electric cars right now. All that to say, the Rimac Nevera R, which is the higher performance version of the Nevera and has over 2,000 horsepower, it's a little bit more expensive. They're going to make 40 of them if they can sell 40. Um, that car is the car that just became the world's fastest production EV. Now, we have to say production because there's another car outside of Japan that was a prototype that is slightly faster for top speeds um called the Aspark Owl. But um, so first of all, is the Nevera the only car Rimac makes? Is that the only model they have? I believe it's currently the only car they make. They have said they're going to start making two seat autonomous robo taxis. Okay. So they're yes they're working on things and of course Rimac also supplies components, parts, battery technology to Pininfarina. So it supplies things to other automakers and of course Rimac owns Bugatti and we know what Bugatti makes. But in terms of the Rimac brand, the Nevera is the current only thing that they make. But again, Matt, as we know, is kind of a petrol head. He had a record setting BMW that he built. He actually does love combustion as well. And whenever we talk with him, and we did try to get him for this podcast, but it was a little too last minute, but he does want to come on. Um, he always says, you know, whatever makes the most sense in terms of powertrain is fine by him. He's not married to electric vehicles necessarily. And one thing I really like about him is he's pretty open about, yeah, I guess guess no one wanted the Nevera. I mean, it's the CEO of Bugatti, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, he's happy to make 12 and 16 cylinder motors. The one person I do actually know who has a couple is Brian Miller, which isn't fair because he owns Miller Motor Cars and they're for sale. He has a couple Bugattis. Yeah, that's the only place that's the only time I've ever seen them in the flesh is when I'm with him looking at his inventory. He should let you drive one of those. I didn't think about asking. What? But you've driven one, right? Yes. It's incredible. It's on a whole other level for sure. Incredible. That's because the interesting thing is like most electric cars are obviously any Tesla owner that you talk to will tell you I smoke people off the line all the time. And even, you know, this morning I drove out to the local co-op to get some milk in this ex and that is a family. It's literally a family hauler, you know, and it flies. So, any electric car will fly, but this must be a different kind of flight. I think there are certain levels. Let's I mean, let's put it into perspective. The Tesla Model S Plaid has a top speed of 200 miles an hour. So, the Rimac Nevera um the R just set a record for a top speed of 268 miles an hour with a 0 to 60 time of under two seconds. The 0 to 60 on the Rim Nevera is 1.66 seconds. So, again, like I think it's just it's a whole other level. Yeah, the the the Tesla feels pretty fast, but that's like a mini minivan compared to what Nevera is doing. So, basically in electric cars, 0 to 60 for the most part when you get to those big power numbers is only limited by your traction. Totally. Yeah. Totally. It's so the the the next frontier for electric cars is top speed. Yes. Which is where we're pushing. And that's pretty awesome. It's pretty awesome. And you know what the interesting thing though is? Combustion engine cars are still faster for a top speed number even, right? Yeah. Like the Bugatti uh the record setting Bugatti um has a top speed of over 300 mph which is leaps and bounds. You know, obviously whenever you talk to the people who drive these cars for world records, they say it's exponentially every single mile per hour that you add is feels exponentially faster the faster you go. Um, and this Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300 plus hit 304 miles an hour in 2019. So, you know, that's a lot more um speed. And I know Koenigsgg and SSC also have cars that are still faster than than a Nevera and those are combustion engine cars. So um you're right. I think for EVs top speed is really the next frontier. We should actually have Andy Wallace on the I mean Oh my goodness. We should while we're listing while we're listing people that we should be talking to. Mate Rimac obviously is one. Yes. and uh fascinating because of the I'd love to know more about the structure of ownership of his business and how it fits into Porsche and Volkswagen, but Andy Wallace is the one who drove that Bugatti top speed and you you know him as well, right? Yes. He is a great interview. We should definitely have him on. He's really he's one of these guys that has done something extraordinary who is really humble and you could talk to him and never know what he's done. speed. I mean, to me, when I watch these top speed attempts, it just seems so dangerous. I know. Um, and I guess with the Bugatti, they do it on a track that it's like a a road track that just is a giant oval, right? But other times, people do it at the salt flats, which I've never been to and I would love to visit. Yeah. Um, I have also never been. And we should definitely go to the Bonneville Salt Flats, Hannah. trip. Yeah, let's do it. Like, let's actually make a point of it. Um, you know, I know, uh, people are killed trying to set speed records like this. There was a a woman who was killed in southern Oregon, um, trying to trying to set a four-wheel land speed record who was killed um, years ago. And yeah, it's super dangerous because the cars can get airborne for one. I think that's I mean any type of steering correction at that speed is like fatal. Yeah. Right. But also if you're going to go and we all as Joanie Ernst reminded us you know we're all going to die. Um that's a good way to go. Right. I don't know. I I No. I mean I can't think. Not for me. Not for me. Going over 300 miles an hour. You surely are notice it. You know it's like no completely. You know who we should have come on to talk about this is our friend from Goodyear because it all comes down to tires too, doesn't it? Like the tires are the the a limiting factor as well. Yeah. Traction tires. Mark Stewart. Mark Stewart also on the list of people that we need to interview. And frankly, and it could get too political, but Brian Miller also is a good one. You know, I don't know him, but I'd love to know him. What do you mean when you say he could get too political? He has opinions and he is not afraid to share. So I love opinions. No, it's great. It's great. I mean, what are what are his opinions? And I Well, let's wait till he's on, but you know, he can say it. He can say his opinions. He's had an incredibly successful career selling cars to the wealthiest people in Manhattan. Uhhuh. Oh, yeah. That that gives me a hint about what his opinions might be. But the cool thing is he and he uh like he's older he's older than me at least. So um but he has fantastic taste in music. So he can talk to you not only about you know the newest Bugatti and who's buying it but also about um you know the Derek Trucks band or the Almond Brothers and he goes to all these. See I love that. And you know what? I like people who have different opinions than me because it makes me want to ask, \"Oh, tell me more. Why do you think that?\" The, you know, and I'm going to get on my soap box for just a second. I have to say I think the proper response when someone has a different opinion opinion to you is not to get angry, but to ask why and say, \"Tell me more.\" You know, well, most of us live in an echo chamber, right? So, the someone asked me this morning what news sources I listen to, and after I listed them, I thought, \"Oh, that doesn't sound good.\" Because I'm not listening to any other opinions. Right. If I'm just listening to Bloomberg and the BBC and NPR, yeah, I'm kind of doing myself a disservice uh by not broadening my horizons a little bit. Yeah. You know, this is something I've I've actually been talking to my own parents about. You know, let's have a a big variety in our media diet. Variety is important. It's just like healthy eating. Swap with your parents, right? Swap. Are you Are you Are are you on the same diet as your parents or Oh, no. No. Would the two of you benefit from, you know, swapping out a few? You You give them NPR for a week and they give you Fox News? I'm I'm gonna say that I have a very healthy media diet and I I will say that I'm confident I do. I read conservative opinions. I read liberal opinions. I listen to a bunch of podcasts. I I will say this. I don't watch TV. I do not. And which is ironic because Yeah. I work for a news organization that has a TV studio, but I don't I also don't watch TV. Yeah. Um, I think that's important. I read p I read print. I read newspapers. I read magazines. I don't do the TV. I guess I read the Wall Street Journal and New York Times and the FT in addition to Bloomberg, of course. That's pretty diverse, right? Yeah. What about your local paper? You get a like a My local paper I also read because my wife writes for it a lot. Oh, nice. whenever she feels like, you know, we shouldn't be spending $8 million to put turf on the high school football field because it involves PA fast or whatever. I don't know what that is, but I know it's bad. So, we're against probably a forever chemical. Not good for the children. I totally I'm I'm with her. I'm with her. We need more na nature in this world. Yes. Plastic. Um, so yeah, I guess I read the local paper in that sense. Mostly I read, you know, automotive media also, which should we talk about Christian Horner leaving Red Bull or have you really That's what do you think? What do you think about it? Because I'm not as immersed in the world of F1. I know he got in trouble for like texting some co-workers. He denies that he inappropriate relationship. He's married to like Spice. Ginger Spice. Yeah. Yeah. Um and he got the he's been there for gosh 20 years. Got the job when he was 31st. Yeah. Yes. Crazy. Um obviously there are a lot of politics involved. Max Verstappen and his dad have had you know difficult relationships with Christian Horner which has been well documented. Um, and I do think it's interesting that he was not asked to leave during the time of his indiscretions and his unethical behavior at Red Bull because they were winning. But, you know, now they are not winning. Um, and this car that they will never admit, but it was probably really tailored and manufactured to really benefit Max Verstappen is still not doing well. Um, they've gone through multiple secondary team drivers and no one has been able to really score any points with the car except for Max. And Max, even Max can't get it to be great. And everyone seems to think that Max is leaving soon anyway. So, it seems like really his departure, weirdly, is unrelated to the indiscretions and is truly related to he's not winning anymore. Um, so is that good? Is that good or bad? Because like do you care if your boss uh if you're if you're an F1 team isn't the only thing you want to do win? Yes. Uh I don't know. That's a good question. You know what the crazy thing is? He's not leaving the organization. They're removing him from his post, but he at this point at the point at the time of this recording, he's not actually leaving Red Bull. He's staying on. and we don't know what role he's going to maintain at Red Bull, which to me could set up a weird dynamic on the team. Um, like if someone's been the leader and then they're removed from the leadership position, but they're still around, that seems like an odd dynamic. Surely else surely they're just giving him time to find another job. Yeah. Yeah. Uh leave because it's too much intelligence walking out the door. Could Oh, could be that too much proprietary, you know. I'm sure he has a non-compete in his contract. Exactly. So, we're we're taking you out of your leadership position, but we're not letting you go from the company, so you can't go anywhere else kind of thing. Yeah, that sounds that sounds right. Um I don't know. I think motorsport right now is peaking. Oh, did you see F1: The Movie? Have we talked the movie? I saw the movie. Yeah. I It was okay. It was good. I guess you don't want to discuss more. You're not ra I don't I haven't I don't know a great way to describe how I feel about the movie because I suppose I enjoyed my 3 hours in the theater. you know, I ate a lot of popcorn and I got to see Brad Pitt um and a lot of F1 people, you know, driving cars, but it just I don't know. Is this like a summer blockbuster movie? I also didn't like the new um Top Gun movie, Maverick. Never saw that one. Um, but if I think about the F1 movie in terms of the actual story or the acting, how I felt about the characters, none of that was a home run. There's not really a story there. It wasn't Moneyball. I mean, when Brad Pitt is in Moneyball, and I have no connection to baseball, whereas I love to watch motorsports, I thought it was an amazing movie. Like, insanely good. That's a great point. And a great point. I I I've watched Moneyball like three or four times and I don't really need to see F1 again because when I was sitting there I was thinking I'd\n\n\nI'd much rather be watching a race, and I think most F1 fans would much rather watch a race than the movie.\nYeah.\nI didn't think the driving scenes were that good.\nInteresting.\nI didn't feel the drama that I feel when I'm watching a closed race.\nYeah.\nOh, that's interesting.\nUm, I, you know what?\nI would say I was relieved when I saw it because we talked about this a little bit in past episodes, but I liked it.\nI had very low expectations, 'cause I really didn't like Ford versus Ferrari.\nSo, I was just kind of bracing myself to not like F1.\nAnd I liked it.\nI came away excited about motorsport and thinking, \"Oh, my friends who don't think they're interested in cars will like this movie.\"\nAnd that's exciting.\nAnd I, you know, just yesterday I was talking with one of our editors, Justin, and he had seen it and he loved it, and he was all excited about now he wants to go to a real race, and he's never been to a race.\nHe's not a particularly big F1 fan, but he knew that Silverstone had just happened in the UK.\nAnd you know, I think I get the feeling that people it may turn some people into, \"Oh, maybe I should check out the actual sport.\"\nUm, yeah, maybe I'm too critical, 'cause that's...\nI don't think you are, because I think because you're a real fan, and you have been.\nI don't think anything that you said, I don't disagree with any of it, you know.\nI mean, Magnus, he doesn't even want to see it.\nI've said I'll go back and watch it with you because I was at a press screening.\nHe wasn't there, and he doesn't even care to see it.\nI just think like it didn't move me in any way.\nThe love interest wasn't compelling.\nNo, that that was just so lukewarm.\nI didn't care if the kid won or not, even though it's so nice that he lives with his mom.\nUm, you know, it's obviously completely unbelievable that a 60-year-old man goes out there and wins an F1 race or get, I mean, gets close.\nYeah.\nUm, and I even think like if you're causing clearly causing accidents to get a safety car out there, that's something that that would never happen.\nThe stewards would notice and say that's not okay.\nYes.\nSo, I don't know.\nIt was it was it cool to see Brad Pitt wearing like nice clothes?\nI guess.\nI like I want to buy a couple of the shirts that he was in.\nOkay, so that's good.\nSo the branding, the branding worked, the uh, yeah, this the sponsorship.\nBut I'm far more excited to watch an F1 race, and I'm excited to be to watch a Moto GP race, obviously anytime, but I can't think of many movies that I like better than that anyway.\nSo yeah, I get it.\nI just it in terms of Brad Pitt, it just made me think, \"Oh, I need to go rewatch Fight Club.\"\nThis was not Brad's finest work.\nI will say that.\nYes.\nIt's hard to pick his finest work because he's done so many amazing things.\nI mean, true.\nLegends of the Fall.\nRiver Runs Through It and Legends of the Fall are two of my favorites, but I love Fight Club.\nI love Moneyball.\nI love him in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\nOh, and that's the other thing.\nYou mentioned it before, and I don't think it's so startling, but the work that he's had done to his face, even if it's minor filler that somehow like around his eyes, just makes him look like a less special person and more of a regular dude.\nAnd I don't like I don't like it at all.\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nSo, you do agree he's had work done.\nI'm not just imagining either, either he's had work done since Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, or he just there's fillers in there.\nYeah, it does.\nLike there's no wrinkles around his eyes.\nSo, it's just a strange Yes.\nkind of plastic surgery or whatever you call that look.\nAnd I I'm kind of bummed that he made that choice.\nMe, too.\nMe, too.\nAre lucky enough to age with men are allowed to age.\nYeah, women are not allowed to age.\nAnd like speaking of Top Gun Maverick, by the way, the fact that Kelly McGillis, they didn't even shout out Charlie in that movie for me, it was really a bummer.\nLike, no.\nWhere's Charlie?\nOh, Charlie died in a plane crash.\nJust something or Charlie got too old and Mav doesn't like her anymore.\nYou know, something like that would be Sure.\nJust be honest about it.\nWe can handle it.\nWe're big girls.\nCome on.\nHuh?\nRight.\nWell, yeah, I agree.\nI was It just kind of bummed me out because of all people, Brad Pitt is allowed to age because his face is special or was.\nBut you're right.\nThere's something there.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI get it.\nUm, listen, I got to go to this little paleo.\nWell, it's so great to talk with you.\nThanks for taking time out of your vacation.\nThank you so much.\nUh, I guess I'll probably be here next week still.\nYeah.\nBut, um, in fact, I know I will unless something goes horribly wrong.\nWe'll be well.\nLet's hope.\nGosh, we don't want you stranded in Italy.\nHave you got anything cool coming up before we go to...\nYou know what?\nUm, yes of always.\nNext week I'm actually coming to Portugal to drive the Timario, the Lamborghini Timario, which is the Huracan Successor.\nSo, yes.\nSo, that's fun.\nAnd then I will be in New York and we can do it live together.\nThat's That's awesome.\nNew York and I will see you in New York the week after that.\nSo, the Lambert Lamborghini Drive should be amazing.\nYeah.\nAnd you you bring up Justin Ocean.\nHe also edited my probably the greatest work trip I've ever been on uh for Lamborghini when I went to the F1 circuit at Barcelona to drive the Aventador SJ.\nAmazing.\nJustin's a good editor.\nHe's a hard editor, but he I think I was a bad writer to work for him.\nI think he was like, I never want to edit this kid again.\nOh, I'm sure.\nI'm sure he I'm sure it was fine.\nHe's never said a bad word about you.\nUm, but he's great.\nWell, then, uh, I will talk to you again same time, same thing next week.\nCan't wait.\nCannot wait.\nI'm Matt Miller.\nAnd I'm Hannah Elliott.\nAnd this is Bloomberg.\n[Music]\n",
