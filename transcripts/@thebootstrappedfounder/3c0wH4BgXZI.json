  "cleanText": "Hey, it's Arvid, and this is The Bootstrapped Founder.\n\nToday I'm talking to Shane Rosenthal and Simon Hamp from the NativePHP Project. These fine gentlemen have brought PHP and, with it, my favorite web framework, Laravel, onto mobile devices, and I love this. They take established tech and they port it into places where you wouldn't expect. I'll be talking to Shane and Simon about how they accomplish this and, maybe even more impressively, how they turned this into a profitable business at a very early stage. That's always complicated with open-source stuff, so it's really, really cool to see.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Paddle.com, my personal favorite merchant of record, who also has something that might interest mobile developers. I recently produced documentation for hosted checkouts because I was experimenting with the vibe coding tool that needed some payment, and I found that Paddle has built a very functional and super easy-to-integrate hosted checkout for mobile applications. It works for other things too, but it's meant for mobile because it just makes it so easy to get people to pay for your app. Now, pair this with a solution like NativePHP, and you have yourself an application where all the money stuff is handled by professionals, and you can just keep building in the language that you already know. It's really cool. So, go check it out at paddle.com.\n\nNow, here are Shane and Simon and their intriguing NativePHP Project.\n\nYou brought PHP to mobile devices. How did you guys do this? And why did it take until July 2, 2025, of all years, for someone to finally get this right?\n\nOh, wow. Uh, this is the loaded million-dollar question. It's a journey. It's been a real journey. And I mean, in terms of taking till now, and we were talking about this a few weeks ago, just like thinking, would this have even been possible a few years ago? And honestly, I don't know the answer, but it feels like it's all come together at this point in time. So there's definitely, um, there's something in the air, you know, that has enabled all of this. So, uh, but yeah, getting to this point, I mean, for me personally, it started probably in 2019. I was working for a company. I saw this tweet by a fellow called Marcel Pozot, which you might know, and he was trying to get a project called Laravel Zero to run on somebody else's computer without them having to have PHP installed. And he was using this weird library that, when I went to the GitHub page, it was all in Chinese, and I, you know, I kind of gave up at that point, but I, it stuck in my brain, and I bookmarked the tweet, and I thought, right, when I finish this job, you know, when I get some free time, I'm going to come back to this, and I'm going to pick this up, and I'm going to see if I can reach out to Marcel, you know, figure out how to get this going, because it is, it looked like he kind of got so far, and then I never heard anything about again. Anyway, me thinking like this is going to take me a few months to get some free time to work on this took me until the time when I left that job, which was three years later, you know, like three and a half years later. So, it was the end of 2022, and I finally picked it up. I dug out the tweet, you know, and then I went and reached out to Marcel and all of that kind of stuff. But yeah, basically got Laravel working, not just the Laravel Zero, which was for CLI applications, but full Laravel working on, um, a distributable PHP executable, and that was it. That sort of unlocked the whole, the whole thing, and then we're here today.\n\nWhat's the magic there? Like, why did it take so long? Because I, I think compiling PHP into something else like that feels odd, but not impossible, like not 2025 impossible. So, so what was it that was needed at that point?\n\nThat actually came out of a library that was able to compile PHP into this static binary. That's just what allows it to be distributable. But getting it onto mobile is another lift. It's not the same, because you can't just ship that static binary onto a phone. And that didn't really come, and we were just talking about this before this call, Shane and I, that didn't really come until about October last year. And I can't, I can't really give a reason to why it's taken that time other than I think generally people go, we probably shouldn't be doing this with PHP.\n\nYes. So it's probably what it is.\n\nI would say I come at it from a very different angle. I didn't really have a curiosity or interest necessarily in compiling PHP for mobile or anything like that. I came at it from like a Laravel look. I interface with clients. I build apps. I make money. I feed kids. That's just what I do. And the reasons why I started working on this was there's a whole kind of story there, uh, with Simon and I. So, we were already on a podcast together called The Bucket. And we, um, off air one day, he just announced he's going to talk at Laracon EU, and that's was just this last February. And I helped him prepare for slides, if I could, or talk, you know, just go through his talk with him and really just try to ask the questions kind of what you're doing now, like, how do you even do this? How do you go about this? And just conceptually understanding theoretically how it could be done, even though I didn't know until literally like 10 minutes ago, he didn't even know how to do it at the time necessarily. But, um, I was like, \"Okay.\" And, uh, yeah, I, I asked him a question that would forever change the trajectory of my life. So far, it has at least. I don't see my life really going back to necessarily working on client work with the recent successes we've gained with this, but you never know. But I, I asked them, you know, if you're going to be charging money for this kind of thing, you can't just do it for iOS. No company's going to seriously invest into this unless you can provide the world, right? Which is at least more than 95%, I would imagine Android and iOS is going to cover that. There's other kinds, right? So that question, he, his response was maybe six months to a year until he works on Android. I'm not going to do the accent, but, uh...\n\nThank goodness for that.\n\nYeah, you know, maybe that long. He's also got client work he's doing at the same time, and he has to, he just, you know, kind of figured things out in iOS, and that didn't sit well with me. I just felt like, you know, as my friend, which I do respect him in that regard highly. He's probably my best friend at this point or one of them. I felt almost like I want to help ease the burden for him. And it wasn't really like I hate the word entrepreneur. I think it's just overused, but it's really kind of what we are anyway. Like we actually are looking for like the right business ideas always. And I've swung for the fences so many times in my, you know, 15 years of web development and fallen short, and it, you get burnt out, you know, there's a churn there in your own mind, I guess. But I came at it from a different, like wholeheartedly, just a different angle, and it was like, I want to help my friend start tackling the Android side of things, and, uh, after a couple weeks, I was asking him different questions of like, did you do this extension, and did you do that? And he was just like, are you doing, are you trying to compete with me or what are you doing?\n\nYeah, it wasn't for me, like I had this genuine curiosity as to what we could push the boundaries with. I just found myself pushing the boundaries with the work we were doing.\n\nSo, it's so interesting you say this with the entrepreneurial side of things too, because I, I have this feeling that particularly inside the Laravel community and the PHP community at large, there is like a very palpable entrepreneurial spirit that's always kind of part of it. I don't see it that much in JavaScript. There's a lot of, you know, people who just, you know, want to do stuff, but not necessarily to make money, but just to, to make them. There's a, there's a strong maker vibe, and I don't see it as much in the Ruby world or the Elixir world or or Scala or these other languages, right, where it's more kind of corporate-ish almost, right, where it's like, we have this, this B2B SaaS business that needs that particular kind of thing, but in the Laravel world in particular and PHP in general, people just want to build some kind of business first, and then they are technically curious. That to me is, is very, very interesting because it's kind of rare in a very opinionated community of, you know, of developers.\n\nThat's a really good point, and you know, from my, my opinion on it is that it stems from almost like the kind of people that used PHP, like why did they adopt PHP in the first place and the kind of person that they then are, you know, they're not the purists, they're not the computer science grads who are desperate for the most perfect syntax, or I, I'm not trying to put anybody down by that. Those are all good things to achieve, but by and large, my, I've been doing PHP for over 20 years, and I think most of the PHP developers that I've rubbed shoulders with, they're pragmatic people. Like they just want to get the work done. And the fact is, like, PHP has allowed them to do that, you know, and so they were already of this mindset, and they've come to PHP because it lets them do that quickly. And the same for Laravel, you know, it's like why people have come to Laravel because it, it lets them do that so quickly, and and then you just have this bias now because the community is full of these kinds of pragmatic business makers, which I think is very, very cool.\n\nYeah. And the tools that they build, and I'm, I'm not just even talking about the the team which is building amazing tools, but even like people like Marcel building like the the tools that almost every Laravel developer uses, right? Like there's, there's, there's so much, like, a aim when it comes to tool building. People have this kind of shared goal, which is often lacking in these massive open-source communities that are very, like, splinter grouped, right, where there's a lot of infighting. A lot of, I was talking to Taylor about this too, like, just about Laravel in a recent episode of this show, and he, he also said, yeah, PHP is just an adaptable language, and the people who started using it, they, they adapted over time, right? When you think about PHP before that was before there was any like object-oriented parts, and it was horrible. I remember building apps in like the early 2000s in that language, web apps, uh, got to say, got to be precise, but I kind of didn't like it, and then when you look at what a Laravel source code looks like now, it is nothing compared to back in the day, like all globals gone, right, weird like dollar server accessors, like gone. It's, it's, it's all completely different. It has been supplanted by better and stronger systems on top of this stuff. You could still use it, probably, right? You could still write like PHP code like back in the day, you shouldn't, and nobody never show it, but it's, it's likely that the binary still could support it. So, there is just some, some pragmatism here in this community for which I think it's such an important thing that you guys been building something that allows them to now go onto a different platform.\n\nSo, let's talk maybe about mobile a little bit. I remember building mobile apps in what was it like some weird Ionic was a framework, like a JavaScript framework that was the first thing that I ever used. It was horrible. It kind of workedish, but it was like a hybrid thing here and and didn't really work the way I wanted it. And I stopped doing this. I tried some Swift. I, I tried some some Gradle stuff, and it all didn't really go anywhere. So, I would like to know, just bringing PHP to mobile, how easy is it for me to build an app there, and what can I expect to be able to do?\n\nI like this question. So, touching a little bit on the accessibility of what PHP has provided and then what Laravel's done over the last almost 15 years with Laravel in a nutshell, just to get to the answer, if you can build in Laravel, you can run a single command, you have an app. You have to think about some things a little bit differently. Your data is not shared globally, it's on a device. You need an API and, you know, security and files and and and some of those things, but as far as like the ease of use, we are fortunate and blessed to find ourselves using such a robust community ecosystem. It's not just the codebase and the docs are nice. They are. It's way beyond that. Laravel News and all the other news, um, news the hat, right? Um, all of the other places to to get information, all of the resources, YouTube channels, plus just there's so many people that just they come into it, and within the first few months of learning themselves how to do anything with Laravel, they're already posting videos on YouTube to show other people the way. And I don't, there might be other things like that. I don't peak my head out of this, uh, bubble much because this is my whole world, you know. Um, my son will be 16 in December. Every meal he's eaten was paid for by PHP and/or Laravel.\n\nThat's amazing, man. That's awesome.\n\nSo, like I can stay here and just do that. That's like my whole life can be inside of that. The best thing is we have now this whole ecosystem, community, resources, plethora, 15 years plus of everything grown to where it is that we can just shoehorn our own foot into iOS and Android. And so we can leverage the power that's there already and just say, \"Hey, now you can literally run this one or two other commands, think about things a little bit differently, and you have iOS and Android with the same package installed on on your Laravel application.\" So it's easy. It's very easy.\n\nWell, I, it is, it is. And at the same time, it really depends on like what you're trying to do. You know, the classic software engineering response. Obviously, if you're, if you're trying to do something that it's not capable of right now, then it's very hard. But also, if you're coming at this with a very specific thing in mind, then getting to the point where that is a robust solution for you isn't necessarily going to just like be a couple of commands away. But I think that point of sort of getting going, there's been a really good kind of baseline for that that's been, you know, Laravel has sort of set the precedent for us, and it keeps getting better at it. You know, in the last year alone, I think there's things that like php new, which I also think is one of Marcel's projects.\n\n\nYou know, which is just like, you, you don't even if you've got a new machine, you just go to PHP new and run a command, and now you've got PHP and composer and everything on your machine. You haven't got to think about it. You know, this, this kind of idea of I can just type a single thing and, and sort of, and, and this was embodied in the community for some years. I kind of got this sense of messages on Twitter and things where people would say there'll be a command that you can run, and you know, like Laravel magic, and it will be, you've created a SAS, or you've created a, you know, a whole new product, right?\n\nLike, yeah, we already have that tech. You just need to pipe a couple prompts into a couple of like agents and then like wait a half an hour and you get like the full, the full thing. Like, of course, it's not boxed up just yet, but that might be a couple months from now until we have this like fully featured as a pay once, used once kind of thing.\n\nWhen you guys talk about the challenges or kind of the limitations maybe of, of bringing something that is like natively a web app or web framework into the mobile world, I'm always thinking about, you know, the um, permissions, or I'm thinking about like native access to things like cameras or, or audio. What were the challenges along the way? Like, how far are you to to having a kind of parody with a native app if that's even possible? What's the the technical situation there right now from that side?\n\nI mean, Shane, you'll have to speak to the Android side, cuz I don't really understand that very well compared to the, and I don't understand the iOS side very well. Honestly, I built it. Um, but no one does. No one does.\n\nUm, it's generally quite straightforward. I mean, we're, we're tapping into truly native functionality. So, there's no like layers really in the middle. I mean, PHP is built in C. The phones all have the ability to handle C instructions, and most of the languages have got first-party support for C. So, you can kind of throw C in there and it'll do a bunch of stuff for you. So, and then the operating systems, like let's take the iPhone. You mentioned the camera and, and permissions and that kind of thing. They've got their layers of security around all of that stuff. So, we're not bypassing any of this, you know, we're just tapping into the pre-existing APIs that they've built, and we've put a nice little interface in between, which is so that your userland PHP code can just call those functions as if it was. So, it's essentially bringing the native functionality right into your script, you know, your PHP script. Yeah, it is awesome. And we've then wrapped that up in a nice little um, composer package basically. So, now you get all of the interfaces and all of the, you know, IDE hints and support that you, you'd hope for. And it's just this very easy to use tool. And hey, Presto, you know, you're opening the camera and you're sending push notifications and who knows what next.\n\nIs it, is it the same on the Android side?\n\nUh, hey, presso. Yeah, I mean it's.\n\nYeah, it is. It's compiled to C, and so there's essentially, you're, you're using a PHP function. We have an extension, the NativePHP extension compiled into our own binaries, and you call, we are in par, so we're not, we're the same exact naming. So we can just build one. We're using facades, if you're familiar with Laravel facades, and that facade is really for the most part, and we could get more creative with it, um, and we intend to at some point, but it's just saying, hey, if that function exists, run it, and if not, just don't show some weird error on the screen, essentially, if you're doing this in the browser, which is a great way to prototype, by the way. But yeah, that PHP function is just calling into C, is then in Android world is calling onto uh, Kotlin, and at that point, anything that any API, third party or first on Android, we can do whatever we really want to with. So, we can just interface and build those things out. So, limitations, uh, the biggest limitation that I see right now is time. Uh, I cannot find any anywhere. I know there used to be some all over my couch when I was sitting there for, you know, figuring this stuff out, but it's gone.\n\nSo, someday maybe I'll find some time. But that's, that's really our priority. Simon and I are, there's a lot of other things. I think that in the last, even just the last maybe a week, we're finding ourselves not even like, we're not trying to build out this project and make it really awesome. We are finding ourselves managing a business, and that's not something that we intended initially. Maybe we wanted, but good problems, you know, like there's these are good, good issues to have. But I think too, just to add to that point of like bringing it nicely and natively, firsthand experience with calling these facades inside of a Livewire or just anywhere you want to inside of your Laravel application. One of the things that I really like too that we spent quite a bit of time on was the config file for this. And there's a lot of switches inside of that that will during uh, we'll call it compile time. We're actually adding uh, just doing like string replaces and stuff inside of your XML files on Android side. I'm not sure how Simon's doing it on iOS, but um, to allow or to add or subtract those permissions. So if you don't need permission, I think the app stores don't want you to just have a whole all of the permissions. So it's all configurable, and it's very like Laravel first. If you're a Laravel developer, it's going to feel extremely familiar cuz it is very familiar. You just end up with a nice emulator here instead of a browser, and you can turn on flashlight and make phone calls and all sorts of other stuff.\n\nYeah, that's the important stuff for a good app, right? Got to turn on flashlight. Yeah, makes perfect sense. I, I'm excited by the whole, the business, the, the product side of things because you, you kind of said you didn't really intend to build a business, but you wanted to. That, that already is an interesting statement. But from, from my perspective, and I've been following you guys for, for a long while, like prior to this as well, it felt like a very, let's call it intentional approach to slowly building something into reality. Like it didn't feel like you were surprising yourself with the success or even pitching it at the at Laracon. Like it all felt very intentional and not orchestrated in, in that sense, but with purpose. Like along the way, you found validation. You did distribution first, right? Like that's the stuff that most founders never figure out. Like you, you did it first. You went into the conference scene and all that. So maybe you can tell me the story and like just where you guys are right now, like what the level of success is that you are uh, enjoying at this point.\n\nSo, I want to say something real quick there, though, because I, I don't know if I misspoke, but yeah. No, I think what you're saying is right. And I think to, to some, to some effect, it was kind of like we were going through the motions of the things that we had already done a million other times that probably failed, uh, to, but they didn't. If you look at, if we get success at one time, then those were just practice swings, right? But they don't feel like that when you're missing the ball. You know what I'm saying? So, I really think that's probably the mindset for me at least behind this. Like, all right, so if this is a floodgate of people coming in, where are we going to direct that traffic? And there's like crickets, right? There's nobody actually there, but we know like if this thing is a valid, viable thing, then this is where they'll go, and this is where we'll have them go. And then when we turn the faucet on, the water came out. And so, that's I think my response to that, you know.\n\nYeah. For me, it's, it's quite, I, I think I have to take in all of the context of like where NativePHP as a project has come from first of all, but there's even more than that. I mean, we're talking technically effectively of standing on the shoulders of giants with all the, the other stuff that people have done that have allowed us to get to this point. And it's the same is the true of the business in the same way. You know, there's in some cases, the, the giants are past us, you know, having made loads of mistakes and whatever. But yeah, we, we kind of got to this, well, I got to the place where the, the technical challenge was sort of solved, you know, and then Marcel said, this is back in 2023, he was like, I'm going to change my talk at Laracon US, which I think was in Nashville that year. And I was like, what are you talking about? That's crazy. Like, this thing's never going to be ready in this is like two months from that point in time, and you know, and you know, people are just going to ask us about mobile phones, and all we've got is one, you know, Mac, like we haven't got Windows or Linux or any of this. It's basically nowhere near good enough as was my point of view at the time, and he was like, no, let's, you know, let's do it, let's get it out there. And I think that was, that was an unlock thing for my brain straight away because him having the, the confidence to to do that and saying that and reinforcing that the whole time, like we're just going to put it out and it's going to be fine, was incredible because he was absolutely right. Of course, he went on stage, talked about it, and obviously people got his, they, they know Marcel, they know that he's liable to do something crazy like this, and so they, they loved it. And I, I definitely that, that's no small part of like the success of the whole thing, but you can't just rely on those moments, you know, and I think the my opportunity at Laracon EU was another moment. And they're great because they do bring a lot of attention. You know, you get all of this influx of busyness around it for a short period of time, but you've got to smooth over the gaps. You know, you've got to, it's going to go wild, like up and down for months. And when you're in it, you really feel that. Like for me, there was this lull after Laracon 2023. The project sort of flooded with issues and, and people wanting this and wanting that and it not being capable of doing all of those things, and me feeling, you know, personally it was my responsibility to kind of solve all of that stuff. And then at some point last year kind of digging myself out of that hole and going, I'm just going to crack on with this. You know, I'm just going to like dive back in, fix as much as I can, and move it forward. Like sometimes you just have to dig deep. You know, I remember spending days, weeks, getting up early, going to bed very late, doing my client work to pay the bills and just putting in the hours of like solving issues and, and all of this and just driving the thing forward and not even thinking like, I've got to market this product and and get to a place where I can build this community and then I can release mobile, you know? It was like I'm just going to do the desktop thing, make it sort of work, and then maybe who knows what will happen. And along the way of doing that, you know, some of the mobile pieces sort of clicked into place, and along the way the community grew, and along the way they, these contributors came in who were like instrumental in taking off some of the workload, and you know, Shane came along. Exactly. The same, you know, here's a piece of work that I've done, and this adds to the whole thing in a, in a huge way. And then when you step back and you look at this whole journey, you're like, &quot;Oh, there's nice smooth curve.&quot; And it's like, it's not like that at all.\n\nYeah. If you zoom out far enough, it always looks like a smooth something, right? But it's not.\n\nWell, what was the point? Like when exactly did you choose to monetize it the way you're doing it right now? Maybe you can explain exactly what you chose to do, cuz that's also a more rare occurrence in the open source community, and maybe when that entered the conversation.\n\nSo I think I always knew that if we did mobile, it would have to be some kind of premium offering in some way. You know, I'd hoped that by the time we got to that, that the whole project might have been getting some serious sponsorships. You know, I might have gotten some consultancy gigs doing stuff for NativePHP for desktop. It didn't quite work out how I had planned. Surprise, surprise. And I sort of got to the place where this is working. You know, I've got technically it's right. I'm going to put it in front of other people, but I'm not just going to give it to them. I'm going to put a hurdle in front of it. I'm just going to say sponsor me. And I, I picked that up from another person in the Laravel community called Caleb Porzio, who built, he's built many things, but among them Livewire and more recently Flux. And one of the things that he did with Livewire, which is in my view an incredible piece of kit, and I use it all of the time, I think Shane does as well, is he kind of monetized it through sponsorships. And he's never sold, as far as I'm aware, anything around Livewire, but it's become massively popular and he's become sufficiently wealthy from just that sponsorship setup that he had. And I think he was doing it around like content and you'd get access to this and that and some other things. And that was like right, well, it doesn't need to be exactly like that, but I can see that there's this idea of if I gate this thing that appears to be of value and people see, you know, if I'm showing them what it could be like, then I'll be able to test if they think it's of value, some people will probably buy. You know, I'm saying buy or they'll sponsor. And yeah, lo and behold, I had within a couple of weeks sort of 20 or 30 people who had just sponsor with no, all they got access to was a very, very rubbish uh, GitHub repository which is in a complete state and barely worked. But it was this thing that told me people see value in this. They want what I'm building and they believe in what it can become. And that combination of those three things and the fact that people pass on real hard-earned cash was enough for me to go, I have to see this through, you know, like I have to get to the point where it really does meet their expectations. And yeah, that was like the\n\n\nBeginning of January this year. So it was like it's all been very, very rapid since then. Is it a full-time gig for both of you just yet?\n\nAlmost.\n\nI love that. It is. It is for me. It is for me. So, I may as well take a moment here and thank Craig Anderson. Craig and Simon had been friends. Simon introduced me to Craig. Craig uh has a small dev shop. I guess it's just really him. And then he had too many hours. And through Simon, we met, and I think I started working with him around November, October, something like that. And it was a very flexible schedule for me from the beginning. So, it was kind of like almost as many or as few hours as I wanted, which was awesome. So, I could kind of control how much of my credit card I needed to spend to pay the bills versus uh how much time I wanted to spend uh working on this, which didn't come for me until I guess towards the end of January. So, we had a pretty well-established relationship. And then it was just a few weeks ago we had the conversation of like, you know, if you need help, if I need the hours, you know, at some point, and then he's like, yeah, you've got you, I already know a lot of his apps, and he's got a lot of, there's a lot of stuff he's working on, but it's kind of still an openish door. We still talk all the time. Um, I was prepping for a talk yesterday. He came in and gave us his sense on it. So that was that was cool.\n\nAs far as the pricing, I wanted to just mention though real quick, like for me, it's like it's ask for forgiveness, not for permission, kind of like regardless of like whatever the dollar amount is. I think it's, you know, some people would think it's horrible if you put a dollar amount on this and nobody buys. I think it's worse if you put no dollar amount on it and everybody gets it, and now you have to support something, and you're not even getting paid for it. It's a really, it's a bad situation to end yourself up in. And Simon did on his own little uh podcast, little uh awesome podcast. He just did an episode called Pillars that I would I would say go check out Pillars. It's awesome. And it's not cuz I'm on this side of it. He just very precisely spoke on every topic regarding the justification of pricing and the things that we're working on and why we're choosing this this way to go forward for not just today and so that we can have an awesome summer, but where we want to end up in a year or three or five with the business.\n\nI'll be linking that in the show notes, that's for sure. You were talking about pricing, and I I think it would be very interesting to just look a bit deeper into the the choices that you made along the way because I I know there's like this early beta stage that you have going on, and pricing at early stage is always different, but that's coming to an end, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nThe end of May we've decided now. I mean, we've put it back cuz I think it was going to be a bit earlier, but we hadn't quite achieved some of the technical things that we wanted to achieve. So it's still very early days. The project is going to keep evolving, right? But we have to draw a line in the sand as to what this early access means and you know who gets in on that. What, you know, it's been 4 months, just over. It will be about 4 months when it comes to an end. And I think it's done the thing that I set it out to, you know, like originally my plan was to just build up enough of a little base to prove that this is a viable product. And really it's gone on way further than that, you know, and now we've got this business and it's going sort of wild. And I think that there's a sense, there's always been a sense from in my mind anyway, and we've talked about this a lot where the value of this thing is far greater than the price that we're putting on it right now. But then there's this juxtiposition with like what the rest of the the market, let's say like the competitors in the space, if we can call them that, are pricing their products at, and and for the most part that's zero. You know, they're all free. And so, yeah, there's this like real real challenge now as we come to the end of May of like, are we are we shooting ourselves in the foot with the upping the price quite significantly? And there's a few people who have mentioned that, you know, they're very aware that the price of all these other tools is nowhere near what we're charging. So, yeah, it's going to be an interesting month, I think.\n\nSo this whole the conversation around everybody else is free. How how can we charge? We have sales that justifies the price, right? Or at least it justifies the fact that people are finding value in what we're doing. And I want to say too, we don't have any competitors. And this is maybe a very controversial sort of statement. And that's okay because I'm a high-risisk kind of guy, right? Why not? All right. So, look at, and I don't know these technologies very well. I've never built anything with React Native. I kind of learned a little Flutter once, and I did do some ionic stuff back in the day. All of those frameworks are asking you to learn how to do mobile apps and to learn through their product how to do things. Nobody has done what we have done, which is catered to the Laravel/PHP developer. We brought all of the tooling to your existing knowledge base with the exception of how to interface with the APIs, and then also there's a little arm bend of you have to kind of learn how to think as an app developer. So you know that whole that whole scenario which you would have to do anyway whether you're doing it with us or anybody else. So the pricing I think whether it's a pricing or not, just the fact that we're charging for something, look, we put it out there, if no one buys, then okay, then there's not a market at this price or there's not a uh, you know, this isn't viable for some people or whatever the the cause, but the fact that we've done sales, I mean, and just to um, I know your your audience specifically, out of respect, well, we announced um May 2nd was our official V1 release date, on that day, actually, I think it was just a few hours before that we hit $100,000 in sales. So, I know like your audience would love to hear that, right?\n\nYeah, I bet.\n\nSo, to say like what we're talking about and to be further clear about that, I think about 40ishk was in the week leading up to that release date, and it's continuing, like there's still justification. We'll say it that way. And so, that's like, all right, this is what people want clearly. This is what we need to be working on. And now we have to fall back a little bit, plan, strategize, and put some people around us that are really good in this space and lean on them and more of that managing the business more so than anything else. And I kind of went off on a little tangent there, but that's that's how I roll. I do appreciate it because I think it's important, like you you're talking about like very, very clear validation signals here, and that that's kind of what I meant with like the the PHP developer community is at its heart an entrepreneurial community, like you see not just the value of the product in a technical sense, which is great, like it's a great accomplishment to get this on mobile, like to begin with, right? Again, it's 2025, and this is the first time it actually worked, that's wonderful, but the fact that you from the beginning try to look for value signals that are actually like cold hard cash value signals and not just somebody like thumbs upping on some issue on GitHub, signing up for a newsletter.\n\nYeah.\n\nSigning up for a news or just just following you on social media or, you know, tracking, starring your your repo or whatever. They're all signals. They're soft signals. They are great signals, but none of them are going to pay the the rent, right? That's that's something that as a developer who is trying to build something meaningful that has an impact on other people's lives. Well, it has to have an impact on your own life as well. And I think that's a reality that founders get, and PHP developers are surprisingly strongly overlapping with that.\n\nYeah, I that's so true. I I think for me, like the context of that really comes from trying really hard and the kind of previous almost two years to do the thing that all the the other much bigger businesses frankly have been doing, which is to give it away for free. And although it was with the desktop tool, backing that up with, you know, I'm building it, I'm trying to encourage the community around it and foster more collaboration and all of that, but at the same time, I'm actively trying to pursue funding it. You know, I'd made lots of grant applications. I was quite active in getting people to sponsor the project, but it was just never enough. Like there was so much work and it was so hard to get to that point, and you turned down so many times. I mean, I I don't know why specifically in all of those cases, you know, like grant applications were denied or whatever, but it doesn't really matter because the end result is it kind of forced me into this position of like, if I want to work on this, if I want to make this a sustainable product that other people can rely on to use, I have to build a business around it. There's no two ways about it. And then the other problem is I I can't spend my time on yet another thing to offset the cost of running that business. So the obvious answer was I got to charge for the license to use the tool that I'm building and have that money come directly into building it. That's where we're at.\n\nThat sounds about right.\n\nThat's, you know, that's what a business is. It's so funny that so often people forget that that is like the main and like one of the only ways that these things can sustain themselves. The idea that monetization is an integral part of the product. That is something we we should also like just highlight for people who are building products on top of this, right? I recently there was this whole thing with the Fortnite situation. Let's just call it that, right? With the Apple, the Walt Garden opening its financial vault doors a little bit and not taking the 30% cut, at least enforcing it as much anymore as they used to do, although they still do outside of the US for some reason. But let's talk about monetization opportunities on mobile because for many of the SAS founders that I know and myself, not having a mobile app, I don't think about this, but if I now could, and I am already like I have to keep myself from thinking about it right now, the things that I could build with this cuz there's just so much opportunity for for my own business, for Podscan, how would you approach this? Like what does payment look like? What does monetization look like building mobile apps?\n\nYeah, I mean, the whole iOS in-app billing thing, so I I don't follow. I haven't followed that a lot. I guess there was like a lawsuit going on for a long time, and then they just finally settled that they're not forcing people to go through their 30% fee that they charge for the in-app billing. That being said, that's one of the API functions we have not yet implemented on iOS or Android, which does though. It says, \"Hey, if you're going to build apps to release in the US on Apple, you can accept like a Stripe or something like that form inside of your app. There's already like cashier, and there's already like, I said, these resources available to uh Laravel developers that you can just plug and play, modify for the app environment, and uh go to town.\" So, you can bypass this whole App Store thing. I do think, and I think I've seen some notes of it already, like I do feel like Apple is going to find a way to make that money back and probably retributively, if that's a word, like to take, you know, take it out on whatever, cuz that's kind of the mantra that they've given off to me at least. I love Apple, I like their products, you know, um, if you're listening, please don't take NativePHP, if you're still...\n\nRight. Um, so I mean, as far as like what customer...\n\nI had a guy, I was I did a small talk at um a local meetup a month ago, probably, and I was explaining after my talk to one of the guys there, like there's someone that had come to me and was asking me about MDM. I didn't even know what that was. Some sort of drug maybe or something. What is MDM? It's a like a mobile device uh management. So he had this unique situation, and he had um hundreds of malls in America have his devices with basically a kiosk, but it's using Android, and he wants to lock down that device just for that app so nobody could exit out of it, but remotely he could manage that, and I'm like, well, we could totally do that. And so I started explaining the technology to this guy, and he was like, oh, you guys could build, you guys could build this um like a a trucker app, like where you could like track where the truckers are for companies and stuff, and I'm like, no, you can do that. We are building the tool so that people with you that have ideas can do that. Like we have ideas for our own apps, of course, but like what we're doing is more like empowering, enabling that developer so that he can take that spark of an idea and start implementing it. Go find a trucker, go find a trucking company. Or maybe you already are working in that kind of space, and now you're like, \"Wow, we could monetize this through App Store or not,\" you know, cuz I don't know what the cut is with the Play Console, but you know, they have their own in-app billing there as well. And that's something even though I mean, we we have people all over the world are using this, like um the binary part of our our package that it downloads a zip. We had a CDN it because we're servicing people literally India and Africa and all over the place. I couldn't have it in Ohio or whatever. So, just because that applies to the US, it doesn't apply everywhere else. So we absolutely have to support in-app billing on both OSS. And I think one of the coolest things I guess is our Discord server. We have a channel there that's like show us your app. Day one of releasing this, there were people like little like JavaScript games. They're really just JavaScript. Um what was that? Like a snake game where you eat the eat the... One of our good friends actually was working on that, and um but he tied it into like a PHP server. So when you finish, you got your score, and you can have a leaderboard, and\n\n\nAnd it was like really cool.\nI even had put something together for, like, I just found a GitHub Flappy Bird clone, right?\nAnd I just popped it in and hit run, and it just worked, and it was like, you know, I tie it to touch.\nYeah, we should play.\nWe could use reverb and play against each other.\nOh, multiplayer flappy.\nYeah, I get one wing, you get the other.\nUm, but yeah, I think that people can get creative now, and they can start dreaming.\nAnd even with our, I'll say, quote unquote, limited libraries that we have right now, 'cause that's something we're focusing on actively.\nIt's about a dozen or so.\nYou can already start to build on some things, and there's more and more coming out.\nWe're trying to get to, like, a weekly release of more native functions.\nI think that the whole Apple Epic, wasn't it Epic Games battle?\nIs it, it's obviously, I don't want to weigh in on that because I don't, I don't know very much about it, really.\nBut the whole problem space of these walled gardens and what we've seen over 20 odd years, of more than that, really, but with the web, you know, the open technology is the thing that survives, is the thing that drives innovation, is the thing that enables, you know, new connections across the whole globe.\nAnd, you know, I can see Apple wanting to keep a hold of that for various reasons, but their, their main one publicly has always been so that we can maintain quality, right?\nBut what we will just see over time, I think, is a bit of a domino effect from here, where more and more countries around the world will be pushing them to open the garden up a little bit, you know, and, and just let people have a bit of an easier time with it.\nSo I think the opportunity now for people to really make money through apps is only going to increase.\nSo I think we're going to see a proliferation of more apps doing this and more countries kind of pushing companies like Apple to reduce their fees and help people out, help people get started.\nAnd I think at the end of the day, like Shane said, that's actually going to turn around to be a net benefit for companies like Apple because they'll figure out other ways to generate revenue.\nAnd I think they'll realize that, too.\nAnd then it'll just, it'll make perfect sense for everybody.\nBut yeah, it's like, essentially, you're getting in with a shovel, you know, as we're just about to start another sort of gold, potential gold rush for the app marketplace.\nYeah, I think you mentioned this before.\nYou phrased it as, like, democratization of app building, too, right?\nYou're making things more accessible.\nYou're making them less elitist and also just more playful.\nThere's a, there's a way that you can just do things now, particularly, and we didn't even get into, like, the whole AI coding, VIP coding situation.\nLet's save that for another day because we could talk about this for an hour.\nBut the tooling that we have right now to build these things is already there.\nLike, it's much easier now to build, like, a PHP app than it ever was before.\nAnd since NativePHP is sitting or is allowing for just regular Laravel apps to be built like that is what AI can already do, right?\nLike, this, this is, this is really, really simple.\nAnd I guess over time the AIs of the world will absorb NativePHP's best practices and that stuff as well, right?\nYou could probably create some kind of documentation you can feed into a system like that, and it can create, like, the perfect code.\nIt's, it's just so easy now to build things that I'm excited to see where this is going to go, like, who is going to build what, and what the shift will look like when people talk about their big apps in the Laravel world in particular, right?\nThe Laravels of the future, like, how many of them will just be mobile apps, like, mobile-first apps instead of, you know, SAS web apps that we have been used to over the last decades or so?\nThat's something hard not to think of, to be honest, because it's almost like, because we're on this side, am I being biased in that sense?\nSo the sense is how many people might actually end up becoming Laravel devs because they want to be mobile devs, and this is actually the easiest way to start working on more, more robust.\nI feel PHP is more robust than JavaScript, again, maybe a bias, but it's not that hard, right?\nEspecially the way things are going, one's trending one direction, the other's trending another, right?\nSo that's right.\nUm, yeah, maybe controversial, but anyway, I love JavaScripts, me too, I use it all the time.\nUm, but I think that, you know, again, with the resources we have available, this is a much more robust unlocking tool, key, if you will, to getting into this realm.\nAnd so I do feel like, yeah, at some point, the more awareness we bring to this, more people are realizing that this is actually probably a better, if not best way.\nMaybe not today, but that's our goal.\nWe're going to make this the best way.\nLike, that we're going to strive and try our best to make it as good as it can be.\nAnd I do think they're going to find people ending up at Laracon that didn't know that we can do web with Laravel.\nYeah, that's going to be awesome.\nThat's going to be so Wait, you could do websites, too?\nIt's going to be great.\nThat's going to be cool.\nGuys, I'm, I'm really looking forward to seeing both where your business goes, obviously, because that's, that's just the entrepreneurial side in me.\nI'm looking forward to seeing where you take the project, like, what novel things you will find over the next months or years.\nThere's going to be a lot of interesting stuff happening in the field.\nLike, it never stands still, right?\nSo you always have to adapt and where you take the community.\nI think that that's already established.\nYou, you were mentioning, like, a Discord, and people are flocking to you from, like, the Twitters, the axes, the blue skies, and whatnot, right?\nPeople are excited for this.\nAnd for everybody who is listening to this and wonders, where can I find these people?\nWhere can you guys be found?\nWhere do you want people to go if they want to learn more about you and the wonderful projects that you're working on?\nI think I'm horrifically online.\nMy wife would tell me off if I said this, 'cause, well, boy, she knows it's true, but I'm on Twitter and Blue Sky and all of the places.\nSo wherever you kind of prefer, I'm usually at Simon Hamp on there.\nSo that's, that's where you can find me.\nI'm Shane D. Rosenthal, I believe, on Blue Sky and Twitter.\nYeah, I have opened the door right before we released to some, um, like, early beta testers, and so, like, on Telegram, they're messaging me problems now post-release.\nI'm like, please just go through the Discord server.\nSo, I'm like, kind of reluctant to, like, give out too much info, 'cause I do have, like, reel in my attention and where I'm placing it these days.\nBut again, good problems to have, but I am, we love conversation.\nWe're very much talkers and feelers, and we love to dream.\nThat's really where we want to get to every day.\nIf we can do it just 10 minutes of dream time, you know, that, that kind of ticks my boxes internally.\nSo, I welcome the messages for sure.\nWell, I love this.\nYeah.\nnativephp.com is the website of the project if anybody wants to just immediately purchase a license.\nI highly recommend it.\nIt's a good idea, 'cause it's great, man.\nI, I love this.\nYou guys are doing such good work, and it's so enjoyable to watch you build it in public, like, share the process and the journey with people.\nI, I find this is an amazing thing.\nThanks.\nThanks so much for sharing all of your insights and the journey of this on the show.\nReally appreciate it.\nThanks.\nThanks, Jay.\nAnd thanks, Simon.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nAppreciate it.\nAppreciate the opportunity.\nAnd that's it for today.\nThank you so much for listening to The Bootstrapped Founder.\nYou can find me on Twitter at Arvid Kahl, a r v i d k a h l.\nAnd if you want to support me in this show, please share Podscan.fm, my SAS business, with your professional peers and those who you think will benefit from tracking mentions of their brands, their businesses, and names on podcasts out there.\nPodscan is a near real-time podcast database with a stellar API.\nWe have 32 million podcast episodes in the back now.\nThe database is humongous.\n",
