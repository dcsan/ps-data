  "cleanText": "Hey, it's Arvid, and this is the\nBootstrap Founder podcast.\n\n[Music]\n\nToday I'm talking to Taylor Otwell, the\ncreator of the Laravel Framework for PHP\nand an outstanding entrepreneur who\nfigured out how to turn open-source\nsoftware into Lamborghinis. Seriously,\nTaylor's approach to building not just a\nframework, but a whole ecosystem of\nbusinesses on top of that framework is\none of the most impressive open-source\nmonetization stories I've ever seen.\nIt's quite fitting that Laravel has\ntherefore also embraced the sponsor of\nthis episode, paddle.com. Paddle is a\nmerchant of record payment provider, and\nthey are deeply integrated into both the\nopen-source library Cashier, which is\nfree, and the Forpay payment portal\nLaravel Spark, one of the many ways that\nTaylor is monetizing his work. So it's\nopen source and for pay; it's a very\ninteresting story. So if you want to\nmonetize your own software work without\nhaving to deal with stuff like sales tax\nand expired credit cards, give Paddle a\nshot at paddle.com. They're supremely\ngood at making your founder life easier\nso you can build your business on solid\nfoundations. So let's talk foundational\nframeworks. Here's Taylor Otwell, the\ncreator of Laravel.\nCongrats, Taylor, on half a million\ndeployments on Laravel Cloud. That is\namazing. How does it feel to see\npeople building on your own platform at\nthat scale already a couple months after\nyou released the thing? Yeah. Wow. Um,\nit's pretty surreal, and it's especially\nsurreal thinking back to how it all\nstarted, which was basically like a\ncasual conversation in Amsterdam by a\nfew of us at Laravel. There were not many\nof us at Laravel at the time. There were\nprobably only nine or 10 of us, and now\nthere's like 70. So just thinking back\nto that conversation where Laravel Cloud\nwas just an idea and we hoped we could\nbuild it, you know, we hoped we could\nfigure it out and crack it to now where\nit's live and you know thousands of\npeople are using it and there's you know\nso many people deploying on it is really\nit's pretty mind-blowing, but I'm super\nhappy with where we're at, and honestly, I\nthink we're just kind of getting started\nwith it, so I'm even more excited about\nwhere we're heading with it. Yeah, I\nbet. That is such an accomplishment. I\nthink like just seeing you develop both\nthe idea and then teasing it a little\nbit at the Laracons and all of that. It\nfelt like a it was a concerted effort,\nbut it also felt very natural in the\nway that it was built. That was really\ncool. And looking at the Laravel\necosystem in particular, like the\nproducts that existed prior to cloud, I\ncan't help but feel like you worked your\nway, you iterated your way to cloud\nthrough Forge and Envoyer where the like\nhosting and deployment. Did this make it\neasier to actually build a full cloud\nsystem? Mhm. Yeah, that is kind of\ninteresting. Like Laravel Cloud and\nfully managed Laravel deployment and\nhosting is something I've danced around\nfor like the last 10 years. It feels\nlike, and when I first built Forge in\n2014,\nI really would have built it more like\ncloud as like a fully managed platform\nif I was able to. It was just me, you\nknow, like hacking on this idea in my\nfree time, and I didn't want the risk of\nmanaging all of this infrastructure as\nlike a solo bootstrapped founder. So I\nbuilt Laravel Forge where people could\nbring their own cloud account. Hey, if\nthere's something happens with the\nservers that they're running the apps\non, that's sort of like Digital Ocean's\nproblem, you know, not or AWS's problem.\nBut yeah, we have been kind of working\nour way towards this with things like\nForge and Envoyer and Vapor for a long\ntime.\nAnd you know, building something like\ncloud just takes a much bigger team and\nmuch bigger uh risk, honestly. You know,\nyou're you're just taking on you're\nbiting off a lot more um when you take\non a problem like this. So, we finally\ngot here, you know, in uh June, 2025, all\nthese years later, and you know, it's an\nexciting time. It it sounds like you\nunlocked something inside your founder\nbrain for this, right? Like, how did\nthat happen? Like, what what did you do?\nCuz honestly, I would be so scared to\nlead a team of 70 people, let alone\nseven people. Like, how did you like\nmassage that into your mind? I mean, as\nyou may know, like I I bootstrapped\nLaravel from 2011 until 2024.\nAnd in that time, I launched, you know,\nfive commercial products, um, Forge,\nEnvoyer, Vapor, Nova, Spark, and\nsomething like 27 or 28 open-source\npackages in addition to the framework\nitself, which is like the core of the\nwhole thing. And in 2024\nor really I guess 2023 I felt like I was\nsort of like at this crossroads with\nLaravel of like man I've really built\nalmost everything I wanted to build.\nEvery idea I had the whole idea for\nLaravel was only to create a tool to\nhelp me build startups faster, and then\nthat became like the meta business that\nended up becoming my career. And so it\nwas almost like I can either coast and\nbe like okay that was a solid run, you\nknow, like an open source few people are\nable to enjoy that level of open source\nsuccess or there's like sort of a next\nlevel that we could go to which is\nbuilding something much more ambitious\nalso much more risky but maybe much\nhigher reward with things like Laravel\nCloud and and Laravel Nightwatch which\nis coming out soon as well, and you know\nthat was just kind of what I wrestled\nwith for a long time and obviously\ndecided to sort of swing for the fences\nwith Laravel Cloud and try building a\nbusiness with investment money, you know,\nto build these much bigger, more\nambitious things that I couldn't build\non my own without great personal risk\nand liability\num so and I basically I felt like I owed\nit to the community is what it boiled\ndown to. I felt like if I just sort of\ncoasted and it was like okay guys that's\nsort of the peak, you know, that's\nthat's where it sort of tops out. I feel\nlike that would be just such a bummer for\nlike the tens or hundreds of thousands\nof Laravel developers in the world that\nhave been along for the whole thing. And\nso that's ultimately what led to uh\ndeciding to pursue cloud. Interesting.\nYeah, there's this this concept of the\nbenevolent dictator for life, right?\nThat always exists in the open source\nworld. And that can go either way,\nright? Either you can just do whatever\nyou want as a dictator or you can try to\nbe the benevolent part and and serve\nyour community. That's an interesting\none. I I do wonder like how do you\nbalance this? Because particularly with\ncloud being a a very much for-profit\nenterprise and having investment having\nfunding and on the other side you have\nthis open source community of people who\noften have the expectation that things\nshould be free and things should be you\nknow like designed by like open source\ncontributor committee. How do you\nbalance expectations between these kind\nof groups of people? We really just try\nto let I think our behavior do the\ntalking. You know I think that's really\nthe best way to do it. So like we have\nfull-time staff working on open source\nand we release open source every week\nand honestly at greater frequency than\nwe did before uh just because we have\nmore resources behind it. I think\nLaravel is also in this really unique\nposition with cloud and forge to where\nwe almost have like both sides of the\ncoin, you know, like we have this fully\nmanaged platform for people that um just\nwant to kind of deploy and they never\nwant to think about servers and if they\npay a little bit of a premium for that\nat the end of the day that's fine. And\nthen we also have Forge which is like\nthis kind of semi-managed uh server\nmanagement platform which we're\nrebuilding entirely for Laracon uh this\nsummer which is going to be cool and\npeople can bring their own cloud\nprovider or whatever they want and you\nknow throw 50 sites on a single server\nand really like get a lot of juice out\nof that server for the amount of spend\nthey're putting into it. And you know I\nthink Laravel is unique to like offer\nboth like whatever is better for you.\nWe're just trying to help you deploy\nyour application and enjoy using this\nframework and you can kind of take\neither path. So open source like we know\nand I know and I think the company knows\nif we don't have Laravel and we're not\ncommitted to open source in the\ncommunity like no one's going to be\nusing this stuff. So we have to be more\ncommitted to that than ever basically.\nYeah. I've always admired like the\nstrategy that you have just laid out,\nright? You build products that help\npeople use the tool that you also build\nand then you use the tool to build the\nproducts like that there's a lot of\nsynergistic effects between these that\nmakes sense and that to me is something\nthat is well not completely unique like\nother open source communities try to\nemulate this but it is very efficient in\nthe Laravel world like you just\nmentioned five products I use four out\nof these for my my my software stack so\nyou said you built five products you had\nlike a a five for five success with\nthese products like were there any along\nthe way that you kind of tried to build\nand they didn't work or is it all like\nVapor, Forge, and Envoyer and you know,\nlike the other things like did that all\nwork like from the beginning like that\nthat is such a such a rare thing in the\nserial founder world for that to\nactually happen yeah it is pretty crazy\num there was one product that I built\nall the way through that I never\nactually launched so I don't know if it\nwould have succeeded or failed and it\nwas actually called Laravel Cloud at the\ntime but it was more like a Laravel\nForge\nreimagining that helped you deploy like\nload balanced VPS's and you had like a\nYAML config file. It was just a little\nbit different, but I got it all the way\nto completion. It had a UI built by\nSteve Schoger, I believe, from Tailwind\ncuz he worked for Laravel at the time.\nAnd um at the end of the day, I was\nlike, this just isn't different enough\nfrom Forge to actually be compelling.\nIt's actually like sort of confusing.\nThere's no clear difference between the\ntwo products besides a few like minor\nthings and I just like didn't even\nlaunch it. I I just tabled it which is\ncrazy because the whole thing was built\nthe back end the front end everything\nbut you know I just think it would have\nkind of confused things. So other than\nthat you know everything kind of worked\nbut the whole way though I was just\nsolving my own problems. I wasn't really\ntrying to like in many ways I wasn't\neven trying to build products. I was\njust like, especially with something\nlike Vapor, I was just personally\ninterested in AWS Lambda and could I get\nLaravel running on it and could I like\nbuild a deployment platform on it and I\njust I I went down that road for like 6\nmonths or whatever and I was like, well,\nI guess I'll ship this thing and you\nknow, it just kind of worked out. So,\nlot a lot of kind of happy accidents,\nsome pre-planning and masterful\nthinking, but a lot of happy accidents\nas well. Yeah, that's that sounds like\ncoding to me. Yeah, that's for sure. And\nand software entrepreneurship for that\nmatter, right? like trying to figure\nthings out as you go. I I do wonder now\nthat you have cloud, now that you have\nthese massive numbers of deployments and\nprobably also other kinds of products\nthat people are trying to deploy than\nyou may have seen before on Forge or\nwhatever. How does that impact the\nactual framework? Like how does your\nexperience with this at scale impact\nyour plans for the framework in the\nfuture? Yeah, there's been a few things.\nI wouldn't say they're major things, but\nlike when we start thinking about the\nscaling systems in cloud, we need maybe\nmore insights into what's happening in\nthe queue. For example, like how long\nare jobs sitting on the queue, how long\nare they running on the queue, what's\nthe oldest job on the queue, like that\nkind of info that we haven't exposed\nbefore. Maybe unless you're using\nsomething like Laravel Horizon, but for\nall Q drivers, we need that information\nto like intelligently autoscale. Um\nthere was a few other minor things we\nadded to the framework to make like you\nknow file storage easier with cloud or\nsomething like that but honestly we\ndidn't we didn't change any major pieces\nof the framework. I think what's\ninteresting for me on cloud though that\nI didn't expect in terms of like the\ntypes of applications we're seeing or\nmaybe customers is when we first built\ncloud I kind of wondered like or at\nleast one of the fears I had was\neveryone's already kind of deployed\ntheir Laravel apps on Forge you know and\nso so why why come to cloud but I think\nwhat we're discovering is there actually\nwas this like contingent of a little bit\nlarger applications that maybe were\nrolling their own Kubernetes at at some\ncompany and they're having headaches\nwith it all the time because it's\ncomplicated and they would love to run\nsomething fully managed, but they felt\nlike Forge was not quite enough for them\nand cloud kind of hits that sweet spot.\nSo, we are seeing customers like that\nthat I didn't expect, which is really\ncool to hear their stories and to talk\nto them and to try to get them on cloud\nand help them be successful. Yeah, that\nthat sounds like you're getting into a\nnew segment of customers here. Yeah.\nRight. A little bit. That's just really\nfun and probably like highly promising\nfor the success of the platform. Yeah.\nYeah. I'm excited about it. It's fun.\nHas people using Laravel on the cloud\nsurface something about Laravel that you\ndidn't expect to see? Like is there is\nthere any surprise in there or has there\nbeen? Oh gosh. You know, we see all\nsorts of things both on cloud and forge,\nyou know. Um we see things look at mine\nplease.\nWe see things like the the typical stuff\nyou might expect with a web framework\nlike a a web request that's firing off\n500 database queries and the page is\nslow and depending on what database or\ncache setup they're using that adds up\nto a lot of latency or whatever. So we\nwe see things like that maybe more so\nthan we expected honestly. So you know\nthere's a temptation to want to be like\nokay well you should fix your\napplication that's not our problem but\nthat's going to continue to happen. we\nhave to we have to make it fast even if\nthe app is not ideal you know um so\nthat's one thing we're focusing on right\nnow is like how do we make it as fast as\npossible even if the app's running 400\n500 database queries in a single request\nuh that's that's interesting yeah I\nguess that is also a problem that you\nwill never be able to get rid of right\nyou always have beginners you always\nwill have like AI written code that is\nsuper weird and pretty and\nnon-performant that that will be\ndeployed probably automatically because\nthere's some weird auto PR merger or\nwhatever. Interesting. I guess that you\nhave to solve on the hardware level or\non the optimization level, but I wonder\nbecause now with with Nightwatch in\nparticular, you get more introspection\ninto like how this works. So, is this\ngoing\n\n\nTo be something that you're going to try, don't want to say to push, but to suggest heavily to users to kind of use by default just to see their performance and be able to optimize it.\nYeah, I I think you should.\nUm, we've discovered so much honestly about our own apps.\nWe've been running Nightwatch on Forge and to give context, Nightwatch is like an application observability tool for Laravel that shows you all your performance metrics for requests, queries, all that.\nWe've been running it on Forge and we immediately saw things we didn't know about.\nUm whether it was like these outlier requests that are super long for certain customers and many times those are your most important customers because they have the most servers and data and all of that or pages that were doing more queries than we expected.\nWe actually had a situation the other day on cloud where we were having trouble debugging a problem I believe and so we actually put them on Nightwatch early to help figure this out and were able to like immediately see what was going on, which was super cool.\nNightwatch should be coming out in early June.\nIt is going to have a free plan actually, a totally free plan where you can kind of kick the tires and see the entire product without really any feature gaining or anything.\nSo, everyone will be able to kind of get a taste of it and see like if it works for them or if it's helpful.\nI think it's it's pretty crazy helpful in my opinion.\nUm, so I'm excited to get it out there.\nYeah.\nLike and some kind of observability tool, APM, whatever you want to call it, is to for me at least something that I try to get in as soon as possible just to avoid these kind of scale issues because it tends to be a scaling issue, right?\nLike things are slow that's fine in the beginning but they get slow and aggregate, well that's a problem, right?\nSo that's that's really cool to see.\nUm and also been something that I've been personally having trouble with in the past, like just even to get Sentry or whatever integrated into a PHP application, well that's hard.\nLike there's a lot of work that needs to be done that has very little to do with the actual application and a lot to do with the server management side of things and that's what you guys probably do much better than I, right?\nSo for that reason, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.\nI can't wait to get my invite at some point.\nYeah, I'm really looking forward to not having to deal with this and also knowing that the people who deal with this actually know what they're doing.\nThat to me is that's the great thing about the Laravel ecosystem to begin with.\nLike you you mentioned Spark earlier, I process all my payments through Spark, right?\nThrough the billing system and Nova is also my back end that I use for administrative stuff because that is just the best way to integrate into a Laravel application.\nI think you you've been doing a really good job at finding the next thing that people use something else for right now because there isn't anything but actually want something done by you.\nDo you think this is going to change like with cloud in terms of that you're not going to have like standalone products anymore and it's all going to be part of cloud?\nBecause that's I think a fear that a lot of open source people might have that it's all going to be bundled into this and then not be able to extract it into a standalone deployment anymore.\nLike what's the strategy for you there for future products?\nI mean, I don't think we would try to force anything like that.\nUm, I think we'll honestly have our hands full with just the core feature set of cloud for a long time.\nUm, so to be honest, we haven't thought a lot about like future products that might be standalone or built into cloud.\nIt's just sort of too far out there on the timeline.\nUm but even Nightwatch is a good example of like we could have sort of built the observability stuff into cloud um and said if you want all of this good observability stuff you need to run on Laravel cloud because that's most commercially advantageous to us.\nUh but we didn't do that obviously.\nIt's a whole separate product that you can use whether you're on Forge or cloud or even just rolling your own AWS deployment.\nUm you just run the Nightwatch agent wherever you are and we start pulling in the data.\nSo you know I've already been conscious of that and it's something I want to avoid is sort of like I think it's very obvious when companies like artificially force you into certain things that are only that way so that they can get the maximum amount of money from you instead of like what's actually good for the user or the most users or you know what's going to be good for us long term.\nYeah, I think we'll have our hands full with these two new products for a while anyway.\nOh, for sure.\nAnd I think they are probably Yeah.\nThe most ambitious and most like nuanced products that you've built like ever ever since you started with all of this.\nI I love this like when I when I heard uh the Nightwatch announcement at Laracon, like I was watching it through the stream cuz you know you busy at another conference but I I love just the idea of you finally tackling this because it always has been something I want this.\nI hope they're going to make it and and then it's just gonna naturally happen because you you also have the the other system that needs the observability to be performant, right?\nYeah, me too.\nLike even um even just like one screen of Nightwatch, like for me, like the log screen of Nightwatch, anytime I'm starting up a new Laravel project, I would always just almost kick the can down the road of setting up proper logging because I knew it was just going to be a pain and I didn't want to mess with it.\nBut just even if I only had logs in Nightwatch, I'd be happy with that.\nLike that's just so much better and a level up of the experience for me.\nYeah, you should see what I'm using.\nI use uh like an SSH connection that uh has a tail on the Laravel logs file in the storage directory.\nThat's my logging, like that's running right here somewhere.\nThat's nicer looking than a lot of solutions I've seen, right?\nBut that's not how it should be, right?\nLike there should be like from the start a way for you to opt into something that that works for you, has data retention and searchability, that kind of stuff.\nThat that matters a lot to me.\nUm and I'm I'm glad you're building this.\nI do wonder uh and this is probably something that is is a very recent thing.\nHow much AI in in terms of like in all kinds of ways Laravel will have in the future.\nLike right now AI and Laravel to me is really just I ask my chat and my claws to build me Laravel stuff and it is good enough to build this and understand like what Eloquent is, what the Laravel like directory structure and and what jobs are, cues are and that like AI can build Laravel apps pretty well.\nBut I wonder what your perspective is on both using AI to code with and AI as a part of the larger Laravel ecosystem.\nWhat are the thoughts there at the moment?\nYeah.\nUm, so I'll start with like my view on AI coding in general, which I'm really bullish on.\nI think that probably all programmers will use AI assistance in the future.\nI think that's pretty inevitable at this point and it's it feels like we're almost already there basically.\nAnd I think it's great honestly.\nLike I think it's awesome.\nI wish I had those kind of tools when I was first learning to program.\nI think it's awesome for writing the language you know, but I think it's also awesome for learning new languages and spiking out something in something you're not familiar with.\nSo very bullish on that and think that will continue to get better and more pervasive in the future.\nAs far as AI and Laravel, I mean, I think about it in a couple different ways.\nOne thing we're kind of kicking around now is I think you're right that like the current tools actually write Laravel pretty adequately and it's totally pretty much fine every time I use it.\nThis kind of stuff is changing every day.\nLike even just yesterday I saw like the cloud code SDK and the new GitHub action stuff.\nSo it's just like a constantly changing thing.\nI think I'm interested in like seeing how we can teach the AI sort of like that final level of polish that you know you might put on a Laravel app.\nUh, Laravel's been around a long time, which is great for the AI stuff because it's there's lots of stuff out there for it to be trained on and code and all of that and material, but um, like how can we get it to write Laravel, how maybe we would write Laravel as a company or be a little bit more opinionated with the latest sort of like best practices and and how we would write things cleanly.\nSo, we're interested in that.\nI'm also interested from like a tooling perspective.\nI think it's going to be really important for Laravel to be the easiest fullstack framework to integrate AI with whether that's like an AI SDK.\nUm, so in PHP, the most popular one right now is probably Prism PHP which is like a backend agnostic AI SDK very similar to Vercel's AI SDK where you can use OpenAI or Anthropic or all these other providers.\nSo that another thing we're kind of working on right now is the fastest way to build MCP servers with Laravel.\nSo many people are writing those these days and we'll see if that continues.\nIt's hard to it's hard to say um because things change so fast, but that's something we're actively working on right now trying to get to 1.0 is basically an MCP server framework for Laravel that feels very easy to get started with and quick to spin up these ideas and deploy them as well.\nSo I mean overall, yeah, I think there's going to be more AI related stuff in dev and Laravel.\nI think it's overall a good thing.\nI I think it's really cool and really helpful.\nAnd um I want Laravel to be the best way and and fastest way, most productive way to build AI powered apps.\nAnd I think Laravel's always been an opinionated full stack framework and it makes sense for us to have an opinion and a clean way to integrate this stuff into your apps.\nI think we'd be kind of like burying our head in the sand if we didn't do that.\nYeah, it would be like missing the the just the the point of conversation that is happening right now in the community, right?\nLike everybody's trying to figure it out.\nLike people have opinions obviously they always have opinions and and you know in all different kinds of ways but yeah I like what you're saying because you're not saying we need AI in our product because so many people do.\nYou say we we should facilitate people using AI to build products.\nThat is a very different thing and I love it.\nI love the fact that it's not about you know like hyping or using the the hype train but actually building reasonably useful things with a new technology.\nI I that that is most appreciated and I agree like uh making it easy to build things with AI and through AI that should be the angle for a framework right now.\nMy my big dream is that a framework and Laravel should could maybe the first um ships the Laravel installer ships with a really really small language model that is purposely and you know intentionally trained just on writing extremely good Laravel code and you can run it locally.\nIt it runs in the IDE.\nI mean, I look at my my PHP storm and they have some weird internal little code completion things.\nNow, I don't know what it is, but I assume it's it's a really small language model.\nIf that would be something a framework can provide and then all frameworks could provide something like this for their code bases, that would be so cool and so helpful.\nI think we're like not far from that, honestly.\nYou know, with like this isn't local, but like with things like the cloud code SDK that I that I was talking about that I saw yesterday, the ability to interact with it non-interactively like they announced and feed it prompts and context and things gets us close to having like these artisan commands or local things that I actually know how to write good Laravel code which is I think super cool.\nMe too.\nLike obviously like I yesterday was a moment for me too where I used June.\nI think that's the internal agent that PHP Storm um offers now.\nAnd and I use it for the first time and it was bizarre.\nLike I'm I'm not much into agentic coding cuz I still want to do my own coding which is probably a traditionalist's perspective at this point.\nBut I I gave it a task.\nI wrote a spec.\nI took 20 minutes to write the spec and then I just walked upstairs to get a coffee.\nI came back down and the thing was implemented.\nAnd I was like, this is crazy in the best and worst way at the same time because like now the thing is doing my job.\nAll I'm doing is instruct.\nInteresting to say the least.\nLike how how much AI coding do you use like for developing Laravel features at this point?\nLike how how does that work for you and the team I guess?\nSo a lot of the work I do on Laravel is reviewing PRs and a lot of the changes I have to make are relatively minor and don't require assistance, but some of them end up being pretty big.\nAnd what I'm really interested in and what I what I thought about yesterday when I read about this new GitHub actions integration with Claude and stuff is like a lot of times if I get a PR that's sort of non-trivial and I have some feedback to give to the author and then I just kind of have to sit around and wait for that to be implemented if it ever is, right?\nLike if if they come back, if we're able to unlock that in like PRs as a open source maintainer, if I could just at the agent, Hey, this PR is 90% good.\nHere's the things I don't like and kind of want to change about it.\nCan you implement that?\nAnd it I can go downstairs and get a snack and come back and it's kind of done.\nThat's like insane, you know, unlock.\nUm, so yeah, I'm curious to see.\nI'm curious to see how that develops.\nYeah, I see the same thing for um security testing or even for just trying to do background improvements like when you were just saying that the thing about how people on cloud uh built these weird apps that have 500 database queries.\nWell, what if you could spin up a complete clone of the repo, like have an agent try to fix it and suggest it to them automatically because you're linked to that GitHub account anyway, right?\nThat to me is smart AI usage inside a product.\nYeah.\nAnd I think we're super interested in that for Nightwatch.\nAnd so some of the ways we're using AI on Nightwatch right now are pretty basic,\n\n\nLike summarizing exceptions or issues or things like that.\nBut you could imagine where we could do something like what you're saying.\nWe know pretty much exactly why the request was slow, either which middleware it was, which query it is.\nWe can see if there was an index on the query, all of that stuff.\nIf we're integrated with cloud, then we can just, we know what repo it is.\nWe can send you a PR, we can deploy it for you on cloud.\nSo, it's kind of the whole story could be covered, which I'm very interested in exploring.\nYeah, for sure.\nYeah, that's that's going to be a really fun time.\nIt's already fun, right?\nIt's already fun to have these things do things for you, but to have that done in the background and have problems be fixed before you even notice them.\nI, that, that is a, it's going to be a weird future for people who are traditionally trained software engineers.\nThat's how I feel.\nYeah, I, it's different, but I think it's exciting.\nI, I don't feel threatened by it, uh, at all, you know, like some people, um, seem to.\nI think it's really an exciting unlock in productivity for developers and just gives you so much more power.\nHonestly, as a single founder as well, like if you're bootstrapping a company and it's just you working on something, you can just be so much more productive, especially on maybe the boilerplate work that is pretty boring, that often is where a product kind of gets stuck.\nYou know, like if you've done a lot of side projects, you know, it's basically a joke at this point how many unfinished side projects people everyone has, right?\nAnd you, they usually fizzle out because you lose excitement during the non- boring parts of the development cycle.\nAnd being able to kind of push through that with AI is pretty exciting.\nYeah, I, I heard a lot of people are now doing VIPE coding on the side on their old projects just by throwing them into cursor or wind surf or whatever and like finish this.\nThat's really how that works.\nAnd I love this.\nI love that code gets like reactivated, resurrected even, and then some agent takes, maybe takes care of it.\nMaybe it goes nowhere, but maybe it goes to a point where people can actually deploy it and then something is built that wouldn't have been built before.\nThat's really cool.\nDo you think you're ever going to hire like a full-time AI employee?\nI could see that happening.\nI wouldn't be, I wouldn't be surprised, honestly.\nI'd almost be more surprised if we didn't eventually.\nYeah.\nRight.\nLike it's going to be a cyborg team at some point.\nYeah.\nPretty wild.\nThat's bizarre.\nWell, I'm glad you have a very sensitive approach, uh, to AI.\nOne thing that when I think about like AI existing AI systems like platforms that help you build code, I want to mention one thing.\nI asked my, my Twitter feed a question recently, uh, about what the number one thing is that stops them from using Laravel for the next indie business because my, my audience is a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of software people at the intersection, and I would just wanted to see what's, what's the vibe around Laravel and why do people not use it because the people who do use it, there's a lot of them, they, they are very happy with it and they understand that the ecosystem is really cool, the integrations are easy, if I want payment, I just do one composer require and I'm kind of done, like that kind of stuff is just extremely powerful, so I wanted to see the other side and besides all the people saying, well, PHP sucks, what you, you will find those people still, like that, that are kind of left in the the PHP 4.0 world of 2005 or whatever, and people who still use JavaScript or they use JavaScript for everything because that's also like from the server to the front end to mobile, you can use it on every platform, fine with them, the interesting ones were, and I'm going to quote this verbatim because I want to see what you think about this, I don't use Laravel because the fact that neither cursor nor replet ever suggests Laravel as an option.\nI found that interesting, like what are you going to do about that?\nLike how can you actually get your, your framework into these tools?\nI mean, I think that's something we are working on that internally, even with the AI providers, you know, trying to improve this.\nI think it's like a valid point, right?\nIt's, and it goes for all, all, all new frameworks that will ever be created, right?\nLike it, it has created this weird situation where if I were to write Laravel today, it would, like the AI would have no idea how to write it.\nIt's, it feels like almost so much harder to launch an open-source web framework work today than it was 10 years ago because of this very problem.\nAnd I'm very interested to like solve it, uh, because I think Laravel is uniquely suited to, I think it's the most like expansive and cohesive full stack ecosystem you can write a web application in, in the sense that there's a solution for pretty much every problem you're going to have more or less.\nAnd so for AI just to be able to write all of that and you can deploy it and you don't have to go sign up for eight different SAS services to sort of build your, your full stack app is really cool.\nUm, so yeah, we're aware of this and like very interested in trying to solve this as best we can.\nUm, but because I think it's totally valid, like it's like the new, it's the new SEO basically, you know.\nIt really is a, a AIO or or something, right?\nLike that's, that's where we are.\nYeah, I think Stripe has been doing something really interesting with her, with, with their dogs, like they, it's almost like now native markdown and a copy to markdown button is everywhere and even like open this in chat GPT is a, is a button, like a button that's bigger than other buttons in the documentation.\nI think they've understood that they need to feed these things into the systems either by usage or by asking CHBT to crawl it so that it gets ingested into the the next batch of training data for the model.\nLike that's the AI optimization stuff that we are still all just trying to figure out.\nLike llm.txt describer full website somewhere and then all documentation with code examples to just ingest.\nIt's, it's a bizarre world we're in cuz I didn't have this on my menu for June, 2025, that I have to export all my docs as markdown file for some computer to eat, right?\nNo, I know it's crazy.\nI never would have expected it.\nHonestly, it's, it's been a wild couple years, but I can already feel like personally how my software development experience is completely alien to what it would have been like two or three years ago.\nAnd that's not even with agentic stuff.\nJust even being able to take a piece of code, throwing it into some window, and telling it, \"Hey, fix this.\"\nAnd it does fix it.\nThat is magical.\nI, I laugh sometimes because over the years, you know, six or seven years ago, I would routinely ask like on Twitter, what should we build next for Laravel, you know, just to get feedback?\nAnd there was always these like joking responses of like, can it build my app for me?\nCan it like code for me?\nAnd now that is like 100% reality, which is so mind-blowing.\nAnd at the time it just felt like a joke, you know, and that was not that long ago.\nYep.\nI'm, I'm not surprised that people are afraid for their jobs or just even for for stability.\nI hear it from investors, too.\nPeople who are investing in SAS businesses, they don't know like where's this going to go?\nAre we investing in something that somebody could build in 20 minutes a couple years from now or is there a mode?\nWhat is the mode?\nRight?\nLike that, that is that is problematic.\nI, I think what you're doing in building the the whole system, like from the framework to the tools used to deploy it to the place where it's deployed and the service, like the customer success teams that help you deploy this.\nI think that's the mode is to have control over the whole like channel from start to finish.\nBut I could see how other people don't have that luxury, right?\nLike that's a real problem to them.\nYeah.\nAnd for many people, the ideas were the hard part in my opinion.\nLike you can, you can build apps that have no product market fit faster than you could before.\nYou know what I mean?\nYeah, that's right.\nThat's the one thing that that never changes, right?\nLike there's a, there's a lot of bad ideas that are now just executed faster.\nThat's Yeah, that's pretty much.\nYeah.\nWhich is fine.\nBetter to like fail fast, you know, than to waste a lot of time and fail after years of develop hand coding onto the next idea.\nYeah, I, I wonder where the balance is.\nI, I do wonder where the balance is here because sometimes failing fast is like what, two days of no customers and the idea is bad, right?\nLike is should I take a month to to see if I can actually do some marketing that that it might be too fast and a lot of people have like AI FOMO and they just feel like they need to add AI features and whatnot and they fail to see like what the actual value is.\nYeah, maybe it's screwing up our entire like business founder attention span of like, uh, I didn't hit 100k, you know, a week in the first 24 hours.\nThis is done.\nYou know, honestly, if if you look at Twitter, that's exactly what's happening because the algorithms then also amplify these totally outlandish messages of people who had a fluke success or just like random chance.\nYeah, that's that's going to be a problem, but I guess that's a problem for another day.\nUm, I think we, we talk about the the stuff that's happening right now here, right?\nAnd I think Laravel is happening right now.\nTo, to anybody who thinks PHP is, uh, outdated in in 2025, what is your perspective as somebody who's built an empire on top of that language?\nYou know, I think PHP has such an interesting history from being created in a very similar way to how Laravel was, of just like a guy's personal collection of tools to build his own ideas faster to powering facebook.com and many other, you know, very notable startups.\nI think PHP is like, it's one of the few languages that was built specifically for the web and only for web programming in its in its original inception.\nAnd it's honestly just still such a fast, productive, nononsense kind of language that anyone can learn.\nIt's very quick to learn even in just like a week, you know, especially with AI assistance.\nIt's not a very complicated language, uh, but yet it's fast and there's tons of documentation.\nThere's tons of educational material about PHP, about Laravel.\nAnd I still think it's really like the most productive way to build a web app, especially paired with tools like LiveWire or Inertia where you can pair like a modern React or Vue front end with your Laravel backend in a way that just doesn't make you want to pull your hair out.\nI, I think it's a great way to build applications.\nAnd so that's why I still, like if I was starting a new business today, it's, I'm not even thinking about anything else.\nAnd obviously I, I built Laravel, but I just think it's just the fastest, most productive way to build things.\nAnd I hear so many times of like, I'll hear developers venture into other ecosystems, whether it's like full stack JavaScript or something else, and then come back and be like, \"Oh my gosh, like I'm so much more productive on this stack.\nUh, my team is more productive,\" uh, because we're not, you know, it's nice just to have a structure and a set of opinions on how to build things and not have to like reinvent the wheel for every possible thing you need to build, uh, which I think is one area that Laravel excels.\nYeah.\nAnd, and I think our, our community, I'm just saying our because I feel like I'm part of the Laravel community, is, is not as fragmented and doesn't have as much infighting, right?\nThere's, there's not this kind of framework versus framework stuff.\nLike you literally have Vue.js and and React and whatever you want to put there.\nSwell, sure, why not, right?\nI think you, you can find a way with inertia to to get all of these things working together.\nI think Laravel is, is a, is an integrated framework and and not like a, an excluding kind of framework.\nI, I think it's very integrated and very cohesive.\nAnd I think what separates Laravel from maybe other, let's say, more traditional full stack frameworks is we're also, I think, an open-minded community in terms of as developer tastes and practices change, we adopt them in a way that is not like reactionary, but like considered, and I think inertia is like a great example of that of like, look, it's just unrealistic to expect people to write their frontends using PHP echo tags forever, react in a in a large way as kind of one, let's say, front-end mind share among developers, and we would be silly to ignore that, similar, we would be silly to ignore AI and say, oh, that's for the kids, that's stupid, we only handw write artisan code over here, you know, so I've always been one to not reject where things are heading or not like blind myself to it, and we've tried to just kind of embrace, you know, as the web development landscape evolves, we evolve with it as best we can and continue to try to build the most productive way to build apps.\nYeah, I'm not surprised.\nI think that's, that's what PHP was too, right?\nPHP was this collection of things and then it got better and better with every version and integrated object-oriented stuff and it moved away from these weird like arbitrarily named things to a better internal structure.\nRight?\nThe first time I, I built PHP was 4.0 somewhere in 2002 or 2003.\nLike it was, I was doing typo3 backend extensions and it was a horrible thing to do, but it worked, and that's the last time I used PHP prior to getting into Laravel like a couple years ago.\nSo I had all this, this stuff still in my mind about how unusable it was, but I find myself not even using any of the the functions that I used back in the day.\nThat's how much the language has changed.\nYeah, it's pretty crazy and it's easy to like, I mean, you can download like a reactor view or livewire starter kit and just kind of look at the code and it, it is pretty different, you know, it's very different than how PHP used to be written.\nYeah, for sure.\nAnd, and I think that's the great part, like you, you, it's a, it's a thing that adapts to the reality in which it operates.\nThat is the opposite of having this kind of very agenda-driven, uh, framework development.\nI don't want to hate on anybody, like do whatever you want.\nI just love that this is, uh, the choice that I can now make and build my own monetized applications faster and more reliable.\n\n\nThan I ever could before.\nSo, I really appreciate you spending like your whole life building this.\nSo, thank you so much.\nIt's really cool.\nAnd I also appreciate all the um the products you built along the way because not only are they helpful to me as a developer, they are inspirational to me as a founder.\nThat is something and to a lot of people out there, right?\nLike the way you approach business and the way the decisions that you make along the way, what you've just voiced over the last uh half hour or so, that is why this is successful.\nSo, thanks so much for sharing all these uh very amazing insights.\nI can't wait to see what the future holds for Laravel.\nWhere can people follow you and uh the businesses that you run and the journey that you're on if they want to see more?\nYeah, so they can follow me personally on xx.com/Taylor Otwell.\nUm, you can follow Laravel at x.com/laravelphp or just at laravel.com and cloud.laravel.com is where you can check out, you know, our latest uh cloud platform and nightwatch.l.com will be coming soon so you can get on the waiting list for that.\nThat is amazing.\nWell, thanks so much Teddar for being on that.\nThat was great insight into a framework that I love.\nSo, thanks for everything, man.\nYeah, thanks for having me.\nAnd that's it for today.\nThank you so much for listening to the Bootstrap Founder.\nYou can find me on Twitter at Arvid kahl.\nAnd if you want to support me in this show, please share Podscan.fm my SAS business with
