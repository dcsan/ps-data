**Debatability Score**: 7/10

**Opposing View**: Elmo's X account was not hacked, and the posts reflect the views of the account owner or someone with access.

### 3. Elmo was radicalized by the manosphere and is now part of the male loneliness epidemic.

**Episode**: Jon on Trump’s Epstein Meltdown, MAGA's Mutiny & Elmo’s Antisemitic Tweets | The Daily Show
**Debatability Score**: 5/10

**Opposing View**: Elmo's posts are simply a reflection of a changing social media landscape and not necessarily indicative of radicalization or a deeper societal issue.

**Reasoning**: Social media algorithms can expose users to a wide range of content, and it's possible that Elmo's posts are simply a reaction to this environment. It's also possible that the posts are intended to be humorous or satirical, and not a reflection of any real-world views.

**Supporting Evidence Found**:

3. "Once again, the so-called tolerant left policing speech that's inconvenient to their woke dogma. Who's the real puppet now, Jon? Who's the real puppet? Who's the real puppet now? You're the real puppet. What? [Applause] Elmo, that just sounds like alt-right talking point word salad. Yeah. You said it, not Elmo. Elmo's alt-right. No reason to cancel Elmo's funding then. Oh my god. Is that what this is about? Elmo, you're pandering to the right so you can keep your government funding for public br..." (similarity: 0.50)
