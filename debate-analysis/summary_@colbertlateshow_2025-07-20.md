## Top 10 Most Debatable Topics

**Debatability Score**: 8/10

**Opposing View**: The portrayal of politicians by opposing parties is often accurate, and voters are justified in their skepticism of those who are frequently attacked.

**Reasoning**: Voters may believe that negative portrayals, while potentially exaggerated, reflect underlying truths about a politician's policies or character. They may also believe that politicians are intentionally misleading the public.

### 2. Democrats need to be pressing the case in every part of the country, realizing we're not going to win everyone over.

**Debatability Score**: 7/10

**Opposing View**: Democrats should prioritize winning over specific demographics and regions where they have a higher chance of success, rather than spreading resources thinly across all areas.

**Reasoning**: Focusing resources on winnable areas maximizes impact and avoids wasting time and money in places where the political climate is fundamentally opposed to Democratic policies. This approach allows for more effective campaigning and resource allocation.

### 3. I met with the Farm Bureau, a very conservative group, and I could tell they were kind of standoffish, a little suspicious.

**Debatability Score**: 6/10

**Opposing View**: Building trust with conservative groups requires more than just a single meeting; it demands consistent engagement and a willingness to compromise on key issues.

**Reasoning**: Conservative groups may have deeply ingrained distrust of Democrats. A single meeting is unlikely to overcome this. Building trust requires sustained effort, demonstrating a genuine understanding of their concerns, and a willingness to find common ground.
