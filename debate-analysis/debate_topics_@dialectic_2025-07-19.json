      "reasoning": "While a lack of understanding can be problematic, simplifying systems can also make them more accessible to a wider audience. Not everyone needs to understand the inner workings of a system to use it effectively. The focus should be on balancing usability with the ability to understand and troubleshoot when necessary. In some cases, the complexity of understanding a system might outweigh the benefits for the average user. The key is to provide appropriate levels of transparency and control based on the user's needs and technical expertise.",
