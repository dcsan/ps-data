## Top 10 Most Debatable Topics

### 1. Tool discovery is the killer feature of MCP, and it differentiates it from open API.

**Episode**: The rise of the agentic economy on the shoulders of MCP — Jan Curn, Apify
**Debatability Score**: 8/10

**Opposing View**: Open APIs, with their flexibility and broad applicability, are a more significant differentiator than tool discovery, which may be a niche feature.

**Reasoning**: Open APIs allow for a wider range of integrations and applications, fostering innovation across various domains. Tool discovery, while useful, may be limited in scope compared to the broader capabilities offered by open APIs. The ease of use and flexibility of open APIs could be a more compelling advantage.

**Supporting Evidence Found**:
1. "Yeah, it sounds maybe you have to be less prescriptive about like how your API works because as long as you're passing the right parameters in a way that's structured enough, maybe you don't have to get super granular. I I think it would be silly right now to not if you have a product that has a unique service or value point that users are accessing via the web or UI. I think it would be pretty silly in most cases not to be thinking about an API because of if not just for the like rapid success ..." (similarity: 0.53)
2. "And actually this only became possible thanks to uh, I would say the killer feature of MCP, which is the tool discovery, right? Actually, um, not many clients didn't support this yet. Uh, but uh, just just today I saw that VS Code added support for it. Uh, and actually just like two days ago, for desktop added support for tool discovery. And basically how it works is that um, the client connects to the MCP server and dynamically discovers tools to use and to interact with based on the workflow, ..." (similarity: 0.53)
3. "Yeah, I think the the real power of a lot of these APIs is is both when you can pull content, but also when you can can do things, right? Like when you can start stuff or save things or modify.

Yeah. Especially things that have like a UI because it gets you out of doing click ops for things.

Yeah.

But also, I mean, you're getting into AI ops, but like Yeah. If you're clicking around a UI to trigger things and now you have a tool to interact with that via natural language. That seems interesti..." (similarity: 0.53)

### 2. MCP's way of being allowed to operate as effectively a subprocess over standard in and standard out is extremely useful for lots of use cases.

**Episode**: MCP is all you need — Samuel Colvin, Pydantic
**Debatability Score**: 8/10

**Opposing View**: Relying on standard in/out for subprocess communication, while convenient in some cases, can introduce performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities compared to more robust inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.

**Reasoning**: Users might prioritize performance and security over ease of use. They might argue that standard in/out is slower and more susceptible to injection attacks than other IPC methods like sockets or message queues, especially in production environments.

### 3. General intelligence will emerge through the interaction of multiple entities, or agents, in computing systems.

**Episode**: The rise of the agentic economy on the shoulders of MCP — Jan Curn, Apify
**Debatability Score**: 7/10

**Opposing View**: General intelligence will not emerge solely through the interaction of multiple agents; other factors, such as algorithmic advancements and hardware capabilities, are equally or more critical.

**Reasoning**: While agent interaction is important, focusing solely on it ignores the significant role of underlying algorithms and the hardware that supports them. Improvements in these areas may be the primary drivers of general intelligence, not just the interactions between agents.

**Supporting Evidence Found**:
1. "And uh, so this leads to my final question: so how or how will the general intelligence emerge in computing systems, right? And there is a lot of talk about AGI and like, you know, like ever larger models uh, exhibiting like super intelligent behavior, but in my opinion, the like general intelligence will actually emerge through interaction of multiple entities, can call them agents, basically like multiple models uh, pursuing their own goals, interacting with each other, and uh, altogether exhi..." (similarity: 0.61)
2. "And then there’s a bunch of other factors. Another thing is that, within humans, performance on the task of AI R&D varies wildly. There’s a huge variation between the median human and the best human on ability to do this. Some of that’s training; some of that’s genetics; some of that’s upbringing from things other than direct training, like training on other tasks. So maybe that gives us another bunch of headroom. So you can imagine making 300-IQ humans without having much bigger brains, but jus..." (similarity: 0.57)
3. "and before we get all those things to
work together and then on top of this
have systems that can learn like
hierarchical planning hierarchical
representations systems that can be
configured for a lot of different
situation at hands the way the human
brain can um you know all of this is
going to take you know at least a decade
and probably much more because there are
a lot of problems that we're not seeing
right now we have not encountered and so
we don't know if there is a easy
solution within ..." (similarity: 0.56)

### 4. MCP can do many things, and people sometimes overcomplicate the situation when trying new ways of agent-to-agent communication.

**Episode**: MCP is all you need — Samuel Colvin, Pydantic
**Debatability Score**: 7/10

**Opposing View**: While MCP offers versatility, its broad capabilities can lead to a lack of focus and potential inefficiencies, making it less suitable for specific, streamlined agent-to-agent communication scenarios.

**Reasoning**: Some users might find that MCP's flexibility introduces unnecessary complexity for simpler tasks. They might prefer more specialized tools that are optimized for specific communication patterns, offering better performance or easier debugging.

**Supporting Evidence Found**:
1. "For me I think you need to define the difference between an an MCP server plus client that is just a proxy versus an agent. I think there's a difference and I think that difference might be in um you know for example using a sample loop to create a more richer experience to uh to to have a model call tools while like inside that MCP server through these clients. I think then you have a an actual like agent. Yeah I do think it's very simple to build agents that way. Yeah I think there are maybe a..." (similarity: 0.61)
2. "That's one possibility. Another is like maybe MCP makes sense as kind of like a foundational communication layer for agents to like compose with other agents or something like that. Or there could be other possibilities entirely maybe MCP should specialize and narrowly focus on kind of the AI application side and not as much on the agent side. I think it's a very live question and I think there are sort of trade-offs in every direction. Going back to the analogy of the god box I think one thing ..." (similarity: 0.61)
3. "Um there was a small but vibrant developer community. So models are getting smarter and MCPs are standardizing the way models talk to services. So are we finally done? Well, not quite. With MCP and a new ecosystem of services trying to target AI agents, we have a bunch of new problems showing up. So first I want to go through the list of user problems that we have. So the first one is fragmentation. There are more and more MCP servers being deployed every single day and it's becoming hard to fin..." (similarity: 0.60)

### 5. I argue that unless the agents are able to purchase services, we will not be able to reach some higher level of intelligence.

**Episode**: The rise of the agentic economy on the shoulders of MCP — Jan Curn, Apify
**Debatability Score**: 6/10

**Opposing View**: The ability of agents to purchase services is not a necessary condition for achieving higher levels of intelligence; other mechanisms, such as free resource sharing or hierarchical control, could suffice.

**Reasoning**: Agents could potentially collaborate and share resources without the need for monetary transactions. A hierarchical system where agents are assigned tasks and resources could also lead to advanced intelligence without requiring a market-based economy.

**Supporting Evidence Found**:
1. "So does it mean with like so many tools now support MCP, so does it mean like the agents can discover and access any of them on their own, right? Well, not really, because to use those services, your agents still need uh, to have like API tokens to those services, right? So even let's say if you use Zapier, MCMCP that provides access to like 5,000 apps they have in their marketplace, you still need to connect those individual apps to your services, right? You know, like GitHub or Slack or, you k..." (similarity: 0.60)
2. "Even if you call it an agent, they don't really have agency. It's because like they might—might act as an agent because in the system prompt you said you are an agent and your goal is to provide your users with the best information on a specific topic. But this agency didn't come from the agent itself; it came from you. So you instructed it to be an agent, and if—because the LLM doesn't really understand what it does, it just, you know, generates text. Sometimes this agency will be violated, so ..." (similarity: 0.55)
3. "Why it matters is because it provides us with another level of capabilities previously almost unique to humans. But before we get to that, let me say one thing, and that is many companies already, and every company should be working on already, on digital assets and really morphing them or evolving them for the usage of AI Agents. So you can think about it this way: every digital asset in your organization should become a tool for AI Agent retentmented generation itself or an Agent. And these ca..." (similarity: 0.54)

### 6. Sampling is this idea of a way where within MCP, the protocol, the server can effectively make a request back through the client to the LLM.

**Episode**: MCP is all you need — Samuel Colvin, Pydantic
**Debatability Score**: 6/10

**Opposing View**: The sampling mechanism within MCP, where the server requests back through the client to the LLM, introduces potential latency and control issues, making it less desirable than direct LLM access in certain applications.

**Reasoning**: Some developers might prefer direct control over LLM interactions to minimize latency and ensure predictable behavior. They might see the sampling approach as adding an unnecessary layer of indirection, potentially hindering performance or complicating error handling.

**Supporting Evidence Found**:
1. "Uh, client takes care of making that call to the MCP server. The MCP server now says, "Hey, I actually need to be able to use an LLM to answer whatever this question is." So, that then gets sent back to the client. The client proxies that request to the LLM, receives the response from the LLM, sends that uh onto the MCP server, and the MCP server then returns and we can continue on our way. Um, sampling is very powerful, not that widely supported at the moment. Um, I'm going to demo it today wit..." (similarity: 0.68)
2. "What, what if the uh remote agent that's operating as a tool could effectively piggyback off the uh the model that the original agent has access to? That's what sampling gives us. So as I say, I think sampling is a somewhat, uh, that's not making that any bigger, unfortunately. Um, is that clear on screen? I may, maybe I'll make it bigger like that. Um, sampling is this idea of a, of a way where within MCP, the protocol, the um server can effectively make a request back through the client to the..." (similarity: 0.64)
3. "uh because the llm is at the application
layer um and so that has control over uh
how R rate limits work or how it should
actually interact with the llm uh it
doesn't have to be that way like in
theory if the server Builder like the
first node wanted to own the interaction
with a specific llm maybe it's running
open source on that specific server it
could be the one that controls the LM
interaction but in the example I'm
giving here the llm lives at the very
base layer and the application layer ..." (similarity: 0.57)
