The study identified a number of compounds whose concentrations were observed to increase when dog hair was wet; these encompassed a whole range of independent odours, from ‘sulfurous’, to ‘medicinal’, to fruity, and ‘earthy’. They also found that the concentration of some compounds increased more drastically than others.   The concentrations of benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, acetaldehyde, phenol, and 2-methylbutanal above increased by a greater factor compared to dry dog hair than some of the other compounds."
