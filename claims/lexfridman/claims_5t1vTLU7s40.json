You can easily imagine how it would confer evolutionary advantages: by facilitating cooperative activities, transmitting knowledge about how to build tools and conveying social knowledge. As people started living in larger groups, it became more important to keep track of various social relationships. Also, it’s very hard to transmit knowledge to future generations, and language allows us to do that very effectively. In line with the idea that we have language to communicate, there is accumulating evidence from the past few decades that shows that various properties that human languages have—there are about 7,000 of them spoken and signed across the world—are optimized for efficiently transmitting information, making things easy to perceive, easy to understand, easy to produce and easy to learn for kids."

Their approach incorporates auditory (sonification) and kinesthetic (drumming) elements alongside visual and auditory ones, creating a closed-loop interaction for enhanced learning.  The paper cites research supporting the idea that sensory experiences are crucial to knowledge acquisition and memory formation, highlighting the dual coding theory which posits that verbal and non-verbal inputs (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) are processed by different but interacting subsystems in the brain.\n",

Wittgenstein introduces the idea of “following a rule” to describe what we do when we use a word in everyday life, but what it is to “follow a rule” is notoriously difficult to pin down. Pears’ interpretation was that following a rule was akin to a judge applying a law in a case: Its validity depends on the past instances of how that rule was used, but also may set a new precedent for how that rule may be used in the future."

While not all scientists follow it exactly, especially when direct experimentation is impossible (e.g., studying star evolution), the core principles remain:  discovering cause-and-effect relationships through questioning, evidence gathering, and logical analysis.  The process begins with a question, followed by background research.  A hypothesis is then formulated and tested through experimentation.  Data analysis determines whether the hypothesis is supported or refuted, leading to further research or a revised hypothesis.  Observation and experimentation are fundamental throughout this iterative process.\n",
