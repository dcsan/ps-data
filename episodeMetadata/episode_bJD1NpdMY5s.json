    "summary": "The episode discusses the potential of fully automated companies, examining how Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will enable firms to replicate AI workers, bypassing traditional hiring bottlenecks. It envisions a future where \"Mega Steve\"-like AI systems, processing vast amounts of data, will outperform human CEOs. The discussion highlights how AI could revolutionize social organization, similar to the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to modern corporations. The episode also explores the massive scale of AI firms compared to current human-led companies and the profound differences in evolvability between AI and human-led organizations.",
