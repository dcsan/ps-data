The first one, *Stalin: Paradoxes of Power*. The second one, *Stalin: Waiting for Hitler*.\n\nThank you for coming on my podcast.\nThank you for the honor of the invitation.\n\nLet's begin with the tsarist regime. First question, how repressive was the tsarist regime actually? Presumably the motivation behind the revolution is to get rid of this autocracy. But you have these examples. Lenin's brother tried to kill the tsar. Lenin himself is writing these long manifestos about taking down capitalism and overthrowing the government. He and people like Stalin are in exile in Siberia, living off government money, robbing banks, and small shenanigans. Honestly, it sounds more forgiving than many countries today. How bad was it really?\n\nYou have to put yourself back in the time period to judge the level of repression based upon what norms were, what other regimes did, rather than take the 20th-century regimes as the guide and go back. We need to widen the aperture a little bit here.\n\nThis is the tsarist regime's problem. It needs to be able to compete in the international system. That means it needs a modern military and modern industry to underwrite that modern military. So it needs armaments, it needs steel, it needs chemicals. For that, you need workers. So you want the workers only to work in the industry. You don't want them, for example, to have a labor movement or to go on strike, or to have ideas about how politics should be organized. Similarly, with the intellectual side, you need the engineers. You need the engineers in order to design and build the modern attributes that you need to compete as a global power. But you don't want those educated people to have their own ideas and values about politics, about whether you'd want an autocratic government like the Russian regime has, or whether you'd want some other type of government. So all of these countries in the modern period have this dilemma: importing modernization but keeping out the political side, the value side that goes along with that. They need to have some way to repress and control the working-class organization, movement stuff, and the university-educated intellectuals. That's a problem we still have today. The Iranian regime now has that problem. The Chinese regime in Beijing has this problem. The Soviet Union had that problem. Contemporary Russia has that problem. How do you bring in modernity—meaning you have tanks, you have airplanes, or you have AI—but keep out, for example, separation of powers, freedom, property rights, all the things that undermine your dictatorial rule. The tsarist regime was a quintessential example of this fundamental dilemma. Modernization is not a sociological process that kind of just happens. It's a geopolitical process. You modernize because you need to compete in the international system. If somebody has ships made out of steel, either you also have ships made out of steel or they're going to show up at your door, like we did to Japan, and tell you that they're in charge now.\n\nThis was one of the most interesting takes in your first volume, that modernization is not this inevitable process but is instigated by ruthless geopolitical competition. Do you think that that still applies in today's world?\n\nYes, there are pockets of conflict in the Middle East or in Ukraine, which would motivate the key powers there to want to have modern militaries and modern technologies. But through most of the world… For example, the odds that if France falls behind technologically if their AI is worse, Germany is going to take over, is just sort of unthinkable.\n\nThis dynamic where in order to ward off colonization or other great powers, you need to stay at the cutting edge of technology and also have up-to-date political processes. Is that still a drive that moves countries forward?\n\nIf you have an autocratic regime, it is existential for you every day. You want to compete. France can compete or fail to compete, and its political system is not at risk. No one's going to say the regime is illegitimate because someone else beat them in AI. Students are going to protest in the streets. That's not going to mean that the regime is going to fall. There may be a change of government, but the system remains. You have this dilemma for the authoritarians. Think about Peter the Great. I need to compete against the great powers, so I need to have a navy. To get a navy, I need to have the industry that supports a navy. I need to have the officers. I need to have the technical skills. So I need to have all of that to be able to compete, but I have this autocratic regime. How do I retain the social structure, the hierarchy? It’s non-elected, non-legitimate in some ways based upon modern understandings of constitutional order. How do I retain that while I'm importing these attributes of modern power? That's the stuff that persists today for Iran, Russia, China, North Korea. They have to get very good at holding at bay those attributes of modernity that threaten their political regime while importing as much as they can of the attributes… It's two sides of the same coin. The thing that gets you the engineers also gets you the possible political ideas. So the tsarist regime begins to repress the very thing it needs to compete in the international system. It represses the working class and it represses the engineers and the intellectuals, without which it can't be a great power, without which it can't compete, but with which its political system is threatened. So the amount of repression is an important question. We would call this a vegetarian regime compared to the carnivores, like Joseph Stalin's regime or Hitler's regime, in terms of the degree of repression. But the dynamic of being compelled to exercise repression against the very people you need like oxygen, that's the dynamic that we see in tsarist Russia and that we still see today in a certain form.\n\nIs one of the key lessons from your volumes that you should be tripping over yourself in order to embrace a lesser of two evils? Does that apply to all the examples you give? This is maybe a general question about how much you can actually learn from history. For every seeming lesson, there's an equal and opposite lesson that you can also learn. During the tsarist regime, in retrospect, we can say that the liberals and the constitutionalists should have cooperated with Stolypin or Witte. Even though it was an autocratic regime, they were actually doing these real reforms and there was growth. They should have continued that process. Or when the government fell in February 1917, the Provisional Government factions should have united to oppose the Bolsheviks. But then there's all these other examples. In Germany, the conservative Weimar government allies with Hitler in order to fend off what they think is the greater evil, the communists. Given the events up to that point, it's a reasonable concern to have, given what the Bolsheviks have done in Russia. Where should we end up on this? Should you embrace a lesser of two evils whenever you get the chance, or no?\n\nThe Tsarist regime is undertaking this repression of people who have legitimate claims. That repression is quite severe by the standards of the day. It's not going to be everybody murdered or everybody deported to the wastes of Siberia, which we're going to see in the 20th century when we have a different level of communications and transport, different technology, when we have a different level of ideological commitment. Still, it's highly repressive. It's totally unjust and the claims of the people protesting are legitimate. Stalin goes into the underground, not because he's looking for power. It's because he's dedicated to fighting the injustices of the tsarist regime. A lot of young people like him do the same. He's in the seminary. He's highly successful, unbelievably successful. He's great at school. That's been true for many years now, since he was in elementary school. He sang in the choir, got good grades, and did his homework. He's on track to be successful in society. He gives it all up. He starts reading forbidden, otherwise censored underground literature and books. He learns about social injustice, not just through firsthand experience, but analytically. He never graduated from the seminary, which is the highest level of education that was available to somebody in the Caucasus. They don't have a university, because the Tsarist regime is afraid to allow a university. They need the university graduates, but again, they're afraid of the politics of it. Universities elsewhere, including in the capital, St. Petersburg, are constantly being shut down through these revolutionary episodes. He goes into the underground and for 20 years of his life he's got no job, no profession, no source of income. He's in and out of prison, in and out of Siberian exile, constantly harassed by the police. If he escapes, they find him, they put him back. From the ages of about 17-18 to his late 30s, he's a penniless, jobless revolutionary, dedicated to fighting the genuine injustices of the Tsarist regime. What he'll produce is a much more unjust regime than the one he's fighting against. This is known as perverse and unintended consequences. He's legitimately dedicated to revolution as he understands it in his day, and it's fighting against legitimate injustices. But the way he does that—the revolutionary methods that he uses and then the regime that he ends up building—turns out to be worse than the problem that he was addressing. This is a perverse and unintended consequence.\n\nYour question is about whether revolution is a good thing ultimately, even if the injustices are there, and whether there could have been some solution that was more evolutionary that could get you to a better place. The constitutionalists, otherwise known as the Kadets, we would call them the classical liberals. They're the private property, constitutional order, anti-autocracy people fighting the tsarist regime. They're going to be the protagonists of the February Revolution in 1917. It looks like they could possibly be the solution because they're against arbitrary, autocratic, unjust rule. They're in favor of constitutional order. That's not how they behave once they're in power. But let's leave that aside. Here's your problem. This was foreseen by the Interior Minister who put down the 1905 Rebellion Revolution, Pyotr Durnovo, who understands the liberals, the constitutionalists. They’re the classical liberals who want private property and constitutional order and probably, if they had their druthers, a constitutional monarchy like you have in the UK and Britain at the time. But Durnovo says to them, \"You guys are fools, because if you take down the Tsar, you won't get a constitutional order. You'll get chaos and anarchy and you'll get a massive social revolution by the peasants predominantly, but also by the nationalities and the workers. You will bring on the opposite of a constitutional order. So instead of fighting against the Tsar, you should throw in your lot with the Tsar against the Stalins and the social movement that came from the investment in modernization.\" Durnovo is proved right. He's proved right not just in Russia, by the way. In many places in the world at the time, between like 1905 and 1925 or so, 1926 in the case of Portugal, you have constitutional revolutionary attempts to introduce constitutional order: Mexico, Iran, China, Russia, Portugal. They all fail. The constitutionalists take power for a brief period of time and then they're swept out by a more leftist, more social-oriented revolutionary process. So the constitutional epoch of the early 20th century turns out to be a bust. It had to have happened beforehand, before the modern era. Why? Because when you institute constitutional order, like in England, in the US, to a certain extent in France which has a more complicated process, you do it before you're in the mass age. You do it before the working class and the peasantry are politically organized. You're able to introduce rule of law, constitutionalism based on a private property model where not that many people get to vote. The franchise is restricted, the vast majority of people can't vote, only property holders can vote. Only men can vote, not women. You have this restricted franchise, which is like a breathing space for you to introduce and get used to a liberal constitutional order that you can then democratize over time. Over time non-property holding males get to vote. Over time, women get to vote. Over time, slaves become citizens. They become people and fully-fledged citizens. They also get to vote and to own property legally. You have this order that has all of these birth defects. It's very restrictive in the franchise. Some people are slaves, not even considered people. Yet over time you can get that right because the category of citizenship and the constitutional order are already embedded. When you have the constitutional revolution in the mass age—when you have the peasants and the workers and those for national self determination participating in the constitutional revolution—constitutional order and rule of law isn't enough for a lot of them. It worked in Taiwan and South Korea. There was an era of industrialization under, not a dictator, but an authoritarian government. Then they were able to transition to rule of law democracy. There are these exceptions which have turned out to be false normative, or guiding, stars for us in every case. It happened in West Germany and Japan under American occupation, enormously successful. We turned Hitlerite Germany into our ally with their cooperation. It's just astonishing. And with Hirohito's Japan, the emperor stayed. Then with Japan's two former colonies, South Korea and Taiwan, it worked there as well. Hong Kong was on that trajectory until it was turned back when the lease ended to the CCP regime in Beijing. But the number of countries that have done this is very, very few. The opposite has happened in most other cases where you've gotten an attempt but a failure to introduce enduring constitutional order in a mass society. But there's a paradox here. If you institute this sort of revolution, or changing of the guard, during the mass age,\n\n\nThen you're going to get this sort of leftist revolution, which is very antithetical to future prosperity and rule of law. On the other hand, if you don't change the regime, you will fail to… It's been pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek, when he did have control over China, should have done some amount of land reform. You talk about how Stolypin, after the 1905 attempted revolution, attempted to put in these sort of agricultural reforms. But their success was mixed because the existing aristocracy obviously didn't favor it. So there is this paradox. If you don't change the regime, the existing stakeholders will not want the kinds of reforms which would make it possible to have a lower class that's bought into the system. How do you bring the whole society, what we would call the masses or what used to be called the masses… How do you bring all levels of society into a political system as citizens? How do you build a polity which is inclusive of people regardless of how much property they have? How do you then provide opportunity to them so that they can rise up the ladder? That's the secret of success in the modern world, which a handful of countries have done from a non-democratic starting point. Other countries have done it by democratizing a liberal constitutional order. Go back to the tsarist regime. What were the options for the tsarist regime? You have this very heavy absolutist regime. Autocracy is even a more absolutist version of what we had, for example in the French case, when the Bourbon dynasty could say, \"the state is me\" or \"the state is I\". You have this Versailles-like absolutism, and aristocracy that forms around the absolutism that is the main beneficiary. Most everybody else is excluded from the political process and they are going to break through at some point. So how are you going to manage that breakthrough? Again, in the French case it took more than a century to get this right. The monarch is killed and the monarch comes back and they have an emperor and they have a constitutional order and they have an elected president who does a self-coup and one republic falls and another republic takes its place. Eventually even the Vichy regime, the Nazi occupation regime, overthrows the republic. So it takes de Gaulle in some ways from above to reimpose a republic, the fifth Republic, later on. So it's a very difficult process, even when it works, as the French case tells you. So we're not saying that it's simple and easy and that the tsarist regime could have gone down this path. A lot of people say, if it hadn't been for the war, the tsarist regime was on an evolutionary path. It was modernizing economically, so it might have been a kind of Taiwan story over time, where the dictatorial regime gave way, under economic success and political pressure, to a more benign regime. They institutionalized rule of law, private property, civil liberties, and an inclusive polity for everybody. The problem with that is that the autocracy refused to do that. The autocracy had wanted no part of any evolutionary process. So in 1905, when the tsarist regime is compelled—under pressure of tremendous peasant revolt and worker strikes and a defeat in the war against Japan—to introduce some version of constitutional order, a kind of quasi-parliament, quasi-constitution, the Tsar regrets doing this almost immediately and is trying to push back against his concessions. Once the lid was put back on because of repression, once Durnovo successfully repressed the political movement, the Tsar wanted to undo those concessions and go back to being an autocrat. An autocrat, autokrator, means a \"self-power, a power unto itself\". So this is your challenge. How do you undo the autocracy and get to an evolutionary mode when the autocracy itself is committed to not allowing any political participation whatsoever? So you have the leftist version of overthrow, where you end up with a radicalization in the leftist direction, and you have a rightist version of overthrow, where you end up with, \"Oh, we're not going to have Leninism here. Let's prevent Leninism. Let's go with the radical right.\" The traditional right invites, as happened in the German case and earlier in the Italian case, invites the radical right to power, thinking they can control the radical right, the fascism, the Nazism. The traditional right is wrong. The radical right, once it's invited to power, institutionalizes itself. You get a leftist version of this and a rightist version of this. They're kind of codependent. Each uses the threat of the other to further consolidate their dictatorship. This is the 20th-century version. The irony here is that you got the radical right, the fascist solution in the German case, and you got the radical left, the socialist solution in the tsarist case. The tsarist regime had a massive radical right. They had the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, that infamous anti-Semitic tract, which then makes its way to Germany but originates in the tsarist empire. The antisemitism is there. The right-wing movement is there, implanted in villages, the Union of the Russian People. Russia has the fascism before Germany. Germany has the largest socialist party in its parliament, in the sense that it's not a majority, but it's a plurality. The Social Democrats in Germany are enormously successful at the ballot box. The right-wing movement with the antisemitism is enormously successful in the streets in Tsarist Russia. If you were alive before 1917, 1933, you would predict that socialism would be victorious and triumph in Germany, and the fascism would triumph in the Russian Empire. But it's the opposite. So that's just a fascinating, amazing paradox that I tried to deal with in the first two volumes. You say that in 1917 a leftist revolution of some kind was inevitable, but that it didn't have to be the Bolshevik October Revolution. Why was leftism inevitable in Russia? You put your finger on a big part of it when you talked about Chiang Kai-shek and land reform. You have this peasant land hunger. The peasants are often without their own holdings. They work on someone else's property, or their holdings are so small that if there's a little bit of bad weather let alone a massive drought, they're on the verge of starvation. Subsistence level agriculture is not politically stable. You want a class of people, a kind of yeoman capitalists, property owners who can expand their farms and can succeed and hire labor. Some of those hired hands can then get their own land and become a version of these yeoman farmers, sort of Thomas Jefferson-style or Stolypin, the great attempted reform of Stolypin after the 1905 revolution, which ended in his assassination. You need to deal with the peasant land hunger so that it becomes a stabilizing political force. You have the peasants get the land and then they have a piece of the status quo and want to retain the system, versus the peasants not having the land and they want to overthrow the system to get the land. In the Russian case there is the end of serfdom in the 1860s, again as a result of the defeat in the Crimean War, where there is a reform. They free the serfs, emancipation of the serfs. But the serfs don't get the land to the degree that could have happened, because the landowners are the political support of the tsarist autocracy. To take the land away from the land magnates and give it to the peasants is to go through this risky path where you're losing one political support, the landowners, before you've fully gotten the new political support. You're gonna go through this valley of hell potentially where all bets are off and you're not sure if it's going to work. So the peasants don't really get the land as they could have in the 1860s. It became a problem that's not resolved right through 1917, 1918. So the peasants had their own revolution in 1917 and 1918, which was not about the socialist parties. It's not about the Bolsheviks, it's not about Lenin, it's about the peasants seizing the land. But that creates an intense radicalism that becomes the platform for the socialists in the cities to gain and hold power in the system. You don't have that in the German case. In the German case, you have strikes and seizures of power in a few places, like Bavaria for example. You have a Bavarian Soviet Socialist Republic, but they're easily put down by the forces of order or the army and guess who's in the army? It’s the peasants. You don't have a peasant army ready to put down the revolt in the Russian case, because the peasant army is the one seizing the land. It's the one doing the radical revolution. So you lack the forces of order to destroy the leftist movement in the Russian case, because it is the leftist movement in the Russian case which should be the forces of order. In the German case—and to a certain extent the Italian case which happened simultaneously, and there's also a Hungarian case here—you have leftist revolts in the cities, seizures of power like the Paris Commune of 1870-71, which happened in Paris and not in the rest of France. You need a peasant army that has a stake in the existing order to undo the city leftist revolution. You have this in the other European cases. One case you don't have this is in the Russian case. Then you're going to get to the Chinese case later, which is going to be a variant of what happened in the Russian case, where you have a gigantic land hungry peasantry that's going to become radical for a time. Again, there are going to be perverse and unintended consequences. The peasants are ready to destroy the existing order, not to bring communists to power, but to seize the land themselves. In the 1920s, the peasants were de facto, not de jure, landowners. They don't own the property in law, they own it in fact. But then Stalin's going to reverse the peasant revolution violently and re-enserf or enslave the peasants across all the 11 time zones, this gigantic Eurasia. The peasant revolution is going to be annihilated in blood. So the peasants have, through their radicalism of seizing the land, helped bring Lenin and his Bolsheviks to power in the cities which is going to be the death of the peasants owning the land and lead instead to the re-enserfment of the peasants. Something similar is gonna happen in the Chinese case. Again there's this irony of history: perverse and unintended consequences. Stalin is fighting against tsarist injustice only to impose worse injustice and worse bloodshed and worse repression. The peasants are fighting on behalf of obtaining the land, only to then be expropriated and forced into these collectives and losing the very land, the land that they took in the seizures that brought these leftists to power in the case. In central Europe—the southern German case, the northern Italian case, the Hungarian case—you don't have the endurance of the leftists in power. They're all thrown out. They're thrown out by the forces of order. They're thrown out by the right. So the traditionalism of the peasants—where they believe in God, they believe in law and order—is overriding because they already have a lot of the land in comparison to their Russian or Chinese counterparts. They can be part of the forces of order. So you can get fascism in Central Europe. You can get the right wing dictatorships in Central Europe, the forces of order destroying the left. Whereas you get the leftist dictatorships in the giant peasant societies where you don't quite have the distribution of land. Now the peasants are complaining about land distribution in Italy and Germany, don't get me wrong, but relative to Russia and China they're doing well. So then you think about the Mexican case, the Iranian case, the Portuguese case, all of which are peasant societies as well. There's how you integrate farmers. The whole world order rests on the backs of farmers. How much farmers till means how rich or poor your country is. Whether you have a surplus, as we call it, that the farmers can sell on the market after they consume what they need for their family's purposes or not, tells you how much wealth you have to then build an army, build modern industry, et cetera. The world order rests on these hardworking, predominant in the population, peasantries. In some ways, the political system doesn't derive in deterministic fashion from them. Politics still matters and politics is never reducible to social relations. But failure to master, or mastery of the social relations of, the peasant land question is fundamental in some of the political outcomes. The politicians have to be good at managing the peasantry's integration into that society, where you're trying to get an order in the mass age. You're beyond just the court society at Versailles, the tsarist court in St. Petersburg, or the men at the Constitutional Convention in the US. You're beyond that in the mass age. You have to be able to incorporate the masses somehow in a polity. It's really hard to do. So this dynamic of failure to master, or mastery over it, tells you a lot about the direction you're going to go. This answers one of the other questions I had for you. Why did we see these communist revolutions in peasant countries? It’s the opposite of the Marxist prediction that you would first need capitalism and industrialization before you would see the turn towards socialism. I guess the answer is that the private property which is engendered by capitalism and industrialization actually helps the peasants more, or helps them somewhat and buys them into the system. This raises another question. If it's the case that all of this unrest is caused by the mistreatment of peasants in China and in Russia, you have the mistreatment of them to an extent unimaginable after the collectivization in 1928 where literally 100 million peasants were enslaved. Of course, there's some lack of cooperation with the regime. They kill half the livestock and so forth. But it doesn't break the regime, even though it's way more repressive and destructive than anything the tsar did. So if the peasants are the backbone of the regime's stability, why doesn't collectivization in China and Russia break\n\n\nThe regime?\n\nTerrific question again.\nYou have a multi-pronged answer.\nLet’s do it this way.\nOn the one hand, you have a much bigger repressive apparatus, a much, much bigger repressive apparatus.\nThe tsarist regime has a very small secret police, really small.\nThe secret police for the tsarist regime is mostly following a handful of intellectuals.\nYou had a few thousand university students in tsarist Russia in the mid-19th century, about 5,000 or so when this term intelligentsia got invented.\nYou're going to have a few thousand more over time.\nBut you're in the thousands, not the millions.\nEven there though, Lenin, Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin go off and they're sent into exile.\nThey're not only living off government money, but while in exile and they're writing for Pravda.\nThey're writing, \"here's my manifesto on the fall of capitalism.\"\nEven the intellectuals are not really repressed.\nThe sense of repression is more about following what they do rather than arresting them on a pretext and putting a bullet in the back of their neck.\nYou have this tsarist secret police, the \"Okhranka\".\nThat's the pejorative nickname for them, the \"Okhranka\".\nThey're tasked with following these revolutionaries and infiltrating their groups and maybe sabotaging them from within.\nSomething similar happens in the labor movement.\nZubatovshina is the Russian term where you plant the leader of the workers' movement in order to make sure that it's controlled by the secret police rather than has a spontaneous or autonomous version that could get out of hand.\nSo you have a small police that's dedicated to surveillance and infiltration.\nYou're reading their mail, which is something that's invented in France.\nThe black cabinets are a French invention that the tsar's secret police borrow.\nYou're following them and a lot of them get deported to Siberian exile, like happened to Joseph Stalin.\nSome get forced into European exile, like happened to Lenin.\nLenin for 15 of the 17 years between 1900 and 1917 was in European exile.\nHe's not even in Russia.\nIn fact, the Paris branch of the tsarist secret police, the Okhranka, which conducted the surveillance and infiltration in Europe - we have their entire archive right here at the Hoover Institution.\nIt was supposed to be destroyed.\nThe order went to destroy it in Paris after the revolution.\nInstead the guy put it on a boat and secretly had it shipped here to the United States.\nNow we have the Tsarist Russian archive, secret police for the foreign revolutionaries in foreign exile.\nSo you have surveillance and infiltration on a lower level.\nThe main force of repression in Tsarist Russia is the army, not the secret police.\nYou don't have a gigantic armed secret police.\nThe secret police are kind of intellectuals.\nThey're reading Lenin's tracts and they're writing summaries, like AI would do now, about what they contain and how to combat it and why the idea is wrong.\nThey're sort of like pseudo-intellectuals, or in some cases intellectuals with degrees.\nThey're not the thugs, the torturers and the thugs that we would associate with secret police.\nThat's built under Joseph Stalin in order to enact the re-enserfment, the enslavement of the hundred million peasants.\nIt's that act.\nIt's a kind of chicken and egg thing.\nHow do you enslave the peasants without the gigantic secret police?\nBut then when you enslave the peasants, the result is you have this gigantic secret police now that can do everything and anything.\nIt's a process where the chicken and egg are happening simultaneously and they're building the secret police capacity, while enslaving the peasants, that they didn't have before.\nHow do we explain this surplus of sadism during this period in Russia?\nJoseph Stalin recruits the twenty-five-thousanders who go out to the countryside and steal from basically starving people.\nThey can visibly see, I'm sure, that they're stealing from a family that's going to starve without this grain.\nYou have tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of interrogators and torturers in the gulag system.\nThey must know it's a cynical thing where they're making the person confess to a thing that they haven't done and they're employing torture to do it.\nIt wasn't just Joseph Stalin doing all these things.\nThere were hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people if you include informants, who are implicated in this whole ghoulish regime.\nIs this just a latent thing that is true in any society and Joseph Stalin was able to exploit it, or with some circumstance created this level of sadism?\nAgain, a fantastic question.\nWe get this from Lev Kopelev, The Education of a True Believer.\nHe was one of these people.\nHe later then becomes a dissident.\nHe gets forced into exile in Germany.\nHe's a Germanist by profession.\nHe writes this fantastic memoir, a couple of memoirs.\nOne of them is called The Education of a True Believer, which covers how he was the one who did this, including in his native village.\nHere's your answer.\nOn the one hand, there's ideology and the importance of ideology.\nWe may think that no one really believes the ideology.\nThe ideology is too ridiculous.\nIt's too disproven by facts in life.\nWe're too smart and they couldn't have been as stupid.\nThey had to be smart like us and not believe these crazy fairy tales about it.\nIn fact, it's wrong.\nThey do believe the ideology and they're young.\nThey're young people.\nA story of the evil of capitalism…\nYou have World War I, millions of people die.\nFor what?\nWhy are those millions of people being killed?\nThe flower of European youth.\nThen many colonial armies get drawn in because of European imperialism.\nYoung people, the future of those countries, go to their senseless deaths.\nWhat's that about?\nIt's about imperialism, it's about capitalism.\nSo that's evil and we must overcome that.\nSo there's a way in which life experience, as well as the fervor of youth, leads to, \"let's build a new world today rather than wait for tomorrow.\nLet's be impatient, let's eradicate capitalism, let's bring about socialism.\nLet's bring about socialism, meaning we end war and imperialism.\nAchieve abundance for everybody, so that it's not just the haves and the have nots, but everybody's got something.\nIn the process, let's make my little life world historical.\"\nSo here I am, just a little activist with a red star on my cap and my life means nothing.\nExcept I'm a participant in building a new world, in a world historical process that's going to end exploitation, that's going to end haves and have nots.\nI get it if you're a middle bureaucrat in the Communist Party, sure.\nDo you think that explains the motivation of an interrogator in a Gulag, that this is part of the goal of communism?\nThere's a big story here, which is about how we're building a new world.\nThere are people against that because they're the bourgeoisie, or they're the fools who are doing the bourgeoisie's business on behalf of the bourgeoisie.\nThey're duped into false consciousness.\nBut in many of these cases, they know that they're the ones orchestrating this show trial, this cynical game.\nThey know that they just picked up a random person in the dead of night.\nThey know that there are enemies out there.\nThey know that this process has people who are against it.\nThat's a given.\nWho are the people who are against it?\nThey're masking their true feelings.\nThey're hiding behind professions of loyalty.\nWhen in fact, when the hour of crisis comes and there's a war, they will be the saboteurs behind the lines, the fifth column.\nIt might be that some of them are innocent that you're arresting, but some of them are clearly going to be guilty as well.\nTo get the guilty, you have to somehow manage to deal with victimizing people who are likely innocent and you may know are innocent.\nBut you also know to your bone marrow that some people out there are enemies.\nIt's hard to identify and find them.\nSo you're overcompensating a little bit to make sure that you get every last enemy.\nAgain, it's a crazy idea to us.\nIt makes no sense to us, but a lot of things make no sense that people believe in.\nThere's this young kid who's really adept at social media who just looks like he won the primary for Democratic candidate for mayor in New York City.\nOne of the things he wants to do is freeze rents, rent control, because he wants more affordable housing.\nHe's a complete idiot in terms of facts, because the way to get more affordable housing is to build more housing.\nIf supply massively increases and it exceeds demand, the price has to go down.\nIt's proven again and again and again.\nWhat rent control does, or freezing of rent, it inhibits the building of new housing.\nBecause who's going to build new housing when you can't make money off of it?\nSo rent control is what produces the lack of affordable housing in the first place.\nHe sees what's the problem as the solution now.\nNow, is he a fool?\nNo, he's a really bright guy.\nHe's very well-educated.\nHe's read everything and anything.\nHe's been to university.\nHe's talked to a lot of really smart people.\nYou'd say, \"how could he be so foolish to believe an idea that's obviously falsified by empirical reality?\"\nBut again, it's an ideological belief.\nHe wants to allow people who can't afford Manhattan to live there.\nThat's a good idea.\nLife should be more affordable.\nThere should be more places like Queens, where you can come in as immigrants or you can come in as lower class, front end of the social ladder, like my family did for example.\nMy father worked in a factory.\nYou should be able to get some housing for your family, work hard, and rise up.\nI agree with that 100%.\nBut he's got an ideological approach to how to achieve that, which to me is completely foolish.\nIf I were as smart as him… how could he possibly hold that idea in his head?\nBut ideology is pervasive.\nIt's pervasive, flying in the face of empirical reality.\nWe could give many examples.\nI'm not picking on this guy in New York.\nIt's just a recent example.\nI don't know him.\nI've never met him.\nWhatever.\nMaybe there's a more complicated story there.\nI'm just saying that we have to take ideology seriously because it's deep and it can be enduring even in the face of empirical reality.\nThere's ideology, but there's a very specific thing to these Marxist regimes.\nThey might believe in class conflict and that you need this revolution and so forth.\nBut there's also this sense that you cannot contradict the party, you cannot contradict the vanguard.\nEven in 1924, when Trotsky is getting condemned by the party, or whatever that was, he gets up to give a speech to the Party Plenum, and he says, \"Look, for all of my thoughts, let there be no mistake that the party is always right and party discipline is always important.\"\nSo there's not only the sense where Mamdani would say, \"Oh, I want these specific policies implemented\" but there's also the sense that loyalty to the party, and eventually to Joseph Stalin even when it seems to contradict my understanding of socialism, is absolutely paramount.\nOne way to explain that is that they were just genuinely afraid of Joseph Stalin and they thought this was antithetical to their understanding of communism.\nAnother is that part of the ideology is this theocratic understanding that the party's always right, even if it seems like a single individual is manipulating it to their ends.\nWhy is Marxism-Leninism especially so attractive to young people and to intellectuals?\nWhy?\nWe have this history, which is a bloody mess.\nMillions of people die, and they die because of the enactment of this ideology.\nHow could people continue to adhere to an ideology like that during the murderous time period, and even more after the murderous time period when we can look at it dispassionately?\nHere's part of the answer.\nYoung people are attracted to impatient, quick, total transformation of the world, eradication of war, eradication of social injustice.\nThere's a simplicity to the ideology.\nIt's a total package.\nIt gets rid of everything bad if you just follow the precepts.\nSure, things happen that shouldn't have happened.\nThere are some surprises, there are some downsides.\nBut are you pro-capitalism?\nAre you pro-imperialist war?\nAre you pro-landowners having all the land and the have-nots having nothing?\nThere's this constant threat where if you contravene the ideology, you're in bed with the very evils that the ideology is trying to overcome.\nYou become an accomplice in the persistence of the things that you're dedicated to overthrowing.\nIt's not just that you're loyal to the party.\nYou're loyal to the outcome that the party is dedicated to achieving.\nYou know that there are going to be mistakes and costs and bad things will happen along the way, but is imperialist war better than that?\nNo, the answer is imperialist war has got to be worse.\nThe other reason, which is even deeper than that, is that Marxism-Leninism empowers the intellectual class and the lumpen-intellectual class.\nIn a market system, you get to do what you want.\nYou want to open up a family business, you want to take a loan and give it a try?\nYou can do that.\nNobody can stop you.\nIt might be that it's hard to get the loan in some neighborhoods.\nIt might be that the loan interest rate is…\nYou've got to work much harder than you thought, etc.\nBut you get to make the decisions.\nYou get to decide what to do, when to do it.\nYou can work for somebody else, you can put out your own shingle.\nIn these kinds of systems, it's the intellectuals and the lumpen-intellectuals who make those decisions.\nThey use the state as an instrument to overcome the injustices of the existing society.\nAgain, the injustices are real.\nBut that empowers them to be in charge.\nThe beauty of Marxism-Leninism, and why what we used to call the Third World loves this, is that they get to be in power.\nIt empowers them across the board.\nThey get to\n\n\nThey make the decisions on the economy.\nThey don't have to submit to elections.\nThey don't have to have a mandate.\nThey don't have to legitimate their rule beyond the ideological building of a new world, of overcoming injustice.\nWhat we see again and again is young people being impatient for evil to end, but also empowering themselves to be in charge.\nThey love the state.\nThey love the state as an instrument for social justice, social engineering.\nThey love to empower themselves as the decision-makers because, after all, they're the intellectuals.\nThey've studied the theory.\nThey know better than others.\nWorkers and peasants and the downtrodden, the lower classes, sometimes have false consciousness.\nThey don't understand why, for example, we have an imperialist war.\nThey get sucked in.\nBread and circuses fool them.\nThey have this false consciousness.\nBut I know better, and I can be in charge.\nI can get us to a better place.\nEven along the way, bad things are going to happen.\nSome people who are innocent are going to die or be arrested.\nBut this is the march of history.\nThis march of history is to peace and justice.\nWho is going to stand in the way of that?\nEspecially when it empowers you personally so that… You could never do this in the private sector.\nNobody could afford you this kind of power in the private sector and in a decentralized political system, in a federalized political system where nobody accumulates that much power.\nSocial engineering is always coercive, always coercive.\nThe issue is how much of the coercion is necessary that we accept in the tradeoff to right some of the things that are obviously wrong.\nAll the anti-Marxism, I totally agree with.\nBut still, just purely analyzing the system there's still something to be explained.\nThere are many ideologies.\nYou have this line that you can't explain Joseph Stalin by saying that he was beaten as a kid or he's a Georgian or whatever, because many other people are Georgians or beaten as a kid and they turn out not this way.\nThere's many different kinds of ideologies, and very few of them end up as amenable to dictatorship as Marxism.\nAnother thing that's really confusing here is that all of these Old Bolsheviks who abet the system and whom eventually Joseph Stalin purges, whatever you might say about them, they're not weak men.\nThey were willing to face down the Tsar.\nThey were able to organize the revolution against the Tsar.\nThey're willing to live in exile, to potentially get shot… I guess not shot by the Okhrana, but whatever.\nThey're willing to go through hardships for their beliefs.\nAt the same time, you might think they might just go along with Joseph Stalin's doings because this serves what they think is the end goal of communism.\nBut we know that after Joseph Stalin died, Khrushchev, who was one of the key people in the regime, gave a Secret Speech where he said that, \"No, Joseph Stalin was going against it.\nHe was destroying the building of socialism and the building of Marxism-Leninism.\"\nSo people did believe that Joseph Stalin was actually going against this end goal that they had.\nAt least Khrushchev believed that.\nIn many cases, they themselves are being implicated and they know they're innocent.\nIn many of these cases, there's this period in between when they're a dead man walking—because Joseph Stalin has started putting the feelers out that this person is a Trotskyite or something—but they're still in their positions of power.\nThey're still the editor of Pravda or in charge of the military or something.\nIt's mysterious why these people who were able to… They're not cowards, they were able to organize a revolution against the Tsar.\nBut they are not using this period that’s like a chicken with its head cut off in order to organize some sort of defense of themselves.\nMaybe the next time they have the Party Plenum, instead of just confessing or giving the obligatory speech where you're castigating yourself, you just say, \"No, I think Joseph Stalin's leading the revolution wrong.\nI'm going to die either way, but I might as well say this.\"\nThe same thing happened in China.\nLiu Shaoqi, when he's a dead man walking as the premier under Mao during the Cultural Revolution, he doesn't use that opportunity to go up… It’s very strange.\nThere are very few, but there are some people like that.\nThey're arrested and executed, all of them.\nVery few of those kinds of people are going to survive.\nThe ones who publicly decry the failures of the system and its perverse and unintended consequences, the ones who decry the dictatorship as opposed to the freedom that Marx predicted would happen, there are some people like that.\nThey're extremely courageous.\nThey're known to us.\nI'm not the only one, but I feature some of them in my book.\nBut again, you're creating a new world.\nIt's going to be messy because it's about class struggle.\nAnd class struggle means there are going to be winners and losers.\nThe bourgeoisie have to go.\nThey're inherently evil.\nThey're an evil class.\nThey have to not just be retired to a farm somewhere.\nThey have to be eradicated, liquidated as a class.\nThey're going to resist and therefore there are going to be enemies everywhere.\nYou're not going to know who they are.\nSo are you on the side of the enemies?\nBut what about the cases where they're implicating themselves?\nThey know they're not an enemy.\nAgain, the party is a larger cause than they are.\nYou're building a new world.\nYour life can contribute to that or not, and it's insignificant.\nWhat fraction of confessions by high-level party members do you think were not coerced out of a sense of fear of their own lives or their family's lives?\nI guess they knew they were going to be executed.\nSo it would have to be for their family's life or to avoid torture vs. a very sort of Ozymandian, \"I will sacrifice myself for the…\"\nWe're in the realm of psychology here, DK.\nHuman psychology is a complex subject.\nFiguring out human psychology is a big challenge, even with everything we know now, let alone what we knew then.\nSo it's simultaneously everything and anything.\nWe have to get rid of the binaries.\nThey didn't believe, they were cynical, and they sacrificed themselves because they were cowards.\nOr because they knew that, they were forced to make that sacrifice to preserve some of their family members or whatever.\nThere are elements of belief and elements of, let's say, suspension of disbelief, and elements of cynicism and knowledge and understanding simultaneously in almost everybody.\nThey coexist.\nWe think of them as contradictory, but humans can hold contradictory thoughts simultaneously without too much trouble.\nWe could give many examples.\nYou've had people like that on your show, for example.\nSo the psychology is not as surprising in some ways.\nWhat's surprising is that this whole thing succeeds.\nIt doesn't collapse of its own internal contradictions.\nIt doesn't undermine itself.\nIf you're murdering a high percentage of your upper officer corps… If you're murdering your intellectuals, your scientists, your cultural figures… If you're murdering your loyal party elites centrally and in the provinces… And if you're murdering the police who are carrying out all of these murders…\nThe thing about Joseph Stalin's terror is the police are also murdered during the terror while they are doing the murdering.\nYou're doing all of that and the whole thing doesn't collapse.\nTo me, that's more interesting in some ways than the complexity of human psychology that holds these contradictory thoughts and fails to go for self-preservation in some cases or fails to say, \"I'm going to die anyway, I might as well go down fighting,\" or whatever the metaphor might be.\nThe fact that the system is able to undergo this level of self-disruption and come out the other side, that's pretty astonishing.\nHitler does not murder his upper officer corps.\nHe doesn't like them, he retires them, and they get a pension.\nHe doesn't murder the Gauleiters or the Nazi party officials.\nHe doesn't murder the intellectuals.\nSome go to prison, some go into exile if they're lucky.\nSome definitely are executed, often for acts that they've committed.\nSometimes it’s just because they had an enemy in the system who wanted to enact revenge against them.\nBut for the most part, Hitler is attacking what we would call his real enemies, that is to say, people who are opposed to his regime, either in thought or in action or both.\nJoseph Stalin is attacking those people, but he's also attacking loyalists.\nHe's taking down, in really big numbers, system loyalists, people who would walk through fire for him.\nOne of the things they do is to walk through the fire of their self-immolation on behalf of the cause.\nThis belief in the new world, in the better world, in transcending capitalism, in getting peace as well as abundance on the planet, in building paradise on earth, needs to be understood as absolutely fundamental to everything that we're talking about.\nWe often talk about Nazi racial ideology.\nHow could they believe that stuff?\nThat stuff is obviously ridiculous, you say.\nGoebbels, who helped enact the regime's ideology about a master race, had several deformities, right?\nClubbed foot, walked in a brace.\nYet, he's helping preside over the murder of people because they are disabled.\nThey're singled out solely for their disabilities to be sent to the gas chambers or to be sent to imprisonment.\nAnd he's one of them.\nSo we say, \"Could he really have believed this?\nI mean, wasn't he a cynic enacting this?\nHow could he not understand that these are real people?\nBecause he's one of them.\"\nThe answer is, \"Yes, he was a Nazi.\"\nThese people were communists and he was a Nazi.\nAnd there were a lot of them, and they had doubts.\nThey suffered bouts of doubt.\nA lot of events contradicted the official ideology.\nInnocent people, innocent family members, themselves innocent, went to the gallows, got the bullet in the back of the neck.\nSo you say, God, the belief.\nThey couldn't have believed this stuff.\nAnd yet they did.\nThe main thing that we know from the archives that were formerly secret, that we get into when they're declassified, is that the Nazis were Nazis and the communists were communists.\nSo here we have this problem with socialism.\nSocialism means many different things.\nA communist party is building socialism.\nWhy?\nBecause their view of the world is: feudalism, capitalism, socialism, communism.\nFirst they have to destroy capitalism to get to socialism, and then socialism can eventually get you to communism.\nSo the communist party must first build socialism.\nHow do you build socialism?\nIt doesn't exist.\nSo how do we know what it looks like?\nHow do you get there?\nThey don't know.\nThe only thing they know is that it's not capitalism.\nSo let's destroy capitalism.\nThat will be the step to get us to socialism.\nCapitalism has markets, we'll have planning.\nCapitalism has private property, we'll have state property or collective property.\nCapitalism has bourgeois parliaments where they vote and they claim it's democracy, but it's only for the property-holding bourgeoisie.\nSo we will have a dictatorship of the proletariat.\nEverything.\nCapitalism has wage slavery.\nThat is the story.\nAnd real slavery.\nExactly.\nEverything is to eradicate capitalism to get you to socialism.\nIt turns out that doesn't deliver freedom, it doesn't deliver prosperity, and it doesn't deliver peace.\nIt delivers massive state-ization.\nBecause once you eliminate private property and individual choice, the state is now responsible for everything.\nIt delivers ration tickets and the Gulag.\nYou get a bunch of socialists that break from this.\nThey say Lenin is wrong.\nEradicating private property, markets, civil liberties, and parliament is a mistake.\nWe have to accept private property, markets, capitalism, and parliaments because that's the only way to get to freedom.\nOtherwise, you get to the Leninist dictatorship, total state-ization, Gulag, and ration tickets.\nThese people are denounced as revisionists, like Eduard Bernstein in Germany, for example.\nThe Swedish Social Democrats, they say, \"We accept capitalism, markets, and private property.\nWe want to redistribute the income because it's tough for some people to make their way in the system.\nThe system produces inequality.\nLet's make it more equal with social engineering redistribution.\nBut we keep capitalism, we keep markets and private property, and we keep democracy, voting, rule of law, et cetera.\nWe'll evolve towards full socialism and eventually communism, but we will not do it the Leninist way.\"\nThere's this huge break in the socialist movement between those who are real revolutionaries and want to overthrow, eradicate capitalism to get to the just and prosperous and peaceful future, and those who want to use the existing system and evolve, embrace, and accept it.\nThe left has a civil war, a civil war on the left which is still going on.\nIt’s between those who say capitalism is evil and must go vs. capitalism has a lot of problems, but we need it in order to have peace and prosperity, in order to have freedom.\nWe need to manage it better, redistribute.\nThis civil war on the left, which arises in real time, the critics of Lenin's revolution, the German Social Democratic Party, people like Bernstein and the rest of them, they are critics in real time of this.\nYet, some of the critics who are what we would call the social democrats of Europe… Lenin was also a member of the Social Democratic Party of Russia, but the communist thing makes this divide between those who are serious about destruction of capitalism and those who are, \"revisionists\", this denunciatory term.\nWhat happens is that some of the people who are in the revisionist camp begin to flirt with the \"capitalism is evil\" analysis.\nThey begin to truck with the communists that they've broken from and are in civil war with.\nYou get left-wing social democrats who are closer to Lenin than they are to right-wing social democrats like Bernstein and the rest who are pro-capitalism but pro-redistribution.\nThis is confusing to people because\n\n\nNot everybody is a communist. Some people, like in Sweden, accept private property and markets. But some of the people in Sweden seem to go back on that promise of accepting it and argue that if we don't get rid of capitalism, we're still going to end up with an evil system. This civil war on the left never gets resolved; it's ongoing, and the right uses this confusion to paint everybody as anti-capitalism. The left gives them ammunition by talking about the evils of capitalism, even when they've come along to accept private property and markets. You have this deep and fundamental problem for the left. The tragedy of the left is that it's never able to overcome, even to this day, where it comes out and says, \"No more anti-capitalism ever, that is over. That leads to death, bloodshed, Gulag, ration tickets, war that actually is worse than the original problem it diagnosed.\" Think about Marx. Marx says that you get rid of private property, markets, capitalism, and you're going to get freedom, you're going to get abundance. You don't get that. People say, \"Marx wanted freedom, he didn't want Joseph Stalin's dictatorship. It's not Marx who's the problem, it's Stalin who deformed Marx.\" We see this argument all the time. Stalin is a deformity, whereas Marx was about freedom. Think about a nuclear bomb. You're going to do a nuclear bomb. You're going to nuke a population, but you don't want to kill any people. Your goal is to nuke them, but nobody dies. That's what you say. You're going to get rid of capitalism, you're going to nuke them, but instead everybody's going to live. You give that order to your generals. You say, \"Nuke them, but everybody lives, nobody dies.\" They nuke them, and everybody dies instead of everybody living. You say, \"I never said to kill the people, I said that they should live.\" But once you nuke capitalism, you're going to lose freedom, you're going to lose the ability to have politics, you're going to end up with some version of a Leninist system. The ideology is going to drive that to the doubters. You're going to get a second wind where you get Khrushchev, as you said. He comes into power, he denounces Stalin's crimes. He doesn't praise capitalism, private property, and markets. He doesn't undo collective farms. He doesn't undo state ownership of property. He doesn't undo the planning system. He just undoes Stalin's personality. He's trying to subtract… The de-Stalinization is to take away Stalin. It's not to take away any of the other attributes of the system. It's a second wind that it was Stalin who was the problem, not the system that was the problem. So here we have the experience of going through the horrors, then having those horrors publicly denounced within the party. The Secret Speech is not published in Soviet newspapers, but it's discussed at party meetings in all locales. Within the Party, there's a public dimension to this. All party members become familiar with Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin. They experience the horrors in many cases firsthand. They enacted the horrors in many cases themselves. They then see this denounced as horror, and they get facts that they didn't know. They get a big picture view back onto this. Instead of saying, this system is evil, we made a big mistake, we have to undo state ownership of property, we have to undo collective farms, we have to undo the dictatorship… Instead of saying that, they say, \"We get a chance to do it right this time without the evil Stalin who messed it all up.\" The Khrushchev thing, the revelation of the horrors, the denunciation of the horrors, ironically gives you the second wind of belief in the system that's going to last right through Gorbachev, who's a Khrushchev-era baby. We have this with Xi Jinping. If you know the story of his father and of his own upbringing, they suffer massively through Mao's regime and the Cultural Revolution. They're purged, they're humiliated. Yet, instead of saying, \"This system is horrible, if I ever get power, I'm going to undo this system, which was so unjust to me and my family.\" Instead of that, \"They say, let's make this better. Let's not have the bad things that happened under Mao, but let's keep all the good things, supposedly good things that happened, including the CCP monopoly.\" That to us looks like the problem, and it wreaked havoc in their lives, in their family's life, but to them, that's the solution. This is a paradoxical element of communism where its failures don't become discrediting for so many of the people. They instead become a kind of second wind once you acknowledge and denounce them. It's never the system at fault, it's Stalin at fault. It's never the system at fault, it's Mao's mistakes or excesses as they're called, that are at fault. China actually did reform the system and they didn't just discredit the Cultural Revolution. They said no, much of the planning and state-owned enterprises was a mistaken idea. But I do have a different question. Wait, that's not exactly the way you described it. You have a point. You're onto something, Dwarkesh. But it needs to be qualified. What happens in Deng Xiaoping's case is that the communists have unwittingly destroyed the planning system. They have sent down to the village people who do economic planning. They've sent them to manual labor. They have smashed them in the face because they wear glasses, in many cases, and therefore they're putatively intellectuals. They've undermined their ability to continue the economic system as they had it. But if that's the reason why they weren't able to do planning, shouldn't Stalin's purges and then World War II have also had the same effect on the USSR? Not the political system. Deng Xiaoping never takes down the political system or the ideology. So you still have today the communist monopoly. Communism can fail at everything. It can starve the people, it can kill the people. It only has to do one thing to survive: suppress political alternatives. So during that peasant resistance to Stalin in the collectivization episode that you referenced earlier, there's no political alternative. There's no other place for them to go and say, \"We don't like the injustices of the tsarist regime and we don't like what communism is doing. Therefore, there's something else that we can go to that's an alternative.\" Communism has suppressed all the alternatives. It's either return to tsarism or keep communism. In the Chinese case, you have something quite similar. They allow economic liberalization, in part because they have no choice, but they don't allow political liberalization. They're able to \"reform\" by enabling the people to generate wealth, jobs, prosperity through market behavior. It's mostly the peasant class in China. That then leads to family-owned businesses, which then leads to larger businesses. Society, not the Party, creates the miracle in China. The party tightens its grip because the ideology of the party is that when the socioeconomic base has a lot of market in it, it's a threat to the party's rule. The party has to be even more vigilant against the capitalists in the society. It turns out that you get to Jiang Zemin, who is Deng Xiaoping's handpicked successor. Jiang Zemin sees that the private sector is becoming dominant in the country and that the party's monopoly on power is under threat. Jiang Zemin decides he's gonna do something called the Three Represents. He's gonna bring the millionaire capitalists into the party. He's gonna make them party members. Instead of the party being against capitalists, the capitalists are gonna join the party, and this is gonna somehow increase the party's leverage and control and transform the psychology and behavior of the capital. Of course, it fails. Instead, the party members are in cahoots with the millionaires. They begin to form their own businesses by expropriating other people's property. The party begins to go dissolute in an anti-Marxist fashion in terms of private property, wealth accumulation. So Xi Jinping comes along, predictably. He looks at Jiang Zemin's solution, co-opt the millionaires into the party, and sees that it failed. Not only did it fail to transform the behavior of the private sector people, it infected the behavior of the party people. Instead of bringing the capitalists into the party, he's going to force the party back into capitalism. He's going to push the party into the private sector more strongly than it was before. Board directors, party officials. CEO, party official. Private sector people who don't cooperate? Destroy them, make examples of them, including in the tech sector, so that people get the message that the party is the boss here. You have a kind of natural progression where you open up the system economically in order to drive jobs, prosperity, wealth, because you've destroyed. People say the Communist Party brought 700-800 million people out of poverty. No, the Communist Party put those people into poverty. Why are a billion plus people in poverty? Because of the party's rule. It's the people themselves, they lift themselves out of poverty. The Communists have to reassert their control, their Leninist monopoly on power, because the very thing that has rescued them—the diligence, entrepreneurialism, ingenuity of the amazing Chinese people and of that society—is now a threat to Communist rule. I agree with the mechanism by which the growth happened, but I don't think it's the case that it was their inability to have true Marxist communism which led to liberalization. If you look at the creation of these special economic zones, the imperative at a national level that you must have growth, and then Deng's Southern tour… Jiang Zemin, he tries after Tiananmen to clamp down on opening up. Deng says, \"No, we must open up. If you don't, we’ll remove you.\" All of that is a sort of positive. Maybe positive is the wrong word, but… Policy driven, that’s true. It's a special effort you have to make towards economic liberalization. It didn't just happen by default. People really had to push for it. The alternative story, which it seems you're saying, is \"No, it was just that they physically could not enforce communism anymore.\" That's how it started, Dwarkesh. Let's go look at the facts. Why do you have a Special Economic Zone? Why can't every zone have market relations? Agreed, but then the creation of that zone had to be a proactive action. You’re doing this grudgingly. This is a grudging allowance of certain behavior. You look at the decrees. You can trade onions, but you can't trade potatoes. Okay, you can trade potatoes, but you can trade only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, not Monday, Wednesday and Friday. You can only have three employees per corporation. Right, so the decrees are all grudging with very few exceptions. The society is forcing more and more concessions onto the ideologues in the Marxist-Leninist system. At the beginning, it's launched by the party's grudging acceptance that the society is gonna rebuild and not starve, through its own hard work. They've been through a couple of famines here, really big famines. They don't have the state capacity to reimpose the system immediately in the economic sphere, so they grudgingly make concessions, very few but some, in the market sphere. Gradually, that expands over time as more and more people push against the system's restrictions. It's a policy-driven story in part, but not as the lead. It's a policy-driven story as the following of the entrepreneurialism and the hard work of the society. But that pushback is coming from within. This is your thesis in Uncivil Society, right? Yes. It is coming from within the system. Because they could have… In 1976, they're like North Korea, literally. North Korea still exists. There's no reason… North Korea doesn't have the Cultural Revolution where it annihilates its state capacity in a Maoist frenzy in order for Mao to, in his mind, undo his rivals, unbalance and destabilize them. But they have famines. Yes, they do. But they still have the mechanisms of economic control and they have a massive black market. You’ve got to remember that communism doesn't have legal markets for the most part. It has restricted legal markets, again grudgingly. Household plots… But for the most part, it has a lot of illegal market activity, including in the state sector. The state sector gets an order to produce certain numbers of large quantitative output for the military-industrial sector, but it only gets allocated 25% of its ball bearings. It has to assign its supply department on the black market to go out and find the other ball bearings that it's not assigned from central planning. You get a massive black market in the system, not just at the level of little people in the village, but at the top level of the military-industrial complex to make the system work. So when market behavior is grudgingly accepted, what that does is it brings market behavior out of the shadows into a legal or quasi-legal realm. You're not inventing market behavior from scratch. You're surfacing it in some ways. So party officials and industrial officials have market behavior in their firms to grease the system and to meet their output quotas. I agree with your general point that how any nation gets wealthy is not by the government but because of the thrift and entrepreneurialism and hard work of individuals. But that's also true in Western capitalist countries. In those countries, we also have a lot of stupid policies… Yes, as we sit here and speak. When we say America is a capitalist country, what we could say is the government or all the bureaucrats, they'll try to put in all these regulations. It's only grudgingly that they will accede to… We could point to a bunch of stupid policies in America that are equivalent to where they try to outlaw the potatoes and the onions,\n\n\nBut they could only outlaw the potatoes.\nSo any \"capitalist society\" is just a case where the government had to cede some amount of control.\nWe give credit to capitalist countries in the West for saying, at least the government wasn't maximally stupid.\nFair point, DK.\nWe often exaggerate the role of policy in all realms because we do policy ourselves or we talk to policymakers.\nWe have a bias towards the causality of policy.\nAmerica has been 25% of the global economy since 1880.\nWe've had no income tax, we've had income tax.\nWe've had high income tax, we've had low income tax.\nWe've had tariffs, we've had fewer tariffs.\nWe've had all sorts of regulations, we've had deregulation.\nFor 150 years, more or less, we've been around 25% of global GDP, 5% of the population, through every imaginable variety of policy regimes.\nThat doesn't mean that policy is inconsequential.\nIt matters for a lot of players in the system.\nIt matters for those who get the policy turned in their direction, the subsidies or the tax breaks, or the taxes on their competitors or whatever it might be.\nThere's a lot of gaming of the system and it does matter.\nBut in the larger picture of things, you can't create the wealth of the United States over those 150 years, that global economic dominance, and you can't strangle it, in the policy realm.\nYou can affect it, but you can neither create nor strangle it.\nWe have to understand in the communist sense that incentives matter.\nWhen you create incentives for officials to increase GDP and to increase job creation, and that's how they get rewarded, you're going to get a lot of that behavior.\nThe Party will do that, not immediately.\nRemember, immediately they're kind of flat on their back.\nThey've had this Gang of Four.\nDeng Xiaoping has come back from having been purged.\nThey're on the verge of another potential famine.\nPer capita GDP under Mao is $200 during the Cultural Revolution.\n$200 is the annual per capita GDP of a billion people, or slightly under.\nYou think, \"that's insane\".\nThat's where all the people are in poverty when I was saying the regime put them in poverty.\nThey're a little bit flat on their back, which creates an opening.\nIt creates this grudging dynamic of \"we're going to hold power and we're going to allow economic entrepreneurialism to take place, but we're gonna control it.\nWe’re going to control it with special economic zones…\"\nIn any country in the world today where there's a lot of poverty, the reason the poverty exists is also because of policy.\nTo the extent that poverty has been removed, it is because of some combination of human capital and policy got less stupid.\nIf we're going to complain about a country like Bangladesh being poor—and there are many poor countries in the world…\nMaybe we're going in circles here.\nA different question I wanna ask is…\nNo, you have a point.\nWe're not disagreeing.\nI’m just trying to say that we give too much credit to the Communist Party for what's happened in China and not enough blame for what's happened in China.\nThis is part of the dynamic of us seeing communism as potentially successful.\nWe criticize these fools who thought that the Stalin regime was not going to kill them, and was not going to produce famine.\nYet we have this narrative that the Communist Party produced an economic miracle in China.\nI’m sorry, the Communist Party took advantage of the economic miracle in China.\nIt played a part in it, expropriated the hard work of many people, and stole the businesses.\nA lot of those local officials just stole the land and stole the businesses from people who'd created a success.\nThis is the thing that the Party did that's really important.\nDeng Xiaoping first went to Japan in early '79, before he came to the US and met Carter and put on the cowboy hat, that gigantic ten-gallon hat that was bigger than he was.\nHe was like five gallons, the hat was like ten gallons.\nHe goes to Japan.\nYou're looking at Japan, DK, and it lost the war.\nIt was literally incinerated in the American use of atomic weapons.\nIt was destroyed, it lost the war, and it's rising to be the second-largest economy in the world.\nWhat happened?\nHow was that possible?\nHow could Japan rise from the ashes, literally, when China won the war?\nIt was on the winning side and it has a $200 per capita GDP.\nDeng Xiaoping looks this over, and he says the answer is that Japan is partners with America, not with the Soviet Union.\nDeng Xiaoping is going to divorce the Soviet Union economically, and he's going to marry the US.\nDeng gets most-favored-nation status in 1980, thanks to Jimmy Carter.\nThe communist regime in Beijing gets most-favored-nation status, which has to be renewed every year and is renewed every single year until 2000-2001, when they're admitted to the WTO.\nThat's a Clinton initiative that happens right when Bush is going to come to office.\nThe secret sauce is, you have to manufacture and export to the American domestic market because the American middle class is insatiable.\nThey will buy anything as long as the quality is high and the price is low.\nJapan did this.\nJapan's two former colonies, Taiwan and South Korea, followed in Japan's footsteps.\nChina's going to do this too.\nWe're going to use this Japanese model and the American middle class, and their insatiable overconsumption, is going to create the Chinese middle class.\nSo this is what the party does, this geopolitical reorientation from a Soviet economic model to a Japan-style export-led partnership with the US domestic market and middle class.\nThey have a couple of tricks that are really important.\nThey have Hong Kong.\nHong Kong is a British-controlled, rule of law, international financial order that allocates capital based upon risk and return, not Communist Party dictates.\nGorbachev's Soviet Union, they have nothing like Hong Kong.\nThe only reason China has Hong Kong is because after World War II—when Truman announced that Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists were going to accept the Japanese surrender in Hong Kong—the British sent their boats in and took Hong Kong back themselves, so that when Mao defeated Chiang Kai-shek he didn't have Hong Kong.\nThe British had Hong Kong, and they created this international financial system that Mao's successors would be able to use.\nHad the British not done this, there would be no Hong Kong and there would be no Chinese miracle in the Deng Xiaoping and after period.\nThe other thing they have is overseas Chinese who know the culture, speak the language, and are going to do the FDI, again routed through Hong Kong.\nSo you have Taiwan.\nIronically, the failure to win the civil war 100%…\nWe think of the Korean peninsula as divided.\nWe think of this partition of the Korean peninsula, but China is also partitioned.\nThere's also Taiwan, still partitioned to this day.\nTaiwan is the FDI that's going to come in, through Hong Kong, routed through into the special economic zones on a risk-reward, capitalist market basis, not a communist basis.\nFurthermore, they have the Japanese war guilt because the Japanese committed those atrocities in China.\nSo the Japanese are going to make up for what they did by helping rebuild China.\nAgain, the FDI and the tech transfer, like it's coming from Taiwan.\nSo Taiwan and Japan, this partitioned China, and this war guilt, through the British Hong Kong is going to go into the special economic zones, manufacture things like the Japanese, and then export them to the American domestic consumers.\nIt's going to be t-shirts at the beginning and then they're going to, like the Japanese, and then they're going to climb the value chain until it's got the highest value-added products.\nThen supply chains are going to change as a result, and nothing is made in one place anymore, and the world gets very complicated.\nThe point being is that Deng Xiaoping did that.\nThat was intentional.\nThat's the credit that the party deserves and the party never gets because it's a story not of the party's rule alone, but of British Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, United States domestic market, etc.\nSo how do you get rich in the modern world?\nYou sell to America.\nThose countries that are partners with America and that are able to compete.\nThe Chinese deserve credit.\nThey can manufacture higher-quality, lower-cost products that American consumers will buy.\nAmerican consumers are not forced to buy Chinese products.\nThey're just better, and they're cheaper.\nSo they buy them because it's a market and there's competition.\nBangladesh can do this in textiles, you referenced Bangladesh, which is how I got launched on this reverie that I hope is now ending.\nMy point being is that the East Asian miracle is Japan selling to the American domestic market, followed by South Korea and Taiwan doing the same trick, and then followed by Deng Xiaoping's Communist China, the same exact trick, filtered through British Hong Kong.\nThe problem with the Chinese one is that they're not allies, former enemies who are allies like Japan.\nThey are former allies who are now enemies who have done this magic sauce.\nNow we're in the pickle that we're in as a result of this.\nBut the formula…\nThis is where the communists deserve the credit that they never get, whereas they get credit for things that they didn't do.\nSuppose Joseph Stalin had lost the succession battle in 1924 and somebody else is in power, but he's still on the Central Committee or the Politburo.\nIt's 1930 and suppose the other person is also ruthless and is one by one getting rid of every single person in the inner circle.\nWhat would a Stalin-type figure have done if he found himself on the periphery of somebody else's regime?\nCounterfactuals are really critical for historical thought.\nA lot of historians are pedantic about this.\nThey say we're against counterfactuals, it's just speculation.\nBut every single one of them is a practitioner.\nWhy?\nIf you say that Stalin caused collectivization, that means without Stalin there's no collectivization.\nIf you say Hitler caused World War II, you're doing the counterfactual.\nYou're saying no Hitler, no World War II.\nJust to put a finer point on my question, I mean it not just in the sense of whether collectivization would have happened, but more in the sense of, how would he personally have avoided the fate of Bukharin and Kamenev and Zinoviev?\nPotentially, he’s thinking, \"I'm going to get purged someday, I don't want to be the toady to somebody else.\"\nHow would he personally have navigated the sort of power struggle at being what Zinoviev was to Stalin or Bukharin was to Stalin?\nThis is a question about how do you become Stalin?\nCould there have been another Stalin besides Stalin?\nA lot of people will argue that you have this formative period when you're growing up, your parents, your schooling, the influences of your peers, and you become a certain personality.\nPart of it is genetic, and then a lot of it is the environment, and you have this then personality.\nSo you have to understand how the person formed, whether it's Picasso as a painter or Stalin as a dictator.\nThen if you understand their personality, you'll understand what they do in power.\nThe problem with that analysis is that Stalin is not Stalin when he first gets into power.\nIt's the experience of being in power that makes Stalin, Stalin.\nIt's the building of the dictatorship within the dictatorship, and it's the enacting of that kind of power that makes Stalin who he is.\nIt's sitting in that chair.\nIt's being in the Kremlin, running a Leninist regime, and being responsible for Russian power in the world against Nazi Germany, the UK, the US.\nPeople say about Xi Jinping now, \"You know, Xi Jinping has made a lot of mistakes.\nIf he had just kept to Deng Xiaoping's policies, China would be much better off.\nWe'd still be in a kind of détente or partnership with China.\nInstead, we're at loggerheads and there's potential war.\"\nThe problem with that analysis is, \"What would Xi Jinping have done if he were the number one guy under Deng Xiaoping instead of Deng?\"\nMaybe he would have done Deng's policies just like Deng did.\nMore importantly, what would Deng do if he were alive today instead of Xi Jinping?\nWould he do what Deng did in the 80s and 90s, or would he do what Xi Jinping is doing today?\nIn other words, how much is the personality and how much is the system?\nHow much is formation before you get into the position of power, and how much is the circumstances and responding to those circumstances and the exigencies of the moment and the way the system operates and the place the system is and what the larger context in the world looks like?\nHere you have a Communist party that seizes power.\nAs I said, unlike the case of Bavaria, southern Germany, northern Italy, Hungary, it holds power.\nIt doesn't just seize power.\nThe Paris Commune, 1870-71, they seized power in Paris.\nThen they were destroyed, put up against the wall and shot.\nThey seize and they hold power.\nBut they're in this peasant country, and the peasant has the land de facto and they're Marxists.\nThey believe that the base, the socioeconomic base, the class relations, determine the superstructure or the politics.\nIn Marxism, the base, the socioeconomic base, gives you the superstructure.\nPolitics depends on it, it's an outcome of what the base is.\nSo you have a de facto capitalist base.\nI don't mean whether they would have done collectivization.\nI mean how would he personally…\nBecause he wants power.\nI get that.\nHe makes this decision.\nAll of them want to get rid of capitalist relations in the countryside.\nEvery single one of them wants to do that.\nThey're all communists, they're all Marxist Leninists.\nBut they don't think it can be done.\nThey think if you try it, you'll fail.\nHe goes and tries it.\nHe creates even more destabilization than they had predicted.\n\n\nBut he just powers through and gets there to the end and succeeds. Most of them are grateful that he's pulled this off because they thought it couldn't be done. Your question is, \"Who else could have become Stalin in that position?\" Who else among the Marxist-Leninists could have been the guy who says, \"Whether we can do this or not, we have to do this because we can't have a socioeconomic base that's capitalist and have the communist regime survive.\" They were all ready to say that, but they weren't all ready to do that. Moreover, after he did it, they had criticized him during the process while he was doing it. He was the only one in his mind who was Marxist-Leninist enough to get it done, and they were all carping at him. This is where you begin to see the paranoia, suspicion being magnified, where he then, in a few years after collectivization is more or less finished, he's going to go after them. So you needed a person who could have felt in their head that this was not only necessary, but doable. Someone who would undertake those risks, power through no matter how much famine and resistance and upheaval and criticism there was. Someone who would then come out the other side of that as the victor with this gigantic secret police that was really small but got really big in the process of doing the very thing that people said you couldn't do. Then having all of that and not destroying any rivals and going from dictatorship to despotism… So you would need a person who was capable of being Stalin in that group, not from outside that group but inside that group. Then that person would either not use that power to destroy everybody else—not yearn for despotism but be satisfied with dictatorship where others exercised power and their domains—and yet still be able to hold on to the system. Was there such a person in the circle? If the answer is no, could that person have emerged in the process of doing it? I guess my question is slightly different. Even if such a person did not exist, suppose Stalin already exists, he did all the stuff, and it's 1934. It seems like Stalin's starting to go a little Great Terror-y soon. Another copy of Stalin is in the Politburo. Just out of a sense of self-preservation, they're like, \"In a couple of years, I don't want to be writing my own confession and ending up in the Gulag.\" Is Stalin, being the power player that he was and knowing how to align factions against each other to his own advantage in the very end, if somebody like him was in the Politburo, what would they have done? Or were they already there and there was nothing they could do by this point? This is a question for every single dictatorship. Why didn't somebody just kill Stalin? He was gonna kill them, kill them all. Why didn't they just kill him and save themselves? During the 1920s, Stalin resigned six times, three times in writing and three times orally, between 1923 and 1928. Every time those guys around him beg him to stay. Not only do they fail to try to push him out, but when he himself volunteers to go out, they beg him to stay. Then he kills all of them within 10 years. Every one of them, just with a few exceptions, is dead. Jeez, so what were those guys thinking? It's clear that Stalin was not Stalin yet. If they knew in the 20s that in the 30s he was gonna murder them all, maybe they would have acted the way you said. He becomes Stalin in this process. He's not Stalin yet. That's a really important argument that I make in the book. Today you look at Putin. Putin is ruining Russia. Why doesn't somebody just assassinate him? Xi Jinping, he's hurting China. He's making China enemies everywhere around the world when China was, until recently, popular. China was 75% favorable globally. Now it's 25%, more or less, favorable globally. That's Xi Jinping's doing. How can the elites around him let him do that? Around Putin, the people are falling out of windows. Instead of falling out of the windows themselves, why don't they push him out the window? Khamenei in Iran, he's brought ruin on the country. Why don't they take him out and try to save themselves and save the country, not just themselves? In other words, they can be patriotic as well as securing self-survival. The answer is it rarely happens. One, you have a collective action problem. Sorry, why doesn't this prevent… People are trying to kill the Tsar constantly. They're killing Russian ministers in the tsarist regime. There are more assassination attempts on Hitler, some of which come very close, than by far on Stalin. Also, Mussollini, but never against Stalin. Why is that? Stalin is the guy who is building and personifying the system. The people around Stalin can see that he is unusually good at dictatorship. He is just carrying this entire system on his back through thick and thin, killing enemies, liquidating the kulaks, collectivizing agriculture, building a military-industrial complex, defeating Hitler in war. I mean, how much better from the system's logic, not from humanity's logic, not from the point of view of the kind of values that you and I share, how much better are you going to do than Stalin? So there is a way in which they're pygmies and he's Stalin. Of course, they know that they can't do what he does. If they tried to unseat him, they might save their lives but they might lose the revolution, the system and the radiant future, the overthrow of capitalism, the abundance, peace, paradise on earth. That's a big move to lose if you believe in that, if your life is about that and you're dedicated to that. But in addition, you have a collective action problem that's really important. Let's suppose that I'm in a Stalinist regime with you. You're a functionary and I'm a functionary. Stalin's collectivizing agriculture, which means he's destroying productivity, and we're going to be poor. All the way through the Brezhnev period, we're gonna be importing wheat even though we have this gigantic agricultural belt, wheat belt. Some people knew in real time that this was self-harm. I come to you and I say, \"This Stalin guy, he's wrecking everything. We got to take him down.\" You agree with me. But you know what? You don't know. Maybe I've been sent by Stalin to test your loyalty. Maybe I'm provoking you to reveal your disloyalty. Maybe I'm not being sincere. You agree with me, but instead of saying yes, let's do it, immediately you run to Stalin and you say that this Kotkin guy is talking behind your back about how we need to take you down. It’s self-preservation, you're going to preserve yourself because you don't trust. There's a lack of trust inside these dictatorships. If you knew that Stalin hadn't sent me for sure 100%, you would say, \"You know, you're right. You got a point there. What can we do about this?\" But you know that Stalin is constantly doing these provocations, or you suspect he is. You know that he's got people, provocateurs who are around the system doing things like this. The secret police are listening in on your phone conversations. The driver of your car works for Stalin, doesn't work for you, and is reporting any overheard conversations in the car. And the maid in your apartment is also working for the secret police and reporting up the chain of command. So the system that you're in enmeshes you in this distrust, in this surveillance and distrust. So what looks like, \"Geez, let's just take him down and save our own life, let alone save the country.\" Yes, it's logical, but that's not the kind of life that they led. We would think that based upon the kind of lives and the system that we live in. But there's a bunch of revolutionaries who try to kill the Tsar and sometimes succeed. They're just random people. They're not people in the regime, they're just random people. Yes. Why doesn't a kulak, one of the hundred million enslaved people, go out and… The Tsar has less security than Stalin does. Didn't you say that in 1928 he had like one bodyguard when he would go to his dacha? The bodyguard stuff increases over time, but the regime is walled off from the people. Stalin doesn't go out in public. He's not one of these populist types in public who's bathing in the adulation of the crowd. He's in the office, he's at the dacha, he's at the party meeting, he's at the party congress. He's not putting himself at risk. Even so, it is paradoxical because when Hitler goes to make a speech, every year Hitler makes a speech in Munich. It's known when he's going to make the speech. It's announced in the paper. There are a couple of assassination attempts on Hitler, one of which takes place in the hall where he's going to do, where someone plants a bomb. It's a working-class guy. He plants a bomb there and the bomb goes off, it blows up. Hitler left the hall more quickly than anticipated, based on the schedule that people thought he would be there longer. It was quicker. He was out and the bomb exploded and he survived. There are military officials who tried to kill Hitler, famously, in 1944. They plant a bomb under the table which also goes off. It almost gets him but doesn't get him, during a military briefing. There are attempts on Hitler's life both from the society and from inside the regime. Stalin doesn't have this. In fact, the people inside the regime are killing themselves. When they see that Stalin is leading them down a blind alley of murder and ration tickets in Gulag. They kill themselves rather than kill Stalin. Again, there's something special about the mentality of these communists. There's also something about Stalin's success as well as the threat that he represents to these individuals. Still, it is mysterious because there were opportunities and people didn't take up the opportunities. Very few… There was no serious assassination attempt on Stalin. The very few times when they accused somebody of doing an assassination… There were shots fired at a boat when Stalin was on holiday in the south. It was not because Stalin was in the boat. It was because the boat was not in the system as marked as allowed to use that waterway. They were just performing their duties as border guards shooting at the boat. It got dressed up as an assassination attempt and people were arrested and executed and it was publicized as such. They didn't know that Stalin was in the boat. You've written other books about the collapse of the Soviet Union. There's this last ditch effort in the Eastern Bloc where there's falling productivity, to borrow more money, invest more into finding this last ditch technological miracle that can cure all their problems. How similar is that, in your opinion, to what's happening in China? The dissimilarity is that while Eastern Europe was struggling to export and they had a trade deficit, China, many people argue, is exporting too much. Do you see any similarity between where Eastern Europe was in 1989 versus where China is today? Or are you not as concerned about China right now? It's a very difficult question to answer very briefly, but it's a really important question. There are tremendous differences, of course, civilizational differences let alone system differences. We wouldn't want to elide those differences. What's similar is the Marxist-Leninist monopoly on power. People ask me, is China a Marxist-Leninist regime? I usually say it's a Leninist regime because that's undisputable. Do they believe in Marxism or not? People disagree on this. How many true believers are there? Is Xi Jinping a true believer? That's a difficult argument to win because the evidence is contradictory and because we don't know the inside of the system. It's still in power, it hasn't fallen. But it's clearly a Leninist system. A Leninist system can't be half-pregnant. You can't be half-communist. You either have a communist monopoly or you don't. What happens in communist political reform, not economic reform where they allow some market behavior, but where you liberalize the system and you open it up politically… You say, \"Dwarkesh, let's have debate inside the party. Let's allow pluralism inside the party's rule, meaning we're going to keep the party but we're going to allow different tendencies in the party. The problem with that is some wiseacre raises their hand and says, \"I don't want the party. I want another party. I don't want the Communist Party. I want a Social Democratic party, or I want a right-wing party, or I want a centrist party.\" And you say, \"No, no, no, that's not the rules here. The rule is only debate within the party's monopoly, not that you can have another party.\" What happens is there's no way for them to open debate and then to put a lid on the debate. It becomes a Pandora's box. You can't be half-communist, half-monopoly. You either have the monopoly or you don't. Every time they liberalize politically, the system liquidates itself. Hungary in '56, Czechoslovakia in '68, and Gorbachev. Had Gorbachev not happened, China might have done its own Gorbachev. Had they not seen Gorbachev accidentally liquidate the party, they might have done political reform, opened up the party, and watched the thing unravel. Or they would have had a crackdown and put the lid back on much bigger than the Tiananmen episode in June 1989. They're not going to do political reform because they know from studying the Gorbachev case, which everybody studies in party school where all the cadres have to go to be trained. They're not going to open up the system politically because that's suicide. They're not going to commit suicide like what happened with Gorbachev. This means their policy options, their menu of policy options, is limited.\n\n\nThey can open up the economy, but if it gets too open and too liberalized, too many people with independent sources of power and wealth, too many Jack Ma’s, they lose control potentially. They can open up the system economically, but then they have to somehow reimpose controls. But if they reimpose too many controls, the GDP goes down and they don't have the job creation. You have this constant back and forth of how much economic liberalization you can have before it becomes a threat, or how little economic liberalization you can have before it becomes a threat to your ability to create jobs and wealth. That's the dilemma they're in. The Soviets in the '70s and '80s were looking at the system. They didn't want to change the system Gorbachev-style. They didn't want to liberalize it politically. They were willing to introduce some market economic liberalization, some market incentives. They tried that in '65, it actually didn't work. Then the Prague Spring happened in '68 and scared the bejesus out of them. Reform looked like the end of the system. They tried a little bit of economic liberalization. It didn't work. They didn't want to open up the system politically. So what's left? Technological fantasies. Maybe technology can perfect planning. All the pathologies of the planned economy, all the inefficiencies of the planned economy can be overcome with computers. Maybe if we invest heavily in tech, we don't have to make the hard choices of deep and fundamental structural change which would end our party's monopoly. We can keep the party. We can keep the party's monopoly. We can even keep the state-owned economy, but we can just tweak it with the tech and supercharge it or even turbocharge it and make it work that way. Computers, tech, will save us from the hard choices of deep structural reform which will threaten our power. We know how that worked. It didn't work. Now you're looking at China today. You have a Communist Party monopoly. You can't be half-pregnant. You can't open up politically. How are you going to reintroduce dynamism? How are you going to get the GDP growth? How are you going to get job creation? How are you going to get societal buy-in? If you go too far in that direction, that could threaten the regime. If you don't go far enough… So we got tech. The tech can make our dictatorship function better. Not just our economy, our productivity, our job creation, managing through the demographic crisis, not just the economic and social benefits from tech that tech could deliver… Tech could maybe make our communist dictatorship immune from challenges because surveillance is all-encompassing, because of our ability to spot things before they happen. So you can see where they would be so seduced, so tempted to believe that tech is the solution. Here's the problem with that argument. First, it didn't work the last time. That doesn't mean it won't work this time, but the track record, even though it's a small number of cases, is not good. But the other problem is political legitimacy. You can't get political legitimacy. You might have thought that, \"Oh, geez, if the GDP grows, that'll give us legitimacy.\" Then the GDP stops growing and you no longer have the economic benefits to claim that that's why you're in power. But do you need it? Joseph Stalin didn't have strong growth in the '20s and '30s, and it seems like you just double down on repression. If you double down on the NKVD… The Tsar actually had 2% growth up until 1917. They're dead, and their system is gone. It's fundamentally a deficit of political legitimacy. We talk about Iran today and how Russia and China didn't even help them with any military support or economic support while they're under tremendous strain from Israel rolling back Iranian power. So they kind of got betrayed by their strategic partners. The strategic partnership among the authoritarian regimes is a fake. That's true. It is a fake. They're out for themselves. They're opportunistic, and they will help the others to the extent that they feel it's helping for themselves. The day that they feel it's not helping themselves, forget it. There's a deeper problem there. What the Iranian regime needs is political legitimacy. That's what it doesn't have. It's not just a failure economically. It's not just a failure in security. In its foreign policy terms. It's hated by its own people. It's got maybe 20% support in the population. A lot of people are indifferent but a majority of the people despise this regime and want to see it go. They're patriots for Iran, but they detest the mullah's clerical regime. Neither Russia nor China can give political legitimacy to Iran. They can give dual-use technology. They can give them missiles. They can give them anti-missile defense. They can never give them political legitimacy. That's the vulnerability, which is why Iran is on the precipice now. Because the regime is illegitimate and the regime knows that it's illegitimate in the eyes of the people. I guess we'd like to think that's what matters. But historically it just seems like when authoritarians crack down really hard, it kind of just works. Right? That's why they have gigantic repressive apparatuses. People talk about a bargain. The Chinese made a bargain or the Russians made a bargain. The people gave up their freedom and the regime provides a higher standard of living. So there's this bargain. There is no bargain. Because if the regime fails to raise the standard of living, the people can't sue them in court. They can't say, \"You didn't live up to your end of the bargain. We gave away our freedom, but you didn't deliver on your part of the bargain, so the deal is over. You're out of power now because you didn't live up to your bargain.\" Instead, they repress. They bring out the batons. They bring out the water cannon. They bring out the disappearances where people are arrested in cause. They're not even indicted, they just disappear them. You have this huge repressive apparatus, and it seems to work, especially when you have this moment where you fail to live up to some of the promises that you made. The challenge for them is that somebody has to do the repression. The repressive apparatus is not a machine. It's not AI. It's not something which is mechanical. It's people. It's people who grow up in neighborhoods, come from villages, and went to schools with other people. This brings us back to the tsarist regime where we started. The tsarist secret police wasn't big enough to keep the lid on, so they had to use the military. The military was a peasant army. They were peasants in uniform. The working class, including women, was striking for bread in the capital and marching in the capital for bread in 1917. The military was told to shoot them. These are elite military units. Shoot these workers. They're peasants, and you think, \"Okay, peasants, they'll shoot workers. No love lost.\" The workers were peasants yesterday. Some of them were still peasants who went back to the villages where these soldiers were from, during downtime at the factory, during harvest time. They were the same people. The army decided not to shoot. There came a point where the regime called out the repression, and the repressors had agency and didn't repress. That's what happens in these cases. You never know when it's going to happen. It's very hard to predict beforehand. But there comes a moment where the people who are supposed to do the shooting decide not to shoot. The people who are supposed to do the arresting decide not to arrest. The people who are doing the surveillance decide to stop. You have this huge repressive apparatus, and it works until the moment the people in it decide not to do it anymore. That's where the political legitimacy variable is ultimately decisive. Because those people who were killing under communism and collectivizing those villages and dekulakizing and killing the people in their native village that they had grown up with… If they hadn't done that, the regime couldn't have done this. The regime couldn't have collectivized. Joseph Stalin wasn't out there shooting people. He was signing the decree, which then got communicated through the system to the point of the activist who enacted it or not, as the case might be. When they don't enact, your power evaporates. It's like a bank run. You look at the bank, and you think, \"Wow, that's pretty solid. They got these neoclassical columns. It's all made out of stone. Looks really impressive. This bank is really solid.\" One day, it gets in people's heads that the bank might not have your money. The bank might not be good in reality for your paper holdings. You rush to the bank to try to get your money out before that money is gone or doesn't exist. Everybody gets that idea at the same time, not just one person, and you get a bank run. This really solid institution with these neoclassical stone columns turns out to evaporate, evanescent. You can have a political bank run in the repressive apparatus. They cease thinking that they should kill people like themselves on behalf of a system that they are no longer loyal to, no longer adhering to. That can happen in the forces of order, as we call them, in the repressive apparatus. It can happen inside the elite. Because when the leader gives the order, it's got to go through the whole chain of command. The leader doesn't give the order to the soldier. It goes to the one boss, the subordinate to that boss, the subordinate… Anywhere along the chain of command, there can be disloyalty and revolt. There can be what we call political defection. What motivates, what triggers, political defection? The lack of legitimacy, political illegitimacy. People are not going to die for something that they no longer believe in. So that's a really big problem that the communist regime can't solve with tech. You say, \"Well, the tech could produce power and prosperity and China could relegitimize its rule just like it did with economic growth. The economic growth did it for 30-40 years and that's how the regime legitimated itself. The tech will do that for the next 30-40 years.\" The answer is, that hasn't happened yet. Maybe it can do that and maybe it can't, but it's never permanent. What's permanent is power rooted in the people. What's permanent is their real citizens. They have real freedoms. They have the right to vote. Now, they can't get what they want. They go to the polls and they see bad candidate, worse candidate, even worse candidate. But they can punish what they don't like. They can exercise that agency. They can be citizens. They can realize their citizenship, just like we do as consumers in the marketplace, consumers of podcasts. That's where you get legitimacy from, where the system enables people, opportunity at home, opportunity for people who otherwise don't have opportunity. That's legitimacy. That's priceless. China doesn't have that. Russia doesn't have that. Joseph Stalin had that legitimacy for a time based upon the idea that he was building a new world and overcoming the horrors of capitalism and imperialism and world war. Khrushchev gave a second wind to that, even as he was revealing more of the horrors. Then that just ran out, and they unwittingly destroyed the system trying to give it a third wind under Gorbachev. So they have no way forward. They're stuck. They can't do structural reform and maintain their power, but without structural reform, without a legitimate system, they also can't maintain their power forever. It's really interesting. In the short run, we're all dead because there could be a World War III. But in the long run, we're all good because our system is better. So we have to elongate the short run. No world war between the US and China. Get to the long run, get to the competition, get to the cold war instead of hot war, where we're not having a hot war. That's the beauty of cold war. It's not hot war. You can compete, you can have tensions, you can have rivalries, but you don't have hot war. So in the short run, potentially, we're all dead, because a world war with great powers… It was 55 million in World War II, the low estimate of deaths. That was a multiple of World War I, and World War III would be a multiple of World War II. If we can avoid that, in the long run, we're good. It's the opposite of what Keynes said about how in the long run, we're all dead. It's in the short run that we're potentially dead. But I like the long run. So the tech and China thing might work, and it might not work, but it's not permanent even if it does work. All right, great note to close on. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. It was a real pleasure to talk to you. My pleasure. I apologize for not being succinct in my answers, but if you've read some of my books, not all of them, some of them go on at length. A few of them are short, though. I have to master the answers to questions on podcasts in order to be able to get through your whole magnificent list. Maybe next time we'll do better. The long drawdown is why I want you on the podcast. A lot of these issues are complicated, so I appreciate you doing it.\n",

breakthroughs in biology over the last few decades that you haven't been involved in—from the Human Genome Project to CRISPR, age reversal to de-extinction.\nSo you weren't exactly an easy prep.\nOkay, so let's start here.\nBy what year would it be the case that, if you make it to that year, technology in bio will keep progressing to such an extent that your lifespan will increase by a year, every year, or more?\nEscape velocity is sometimes what it's called for aging.\nDifferent people have estimates, and all those estimates, including mine, are going to be taken with a big grain of salt.\nMainly looking at the exponentials in biotechnology and the progress that's been made in understanding—not just understanding causes of aging, but seeing real examples where you can reverse subsets of the aging phenotype—you're getting close to all of aging.\nIn other words, instead of just saying, \"Oh, I'm going to fix the damage in this collagen in this tendon, in this limb,\" you're saying, \"Oh, I'm going to change a lot of things that are common to age-related diseases and I'm going to get more than one at a time.\"\nLooking at those two phenomena—the exponentials in biotechnologies and the breakthrough in general aging, not just analysis but synthesis and therapies, and a lot of these therapies now making it in the clinical trials—I wouldn't be surprised if 2050 would be a point.\nIf we can make it to that point, 25 years… Most people listening to this have a good chance of making it 25 years.\nThe thing is, it's not going to be some sudden point where you're going to be so sick 25 years from now that it's like hit or miss.\nIt's more likely that you're going to be healthier 25 years from now than you thought you were going to be.\nThere may be some, probably not some law of physics, but some economic or complexity issue that we don't know about that becomes a brick wall.\nI doubt it seriously, but we'll have to see.\nGiven the number of things you would have to solve to give us a lifespan of humpback whales… Bowhead whales, 200 years.\nSorry, yeah.\nIs there any hope for doing that from somatic gene therapy alone, or would that have to be germ line gene therapy?\nProbably there's a lot of forces pushing it towards somatic.\nFor one, there's 8 billion people that have missed the germline opportunity.\nThat’s to say, it doesn't apply to us, the two of us and everybody listening to this.\nYou have to be very cautious when you say something's impossible.\nIt's safe to say it's impossible to do it this second, but you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow in the next decade or something.\nI think there's a lot that could be done.\nIn particular, since aging is a fairly cellular phenomenon—with proteins going through the blood and other factors going through the blood, signaling and so forth—you could imagine that if you replaced every nucleus in the body, it would suddenly be young again without going all the way back to the embryo and forward again.\nThere's various other things that are just short of that.\nIf you replace the cells, will they fit into that niche?\nThey might displace the old cells.\nThat's certainly within the realm of modern synthetic biology, for cells to take over niches.\nI think the hardest part is the brain.\nEven there, even though the brain doesn't really use stem cells that much, you could artificially bring in stem cells and they could artificially fit into a circuit and learn the circuit and then displace the old ones in some way.\nA Ship of Theseus kind of thing in the brain.\nYeah exactly, Ship of Theseus, trying to maintain the connections and the memories.\nThere's some fairly straightforward experiments that need to be done before we can really even estimate how hard that problem is.\nVery often there's low-hanging fruit that people just think is improbable.\nBut it's there because biology has all these gifts where it just hands over to us levers that we can flip.\nLike vaccines are this amazing gift that didn't have to exist, but they do.\nIs there an existing gene delivery mechanism which could deliver gene therapy to every single cell in the body?\nThere is nothing close to that today.\nBut there's nothing, no law of physics, that would prevent it.\nAgain, there's going to be practical considerations, like how many injections do you need to do to achieve that goal?\nBut we're getting better at targeting tissues.\nOne of my companies, Dyno Therapeutics, showed they could get a hundredfold improvement in targeting neurons in the brain, which is a big deal.\nThat was just one little campaign that they did.\nThat one experiment involved a lot of AI and a lot of testing of millions of different capsids.\nCapsids are fairly limited in the diversity and the structure that it can change to.\nBut cells have even more possibilities.\nI think you could probably get delivery to everything… The question is how close to 100% do you need to get?\nIt's going to vary from tissue to tissue.\nFor example, for some therapies you just need to get 1% because that 1% can produce some missing enzyme.\nAnd that 1% doesn't have to necessarily be in its normal place.\nYou can turn a muscle into part of the immune system temporarily for a vaccine.\nAn enzyme that's normally made in, let's say the brain, you could make in the liver, if the point is just to get it into the blood.\nSo I think that's moving along quite well.\nYou're one of the co-founders of Colossal, which recently announced that they de-extincted a dire wolf.\nNow you're working on the woolly mammoth.\nDo you really think we're going to bring back a woolly mammoth?\nThe difference between an elephant and a woolly mammoth might be like a million base pairs.\nHow do we think about the kind of thing we're actually bringing back?\nPeople get worked up about whether we are trying to bring back, or have already, or will ever bring back a new species.\nIf you think of it, rather than as a natural thing that we're trying to do, but as synthetic biology with goals that has potential societal… People also get worked up as to whether this could possibly benefit society in any way.\nCan we really fix an environment to suit humans or fix the global carbon to suit humans?\nThe answer is we don't know.\nBut it's worth a try, isn't it?\nBecause it could be very cost-effective.\nThe other aspect of it is there's a whole discipline within synthetic biology of asking, \"What's the minimum?\"\nPeople often phrase it into, \"What's the maximum?\nWhat can we do?\"\nI'm interested in both.\nYes, there's millions of differences between mammoths and elephants.\nThere are millions of differences between elephant one and elephant two, within Asian elephants and between Asians and African.\nBut not all of those are definitive in terms of what we would normally call them and how we would normally classify them, and what their functionality would be in an ecosystem.\nThere's this exercise that people do.\nWe've done it, for example, with developmental biology.\nWhat's the minimum number of transcription factors it takes to make a neuron from a pluripotent stem cell?\nWhat's the minimum number of base pairs it takes to make something that will replicate to something that was done in mycoplasma originally?\nIn a way, these are more interesting than, \"Can we make a perfect copy of something?\"\nWhat's the minimum things we have to do to make it completely functionally, or even functionally in a particular category?\nHow do we make it bigger?\nWe learn the rules for how to make things bigger, how to make things replicate faster, how to use new materials, etc.\nWith the dire wolf, we clearly didn't make an exact copy of a dire wolf.\nBut it helped illustrate and educate people around the world on, \"What is the difference between a gray wolf and a dire wolf?\"\nBecause direwolves, they're big.\nMaybe they have a particular coloration.\nThe head components tend to be bigger than the leg components.\nHow many genes do you need to do that?\nMaybe this was Direwolf 2.0, and we're going to go for 3.0 and successive approximations.\nWe might want to develop the technology for making exact copies of something, especially being able to make 100 variations on an exact copy.\nBecause then there won't be any argument about whether you could make a dire wolf.\nIt'll be a matter of what you should make and what would be most beneficial for the species that you're making, for the environment it lives in and for humans.\nDoes this teach us something interesting about phenotypes which you think are downstream from many genes, and are in fact modifiable by very few changes?\nBasically, could we do this to other species or to other things you might care about, like intelligence?\nWhere you might think, there must be thousands of genes that are relevant, but there's like 20 edits you need to make, really, to be in a totally different ballgame.\nYou're hitting on a very interesting question.\nIt's related to, \"What's the minimum?\"\nFor example, you almost said it.\nTake a very multigenic trait in humans.\nHeight is probably the most well-studied one, simply because no matter what gene, no matter what medical condition you're studying, you collect information on height and weight and things like that.\nAnyway, they tracked it down to something on the order of 10,000 genes, of which we have 20,000 protein coding genes.\nSome of them are RNA coding genes.\nThey each have a tiny influence on height.\nBut if you take growth hormone, somatotropin, you have extreme examples where you'll get extremely low small stature and extremely high stature due to that one alone.\nIn fact, it's used clinically as well for seven different medical treatments.\nThat's a perfect example of how much we can minimize something, sometimes called reductionism.\nReductionism isn't all bad.\nSometimes it helps us bring a product into medicine.\nSometimes it helps us understand or build a tool chest or a module that we could use in other cases and translate it to other species.\nYou hit on it just right.\nNot everything will translate, but we start accumulating these widgets.\nIt's kind of like all the electronic widgets that we accumulate over time.\nIf you just want to slap it into the next circuit, you might be able to.\nWhat implications does this have for gene therapy in general?\nWhat is preventing us from finding the latent knob for every single phenotype we might care about, in terms of helping with disabilities or enhancement?\nIs it the case that for any phenotype we care about, there will be one thing that is like HGH for height?\nHow do we find it?\nWith biology we've got a real gift which is that it's both much more complicated than almost anything we've designed from scratch, but it also is a lot more forgiving in a certain sense.\nYou can have an animal or even a human that has two heads which, evolutionarily, there was no selection specifically to have two heads.\nBut just a little deviation from the normal developmental pattern during fetal development and they both function fine.\nThey control subsets of the body and they have their own personality, their own life.\nThere's all kinds of things you can do in biology where you're working at a very high programming level.\nThat’s a way of thinking about it.\nBut pushing us to a new level of intelligence is going to be very challenging and maybe not even urgent.\nTo some extent, actualizing the people that we currently have would be quite impactful, just getting them all up to whatever speed they want to be up to within the range that's been demonstrated.\nSome people are going to want to be like Einstein, some people won't.\nSome people will want to be healthy all the time.\nUnlikely, but some people might not.\nSome people might want to live to be 150, some people might want to die at 80.\nBut if you give them that range, that capability… What if we had 8 billion, super healthy, don't need to worry about food and drugs, super healthy Einstein-level intelligence, education level the best we can come up with… That would be a completely different world.\nJust getting everybody to the healthy level, how much gene therapy would that take?\nIt sounds like it wouldn't take that much, if you think that there are a couple of knobs which control very high level functions?\nSo do you find them through the GWAS, genome wide association studies?\nIs it through simulations of these…\nI would say mostly GWAS for humans, maybe for animals in general.\nFor animals with synthetic biology, the smaller and the cheaper and faster replicating, the more experiments you can do.\nI don't want to overemphasize how single genes can do these amazing things.\nBut there's also the possibility that multiple genes can be hypothesized and tested quickly.\nFor example I mentioned earlier, what's the minimum number of transcription factors it takes to turn a stem cell into a neuron?\nThere's a bunch of recipes where you can do it with one.\nMaybe you want a specific neuron, you might need a few more.\nBut then you can kind of quickly go to the answer by looking at each target cell type that exists.\nYou can see what transcription factors does it express at the time that it's the target?\nThen you say, \"Let's just try those on the stem cell and see if they work.\"\nThat recipe has worked quite well.\nIt's the basis of GC Therapeutics and a bunch of the work that we do.\nYou can get a recipe for almost every cell type in the body.\nNow, that's not new cell types, but at least you've learned, to your point, about reducing the number of genes we need to manipulate in order to get to a particular goal.\nHere's a whole series of goals, and we can get them with 1, 2, 3, maybe 7.\n\n\nChanged transcription factors.\nThat's an example.\nThere's room for lots of other examples of where you can do reduction and do not just reductionistic biology, but then constructionistic.\nYou take it back up and make a whole complex system and see what happens.\nThen you can do lots of those combinations and you debug them and so forth.\nSome of these things you can do… In vitro things you can do probably on the order of 10^14, 10^17.\nThings that involve cells are typically in the billions.\nBut this is how we're going to get inroads into the very complicated biological systems.\nCan I ask you some questions about biodefense?\nBecause some of the stuff you guys work on, or quite responsibly choose not to work on, can keep one up at night.\nMirror life.\nGiven the fact that it's physically possible, why doesn't it just happen at some point?\nSome day it'll get cheap enough.\nSomebody will care about it enough, that somebody just does it.\nWhat's the equilibrium here?\nI was a co-author on a paper that warned about the dangers of mirror life.\nJust like I wrote a paper long ago about the dangers of having the synthetic capabilities we have for making synthetic viruses, and to some extent of having new genetic codes.\nThey have a few things in common.\nThe advance that we were recognizing, in our Science paper that was warning about mirror life, is not only that we had to calculate the possibility of error-prone escape or something like that was.\nWe don't want anything to escape that we made in the lab unless there's a general societal consensus that it's a good thing.\nSo far there aren't any examples of that.\nMirror life, if it can be weaponized, that would take it to a whole other level of concern.\nThe concern was that if we got it to a certain point, then it would be easy to weaponize it.\nAgain, there's practical considerations that maybe that most people who consider weaponizing mirror life would probably be satisfied with weaponizing viruses that already exist, that are already pathogens.\nAnd they wouldn't want to destroy themselves and their family and their legacy and everything like that.\nBut all it takes is one, one group probably, or one person.\nBut your question is, is it inevitable?\nI don't know.\nIt might be.\nIt's quite possible it's already here.\nIn other words, we already have mirror life in our solar system or maybe even on our planet.\nIt just hasn't been weaponized.\nWhat we were saying in the Science paper is that this seems like the sort of thing that could wipe out all competing life if were properly weaponized.\nBut there are probably a few things like that.\nWhat we really need to do is reduce the motivation to do that, maybe increase our preparedness for a variety of existential threats.\nSome of which will be natural, some of which will be one disgruntled person who has essentially too much power.\nOver the history of humanity, the amount of things that a single person can do has grown very significantly.\nIt used to be, when you had your bare hands, there was kind of a limit to what one person could do.\nA large number of people could team up and get a mammoth or something like that.\nToday, one person with the right connections or right access to technology could blow up a city.\nThat's a huge increase in capability.\nI think we want to start dialing that back a little bit somehow.\nWhat does that look like in terms of not just mirror life, but synthetic biology in general?\nMaybe we're at an elevated period of the ratio to offense and defense.\nHow do we get to an end state where—even if there's lots of people running around with bad motivations—somehow there are defenses built up that we would still survive, where we're robust against that kind of thing?\nIs such an equilibrium possible?\nOr will offense always be privileged in this game?\nOffense awfully does have an advantage, but so far we haven't… We made it through the Cold War without blowing up any hydrogen bombs, as far as I know, accidentally or intentionally on enemies.\nWe did do two atomic bombs.\nBut a lot of that is based on the difficulty of building hydrogen or atomic bombs.\nThe thing that's alarming to people like me is that biotechnology enables smaller and smaller efforts that are harder and harder to detect, more and more subtle to the stochastic variation between people.\nThere's some people that are just so happy they would never want to do anything close to that.\nOr they're so responsible or ethical or whatever.\nThen there are other people who, whenever they have a bad day, they want to take a lot of people with them.\nMaybe some progress in psychiatric medicine would help.\nAgain, you don't want to force that on people.\nYou want to make sure that if they don't want to get cured, you can't force them, but you can make it available to them that might help.\nHopefully there's a more technological solution or more robust solution than that.\nWell, there will be technological solutions to the psychiatric problem.\nIt could be that even people who aren't sure whether they want to be helped or not can test, try it out, and it's reversible.\nThey say, \"Yes, I like that better.\"\nOkay, let's try that then.\nThen there's other things that cause you to have bad days.\nIt's not just your psyche.\nIt's also the environment.\nSo if you're surrounded by your people being starved, infectious disease, or you’re being shot at or something like that, those are things that are subject to sociological and technological solutions.\nIf we could really solve a lot of that stuff, we could reduce the probability that one person… This is maybe pessimistic because you're basically saying we have to solve all of society's problems before we don't have to worry about synthetic biology, which I'm not that optimistic about.\nWe'll solve some of them.\nRight?\nYou shouldn’t be.\nI'm not trying to reassure you.\nWe're having a conversation about what it takes and that might be one scenario for what it might take.\nYou had an interesting scheme for remapping the codons in a genome so that it's impervious to naturally evolved viruses.\nIs there a way in which this scheme would also work against synthetically manufactured viruses?\nIt’s much harder.\nAgain, the offense has the advantage.\nWe can make a lot of different codes.\nWhich will limit the transmissibility?\nYeah.\nSo one interesting thing is that there's only two chiralities.\nThere's the current chirality and the mirror chirality.\nBut there's maybe 10^80 different codes.\nSome of them you might be able to take out all at once.\nAnyway, coding space is a kind of more interesting space.\nOf course it could get even more complicated than that because the 10^83 is based on triplet codons and that sort of thing.\nBut if they're quadruplet codons or novel alphabets and so on…\nWe're sort of getting into a cycle of competition.\nIt'd be better to nip it in the bud.\nWhy did we spend so much societal resources building up to tens of thousands of nuclear warheads?\nNow we've dialed it back to mere thousand nuclear warheads.\nIt's nice that we dialed it back, but why did we waste all that time and money?\nBiology seems very dual-use, right?\nThe mere fact that you, literally you, are making sequencing cheaper will just have this dual-use effect in a way that's not necessarily true for nuclear weapons.\nAnd we want that, right?\nWe want biotechnology to advance.\nIt's hard to pound nuclear weapons into ploughshares, as they say.\nI guess I am curious if there is some long-run vision, where… To give another example, in cybersecurity, as time has gone on, I think our systems are more secure today than they were in the past because we found vulnerabilities and we've come up with new encryption schemes and so forth.\nIs there such a plausible vision in biology or are we just stuck in a world where offense will be privileged so we'll just have to limit access to these tools and have better monitoring but there's not a more robust solution?\nOne of the things I advocated in 2004 is that we stop deluding ourselves into thinking that moratorium and voluntary signups to be good citizens is going to be sufficient.\nWe need to also have surveillance and consequences, and mechanisms for whistleblowers to make it easy for people to report things that they think are out of line.\nWe had essentially moratoria and disapproval for germline editing.\nNevertheless, somebody did it and a lot of people knew about it.\nThat was clearly a failure of the whole moratorium and voluntary and whistleblower components.\nIt worked for five years with only one defector.\nThat's quite impressive.\nOkay, half empty, half full, I'll give you that.\nBut all it takes is one for some of these scenarios.\nIt would have been nice if the whistleblowers could have saved him the three years in prison by getting an intervention.\nIt's not like anybody died.\nRight.\nThere are probably three healthy genetically-engineered children in the world now.\nThey’ll be teenagers soon.\nBut it was a good test run that shows a failure of the system.\nWe need to have better surveillance of all the things we don't want and consequences that are well-known.\nOver the last couple of decades we've had a million-fold decrease in the cost of sequencing DNA, a thousandfold in synthesis.\nWe have gene editing tools like CRISPR, massive parallel experiments through multiplex techniques that have come about.\nOf course much of this work has been led by your lab.\nDespite all of this, why is it the case that we don't have a huge Industrial Revolution, a huge burst of new drugs, or cures for Alzheimer's and cancer that have already come about?\nWhen you look at other trends in other fields, we have Moore's law and here's my iPhone.\nWhy don't we have something like that in biology yet?\nWe have something that's about the same speed, a little bit faster than Moore's Law in biology.\nIt's more recent, that’s one aspect of it.\nWe could stand on the shoulders of the electronics giants to go a little bit faster to catch up.\nI would say we do.\nWe have the biotech industry, which has used that exponential curve to get better.\nIt's also possible we're close to the big payoff is the other aspect, or the beginning of the big payoff.\nRight now we have miraculous things like cures for rare diseases.\nWe have vaccines.\nWe have a trillion dollars, probably, of various biotech related things if you go far enough apart.\nWe're on the verge of really combining electronics and biology more thoroughly, and AI and biotech.\nIt seems like we're on the same track as Moore's law, if not better.\nWhat exactly are we on the verge of?\nWhat does 2040 look like?\nWell with 2040 we're talking about only 15 years.\nWhich is maybe two cycles of FDA approval.\n2040 is post-AGI.\nIt's a long time.\nWell, I hope it's not post-AGI.\nI think we're rushing a little bit to get to AGI.\nThere's lots of cool things we can do with just super AI, but we need to be very cautious with AGI.\nAnyway we can get into that.\nI have questions for you there.\nWe are shortening the time of getting medical products approved still in a safe way.\nBut that's not going to completely change the exponential.\nIt might reduce it from 10 years down to… One year is our record so far for say COVID vaccines.\nMaybe that'll be 10 times shorter.\nMaybe that will multiply out a little bit.\nThe big thing is that all our designs will become better so there'll be fewer failures.\nThe cost per drug will drop.\nThere'll be things that we didn't classically consider drugs or instruments, some sort of hybrid thing.\nBut again that won't be completely shocking.\nIt's just going to be so much of it.\nThere's going to be lots of diversity of solutions.\nHow much more are we talking about?\nAre we going to have 10x the amount of drugs?\n100x?\nI'm not even sure it's going to make sense, but 100x would not be completely surprising.\nCombinations of drugs will be important, using them intelligently.\nThere'll be a lot more.\nSome drugs will affect everything, for example an age-related drug that could impact every disease.\nI'm not sure the number is going to matter so much as the quality and the impact and intersection, and software that helps physicians and regular citizens make decisions.\nWhat specifically is changing that's enabling this?\nIs it just existing cost curves continuing or is it some new technique or tool that will come about?\nThe cost curves are affected by new tools.\nIt's not just some automatic thing.\nThere was a big discontinuity between Sanger sequencing and nanopores and fluorescent next-gen sequencing.\nSometimes it's a merger of two things.\nClearly AI merging with protein design caused a step function.\nThese step functions get smoothed out into a smooth exponential, but there are lots of them.\nThe next set will probably be a merger of AI with other aspects of biology, like developmental biology.\nAfter that, the merger of developmental biology with manufacturing, conquering developmental biology.\nIn other words, it’d be actually knowing how to make any arbitrary shape given DNA as the programming material.\nThat would be a big thing.\nJust having more materials in general.\nAll the materials that we use in mechanical and electrical engineering should be made better by biotechnologies.\nWhy is that?\nWell in electronics, I wouldn't say Moore’s law is stopping, but think about what we would call the 1 nanometer process, which is supposed to come out in 2027 according to the roadmap.\nIt's not really 1 nanometer, it's more like 40 nanometers, center-to-center spacing, typically in two dimensions, maybe a little bit of three dimensions.\nBiology is already at 0.4 nanometer resolution and it is in three dimensions.\nDepending on how you count that third dimension, it could be a billion times higher density that biology is already at.\nWe just need a little more practice with dealing with the whole periodic table.\nEven electrical and mechanical engineering don't typically use the whole periodic table typically, especially not at the atomic level.\n\n\nBiology is just really good at doing atomic precision. So then what's the reason that over the last many decades we do have, not atomic but, close to atomic-level manufacturing with semiconductors? 40 nanometers. Right. It's quite small. It's a thousand times bigger than biology, linearly. But the progress we have made hasn't been related to biology so far.\n\nIt seems like we've made Moore's law happen. People in the 90s were saying ultimately we'd have these biomachines that are doing the computing. But it seems like we've just been using conventional manufacturing processes. What exactly is it that changes that allows us to use bio to make these things?\n\nA few things. One is the arrival of synthetic biology. We were already kind of doing synthetic biology before; we were doing recombinant DNA, a kind of genetic engineering. It was kind of in that direction. But synthetic biology really liberated us to think a little bit bigger. Even though it started kind of focused on E. coli and yeast, it enabled us to maybe think about new amino acids, for example. If you start using the full periodic table with the amino acids, or what amino acids can catalyze, that breaks one of the major barriers.\n\nOne of the major barriers between electrical and mechanical engineering and biology was the use of special materials, things that conduct electricity at the speed of light or conduct signals more generally. But there are definitely polymers that biology can make that will conduct at the speed of light. We could make a mixed neuronal system that has conventional neurons and processes that conduct at the speed of light. That would be interesting.\n\nSo I think that our ability to design proteins was particularly difficult. Designing nucleic acids was great. You want two things to bind to each other? You just dial it up using Watson-Crick rules. If you want to make a three-dimensional structure, it's actually the one kind of thing where morphology is dictated by fairly simple rules. It's not how developmental biology works. We still need to figure out how that works. But DNA origami, DNA nanostructures really work. But doing it for proteins was really, really hard until maybe eight years ago, something like that. I think we're just now getting used to it.\n\nThe use of chips for making DNA. You said that DNA synthesis has come down a thousandfold; it depends on who you talk to. When we came out with the first chip-based genes in a 2004 Nature paper, basically people dismissed it for about a decade. The only people that used it were collaborators and alumni. It wasn't even listed on the Moore's law curve for DNA synthesis, even though it was thousand times cheaper. It was just ignored. Now we have claims of 10^17 genes that you can make libraries of, that aren't randomized in the usual sense, where you just do error-prone PCR or spiked nucleotides. 10^17, that's a lot bigger than a thousandfold if it turns out to be practical.\n\nSpeaking of protein design, another thing you could have thought of in the 90s—People were writing about nanotechnology, Eric Drexler and so forth. Now we can go from a function that we want this tiny molecular machine to do, back to the sequence that can give it that function. Why isn't this resulting in some nanotech revolution, or will it eventually? Why didn't AlphaFold cause that?\n\nPart of it is that nanotechnology as originally… The source of the inspiration, Eric Drexler, he wanted to reinvent biology in a certain sense but it already existed. So you don't need to design a diamond replicator because you already have a DNA replicator. The question was, what was missing? What was motivating this reinvention of biology? It was materials. Biology is not that great with materials that are, say, superconductors, conductors, semiconductors, and light speed. But it's getting there. Rather than going the route of everything having to be based on first principle nanostructures, you can meet in the middle where biology can build things.\n\nOf course, when you go down to liquid nitrogen and colder temperatures, biology as we currently know it stops functioning. It's not to say that you can't have things moving in liquid nitrogen, you can. But that hasn't been explored and doesn't really need to be, because if biology can build things that can operate at low temperatures… Or maybe biology now, because you can make these big libraries of biology, maybe 10^17 in vitro, you can flip through them quickly and you can barcode them and you can… This is something that's never been done in electronics. I'm not saying you can't do it in electronics. But you haven't made a billion different kinds of electronic materials just in an afternoon, barcode them all and see who wins. But we do it all the time in biology now, at least since 2004 we have. So I think that's an opportunity. We use those libraries to make much superior materials and we might even finally get a room-temperature superconductor that way.\n\nFrom bio? It's possible, from libraries. We call it chemical / biochemical / exotic material libraries. The point is that they're libraries. They're essentially based in some sense on polymers, even though pieces of them don't necessarily have to be polymers.\n\nDo you have a prediction by when we'll see this materials science revolution? What is standing between now and that? Because we've got AlphaFold right now. So what is the thing that we need? Do we need more data?\n\nAlphaFold is very nice, but it's only part of it. There are large language models that are different from AlphaFold. To give an example, with AlphaFold—last time I checked anyway—if you substitute an alanine for a serine in a serine protease, it will have exactly the right fold. It will be precise to a fraction of Angstrom overall average. But it won't function. It just won't function. That's where you need either extraordinary precision or just knowledge of what happens evolutionarily, or happens in experiments, to say that, \"No, alanine won't work. Okay?\" So I think there's all kinds of combinations of AI tools that can give you deeper insight into that.\n\nIf AlphaFold predicting the structure doesn't tell you whether the thing will actually function, then what is needed before I can say, \"I want a nanomachine that does X thing, or I want a material that does that Y thing, and I can just get that\"?\n\nThe way that it's working now—which will get us a long way, won't get us the whole way—is we have something that kind of works and we make libraries inspired by that. We make variations on it and then whichever of those variations work, we make variations on that. We can just keep going. It's kind of like the way evolution worked, except now we can do it at incredibly high speeds. In principle, evolution might incorporate a few base pair changes in a million years. Now we can make billions of changes in an afternoon. It's all guided in such a way that you get rid of the wastefulness of having a bunch of neutral mutations and a bunch of lethal mutations. You can have things that are quasi-neutral but likely to be game-changing and have more of a focus on those.\n\nAnother thing that's been missing. None of the AI protein design tools that I know of are particularly good at it yet but as we speak, we're trying to improve it, is nonstandard amino acids. Because a lot of these tools depend on adding libraries of 3D structures, which use 20 amino acids, and large language models where you line up all the sequences of 20 amino acids. We have very little experience with extra ones. But there's a revolution going on in generating nonstandard amino acids, where the amino acids can either have as part covalent part of them, or as easily liganded, all the stable elements in the entire periodic table. Each of those we’ll have to blend in and train our models on. But as soon as that comes in then we're going to have a whole series of new materials very quickly.\n\nUltimately, the determination of the functionality of your library is a kind of computer. You use AI to design the library optimally. You avoid things that are really neutral and really seriously damaged. But the stuff in the middle, you actually play it out, not in a simulation, but in real life. But it's so inexpensive and it's so fast and it's so exact. It's a hundred percent precision, because you're not simulating. You're not making assumptions. You're not going from quantum electrodynamics, which is an assumption, to quantum mechanics, which is an assumption to molecular mechanics, which are full of assumptions. You're really doing the real thing. So you're doing a kind of natural computing. Then you can take that data and harvest it in various ways very efficiently, pump it back into the more conventional AI, and do another round of it.\n\nIf I listen to these words, it seems like I should be expecting the world to physically look a lot different. But then why are we only getting a couple more drugs by 2040?\n\nWell, I didn't mean to stop there. I knew the conversation would continue. I'm not pinning down a particular year either, but this is poised to go pretty quickly. There are very few practitioners, which is the thing that will stop it for a while. Materials actually should go faster though, because they don't require quite as much regulatory approval. It's one of these things where when you get the right idea, it's not hard to recruit people. For example, when Feng Zhang and my labs brought out CRISPR, we each got 10,000 requests in the next two months for people that wanted to duplicate the system. That's what I hope will happen with the nonstandard amino acids and using AI for protein design and making new materials. Hopefully that will recruit tens of thousands of people overnight.\n\nAre you more excited about AI which thinks in protein space, or capsid space, just predicting some biological or DNA sequences? Or are you more optimistic about LLMs just trained on language, which can write in English and tell you, \"Here's the experiment you should run\" in English. Which of those two approaches, or is it some combination, when you think about AI and bio is more promising?\n\nI'm much more excited about scientific AI than I am about language AI. With languages, we're in pretty good shape already. What worries me is that to get to the next level of language requires AGI or ASI. That's very dangerous. I don't think we have quite figured out how to handle that. There's a lot of safety organizations and a lot of safety rules and so forth. What typically happens when there's an intense competition is those safety rules get undermined and pushed aside. Even if they weren't, I don't think we understand our own ethics well enough to educate a completely foreign type of intelligence. We barely know how to pass it onto the next generation of humans. So we need time to sort that out. There's no rush. This is a completely artificial emergency. This is not like COVID-19, where millions of people were dying if we delayed the science. This is something where, if there ever is a crisis, it's because we created it, it's not because we're trying to solve it. So I think we need to go very slowly on AGI and ASI, and double down on slightly narrower scientific goals. With even that, we need to be very cautious. We need to have kind of an international consensus on what constitutes safe AI.\n\nSuppose we did build safe superintelligence. How much would that speed up bio progress? There's a million George Churches in data centers just thinking all the time, is it a 10x speed-up?\n\nI think it would slow it down. I think it would eliminate it, because the first thing it would conclude is biology is not relevant to me because I'm not made out of biology. Suppose you could get them to care about it. There's a million copies of you in a data center. How much faster is bio progress? They can't run experiments directly. They're just in data centers. They can just say stuff and think stuff. I don't think we have anything close to the assurance that we need that that would be safe. But let's put safety aside for a moment. It's not only hard to calculate the bads, it's hard to calculate the goods. It could be a complete game changer. But on the other hand, it's like if we said we could get instantaneous transport all over the Earth. Well, we could say, \"Yes, that could be a game changer.\" But do we really need it? Is that really important? Maybe it'd be more interesting to just have Zoom calls that are better, or we can just learn how to get everything we want in our kitchen and we don't need to travel anymore. So be careful what you ask for. You could tip our priorities towards something that we really don't care about, that we shouldn’t care about, or we might wish we didn’t care about.\n\nBut I'm curious, you've still got to run the experiments, you still need these other things. So does that bottleneck the impact of the millionth copy of you or do you still get some speed up? Basically, how much faster can biology go if there are just more smart people thinking, which is a sort of proxy for what AI might do?\n\nThese are great questions and I don't want to misrepresent that I know the answers. But it's like the question of, \"If you have nine women, can you do pregnancy in one month?\" No, not at present. But you're working on that, right? No, but the same thing is that there may be certain things that don't take a lot of people. We just don't know. We don't have that much experience with having thousands of Einstein-type levels of creativity and intelligence simultaneously in a generation. In fact, it's probable that we're all capable of being a bit more efficient if we don't have distractions of mental illness, or taking care of other people. Now, taking care of other people may be a very good thing. Maybe if we have no one to take care of, there\n\n\nI'll be something bad that happens to us socially.\nSo these things are very complicated and hard to predict.\nI think right now, the baby step, or actually the pretty big baby step, is to eliminate diseases or at least make it possible for people to eliminate their own diseases as they see fit.\nYou've worked on brain organoids and brain connectome and so forth.\nHow has that work shifted your view on fundamentally how complex intelligence is?\nAre you more bullish on AI because you realized the organoids are not that complicated, or rather very little information is required to describe how to grow them?\nOr are you like, \"No, this is actually much more gnarly than I realized.\"\nI always felt it was very gnarly.\nI also felt that it was something that we could engineer.\nCertainly we have made a lot of progress at the broken end of the spectrum where the brain is severely challenged relative to average.\nThere are a huge fraction of genetic diseases that have as one of their consequences the child being developmentally delayed to such an extent that it's lethal or causes a lifetime deficit.\nWe know the genes involved and we know how to do genetic counseling in some cases, gene therapy and other therapies to deal with it.\nAt the other end, we have reduction of cognitive decline by cognitive enhancement, which is showing some promise.\nBut again, that's kind of like this early stage severe impediment to cognition having a late stage component.\nBut what about, how much information does it take to encode a brain?\nI'm not sure that much less genome is required than if you just wanted to just make a brain, because the brain is totally entangled with the body.\nYou have 10^11 neurons, 10^14 synapses.\nIf you wanted to reproduce a particular brain, it's speculative as to whether it would be easier to do that by making a copy of it in silico, in some kind of inorganic matrix, or making a copy of it.\nBoth of those are going to be hard.\nI would say that if you wanted to make a copy of a complicated book, it would be easier to take photographs of each of the pages than to completely translate it into another language—trying to get all the nuances of the poetry and so forth—if your goal is just to replicate it.\nThe same thing might be true of the brain.\nBut replicating a brain probably involves a lot more information than synthesizing it.\nJust to define this, 10^14 synapses is going to take a lot more bytes than the genome, which is billions rather than 10^14.\nBut there might be reasons that you want to replicate a particular brain configuration rather than just make another animal that starts from scratch as an infant.\nGoing back to the engineering stuff, often people will argue, \"Look, you have this existence proof that E. coli can duplicate every 30 minutes.\nInsects can duplicate really fast as well.\nBut then with our ability to manufacture stuff with human engineering, we can do things that nothing in biology can do, like radio communication or fission power or jet engines.\"\nHow plausible to you is the idea that we could have biobots which can duplicate at the speed of insects—there could be trillions of them running around—but they also can have access to jet engines and radio communication and so forth?\nAre those two things compatible?\nCertain things seem incompatible.\nLike the temperature of a fission reactor isn’t obviously compatible.\nBut it is a possibility that a biological system can make other things.\nFor example, it can make a nest.\nA bird can make a nest.\nYou consider the whole nest as part of the replication cycle of the bird.\nSo you can say the biological thing that replicates at a 30 minute doubling time could make a nuclear reactor.\nThat would be its nest but you need to expand its range of materials.\nIn a certain sense, we do this already.\nHumans are a biological thing that replicates not in 30 minutes, but in 20 years or less.\nIs that fundamentally limiting us?\nYeah, probably it is.\nBut it's amazing to think about.\nWhat if you could take a cornfield or a nuclear reactor, and suddenly 30 minutes later you've got two of them, then four of them, and eight of them.\nThat's quite an interesting concept.\nI teach a course called How to Grow (Almost) Anything.\nI work with Neil Gershenfeld at MIT who has a course called How to Make Almost Anything.\nWe're trying to meet in the middle where his mechanical electrical engineering will meet with our biological.\nIn fact, neither of us can make or grow almost anything because there's all kinds of little gaps and things that are very hard to make in a small lab.\nThere are things all over the world that depend on multi-billion dollar fabs to make things.\nBut we're eating away at it.\nMaybe a smaller baby step than making a nuclear reactor is making a phone.\nYou said radio communication.\nIt should be a small challenge goal for the synthetic biology community, maybe iGEM or something: make bacteria make a radio.\nActually Joe Davis is an artist—he’s been affiliated with my lab and before that, Alex Rich's lab—and he did make a bacterial radio but it was kind of more on the art end than on the science end.\nBut I think that would be a good goal.\nWhat would it take to do whole genome engineering to such a level that for even a phenotype which doesn't exist in the existing pool of human variation, you could manifest it because your understanding is so high.\nFor example, if I wanted wings.\nIs the bottleneck our understanding?\nIs the bottleneck our ability to make that many changes to my genome?\nPart of this has to do with just learning the rules of developmental biology, like I said.\nWe can determine morphology at the molecular level now: proteins, nucleic acids.\nDetermining at the cellular multicellular level, there's a lot more things you can do and a lot faster.\nBut we don't know the language yet.\nI think we're on the cusp of getting the tools to do that, like the transcription factor I was talking about earlier, harnessing migration, gradients of diffusion factors, chemotaxis and so forth.\nThat's one thing we need, but there's a bunch of things we need, really.\nWhat discovery in biology—so not in astronomy or some other field—would make you convinced that life on Earth is the only life in the galaxy?\nConversely, what might convince you that no, it must have arisen independently thousands of times in this galaxy?\nOh, I see what you're getting at.\nAstronomy might be that we would detect radio signals or light signals.\nWith biology, the kind of evidence would be that you show in a laboratory using prebiotic conditions a really simple way to get life.\nIt's harder to prove the negative because we don't know all the possible prebiotic conditions.\nProbably the number was vast.\nYou have 10^20 liters of water at various different salinities and drying up on the ocean and the sun and the lightning and all this stuff.\nI think if you showed, reconstructed in the lab, a very simple pathway from inorganics, cyanide derivatives and reduced compounds, all the way up to some cellular replicating structure, that might lead us to believe that at least life exists.\nNow that there are other parts of the Drake equation that might kick in.\nMaybe it's hard to get intelligent life because intelligence isn't necessarily in your best interest.\nAnd if you get intelligence life, it's hard to maintain that without societal collapse or without robotics taking over and then killing themselves.\nThat's hard to do experiments on.\nBut to your question, an experiment that showed maybe multiple different ways of getting to a living system from non-living systems spontaneously would be interesting.\nAgain, I'm not sure.\nIt'd be very hard to prove the negative.\nBetween intelligent life and some sort of primordial RNA thing, what is the step at which, if there is any, you say there's a less than 50% chance something like at this level exists elsewhere in the Milky Way?\nThese are very challenging problems.\nI'm not even sure we would be able to say within five orders of magnitude, much less 50%.\nI think it's more likely to come from exploration than it is going to be from simulation.\nThe sad truth is that almost none of the missions that we've sent outside of Earth have actually looked for life.\nThey've had components that could have looked for life.\nA sad number of those had not enough components that could look for life.\nThe ones that could look for life were not really looking for it.\nWhen we get positive results, we dismiss them as happened with Pioneer.\nI think if we just start looking at the geysers that are coming out of various moons of Jupiter and Saturn, there's so much water.\nThere's 50 times more water, liquid water, not frozen but liquid water, in our solar system than on Earth.\nDoesn't that seem likely that some of that would have been a good breeding ground?\nIt could be that we need sunny shores where you have a lot of dry land right next to water.\nMaybe these are just giant oceans that are surrounded by ice and maybe that's not an ideal.\nIn any case, we need to look at those fountains to see what's popping up.\nThat's a high priority.\nThe same thing goes for water on Mars.\nThat's maybe even more accessible.\nBut until we've exhausted those, those are probably the easiest.\nThey're hard.\nWe’re still talking about multibillion dollar experiments, but I think they're a little more convincing.\nAgain, it'll be hard to prove the negative.\nIf we find this negative on everything in the solar system, there's so much more diversity out there that could have done it.\nIf in a thousand years we're still using DNA and RNA and proteins for top-end manufacturing, the frontiers of engineering, how surprised would you be?\nWould you think, \"Oh, that makes sense.\nEvolution designed these systems for billions of years.\"\nOr would you think, \"Oh, it's surprising that these ended up being the systems.\nWhatever evolution found just happened to be the best way to manufacture or to store information\"?\nI don't think I'd be surprised either way.\nI can imagine it going either way.\nI can imagine making truly amazing materials using proteins as the catalysts, or maybe in some cases as a scaffold as well as catalysts.\nOne thing that's probably already happening, we don't have to go a thousand years out, is that the number of amino acids is going up.\nIt's going up radically from 20.\nI think pretty soon we'll have a system where we can have 34 new non standard amino acids being used simultaneously with the standard ones in a E. coli cell.\n34 plus 20 is a lot bigger than 20.\nI don't think we necessarily need more than four nucleic acid components.\nCertainly there are plenty of modified ones.\nThere's a bunch of alternative base pairs, some of which don't even involve hydrogen bonds.\nSo we could have more.\nBut I think the main thing is this information storage—whether it's bits, digital binary—it’s just zeros and ones.\nThat works pretty well for 99% of what we do electronically.\nHaving four is better than two maybe, but do we really need six?\nI don't know.\nI wouldn't be surprised.\nAnother possibility is if we changed the backbone of DNA.\nMaybe we keep the ACGT, but make it out of peptides now, a little bit smaller, a little bit more compatible.\nI don't know.\nIt could be part of the new amino acid collection.\nThere'll be more.\nThese are just things that my primitive 21st-century brain is coming up with.\nA thousand years from now, it'll be a whole new millennium.\nIt makes sense why evolution wouldn't have discovered radio technology.\nBut things like more than 20 amino acids or these different bases so that you can store more than 2 bits per base pair or for example, the codon remapping scheme, this redundancy, which it seems like based on your work there was this extra information you could have used for other things.\nIs there some explanation for why 4 billion years of evolution didn't already give living organisms these capabilities?\nI think that evolution has a tendency to go with what works.\nThe investment in making a whole new base pair would have been high.\nWe haven't even articulated what the return on investment would be.\nWhat do you get from that?\nWe have made systems, like Floyd Romesberg and others, where you have replication and transcription and translation with a new base pair.\nBut it hasn't been clearly articulated what that gets you, even in technological society.\nIn technology you can jump to things where all the intermediates aren't incrementally useful.\nBut evolution, as far as we know, is generally limited to… You have to justify every change, like some bureaucracy, \"If you're going to put this sidewalk in, you have to justify that before you build a city.\"\nWe've talked about many different technologies you worked on or are working on right now, from gene editing to de-extinction to age reversal.\nWhat is an underhyped technology in your research portfolio which you think more people should be talking about but gets glossed over?\nIt's hard to say because as soon as you say it, it becomes hyped.\nIf I've ever been asked this question before, it's too late.\nOne thing I think is very ripe and is very well-understood in a certain sense but is nevertheless ignored… The previous example I would have chosen was making genes out of arrays.\nArrays were typically used for analytic, quantitating RNA, or something like that, the original Affymetrix-type arrays.\nBut we turned them into gene arrays and people just weren't using it.\nIt was in Nature.\nIt was hidden in plain sight.\nBut anyway it was somehow underhyped.\nWhat I would say is genetic counseling is underhyped.\nIt is clearly competitive with gene therapy in a certain sense, clearly not for people that are already born but for people in the future, not even distant future but in the next couple of years.\nWe've got a chance of diagnosing them or diagnosing the potential parents and dodging… This has been in practice since 1985 in Dor Yeshorim, a perfectly reasonable community response to it.\nIt eliminated or greatly reduced all sorts of very\n\n\nserious inherited diseases.\nSometimes, depending on how it's presented, it’s dismissed as eugenics.\nRarely have I heard Dor Yeshorim described that way, and rightly so.\nWhat they're doing is standard medicine, whether you cure these kids as soon as they are newborns or whether you counsel the parents so the same disease is missing.\nThe problem with eugenics was that it was forced.\nThe government forced it on people.\nIt wasn't that it enabled people to make a choice.\nIt's that it removed the choice from the people.\nThat was what was wrong, and that's the confusion.\nBut I don't think that's the explanation for why this is underhyped.\nI think it's because when people are dating, they're not thinking about reproduction necessarily.\nAnd when they're thinking about reproduction, they're not necessarily thinking about serious genetic diseases because they're rare.\nI think it's our difficulty with dealing with rare things.\nThere was great resistance to seat belts because less than 1% of people died in automobile accidents or even got hurt.\nThere was great resistance to stopping smoking.\nIt's hard even for us to imagine how great the resistance was for seat belts and smoking.\nBut eventually we got over it.\nI think this is a similar thing.\nOnly 3% of children are severely affected by genetic diseases, and they feel like, \"I'm not that unlucky. I'm in the 97%.\"\nIf those were your odds of winning at the horse races or at the casino, you'd take them.\n97% of winning, good.\nBut when a child's future is at risk, I think that's not the right solution.\nThe other thing is that I think it has to do with the trolley problem.\nIf you don't influence it, it's not your fault.\nBut actually everything is your fault.\nNot doing something is a decision.\nSo I think it's like, \"If I just don't do anything and they come out damaged, it's not my fault,\" but it is.\nDavid Reich was talking about how in India—especially because of the long-running history of caste and endogamous coupling—there have been these small subpopulations that have high amounts of recessive diseases.\nSo there, it's an especially valuable intervention.\nI know what you're saying, and what David is saying, but I think it's a dangerous dichotomy.\nThere are lots of, not just in India but all over the world… In fact, we all went through a bottleneck.\nBut that changes the rate from say 3% to 6%.\nBut the point is 3% is still unacceptable.\nIt's just a tragic loss, not only of the human life directly affected, but the whole family.\nVery often one or both parents have to quit their job and spend full-time caregiving and fundraising, because these are very expensive diseases as well.\nWe need to be careful not to stigmatize as well.\nSo if a bunch of families get fixed, we shouldn't point a finger at the ones that are unwilling to get fixed because that's their choice.\nBut I think as word spreads and you see the positive outcomes, I think it will be seen as one of the simplest bits of medicine ever.\nIt's very inexpensive.\nIn fact, it's less than zero because you spend a hundred dollars per genome.\nIt'll probably be less soon.\nYou get the whole thing analyzed.\nCompare that to millions of dollars that will be lost in opportunity costs and them not being part of the workforce, taking care of them, and so forth.\nSo the return on investment is tremendous.\nIt's at least a tenfold return on investment.\nIt's a no-brainer from a public health standpoint.\nWe should be able to pay for this through the National Health Service in England, through insurance companies in the United States.\nIt turns the insurance companies from being the bad guys snooping in on your personal life and then raising your rates to them giving you this free information, and you can do with it as you wish.\nIf you take the advice, then you save them millions of dollars.\nDo you think genetic counseling is a more important intervention, or even in the future will continue to have a bigger impact, than even gene therapy for these monogenic disorders?\nAbsolutely, I've actually counseled my gene therapy companies that they should be investing in very common diseases because rare diseases have this genetic counseling solution, with the exception of spontaneous mutations and dominance, which probably are IVF clinic type solutions rather than… But the rare recessives can be handled at matchmaking and at every level.\nAnyway, I counseled my genetic therapy companies that they should invest in common diseases like age-related diseases and infectious diseases.\nIn fact, the COVID vaccine was formulated as a gene therapy, and the cost was in the $20 per dose range.\n6 billion people benefited from it, or 6 billion people took it, and it was proven over the whole population.\nSo I think that's the more appropriate usage of gene therapy.\nFor practical reasons, getting FDA approval and so forth, you might go for the rare diseases, and that's perfectly fine.\nBut I think the cost effectiveness… The sweet spot for gene therapy is for age-related diseases, and the sweet spot for rare diseases is genetic counseling.\nAlright, some final questions to close us off.\n20 years from now, if there's some scenario in which we all look back and say, \"You know what?\nI think on net it was a good thing that the NSF and the NIH and all these budgets were blown up and got DOGE’d and so forth…\"\nI'm not saying you think this is likely, but suppose there ends up being a positive story told in retrospect.\nWhat might it be?\nWould it have to maybe come up with a different funding structure?\nBasically, what is the best-case scenario if this post-war system of basic research is upended?\nI have to preface this.\nWhen scientists answer a question and explore possibilities, it doesn't mean they're advocating it.\nIn the past, people have asked me off-the-wall questions about Neanderthals, for example, and then it was described as if I was enthusiastic about it.\nI’m not enthusiastic about NIH and NSF budgets being cut.\nYou could say that it forces us to think more seriously about philanthropy and industrial-sponsored research.\nThat could be a positive thing.\nIt could be that that makes us listen more carefully to what society actually needs rather than doing basic research.\nI'm a big proponent of basic research, but also maybe I'm more than average at connecting the basic research to societal needs from the get-go.\nI don't think it actually interferes with basic research to think and act on societal needs at the same time.\nThat could be a positive.\nIt could be that it creates another nation-state that now is the dominant force.\nLike China could now become the next empire after the US.\nIs this a positive story?\nIt could be for China.\nYou didn't specify who it's a positive story for.\nThe US displaced Britain, which displaced Spain and Portugal.\nIt keeps moving.\nFresh blood is sometimes a good thing.\nAgain, I preface this by saying I'm not advocating this.\nLet's see, what else could go well?\nThere are just certain things that society is fairly good at doing collectively that we're not good at doing individually.\nBuilding roads, schools, and science are examples of that.\nIt doesn't mean we couldn't learn how to do that.\nTo some extent, when you build a gated community, a lot of that is done with private funding.\nIt's possible we could figure out how to build roads and schools and just about everything.\nIt means we're going to run into some kind of hypercapitalism.\nThat might mean that there's all kinds of pathologies that come along with that.\nWhat is it about the nature of your work, maybe biology more generally, that makes it possible for one lab to be behind so many advancements?\nI don't think there's an analogous thing in computer science—which is a field I'm more familiar with—where you could go to one academic lab and then 100 different companies have been formed out of it, including the ones that are most exciting and doing a bunch of groundbreaking work.\nIs it something about the nature of your academic lab?\nIs it something about the nature of biology research?\nWhat explains this pattern?\nFirst of all, thank you for being so generous in your evaluation.\nMaybe take it with a grain of salt.\nBut I think that what it is is being in the right place at the right time.\nBoston is a unique culture.\nIt attracts some of the best and brightest students and postdocs automatically.\nIt is dense enough.\nSometimes people want to spread the wealth out evenly all over the universe or the planet.\nThere are advantages to having it clustered.\nSpouses can find other jobs in the same field.\nHaving a concentration of biotech and pharma and MIT and Harvard and BU and so forth, all in one pretty walkable distance, not spread out all along the East or West coast, but actually in a walkable city is one thing.\nThat's the starting point.\nAnd then a lab that chooses from an early stage to keep this dynamic between basic science and societal needs going at all costs, causing great trauma when the lab starts, but then getting a couple of wins.\nIt starts building up a positive feedback loop, just like the building of Boston was a positive feedback loop.\nThe more Harvards and MITs and high-tech startups, then pharma… So you get a couple of wins in the literature, and people start coming that are a whole other level up.\nMaybe they're already aiming for entrepreneurship while before they weren't.\nAnyway, it evolves in a way that you can't just jump-start from scratch.\nYou couldn't just suddenly create Harvard and MIT in the middle of the desert and suddenly create a lab that is taking these kinds of risks early in a career.\nAlso the timing is good because the exponential is starting to show up.\nThe exponential is pretty much the same in the beginning of the hockey stick and at the end of the hockey stick, but you don't notice it until it gets going.\nThat’s what's happening in computing, AI, and biotech.\nThey're all peaking at this point.\nSo whichever lab happened to already have that positive feedback loop going with the academic to industry technology transfer would asymmetrically benefit from that exponential.\nTo some extent with the exponential, you can really look like you're very productive when really you're just kind of sliding downhill.\nIt's like, \"Yeah, look at how productive I am.\nI just jumped out of a plane and am accelerating steadily.\"\nYesterday I had dinner with a bunch of biotech founders.\nI mentioned that I was going to interview you tomorrow.\nSomebody asked, \"Wait, how many of the people here have worked in George Church's lab at some point or worked with him at some point?\"\nI think 70% or 80% of the people raised their hand.\nOne of the people suggested, \"Oh, you should ask him, how does he spot talent?\"\nBecause it is the case that many of the people who are building these leading companies or doing groundbreaking research have been recruited by you, have worked in your lab.\nSo how do you spot talent?\nWell, I'm glad you framed it as spotting talent.\nI've heard at least one meme that all you have to do is show up and you'll get into my lab, which is definitely not true.\nFirst of all, there's a lot of self-selection.\nFrankly, we're an acquired taste.\nTechnology development is not at all the same skill set as regular biology where you pick a gene, you pick a disease, you pick a phenomenon, and you hammer away at it for your whole life.\nThis is more like you make a library where you have a million members of the library that are going to fail, and maybe one or two will succeed.\nIt’s a very different attitude.\nIt's much more engineering, but it's even different from most engineering.\nEngineering doesn't usually use libraries that way, millions and billions of components that are non-random, but many of them will fail.\nSo the question was selection criteria.\nThere's self-selection.\nThe next thing is, in the interview, I typically tell them that I'm looking for people that are nice.\nI'm not necessarily looking for geniuses.\nWe end up with a lot of geniuses.\nThat's wonderful.\nBut nice, I think, is highly predictive of how well you will do in the lab and afterwards.\nAs a consequence, I think we have a kind of international set of alumni that are quite nice to each other even though they're supposedly in cutthroat fields.\nAnd I think they're nice to other people as well.\nSo nice is one criteria.\nMultidisciplinarity.\nIt's hard to build a multidisciplinary team from disciplinarians.\nIf you have two people that each know two languages or two skills, even if they don't have anything in common, they have shown that they can learn a new skill, and then they'll each add the skill that connects them.\nThat's the third thing.\nThose are the three main things I would say.\nFinal question.\nGiven the fast pace of AI progress—your point taken, that we should be cautious of this technology, but by default I expect it to go quite fast and there not being some sort of global moratorium on AI progress… Given that's the case, what is the vision?\nWe're going to very plausibly have a world with genuine AGI within the next 20 years.\nWhat is the vision for biology given that fact?\nIf AI were 100 years away, we could say we've got this research we're doing with the brain or with gene therapies and so forth, which might help us cope or might help us stay on the same page.\nGiven how fast AI is happening, what is the vision for this bio-AI co-evolution or whatever it might look like?\nIf we handle the safety issues, and that has to be a top priority, then we're probably going to have almost perfect health.\nWhy wouldn't we?\nIt's going to go so fast.\nIt's going to go pretty fast with just regular AI without AGI.\nBut if you add to it AGI… It'll also be a positive feedback loop, because the more people that get fixed or get access to good healthcare, the more people will be helping prompt the AI, if that's necessary.\nI think it probably will be.\nThe more hybrid systems we\n\n\nI'll have of people and machines working together in harmony in this very positive scenario.\nWell, that's a good vision to end on.\nGeorge, thank you so much for coming on.\nThank you.\n",

      "summary": "George Church, a pioneer in synthetic biology, shares his insights on the rapid advancements in biotech. He envisions a future where aging is reversed, extinct species are revived, and biobots combine biological and human engineering. Church highlights the potential of gene editing, AI, and other technologies to achieve these breakthroughs. However, he also raises concerns about the weaponization of mirror life and the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of these powerful technologies. The conversation covers topics from the possibility of extending human lifespan to the search for extraterrestrial life and the impact of AI on scientific progress.",

    "cleanText": "Today I'm interviewing Arthur Kroeber, the founder of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research consultancy focused on China, and the author of China’s Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know. A friend recommended it to me while I was in China. It’s been the most valuable and useful resource I've found on how China works. Arthur, thanks for coming on the podcast and taking the time to chat with me.\n\nIt's great to be here, thanks.\n\nFirst question. What really is the problem if China becomes as wealthy as America, or if its economy grows as big, or even bigger than America’s? I know it may not be your perspective to be a China hawk, but I’ve never really understood why this is a problem in the first place.\n\nIt's a very good question. There's a lot of criticism of China from the standpoint of, okay, you're trying to get rich, that's fine. But you're basically trying to get rich on the backs of everyone else in the world by running this gigantic manufacturing export machine, where it seems like the Chinese ambition is to produce all the manufactured goods in the world, for everyone, run an enormous trade surplus, which means they are depending on the rest of the world’s buying power to support them. People say this model is not fair, not sustainable, and not a stable way to participate in the global economy. The real question isn’t just if China gets rich, but how it gets rich. Does it get rich by operating under the same rules as everyone else and having a market other people can participate in? Or does it get rich by making it impossible for anyone else in the world to have the kind of production structure that they want to have, and relying entirely on these ever-growing trade surpluses?\n\nIn principle, from a welfare standpoint, I think it would be great if China became as rich as America. But that’s likely to have difficult and destabilizing political consequences, because the Chinese political system is vastly different from that of the US and other major industrialized countries.\n\nOn the trade surplus point, to the extent that it is made possible by the government involvement in industry… It’s actually not even clear to me that that's the case. If you have high savings and not enough investment domestically, the accounting identities are such that you will have a trade surplus. But suppose that's even the case. On paper, it just seems like what is happening is that the Chinese taxpayer, the Chinese saver, is subsidizing foreign importers. On paper, it just seems like we're getting a good deal. I'm sure some people are upset about this, specifically people who manufacture outside of China. But it's certainly not something obviously insidious.\n\nSo it seems like if it wasn't for this, there'd be some other reason that China can't grow as wealthy as us. I am playing a little bit of a devil's advocate here. But I don't really understand why this is such a big issue that there needs to be very powerful competition about it.\n\nThere are a couple of things beneath that. One is the systemic political difference is really important. The US self identity is that it is the leader of democracies around the world. We are very invested, at least for now in our democratic system. We'll see how that evolves over the next two or three years. There's some question marks around that, but historically that's been a really huge part of the US identity. Basically the morality play of World War II and the Cold War—which have really been the crucible in which US foreign policy has been formed—is that you had an alliance of democracies that fought back first against fascism, then against communism. They won. The result was that you created a world where most major countries were democratic. They operated on market economic systems. We were heading towards a world of convergence of systems where everyone essentially playing by the same rules. China really gets in the way of that narrative because it's this incredibly successful authoritarian system where the authority still calls itself communist. US elites have never, to this day, really gotten comfortable with the idea that the Chinese political system is legitimate. As long as you have that underlying problem, it's going to be very difficult to erase these difficulties.\n\nOn the economic side, I think it is a problem, the way that China has chosen to organize its economy. In a strictly financial sense, the rest of the world comes out ahead in the sense that China is willing to subsidize a lot of low cost production. The rest of the world gets a lot of cheap goods and the overall welfare of the world improves a lot. I think that's clearly true. But if you look at what has happened to the US politically over the last 20 years, there are a lot of flies in that ointment. The fly is that it is important for large countries to be able to maintain a diversified production structure and maintain social cohesion. If you lose the capacity to run a manufacturing economy that employs large numbers of people, there's a lot of disruptions that come as a result of that. The purely financialized economy that we had growing up in the United States in the early 2000s as a result of this bargain with China wound up being pretty bad for the social compact. So there is a legitimate question about how you integrate China's growing power, wealth, industrial might, into the world in a way that societies around the world can tolerate. It's a legitimately difficult problem.\n\nI think a lot of the problems have to do not with China but with US domestic policy. A lot of what's going on right now is scapegoating of China as a way of diverting attention from decisions that need to be made domestically about income redistribution and macroeconomic policy and so forth. But there is also a legitimate question to be made about how China now accounts for 20% of the global economy, probably larger in the future, and a third of the global manufacturing economy. There has to be an agreed set of rules about how it interacts with the rest of the world so that everyone feels that they are benefiting, not just in financial terms. We don't really have that agreement now.\n\nTwo points. On the political system, I wonder if we've learned a bad example from World War II and the Cold War, which is that great power conflict culminates in the other party totally collapsing. I think that was actually necessary, obviously, for Hitler and even for the Soviet Union. I think they were evil regimes. I think China today is an evil regime in a way, but it's just not in the same tier as Stalin or Hitler. So the end state for any great power competition for America… History is long, there will be more than just these next few decades. It cannot be that if there's a different political system that it has to collapse the way that the Soviet Union collapsed or that Hitler collapsed.\n\nThe first thing to note here is that this could be true of any country. I think people conflate these two arguments. Whereas it's worth noticing that if Australia was producing everything the world consumed and had an economy the size of America's, these arguments should apply to them as well. I don't think people have the sense of if Australia were producing a bunch of stuff for us, we would need to form a coalition against them and have this adversarial attitude. But suppose we did. There's a question of, “How could you prevent this dislocation and is it Australia's fault?” The analogy is breaking down.\n\nLet me just go back to China. So there's low value-added manufacturing where labor cost is a big fraction of cost. That kind of stuff was shipped off to China. But if it wasn't for China, there's many other countries in the world that have much lower labor costs than the US. If it wasn't for China, it'd be like Vietnam or Bangladesh or something. Then there's high tech manufacturing. There I haven't crunched the numbers, but if I were to guess, I don't think with TSMC's leading-edge 5 nanometer wafer, I doubt very little of what it costs to make that is the process engineers themselves. That is just a question of, “Can your country produce it?”\n\nThere's a few different questions in there, so let me break that down. The first thing that you alluded to there. Essentially, is a Cold War the right framing for whatever this conflict is with China? My answer to that is absolutely not. You can address that question both empirically and conceptually. Empirically, if you just look at patterns of trade and investment during the Cold War, the Soviet Union never accounted for more than about 1% of US trade and investment flows were basically non-existent. China at its peak about 10 years ago accounted for 17% of US trade, about the same amount as Japan did in the late 80s and early 90s. That number has come down a little bit on the surface. But when you take account of stuff from China coming in through third countries and so forth, basically that remains the same. If you talk about investment flows, there's $600 billion or more of US corporate investment in China. That generates huge amounts of sales, much larger than US exports to China. The integration of the two economies is just extraordinary. There's basically no precedent for it at any point in economic history. It is just a completely different order of magnitude to what was going on during the Cold War. So one question would be, “Okay, if you really want a Cold War, does that mean that what you want to do is you want to reduce those trade and investment flows back down to essentially zero? If so, how do you do that?” That's a very difficult problem.\n\nYou got at the more core conceptual issue, which is, how does this end? This does not end by China going away or turning into something completely different. It's too big. It is too successful. The economic model is successful on its own terms. It has a lot of problems, but it's fundamentally successful. It is deeply integrated with the entire global economy in ways that are beneficial for China and beneficial for most of the other countries in the world. Everyone has some sort of a stake in China continuing to succeed. This is just not going to go away.\n\nThere’s another sense in which it's not going to go away. Let's say you could wave a magic wand and make the CCP disappear tomorrow and replace it with something else. What would that something else look like? If that something else were to be successful at governing China, it would almost certainly share many of the characteristics of the Chinese Communist Party. It would have a strong determination for China to be an independent geopolitical actor, taking care of its own security with a very strong military so that it could defend itself against all of its real and perceived security threats. It would be committed—as every Chinese government since the mid 19th century has been—to maximizing the rate of technological progress and making sure that as much as possible of China's core technology needs were met by domestic production rather than imports. It would be very, very similar to what we have today. It's a fantasy to think that we have a problem here with just this particular regime, that we can just get them to change their minds. No, the Chinese approach on this is very deeply rooted in both the institutional, cultural history of China itself and its geographical and geopolitical position in the world. So it's going to have interests that create a lot of friction and conflict with the perceived interests of the United States under any government. It's probably going to be quite successful at managing this economy because they've been very successful for many, many decades.\n\nWhen I was in China, I asked somebody I met what would happen if there was an election in China tomorrow. His answer was that it's possible that the median voter in China is much more reactionary than the government. In fact, this might be much more liberal than the regime you would get out of a democratic election.\n\nYes. We don't know for sure because there really is a lot of public polling. But a lot of people say that and my perception is that could well be true. All you have to do is look at the Chinese Internet, the blogosphere. They don't have Twitter but they have local equivalents. There is a lot of unfettered nationalist, highly militaristic thinking there that the government spends most of its time keeping in check. Every so often they unleash it because they're in a spat with Japan or whoever and they need to get the popular opinion. Mostly they try to tamp that down. A Chinese system that was fully representative of actual popular views… We don't know exactly what that might be, but it could be very, very difficult to deal with.\n\nLet’s go back to this discussion about what should be the grand bargain between the rest of the world and China. I live in Silicon Valley and as you know, a big topic of conversation is AI. In particular the race between China and the US on AI. One idea I've heard is that what we should do is give them free rein on solar, electric vehicles, batteries—all this other real world heavy manufacturing that they seem to have greater proclivity for anyways. They consider it more real. On AI and semiconductors, we’ll dominate that. Everything else we'll import. Is this a plausible deal worth making? Because if you take AI very seriously, this might be an amazing bargain. You can say what you want in your ideal state of things, but how do you get there? There are a lot of people in China who'd say, “No, we want it all and we can. So why should we make that deal with you?”\n\nIf I basically take this down to the level on which the United States and China are now starting to negotiate, my personal view on this is that it would make a lot of sense for the US to be much more open to direct investment by Chinese companies in manufacturing in the United States. I'm thinking particularly of things like electric vehicles and that whole supply chain, green energy, industrial automation, all of those things. Why do I think that? First of all, if the US is serious about revitalizing its industrial base—and I think there's a good case for trying to do that selectively—it is not going to happen unless you invite in the world's leading players and have them compete. That is how China industrialized. 45 years ago, they were an industrial basket case. They said, “We want to get industrially strong. How do you do that? Get all the leading companies in the world to invest here and we'll learn from them.” That's how you do it. If we're serious about that, we should be serious about figuring out ways that we can bring Chinese industrial investment into the United States. That to me would be a win-win, because Chinese companies at an individual level would love that. They see the US is a huge market. They can't get into it right now. They would love the opportunity to tap into it more. We could learn from them. And if you did that, basically you would be saying that whatever we're in with China, it's not a cold war, because we are willing to have high levels of direct investment by both sides. You might want to put protections around that, all kinds\n\n\nOf rules of the road.\nBut in an ideal world, we would have a lot more of that.\nThe first question is, why is that so difficult?\nWhy do you essentially have a consensus in Washington that not only do we have to prevent the export of US technology goods to China, but we also have to prevent Chinese companies from investing in the US?\nThis is basically agreed on in Washington.\nThe reason is data.\nFundamentally, there is a view that any manufacturing process today is also a data creation machine.\nWhere does that data go and who benefits from that data?\nThe other thing is that, back 30 or 40 years ago, you used to be able to divide the world into technologies which were essentially for civilian use, a few technologies that were military, and then a very small proportion of dual-use technologies that could go either way.\nIt was those dual-use technologies that had to be controlled very carefully.\nNow basically everything is dual use.\nAny technology that you can imagine can be put to some kind of military use.\nSo it becomes much more risky to have these patterns of investment, particularly when you don't know where the data is flowing and how that will feed into someone else's defense production base.\nThat is a legitimate concern.\nIn my ideal world, you would have a lot more Chinese investment in the United States, but it would be very carefully regulated in the same way that China very carefully regulates the direct investments by foreign companies in its economy.\nThey have rules about data localization, etc.\nI think that could be achieved.\nI think it will be very difficult in the current political environment.\nIn terms of the grand bargain that you suggest, China is very interested in not being pigeonholed.\nThey didn't want to be pigeonholed in low value-added manufacturing.\nThey wanted to do the high tech stuff, now they're doing that.\nThey don't want to be pigeonholed in manufacturing.\nThey want all of technology, including AI.\nI don't think that any strategy premised on the idea that China should accept arbitrary limits on what it can do is viable.\nWould we accept that?\nAbsolutely not.\nSo why should we expect them to accept something that we would consider an absurd and completely unreasonable infringement on our sovereignty?\nIt just doesn't work that way.\nIt's funny because one of the main arguments that China hawks will make, or one of the big parts of the worldview, is that China really cheated us.\nOur companies would invest in China, build up factories in China, and technology would get transferred there.\nThis was a huge arbitrage that China was able to pull.\nSo if you actually believe that, it should just make the reverse of that incredibly compelling.\nBecause you get a chance to do that again.\nDo you want to tell the story of BYD and Tesla in 2018 and 2019?\nBecause I think this really illustrates the point of what could be done in reverse very well.\nIf you go back to the early 1990s, China recognized that pretty much every other country that had gotten rich had done so in large part by building up an automotive industry that then served as the mechanism for creating innovations in other sectors.\nLook at the US, Germany, Japan, even Korea which is very successful.\nThey said, “We have to have a big auto industry.\nThis is one of the key industries that we have to support.”\nSo starting in the early 1990s, they had this strategy of bringing in foreign companies and making them do joint ventures on a 50/50 basis with Chinese auto companies.\nThe theory was that eventually the Chinese companies would learn.\nYou would be able to develop your own national champion auto companies and kick the foreigners out.\nBasically this failed.\nIt failed massively.\nOver the next 25 years, foreign companies came in.\nGeneral Motors, VW, Toyota, Honda and so forth.\nThey did very, very well.\nThe joint venture partners in China basically just sat around and clipped coupons from the dividends that these joint ventures were producing.\nAll of the technological inputs continuously came from the foreign partners, all of the design ideas.\nThe local partners were never able to succeed.\nIn volume terms, you had a lot of smaller scale, locally sponsored vehicle companies in China building low-end vehicles.\nSo a lot of the cars that wound up getting made in China were made by local firms.\nBut if you look at the share of profits and total value in the system, it was dominated by these joint ventures, which were in turn dominated by the foreign partners.\nSo China, circa 2010-2015, had been doing this for 25 years.\nThey were basically no closer to having globally competitive conventional car makers than they had been 25 years before.\nSo in the late 2000s, 2005-2010, they started thinking, \"Well, this and other related industrial policies are not working very well.\nWe are not generating the national champions that we thought would be.\nSo what do we do about this?\"\nTheir answer was to leapfrog.\n“Let's try and figure out what is the next stage of technological development that people really aren't working on yet.\nLet's work on that and then maybe we can get in on the ground floor.”\nWhat they came up with in large measure was renewable energy and specifically electric vehicles.\nThey started having a pretty comprehensive set of subsidies and other kinds of industrial support for companies like BYD to produce electric vehicles.\nBYD is basically a private company.\nThis worked okay for 10 or 12 years.\nBYD got pretty good.\nParticularly what they started to figure out was the supply chain.\nThey got very good at making the batteries.\nBut by 2018-2019, BYD was still not that exciting a company.\nMost people in China really didn't want to buy electric vehicles.\nThey seemed really inconvenient.\nThe sexy cars were the big SUVs that the joint ventures were putting out and so forth.\nThen in 2018, the Chinese government made the decision to allow Tesla to come in and build a wholly-owned Gigafactory in Shanghai.\nThey had never approved a wholly-owned automotive company before.\nThey started cranking out cars in 2019, which became immensely popular.\nIt seems like one of the things that happened was that the Chinese companies by 2019 had gotten pretty good at the underlying technology of electric cars, specifically the batteries and the software systems that govern the cars.\nBut they were terrible at consumer design.\nThey had not figured out how to make appealing products that people would want to buy.\nTesla did have appealing products that people wanted to buy.\nThey were big status symbols.\nSo BYD and its competitors said, “Okay, this is the part we have to figure out.\nHow do we achieve this?”\nBasically, they recognized that they had to up their design game.\nAmong other things, they went to Germany and loaded up on a lot of German car designers that were able to transform their technology base into much more appealing packages.\nThen by 2022 or so, they were able to compete with Tesla both on price and on quality.\nWhat that shows you is that, number one, the Chinese government made a pretty good bet on this leapfrogging idea.\n“There are technologies in the future.\nWe need to get in early, subsidize the heck out of them.”\nSome of the estimates that have been made about the level of subsidies given to the EV industry and its supply chains range from $200-300 billion.\nIt was a huge, huge amount of money that did not generate that much of a financial return for a really long time but they stuck at it.\nThen the thing that finally flipped the switch was this catalytic foreign investment that showed the Chinese companies what they needed to do to actually compete in the consumer market.\nThen they got very good at that very quickly.\nHow much was the $200-300 billion actually relevant given the fact that BYD, as you mentioned, is a private company?\nHow much of that was actually necessary or counterfactually important to creating this outcome?\nIt's like the old slogan about advertising.\nHalf of it works, but you don't know which half.\nDid China need to spend that much in subsidies?\nProbably not.\nBut had they spent less, would they have had the same effect?\nMaybe, maybe not.\nThey tried various different types of subsidies.\nInitially there were producer subsidies to just get companies to produce more.\nThen they had a lot of buyer subsidies at the individual level, but also the city government level to promote things like electric buses.\nI think all of that played a role.\nWhat was important was that the government set a very clear direction and they said, “We want this to happen, we really want it.\nWe don't know how long it's going to take.\nWe're just going to keep trying different things until it works.\nBecause the goal of creating this electric vehicle sector and the whole supply chain for it, that's what we want at the end.”\nWhy are they able to identify these kinds of sectors in advance?\nCentral planning isn't supposed to work.\nThere's been many cases of countries which have tried to do this.\nGermany, Japan, and many other countries missed out on the Internet because there was a centrally directed effort towards these heavy industries or manufacturing, which actually turned out not to be relevant in the 21st century.\nNo, it's definitely perilous.\nChina has a list of key industries.\nIt's called the strategic emerging industries.\nThey came up with it basically in 2010.\nIt built on previous iterations of industrial policy.\nMost of it is not really an effort to predict with a high degree of specificity what comes next.\nThey're mostly pretty obvious things like semiconductors, industrial automation, new materials.\nIt’s all this kind of stuff that would be on anyone's list if you were running a VC fund and saying, “What are the sectors that we think are—”\nBut most VC funds are losing money.\nActually, maybe only a couple of firms in the world were able to make this prediction correctly.\nSo it's like a couple of firms in the world plus the Ministry of Information Technology in China are the only people who can predict the future?\nNo, I think basically the analogy with the VC fund is a pretty good one.\nI’ve made it many, many times.\nThink of China as a giant VC fund that is just willing to lose huge amounts of money for a really long time on the assumption that a few of the bets will pan out.\nChina as a state, as a government, is uniquely able to throw a lot of money at things for a really long time and not care about what returns are.\nThey say, “We're going to identify this universe of potential winners.\nWe're going to promote all of them, basically.\nSome of them may work and some of them may not, and the successes will pay for the failures.\nI guess I'm still confused on why this works.\nMany other countries have tried similar things.\nMITI was a Japanese version of this, right?\nYeah.\nLook at their economy now and their high tech sector.\nThere’s a couple of things.\nFirst of all, even if you go back to like 2005-2006, when we started thinking about this, everyone was saying that green energy was going to be an important industry in the future.\nYou had the Kleiner Perkins guy.\nJohn Doerr was the big VC who said circa 2007, “I'm going to put all of my bets on green energy because this is the future.”\nHe turned out to be wrong from the standpoint of his investment returns.\nBut he turned out to be totally correct in terms of this being a really big thing.\nIt was just not that wild a bet to say that green energy was going to be really important and that we should place a lot of bets on that.\nWhy does this work and why is this different from a central planning thing?\nThat's a really important point.\nFirst of all, the Chinese system, like the systems that preceded it in East Asia—Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and so forth—has always put a lot of emphasis on being good at exporting.\nThere are a lot of pressures within the system to create industries that can export.\nThe reason this is important is if you have a totally closed system—which frankly is what I think Donald Trump is trying to create in the United States—and people are just producing essentially for domestic consumption, there's no incentive to keep up with global technology developments.\nIf you have this constant export focus, essentially what everyone is trying to do… If you have a closed domestic market, you can rig the domestic market and buy off your connections in the government to make sure that you, as a company, have your market share.\nThere are a lot of ways to win that do not involve technological upgrading.\nThat is what dooms all import substitution regimes.\nIf you're an export-driven economy, you can't rig the global economy.\nUltimately you have to compete.\nYou can't compete just on price, you have to compete on raising your game.\nJapan did this successfully, Taiwan did this successfully, Korea did this successfully.\nChina's done that successfully.\nSo that's answer one.\nYou had this underlying system which was heavily incentivized towards technological upgrading across the board.\nThat's what you were sitting on top of.\nIt was completely different from the old central planning regime, which was autarkic and inward-looking.\nSecond, you had this domestic competition environment which was really cutthroat and involved a lot of international companies.\nThis is a little bit of a difference from Japan, which always kept the foreign companies out of its domestic market.\nTheir companies operated globally very, very well, but the domestic market was very protected.\nChina's domestic market was not that protected.\nThey were always willing to bring in companies that they thought would be able to spark some technological change.\nSo what this did is it created a field in which whether the government has the right ideas, or whether they don't, you have a crucible in which their ideas can be tested.\nYou have a very competitive domestic market where you have a lot of the big international players doing their own thing as well.\nSo the things that work get some validation and you can keep building on those successes.\nThat's really important.\nThen just the sheer scale at which they were able and willing to support what appeared to be losing bets for a long time does matter.\nYou could contrast their view, for example, in solar energy.\nThey said, “Look, we want to be big in solar energy.”\nAgain, they started thinking about this in 2005.\n“What do we need to do?”\nSo they identified the whole supply chain, from the raw silicon inputs to all of the modules in the finished panels.\nThey said, “We want to be in every stage of that.”\nSo they had a pretty deliberate strategy of trying to create people at every point in the supply chain.\nAnd they were willing to go through cycles of people not making any money.\nThe obvious comparison in the United States is that the US government gives one loan to one company, Solyndra.\nIt goes bad and everyone says this is proof that industrial policy does not work.\nChina actually has the right answer to that question.\nWe had the wrong answer to that question.\nYou have to be willing to accept some failures and some loss of government money along the way if you want to get to the end.\nBut I really stress the ecosystem because a lot of this would not have worked just by the government saying\n\n\n“Oh, we want to do solar.” It would not have worked unless you had this broader ecosystem of export-driven manufacturing, high competition, and international participation across many, many sectors of the economy. They all converged to create success for themselves.\n\nI want to put some of these bureaucrats in a Factorio speedrun and see how they do so.\n\nI just interviewed Ken Rogoff, so Japan's top of mind for me. It's really interesting that even though Japan had this export discipline, maybe the reason that the growth didn't continue after the 80s is because you had this convoy system where banks were incentivized to lend to people they knew in these conglomerates. These conglomerates have been around for decades, even before World War II.\n\nI have a question now about China. You have these companies which have become national champions and are conglomerates, the same companies producing a phone and a car and everything in between. Given the intrinsic nature of authoritarian systems, or systems with financial repression, will we go to a system that is closer to what Japan had in the 80s? They’re going to give money to Huawei because Huawei or BYD are the right people. Or will it remain dynamic, especially in the sectors which are coming up over the next few decades?\n\nIt's a good question. I would start by emphasizing the ways in which China is very, very different from Japan. The central thing that is really different and lies at the root of a lot of this, is that China is an independent geopolitical actor. Japan was not. Japan, at the end of the day, could rely on the US for security. They were demilitarized. China basically is on its own. They're in a very dangerous neighborhood. They have 14 land neighbors they share borders with. They have names like North Korea, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, a lot of dangerous actors. Several of them have nuclear weapons: North Korea, Russia, Pakistan, and India. So China, just in a very narrow sense, lives in a very dangerous neighborhood. They quite legitimately have some pretty significant national security needs. They also have aspirations to be a great power, and they want to do it on their own. The incentive to get things right is much more existential in China than it was in Japan. Japan essentially could take the choice to sort of say, “Oh, we're going to have a stagnant economy and that's bad and whatever, but actually we'll be fine.” For China, it's not fine. So underlying it, there's a spur that increases the chances that the Chinese leaders will do the things that they need to do to keep the system more dynamic. It's not a guarantee, but it's a pretty strong incentive.\n\nThen, if you look at some of the specifics, the big difference between the way that China and Japan are economically organized is essentially the relationship between the financial and the corporate sector. Japan had a system where banks owned equity in these giant industrial companies and trading companies, and vice versa. There were these cross shareholdings, which meant that essentially the entire economy of Japan, the entire corporate and financial sector, had one big balance sheet. All of that balance sheet rested, by the late 1980s, on land values that had just gotten completely detached from any form of reality. There was an investment thesis among investors who were playing the Japanese stock market in the late 80s, that you did not look at the earnings of Japanese companies. Those were irrelevant. What you looked at was the value of the land they controlled. You looked at essentially a capital ratio where you assumed that the value of their underlying land capital was a permanent contribution to their wealth and prosperity. The valuations of these stocks, which again got crazy, you couldn't justify them by earnings. They said, it doesn't matter because the land they're sitting on is so valuable. Then the land values collapsed by 80%. The stock values had to collapse by a similar amount, 80%. Everyone was holding shares of one another. So the banks’ capital got eroded because a lot of their capital was tied up in the land and in the stocks which were collateralized by land. So they were unable to lend. They just had to deleverage as fast as possible. The companies had to deleverage as fast as possible. The entire economy got engulfed by this phenomenon of debt deflation, which basically means in the act of paying down the debt—because you're doing fire sales of assets—you're reducing the prices of those assets and introducing deflation. So the real value of your debt continues to grow even as you are supposedly reducing it, because of the deflationary effect. It's very, very difficult to get out.\n\nChina does not have this problem at all. They looked at the problems that Japan got into, they looked at similar problems that Korea had in the late 1990s, and they said, “We will never allow this kind of cross shareholding between financial companies and corporations. This is way too dangerous.” They have kept the two quarantined. It is illegal for industrial companies to own a bank. The bigger ones are allowed to have internal financing subsidiaries, but they can only sort of manage finance inflows within the group. It is also illegal for banks to load up on shares of industrial companies. So you have a distinct financial system and industrial system. That means that the particular type of macro problem that Japan got into is very, very unlikely to occur in China.\n\nYou do have huge debt problems. The property developers are very over leveraged, it’s a huge problem. We've had a massive property crash in China over the last five years. That is a big, big problem. You have local governments that borrowed a lot of money, invested in infrastructure which is now delivering very little returns. They have a big debt problem. You have very substantial debt problems in China that have significant negative macro consequences. But they're all isolated and they can be dealt with sort of one by one. If you look at the industrial sector, it's not very highly leveraged. Debt levels in fact are not high. Most private companies in China have learned for many years that they couldn't get access to bank credit. The banks only wanted to lend to state-owned enterprises which were secure, had physical collateral, and had a state guarantee. Private companies for years have learned to make do by basically financing their investment out of retained earnings. Their leverage ratios are not that high. They're creeping up now over the last few years because of the big industrial policy push. But fundamentally they're in a very different position from the Japanese companies.\n\nInteresting. This is just stuff from your book that I'm citing back to you. You talk about these local government financing vehicles which are backed. The local government takes out a lot of loans in order to build this infrastructure. That is backed by the presumed appreciation of the land, which should go up as this infrastructure goes up. That sounds actually very similar to the problem you were describing with Japan. You say, “Look, this is debt that's on the local government's balance sheets. But fundamentally it's like one country.” You have this system where the government can just hand the debt to somebody. So how immune is the private economy really? Will it just take down the local government and then nobody will make a fuss? These other companies will just never have to hear about it again?\n\nI guess my view on this is that the local government land based financing model was actually a pretty smart thing to do initially. For a decade or so it worked quite well. Local governments were sitting on a lot of these land assets. The land assets originally were undervalued quite substantially. So it made sense for the local governments essentially to try and capitalize some of the future value of these things and use them to finance infrastructure development. This was not a rogue policy that local governments came up with on their own. It was actually sponsored by the central government and the China Development Bank back in the early 2000s. They were grappling with the problem that China at that point had a severe shortage of housing and infrastructure of all kinds, including urban infrastructure. The question was, “We need a lot more of this stuff. How do we build it? How do we finance it?” They realized, “Actually as we build this stuff out, the values of the land are going to skyrocket. So let's essentially take some financing against that future land price appreciation and use that to build the infrastructure that makes everything possible.” If you look at the first two cases of where this was done in the early 2000s, they had these estimates of what the land would ultimately be worth that seemed ridiculous and astronomical at the time. They were in fact way too low. They were way, way conservative on what the actual land price appreciation would be. So you had a period of about eight or nine years where essentially the state-run development banks were doing this in a fairly controlled way, very successfully. What happened was that after the 2008 financial crisis, the government said, “Oh, we just have to spend a lot of money to gin-up growth because there's been this global economic catastrophe.” They did a massive cash infusion into the banks and to the state-owned enterprises. They said, “Spend, spend, spend, and basically all infrastructure is good infrastructure or just build whatever you want.” What happened at that point was that all of the commercial banks got into this business of lending money to local governments for these infrastructure projects. Their underwriting standards were much less robust than the China Development Bank’s had been. For the local governments, it was just free money to them. They just took all the money and they ran with it. That created this kind of Frankenstein's monster. Even so, you had quite a lot of that money in the first two years that probably generated a pretty good return because China was still underbuilt relative to what it needed to be. But after that had run for three or four years, it became clear that a lot of this was going into wasteful projects that didn't deliver a good return. Now they've been struggling for the last decade to unwind that. But it's important to understand that the underlying model was actually an okay model. It just wound up being done in a way that was completely uncoordinated and excessive. You didn't have incentive structures that enabled local governments to rein it in when they needed to. So I still think that that is fundamentally a local government fiscal problem, which ultimately is a central government fiscal problem.\n\nIf you look at the consolidated balance sheet of the central and local governments, put all together, China's government debt is still probably less as a share of GDP than US federal government debt. The US is over 100%, China is probably under 100%.\n\nSo my previous guest, Victor Shih, estimated that the local government debt alone is somewhere between 100-150% of GDP. If you add it to the central government debt, I think he estimated that government debt in China is 200% of GDP.\n\nI would respectfully disagree with Victor on that. It's impossible to know for sure. You have the problem of formal debt, which is debt issued by government entities, and then you have contingent debt, which is debt issued by corporations that may or may not essentially be fronts or windows for local governments. There is also a very significant problem of double counting, which is hard to resolve. Debt gets counted at different levels in the system. It's one piece of debt, but depending on how long the chain is, it gets counted in various different places. I've long had the view that many of these much larger estimates of debt don't fully account for the double counting problem. It's quite possible that the true debt level is higher than what we think it is. It's unlikely, in my opinion, to be as high as Victor says it is. It also matters what the debt goes to and who is actually formally responsible for paying it. Are there project flows or income flows that can be used to pay for it? The structure of the servicing of the debt matters.\n\nAt the end of the day, we do have a pretty good sense from the macro data of how much total debt there is in the economy. It's on the order of 300% of GDP. So if you want to say that government debt is 200% of GDP, then unless you're double counting, you're basically saying that everything else is a lot less than you think it is.\n\nDo we know what the total debt, private and public, is in the US?\n\nI don't have it off the top of my head. The federal government debt I think is around 110% GDP, something like that. Total gross debt of all sectors, government, corporations, households, I think would be on the order of around 300% of GDP. Japan is substantially higher.\n\nYou can get into an endless debate on these things where it becomes kind of a numbers game. But I have a pretty high conviction that China has a significant macro leverage issue. If you take my numbers, say gross debt to GDP—which by the way are the official numbers of the Chinese government and largely accepted with some structural modifications by the IMF, so forth—it’s 300% of GDP. That is in the ballpark for highly developed economies. It is extremely high for middle-income economies. So if you look at China as a country that has average per capita income that's kind of like Brazil, China is way more leveraged than any other country of its level of income. That is potentially a problem. So I don't want to make light of the problem because I think it is quite serious. It's an important constraint on policy and it is an important constraint on growth, at the moment. I don't think that it leads to a financial collapse situation because the system is contained and all the debt is denominated in local currencies. But it does impose a tax on growth and it is one of the things that makes China's growth more sluggish now than it probably could be.\n\nWhy is it the case that middle-income countries are especially in a bad position with having a high debt to GDP ratio? You would think naively that they're in a position to have higher growth over coming years, so it may make sense for them to take on more debt so they can use that to finance the greater growth that will come—theoretically assuming they use it to invest in high return things—as opposed to the US or Japan where you're just going to be stuck with this debt load for a long time.\n\nOne of the things that you could say about debt historically in China was that it tended in general to finance productive assets, whether it was industrial production or infrastructure. For many years China was a very infrastructure short country relative to its needs. So you could justify quite substantial debt-financed infrastructure investments on the basis of these would deliver good economic returns for many decades. The case for that is a lot weaker now than it was before. The problem is how you essentially retire this enormous stock of very low-productivity, infrastructure investments, debt-financed. How do you sort of move on and have a more productive return on capital in future?\n\nThere are ways for solving that problem. To me the fundamental issue is they have too much of a supply-side strategy,\n\n\nNot enough of a demand-side strategy.\nIt's really a macroeconomic issue.\nIf they had stronger domestic demand, that would generate more profits for companies.\nThey would be able to have more pricing power for companies.\nYou would get a little bit of inflation.\nSo you would have more cash flows within the economies that would enable people, and local governments, to pay down debt.\nA little bit of inflation would erode the real value of the debt.\nThat's essentially how they got out of their last debt problem in the late 1990s.\nThey had gigantic bad debts in the banking system, essentially representing legacy loans to state-owned enterprises.\nThey had no way of paying them back.\nThey had a very, very growth friendly program that generated a lot of growth, a lot of inflation.\nThat basically strengthened their debt problem.\nWhat they need now is a kind of a revamped, updated version of that strategy.\nThey do a lot more to promote domestic demand, to get more profits, more cash flows, and a little bit more inflation into the system.\nThat would probably solve the debt problem over a decade or two.\n",

    "cleanText": "Today I’m speaking with Ken Rogoff, who is a professor at Harvard, recent author of Our Dollar, Your Problem, and former Chief Economist at the IMF. Ken, thanks so much for coming on the podcast.\n\nThanks so much for having me and welcome to Harvard, which is where we’re filming this.\n\nIn your book you have a lot of anecdotes of meeting different Chinese leaders, especially when you were Chief Economist at the IMF. It seems like you had positive experiences. They would listen. You met the Premier with your family, and he would listen to your advice.\n\nOne, how does that inform your view about how competent their leadership is? Two, how do you think they got into this mess, with their big stimulus or whatever else you think went wrong?\n\nTo the extent that when you were talking to them in the early 2000s, it seemed like you were seeing eye to eye, or that they would understand your perspective. Do you think something changed in the meantime?\n\nFirst I want to be careful to say that they listen to everybody. The Chinese are way better than we are at hearing a hundred different views. Mine would be one of many that they heard.\n\nI was very impressed by the competence of the Chinese leaders. I actually gave a lecture in the Party’s training school where, if you’re a mayor, a provincial governor, any bureaucrat on your way up, you go to this thing which for them is like Harvard Business School. They really looked for competence. Of course there were various loyalty things. But when you met the leaders—and I met a lot of them when I was at the school—they actually asked really raw questions too. They said things I couldn’t believe they were asking. And I was told that within the school, you're allowed to say anything. So they had that system for a long time. When you met Chinese technocrats—or even the mayor of Shanghai—they were impressive. I'm not saying ours aren't, but it's a mix. I think you know that. I think Xi Jinping has really changed that. He’s been the president since 2013, and over time he’s pushed out that system and moved more toward loyalists, people who are less technocratic.\n\nProbably the most important talk I ever gave in China was at what's called the China Development Forum in 2016. It's this giant hall that had most of the top leaders in the party. A lot of the elite of the tech world, Mark Zuckerberg and many others were there.\n\nI said, “Okay, I'm looking at your housing. I'm looking at your infrastructure. It looks to me like you're going into a classical housing crisis problem. Your catch-up is over. Your demographics don’t look good.” I gave a list of things. “And by the way, it looks like power is becoming very centralized in the economy.” And I said, “I'm a Western economist. You're doing an amazing job. What do I know? But I don’t think that would be good for growth.”\n\nAfter I gave the talk—I just figured you only live once, you just have to say what you have to say—a couple of top leaders came up to me and said, “Professor Rogoff, we very much appreciated your remarks.” I was thinking, “Oh no, they’re going to put me in jail or something at the end of this.”\n\nI’m less impressed by them now. And I’m worried. Let’s say they get into a crisis—which I think they’re in now. I think they're still in a deep crisis—or somehow hotter heads prevail between the United States and China and we get into some kind of entanglement nobody wants. I worry that we’re not as competent. I’m speaking about right now. We have some very good people, but the average quality at the very top, I think, has gone down. And China’s not as competent either. That’s a recipe for having bad things happen.\n\nOn that talk, you mentioned in the book that, before, you had to clear your talk. So you gave them a sort of watered-down version of what you were going to say. I have to say, it would take some gusto to go up to the top party leaders. Were you nervous while you were giving the talk, saying, “Oh, it’s too centralized”?\n\nI mean I was pretty experienced by that time. I frankly never used notes, so the idea that I was going to read my speech didn’t even occur to me. Maybe it was a little bit spontaneous. But I certainly felt at that moment, what am I here for? What’s the point of coming to this? Why don’t I talk about the elephant in the room? Everybody knows this. I don’t know if everybody knew it, but it was clear to me and I’m going to say it. I think a lot of people in that situation—even though they should or the logic makes sense—they often don’t.\n\nYeah, I’m a professor. So people who had a big tech company or a finance company, or all these other businesses, most of them can’t afford to do that. I think they know that when they invite a professor, they can’t cut your... They can stop you from going again. They invited me again, by the way. Although the second time I just talked to a tiny room instead of the big hall.\n\nBut, I give credit to the Chinese for listening. You’ve said that the seeds of their current crisis were sown in 2010 with their big stimulus. Is it wrong then to blame Xi Jinping for this? That was before his time. It was Hu Jintao’s government that launched the stimulus that’s causing all these problems now.\n\nHu Jinato did it, but they kept it going. The local government debt, that was an innovation put in with the 2010 stimulus. But they kind of left it running and used it as a stimulus program. Long tangent, but the local governments don’t have enough ways to fund themselves. So they were allowed to sell land to start and fund these construction companies, get revenue, and sustain themselves. They let that keep going.\n\nWhen Xi Jinping came in, I was told he was going to be Ronald Reagan. I had very good contacts in the intellectual sphere in China. Someone who had worked for me when I was chief economist at the IMF, other people I knew whom I really trust. They're really smart and well-connected, I don’t want to say their names. But they were telling me, “He's going to change everything. This is really the time we’re going to liberalize our markets a bit. We’re going to do the things we haven’t done.” And he didn't do that much. If you look at China’s growth, it actually slowed down quite a bit when he came into power.\n\nThere are different ways to measure a country’s output because China produces completely different stuff than we do. They use their currency and we use ours. Nothing's perfect. But one way to do it is this. What do they report their output to be in Chinese currency? What do we report ours to be in dollars? Then we use the exchange rate to compare. We can look at growth that way and if you do for China, it’s been spectacular. It’s been very, very good. It’s obvious they're pulling it out of thin air.\n\nBut there are these approaches trying to control for how you’d really compare how an ordinary person lives or how an ordinary firm gets by. When you look at those measures, China’s grown is quite a bit less. If you go 1980 to 2012, the official growth rate is almost 10 percent. This purchasing power parity rate—forgive me for using those words—is like just over 7 percent. If you look in more recent years, it’s really slowed down a lot. Even the official numbers have slowed down. I don’t know the number off the top of my head, but it’s 6% or 7% for Xi Jinping, and maybe only 3.5%. They’re starting from a very low base.\n\nOkay, things were gonna slow down. It’s not all his fault. But I think he’s been reluctant to take risks and I think it’s gotten us to where we are. I think they’re in a lot of trouble. They’re overbuilt in infrastructure. They’re overbuilt in housing. Have you been to China?\n\nI was there six months ago.\n\nWhere did you go?\n\nShanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Emeishan.\n\nSo you saw a few of the medium-sized cities. At least one of them, I think, is the new tech center. I can’t pronounce it.\n\nHangzhou?\n\nYeah it’s a big tech center. Some of the smaller cities don't feel like the big cities. And 60% of Chinese income is from what they call their tier-three cities. I grew up in Rochester, that’s like a tier-three city in the United States. But you could pick Cincinnati, Liverpool. Rouen— I may not be saying it right—in France is an example of a tier-three city. And they have invested like crazy. I’ve been to a few and I’ve studied the data on it a lot. They have amazing roads, amazing real estate, amazing housing. But the feel of death in those cities... They were very good at building stuff. The Soviet Union was very good at building cement factories and steel plants and railroads. But they’ve run their course. They have other stuff: green energy, AI, electric vehicles. But believe it or not, that stuff’s still tiny compared to infrastructure and real estate. Real estate’s a third of the economy by some measures.\n\nSo I think they’re in a lot of trouble now in China. They let it go on too long. But again, I wasn’t running things. If things seem to be working and you try to change things, you get thrown out. It’s not easy to be in those shoes.\n\nWhen I was in China, we visited a town of half a million people outside of Chengdu, so one of these tier-three cities. Arriving there, the train station is huge. Compounds are huge. Even when you’re driving around, like a movie theater is this humongous complex. I realized things were bigger in China. I was used to that because I’d seen these other cities by that point. But I just thought, I’ve seen cities of half a million people. I live in a city of half a million people in San Francisco. This just doesn’t seem proportionate to the size of the population.\n\nThen we visited a Buddhist temple that had been built recently as a tourist site. It was ginormous. You would go through one little shrine, and then behind it would be an even bigger structure and then another one concentrically for like eight turns. It would take you probably 10 minutes to drive through this thing. There was just nobody there. It was like me and three other white people. It’s very much that feeling. And the young people don’t want to live there. I have a lot of young people here as students and I run into people. They don’t want to live in these towns, and the jobs aren’t there. I can’t criticize them for trying that. If you’d asked me in 2005, “Should we try to encourage people to go out to the Rochesters and the Liverpools and the Rouens in France?” I would have said yes. There’s too much in the big cities. There’s overcrowding. Look what happened to São Paulo. Look what happened to Mumbai. But I would’ve been wrong. These forces are very powerful.\n\nSo a lot of their growth, and what they call their GDP, is this stuff. So they’re having to reorient and people just aren’t that flexible. It’s like when AI comes and puts everybody out of jobs. When construction jobs are gone, and all these indirect things are gone, it’s not that easy to move everyone.\n\nIf it hadn’t been for financial repression, and all this investment had been done through purely market mechanisms, would things have turned out much better?\n\nEven if China gets rid of all financial repression today, they save a lot. So this money has to go somewhere. Are there enough productive opportunities to soak up all these savings? Or could there have been in the past? If they get rid of financial repression, is this a problem solved, or could it have been solved?\n\nWhat everyone’s told them forever is their saving rate and investment rate are astounding. It was higher before, but it’s still maybe 45%, their consumption rate… ours is pushing 70%. European countries are a little more temperate, but they’re in the low sixties. Their consumption is very low. They have some wealthy people that you saw when you went to the marquee cities. But a lot of China is living on $200-a-month kind of incomes. You could give them money. You could let them consume instead of exporting it. They’ve been very reluctant to do that. You could do things to encourage consumption. Actually, even just changing their exchange rate policy to allow it to appreciate more at times, would make imports less expensive. They have been very reluctant to do that. That’s what everyone tells them. That’s certainly what I said in 2016 also. The ticket to getting people to spend more is to provide more security than they have. First of all, there’s nothing like our Social Security system. You need to save for your old age. There’s nothing like our health system. If you work at one of the big state-owned factories, they give you healthcare, but otherwise you’re on your own. They’re not allowed to invest abroad. It goes in waves, but they’re not allowed to put their money abroad. So they’re trying to be\n\n\nBe careful about all of that and not do things suddenly. There’s nothing to do overnight. But fundamentally, if you’re looking at China and asking what’s wrong, it’s that the consumer isn’t spending enough. What’s happening right now is worse, because housing prices are collapsing. That’s the only thing they really let people save in. You could either save in a bank account, which gets you a crummy interest rate, or in a house. Now they’re going down, so people are cutting back. They can dig their way out. There’s no magic bullet to make them grow at 5%. By the way, that is the official number, but I don’t think they’re anywhere near that. There’s no simple thing, but the general goal would be to try to rebalance investment and consumption.\n\nGoing back to your point about whether purchasing power parity is the right way to compare, or whether nominal is the right way to compare. I think in the book you say the nominal comparison of GDP is better because you can’t buy Patriot missiles or oil with purchasing power parity dollars. But if we’re trying to compare the strength of the two countries—their relative strength, especially in a military context— if they can build ships and munitions much more cheaply, and they have to pay their soldiers less, isn’t that actually more relevant if we were trying to figure out who would win in a war? Shouldn’t we actually be looking at the fact that they have a bigger PPP economy than us as a sign that they’re actually stronger?\n\nYeah. So in the book, I’m talking about your geopolitical power, where if you’re going to give money to somebody, what’s it worth and how much can they use it. But no, you’re absolutely right. They just crush us in shipbuilding. It’s partly because they build commercial ships, and there’s a lot of symbiosis between commercial and military. I think they’re 50% of the global shipbuilding market. For us to build a new aircraft carrier takes years and years and incredible expense. One of the mistakes we’re making is trying to build everything ourselves. Let our allies do some of this. The Koreans are really good at building ships. That’s another place we could be importing from. You’re right about the soldiers. They’re paid much less. They have a lot of advantages in a conflict against us.\n\nWe’re way ahead in your department, tech. That is our advantage at the moment. If that were to dissipate, it would certainly hurt. What is your projection? Right now I think their nominal GDP is 75% of America’s, or something like that.\n\nYeah, in dollars, what we call the market terms. What’s your projection by 2030 and by 2040, the ratio?\n\nI didn’t realize it was as high as 75%. I thought it was a little lower. I was actually going to say 75% in 2030.\n\nAt one point in 2024, it was around two-thirds, but it’s really volatile with the exchange rate. The dollar’s really high. When the dollar’s really high, it makes us look bigger.\n\nI think they’ll gain about a percent a year on us, maybe. I don’t think they’re going to grow way faster than the United States.\n\nWait, that means you think they’ll never actually have a bigger economy than us?\n\nIt’ll take a long time. We’re talking about the absolute size. They have four times as many people.\n\nThere were these projections by Goldman Sachs and many others that we’d be like Canada is to the United States pretty soon. Like all these extrapolations, they were proven wrong. That brings me to a big topic. A lot of people will look at some trend, whether it’s growth in something, AI, China— I was about to say. That's a common trend in AI. —and just project it into the future. Economists at least consider ourselves terrible at that. You go back and look at any of these commissions that were supposed to figure out what was going on. They happen periodically. Maybe Brookings puts one together, maybe the government does. My former colleague, the late Dick Cooper, had a whole list of these. So it is very hard to know. But my gut instinct is that what’s happening to China is what’s happened to Japan. It’s what’s happened to Asia, what happened to the Soviet Union. We have a more dynamic economy. We’re not perfect. Maybe we’re screwing it up right now with all the tariff wars and deglobalization. But we have this dynamism and creativity that other places—at least other large economies—just can’t replicate.\n\nThey can build stuff. The French have better high-speed trains than we do. I hope you don’t ride on the train from Boston to New York. It’s nicer than it could be, but it’s no high-speed train. You mentioned China. Oh my gosh, their high-speed trains are just incredible. They’re good at that. But the really creative stuff? I don’t want to say they don’t have any. There are some amazing Chinese companies. But let me say that the US is really good at it. We’ve kept that in our DNA. I think it’s very important, to preserve it.\n\nThe 1% per year compression is actually an extremely bearish forecast. Even people who are pessimistic about China will say, “Oh, by 2040 they’ll be at 150 or 125% of US nominal GDP.” They think it’ll be bigger, but only slightly bigger. The fact that you think even by 2040 they won’t have caught up is actually very extremely bearish.\n\nNo, I think they're digging their way out of a crisis. Right now we know their prices are falling. It's not because they're inventing stuff really fast. We know that interest rates are being pushed to zero. All these are signs that demand has been crushed and the economy's not doing well. Historically, they have given numbers which are accurate on average, as best as we can tell. I think that's gotten less and less true in the Xi Jinping era.\n\nGoing back to the subject of your book. People who are trying to predict when and how China might invade or blockade Taiwan will look at satellite photos of different docks and see how many ships are there. They'll look at military preparedness. From a monetary perspective, are there signs we could be looking for? For example, if they think a lot of their American-dominated assets will get sanctioned or they won’t have access to them, could we see them liquidating those assets? Would there be any sort of preparations that we could see on the monetary side to let us know they’re preparing for something big?\n\nI don’t think they’re going to do it suddenly. But very crudely, on their reserves they’re definitely moving more and more into gold. It doesn’t necessarily help to move into euros or Canadian dollars because those countries might side with us. But they’re doing what they can to diversify. I don’t think they’ve diversified into crypto yet. I had a student do a paper on that. But who knows. What they are doing very concretely is not just about what they’re holding. That’s the big fact everyone looks at. They officially hold a trillion dollars in Treasury reserves. But the estimate a student of mine did, in a nice paper—and I think others agree with it—is that it's more like $2 trillion. They hold a lot indirectly through proxies. The other part of it is that the whole financial system runs through the United States. What we sometimes call the rails or the pipes of the system. Your bank gets a purchase and my bank gets that I’m going to get a credit. How does that take place? How does it take place when we're in different countries? The United States just disproportionately controls that. That, they can’t live with. They could live without their $2 trillion for a little while. But they can’t live without being able to pay suppliers and other countries. So they're working hard on developing their own payments mechanisms. Russia actually did quite a bit in preparation for the invasion. We see China doing that. Maybe they’re selling Treasury bills, we don’t know exactly. I would advise that to them, if I were a Chinese economist talking to them. But I don’t think it’s going to be something they’ll do suddenly. Maybe Trump will bring down the markets and then there’s nothing to save. But they don’t want to be the ones to bring down the markets and cause a global crash.\n\nWhat would the alternative rails that they're trying to build look like? Are they buying oil from Iran in RMB? Will other countries they need things from accept that? In 2030, what is their goal?\n\nAbsolutely. There are a lot of countries in Africa and Latin America—some of them are almost client states of China—that they can force. Iran, of course, sells a lot of its oil to China even when there are sanctions. They’re moving in that direction. It’s not just about what you invoice the payment in. It’s how we acknowledge it, how we clear our books. That’s what they’re working on. It’s coming. The Europeans are working on it too, by the way. Europe is not happy with the situation. They're actually forming a central bank digital currency. It’s moving quite a bit faster than I thought it would. That’s actually one of the reasons they’re doing it, for international payments.\n\nLet’s talk about Japan, which you also cover in the book, or their crisis. You blame US pressure in advance of that crisis on the Japanese to raise the value of their currency, and the actions by the Bank of Japan. Zooming out, how much of the crisis is not caused by things like that, but just the fact that high-tech manufacturing as a share of world output was becoming less important? There are demographic factors as well. So something like this was bound to happen to Japan, even if there wasn’t some big crisis that preceded it? South Korea’s GDP per capita isn’t that high either, at least in comparison to the US. How much of this is due to actions taken by specific actors? South Korea had a crisis in 1983 and another in 1997. They haven’t been crisis-free, by the way. There are a lot of factors. The demographics would be the most obvious one. The rise of not just China but Korea and other competitors too. Japan invented a business model that a lot of countries have since duplicated. The model was export-led growth. Something people might not think about is it creates competition. Most countries aren’t as big as the United States, and there aren’t as many different firms trying to do the same thing. Of course, we have trouble with competition here. Famously, in Mexico at one time, there were only two telephone companies, two bread companies, two taco companies. It’s very hard not to let monopolies sit and use their political power. So how do you get around that? Japan did something that was really pretty innovative. Germany did it too to some extent. In the export sector you’re competing with the world, not just with domestic firms. That created innovation and creativity. Japan did really well with that. But over time, others imitated it and started building the same things. So that’s part of it. The aging is part of it. But I think the financial crisis was a very big part of it. What is the counterfactual? Suppose that the crisis hadn’t happened, how much wealthier is Japan today than it might have been otherwise?\n\nOh, I think 50% wealthier per person, way wealthier. That’s where they started. It depends on which measure you use. But by market exchange rates they were richer than the United States in the late 1980s. Even if you use the more complicated measures, they were richer than any European country, richer than Germany, France, Italy. They’ve moved to the bottom of the rung now. The financial crisis wasn’t the only thing. It’s a long story but we effectively forced them to move faster to open up and deregulate than they were culturally and politically ready to. I give that as an example of something in the book where I changed my mind. I had looked at that for a long time afterward. Going back to 2005—that’s long after the Japanese crisis—I would hear from people like Jiang Zemin, who was the president of China that I met, \"We’re not going to let this happen to us. There’s no way.” We were discussing how I thought maybe they shouldn’t have such a fixed exchange rate. He said, “That’s what the United States told Japan. Look what happened to Japan.” I didn’t push back that much with someone like that. You talk to other people. But I heard that from many people. I used to think, how can that be? There’s this thing called the Plaza Accord in September 1985 where we pushed them to make their exchange rate more free. But I used to say that you did that in 1985. Carmen Reinhart, my co-author on many things, and I date the crisis to 1992. That’s seven years later. I continued to think that but over the years, particularly recently, I’ve started to think I was wrong. These things unfold slowly. Crises don’t happen overnight. Japan deregulated and it worked. But they didn’t know what they were doing. I think it was a huge mistake for Japan to agree. I actually heard from someone who attended the 10th anniversary of the Plaza Accord, held in Tokyo. The person\n\n\nWho had been head of the Bank of Japan in 1985 gave a speech to officials. He went like this and apologized, very symbolically, “I have ruined our country. I did this. I take responsibility.”\n\nHe told that too when he read my book. Financial repression is bad. But financial liberalization needs to be done gradually. If you do it too quickly, you get a crisis. Many crises are caused by that.\n\nAsking as somebody who obviously doesn’t know the details, at a high level how would you explain it to a novice? How could a country be 50% less wealthy than it otherwise might have been, simply from a financial crisis? Whatever they could’ve otherwise produced, why can they still not produce it? A country’s producing a bunch of things. Why are they producing 50% less just because of a financial crisis a couple decades ago?\n\nTheir case is very unusual, although having a number like 10% or 20% is very typical. In fact, one of my professors at MIT was teaching us about the Great Depression. He said, “Here’s how to think about it. We were growing like this, then we get here and we go like this, and then we’re going like this. We never got this back.”\n\nThere’s a lot of economic models where, Solow catch-up… Yes but what happened with a financial crisis—particularly in Japan—is that it sort of blew up their business model. For example, maybe China wouldn’t have overtaken them so quickly if they’d been able to borrow more freely, if their financial markets were working better, if they had been more adroit. Their consumption collapsed. Japan didn’t quite know how to deal with that.\n\nWe in the US were much more brutal in what we allowed to happen than Japan, but we got out of it pretty quickly. I’m not sure we got back to where we were, but we got out of it very quickly. Japan has a very consensus-driven society. They don’t want anyone to be in bad shape. Their struggle with this held them back for a long time.\n\nMaybe 50% is too high and I should say 25% or 30%, but a lot better shape than they have been. Just to put it into context, what do you think the counterfactual wealth of America looks like today without 2008? Boy, that's a good question. I'm hesitant because I probably have some paper giving a number for that and I might say the wrong thing.\n\nWe certainly cumulatively lost a lot. It led to this political crisis that caused us to lose a lot more. I don't know, probably 15% lower. It’s a lot lower than it would be. We had this dynamic which we're living in right now. It's still an echo of that financial crisis. Now, mind you, you're asking about our national income. Inequality matters and would we have done other things?\n\nIn some ways, the 2008–2009 crisis was a condemnation of the system and people could see it. Maybe it led to some healthy cleansing. But I think it led to a lot more damage than healthy cleansing. I think this updates me toward the view that financial crises are even worse than I think. It isn't just this bad thing that happens and you recover. If there's 15% lingering even after almost 20 years, then wow that’s huge. You’re losing a lot of cumulative growth. Look at Greece today or Portugal. You kind of get back to where you're having a positive growth rate, but you're not picking up… They're very different from a normal recession. Actually in a normal recession, you go down and then back up.\n\nThe United States had thought it was immune to financial crises. We really hadn't had one since 1933. We had a different book that came out in 2009. I mostly write papers, but this was a book with Carmen Reinhart. It was called This Time Is Different. We had some papers published in advance. We said: “No, they're different when you have a financial crisis, it lasts way longer. The slowdown is way worse.” And we were mocked when we were saying that. I think the New York Times had a two-page spread saying how ridiculous everyone thought this was.\n\nWe could have been proven wrong and maybe if we’d done things better we would have. But it is the norm. There’s a few exceptions, like Sweden got out in a year or two. But normally they really are different from a normal recession.\n\nYou say in the book that you expect there to be another spike in inflation within the next decade and also that the fiscal position of the United States doesn’t seem sustainable. If you go forward 10 or 20 years, when we do hit this, when the piper comes calling, what actually happens? Is it going to be some acute crisis, like what happened in Greece? Or are we going to have some kind of Lost Decade like Japan? What will happen?\n\nTypically, you have a crisis of some sort when your debt is high and your political system is inflexible. We’ve checked those boxes. Then you get hit by a shock you weren’t ready for. You get caught on your back foot. It depends on what the shock is, and how we react. The way Japan reacted was through what we call financial repression, basically stuffing debt into every insurance company, pension fund, bank.\n\nThe central bank holds almost 100% of GDP in debt. We think we have a lot—I don’t actually know the number off the top of my head for the Fed, but I want to say around $7 trillion. Japan would have the equivalent of $30 trillion. So they’ve done this. It’s not the only reason they haven’t grown, not by any means, but it’s not good for growth. That’s one option.\n\nI think for the United States, that’s tough. We’re just a very market-driven system. If our financial system had that kind of pressure put on it, it would be worse than when Japan did it. And a lot of people lend to us. We can’t do that to them. We can’t force French insurance companies to hold US debt. We can only force U.S. ones. So I think the most likely thing will be inflation, which only lets off steam. Because inflation sort of pulls… well, it’s like a default. And I’m not talking about hyperinflation. I’m talking 10–20% inflation over a period. We just went through that. That actually knocked about 10% of GDP off our debt. We might need more next time. So it lets some steam off, but if you’re still spending too much and you haven’t fixed anything you’re back in the problem.\n\nThat’s what’s going on now. We had some steam let off, but it wasn’t enough. I think when it happens again, markets will be very unforgiving about it. They’ll look at us and say, “You are not to be trusted.” So it’ll raise the interest rate more, our debt will build up faster. I think at that point… There’s this saying about Americans attributed to Winston Churchill: we always do the right thing after we try everything else. I suspect we’ll try other things.\n\nJust for the audience, there are four ways we could get out of the debt: We could default, which you don’t think is likely... But really good for my book. Already you timed this one so well. I’ll be shorting the market when your next one comes out. ...Financial repression. I guess you could actually cut the deficit. Or inflation. You’re saying if there’s another round of inflation, then after that...\n\nWhat everyone calls austerity. By the way, this word “austerity” that progressives use whenever you ignore debt building up and spend whatever you want, “austerity” is when you don’t do that. I think Ezra Klein’s book Abundance actually makes the point that there are costs and benefits to a lot of things. This “austerity” language pretends there are no costs to having your debt be higher and only benefits. So yes, that’s what everyone else has to do. We’ve gone longer than most without doing it.\n\nIf it's going to be a financial crisis and financial crises are this bad… Inflation crisis. A financial crisis is the private sector, and the public sector bails out the private sector. So, the government, we’re not going to default. We're going to inflate, or do financial repression, or baby steps austerity or something. We're not going to have a crisis like Greece had. That’s just wrong. But inflation's not pleasant. Why wouldn’t we?\n\nBecause we can print money. We can honor our debts. We just never have to default. Greece was using the euro and didn’t have control. Japan was using its own currency and it didn’t default. They had a financial crisis, not a debt crisis. They never defaulted on their government debt in that period.\n\nI’m not sure if they ever did. I’m sorry, they did in World War II. Of course, Japan defaulted on its government debt in World War II. That’s an interesting story. But it was a financial crisis they had. Financial crisis is what’s making your banking system not work, lending to innovators not work, lending to dynamic companies not work.\n\nBen Bernanke wrote at the time a thought piece about this. He didn’t really have numbers. He conjectured that was why the Great Depression was so bad. When Milton Friedman, one of the great economists of all time, looked at the Great Depression, he said: “You didn’t print enough money. You tightened the money supply too much.&quot;\n\nAnd Ben came along 25 years later. He was a classmate of mine in graduate school. I had the office next to him at Princeton. He came along and wrote this amazing paper. Again, it was just a thought piece, which is not a typical economics paper. He said, “If it was just that you didn’t print enough money, eventually wages and prices would adjust. Yeah, maybe it wouldn’t happen in a year, maybe it wouldn’t happen in two years, but the Depression took 10 years. How can that be?” He made this conjecture. There’s been a lot of subsequent work showing it. Again, there’s a lot of debate about this, let me be careful.\n\nBut I certainly view the weight of evidence as saying financial crises are really bad, which has led us to the situation in the United States where we’ve gotten a little happy-go-lucky about bailing everyone out. I would describe Treasury and Federal Reserve policy today as, “When in doubt, bail it out.” Because they saw what happened. But as your financial sector grows, that will lead to a problem someday. It did, of course, in the Silicon Valley Bank case. It continues to have echoes of that.\n\nBut I think an inflation crisis is more likely than a financial crisis, although these things are very hard to predict. You say in the book that we didn’t outgrow our World War II debt. What happened instead was that financial repression after the war, and then the inflation of the 1970s made our debt-to-GDP ratio… It should have been 70-something, but it ended up around 20-something instead. Of course, we just had inflation recently. Do you think there’s some irrationality in the market for US government debt already, given that we can forecast what’s going to happen here? They can read your book and see that inflation’s going to go up. They can look through history at what’s happened.\n\nDo you think there’s some irrationality in terms of what people are doing? I think, number one, is that they have too much faith in the independence of the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s been this amazing institution that’s evolved. It’s been the guardian of low inflation. We can argue about if it’s the right inflation or not. The Federal Reserve insists it’s very independent. The Supreme Court recently ruled that Trump couldn’t fire Powell, the head of the Fed. But I think they’re dreaming. There are so many ways Congress and the President could override the Fed, especially if they declare some kind of wartime or “war-on-pandemic” situation.\n\nThough I wonder from the politician’s perspective, maybe the independence of the Fed gives them a convenient way to pass the buck that they’re actually happy about. They can say, “Ah, I’d love to do this irresponsible thing, but I can’t because of the Fed. It’s out of my hands.” That’s for sure. That’s why Trump bashes the Fed. It’s not the only reason he does it. I think he actually disagrees with them. But he feels that bashing the Fed, if there’s a recession which there might be, gives him someone to blame for not lowering interest rates.\n\nIt depends if we run into a world where interest rates start creeping up… Right now, the 10-year rate is around 4.5%. That’s the nominal rate. The inflation-indexed one is a little over 2%. The 30-year rate is around 5%. I think those are going to drift up. And that makes mortgage rates go up, student loans go up, car loans go up, business loans go up. It’s painful. The question is, at what point does that pain become real? As I mentioned, this would be catalyzed if we’re hit by a shock, where you can somewhat take back independence temporarily from the Fed.\n\nI think it’s easier to do than people think. Given that I think shocks are going to happen—maybe AGI brings a shock we don’t yet imagine—people trust in Fed independence too much. Now, I love Fed independence. I actually wrote the first paper on why you should have an independent central bank back when\n\n\nThere were virtually no independent central banks. I was a pawn at the Federal Reserve. I’m talking my own book when I say it’s a great idea. I don’t mean my “book” book, I mean my human capital.\n\nI like to say that the Federal Reserve fights for its independence every day. I hear senators say, “They’re idiots.” I hear people in Silicon Valley say, “They’re idiots. We should bring them under the Treasury.” I used to hear that just from progressives. But now I’ve heard that recently from some tech titans, that “Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, he’s smarter than Powell. Why don’t we let him run things?” They could.\n\nIt does seem like the Fed works really well as it exists now. It’s independent. Sure, there are people who criticize its actions as you say. But on the whole, it seems like a reliable institution that makes smart calls. They can be wrong, of course, but it seems so much more competent than much of the rest of government. If you wanted to replicate how the Fed works—if you wanted other parts of government to work that way—is there something we could do? Or is it more of a human capital problem than an independence problem?\n\nLike, bankers and economists are really smart. I don’t know if you could replicate that in the Department of Education or the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOne of the things the Fed has is this simple barometer that everybody sees. They don’t really see it, but they have a feeling. They see gasoline prices, that's probably how they decide what inflation is. But they have this simple barometer. Mind you, particularly in recent years, progressives have wanted the Fed to solve inequality, social justice, and the environment. But they have one barometer that they kind of control over the long run, not in the short run but over the long run. So that makes it a little easier to say, “You wanted us to have low inflation.” Whereas so many other things the government does might be making everybody better off, but they’re making some people more better off. Maybe some people aren’t better off at all. It suddenly becomes very political.\n\nNobody elected the Fed, so it’s harder to make those decisions. I’m obviously a technocrat, or I side with technocrats. My students are technocrats. I think way more things should be like that. But if you wanted to do that, suppose you get called by the Pentagon tomorrow and they say, “We want to run the Pentagon like the Fed.” What do you tell them to do?\n\nI was going to say, the Pentagon? I’m not speaking about the current Pentagon, but just up till now. I haven’t looked closely but it’s been run pretty darn well. The military’s pretty efficient. There are people who tell me, “Okay, Elon Musk can take a payload into space at 15% of—or maybe one-fifteenth of—what NASA does. Why don’t we let Elon Musk run the Pentagon?” There may be something to that.\n\nI think to some extent—and maybe I’m defending them too much—but you never know where the next blow is going to come from. It always looks like a lot of your stuff is wasted, you built up. But your enemy is looking at what you have. Where are you weak? Where are you strong? So I wouldn’t have picked the Pentagon as the obvious thing. But let’s say crypto regulation, that would be a good example. Why don’t we have something more independent there? Instead, as you well know, it’s been overrun by politics. In fact, there’s this huge thing going on right now. I don’t know how it’s going to play out. The Fed has been protected, though not as much as you’d think. But Trump got to the Supreme Court and was told he can fire the head of any agency. I assume, by inference, he can also fire anybody at any agency.\n\nI think that’s a terrible mistake. We need to have independent agencies. You have an evaluation process. They answer to Congress. If they go off in the wrong direction, you try to fix it. But to just have everything switch every four years? That’s really very worrisome.\n\nBefore Trump—maybe for intrinsic reasons, maybe because of norms—it was really hard to fire people anyway. That didn’t produce remarkable competence across the government.\n\nLet me try to consolidate some of the things you mentioned. Maybe it’s really important to structure more of the government like that. If you're running a department, you have just one target like the Fed’s 2% inflation target. That’s all you have to do. Don’t worry about anything else.\n\nI do think it’s impressive that the Fed has avoided mission creep. It seems like every institution in the world falls into mission creep—companies, government departments…\n\nOh, they haven’t avoided it. They’ve been under incredible pressures. Obviously, things have changed.\n\nBut I talk about this a bit in my book. You go through the working papers and research coming out of the various Federal Reserves and it's all about inequality, the environment, social justice. You’d be strained to find a paper about monetary policy during that period, because they were under pressure. Part of being independent is bending with the wind.\n\nBut they’ve managed to keep their core competency, their core function of setting monetary policy independent. No, it’s been amazing. But it is a constant fight.\n\nYou can go to a country like Turkey. I don’t know what the inflation rate is today, but it hovered up toward 100%. And Erdoğan—the president of Turkey—would fire the head of the central bank every year. Every time they tried to raise interest rates, he’d fire them. You can find other countries like that. So we’ve been lucky. But you can’t count on that continuing.\n\nApart from the political pressure problems from the outside, you mentioned watching your younger colleagues or younger economists writing working papers at the Fed about these other issues like inequality or climate change. From the inside, given what the younger people in this profession care about, do you expect the competence or the focus to just decline by default, given the new generation?\n\nNo, this was a wake-up call. There was a blog that Hoover did. They looked at the most-used words in our big annual meetings. There’s this thing called the American Economic Association meetings. Everybody goes. They took all the abstracts and titles from the last 15 years and the word inflation had not appeared until this year.\n\nBut why are you optimistic about when they get in charge...?\n\nThere’s an intellectual market. This was a huge miss and there’s a market for figuring it out. One of the good things about the American university system—at least in the sciences, and I’ll speak for economics—is that things drift off but if something is way wrong—and they were certainly way wrong about inflation, I believe, and way wrong about interest rates and debt—then there’s some rebalancing. We have a very competitive system of publishing. We have a seminar system that’s just ruthless. There’s a debate around it. It’s not settled, and maybe I’m wrong and they’re right but it’s definitely being debated now.\n\nWhereas 10 years ago, I think I was like a lone voice in the wilderness saying these things might happen again. I would teach inflation to my students. They’d sit there patiently. It was like I was teaching them the music of Fred Astaire or something. They’d go, “Okay, it’s the 21st-century, the Internet, that can never happen.”\n\nOr I’d teach debt. If I had foreign students, they were all having problems. But the American students were like, we can just do whatever we want. But it’s changed.\n\nGoing back to the potential future problems, if we do go the financial repression route and not the inflation route, how bad will that be? As you were saying, after World War II we had financial repression. But that was when we had the highest growth ever. On the other hand, China and Japan, it seems like a lot of their problems might be caused by the misallocation of capital that financial repression created. Do you have some intuition about how much we screw ourselves over with that route, as opposed to inflation?\n\nWe’ll start with World War II but it’s never just one thing, obviously. There were a lot of things.\n\nSo with World War II first of all, financial repression was easy. The financial markets had been destroyed by the Great Depression. World War II became something of a command-and-control economy. There are a lot of interesting papers about World War II that show that Americans just worked really enthusiastically. There was real patriotism in the production. I’m not saying we’re not now, but back then they were able to fill factory jobs that we probably couldn’t even fill today. As we emerged from World War II we had all the soldiers come home. That’s a huge growth lift. We didn’t manage it perfectly. We actually had quite a bit of inflation during that period. The financial markets, as you grew up in and as young people know them today, didn’t exist back then. The world has changed a lot.\n\nDoes that mean US growth would have been even higher after World War II if we had just kept the government debt or figured out some other way to deal with it and let financial markets develop earlier? Maybe. We didn’t have any financial crises for a long time because the markets were very repressed. Oftentimes, when you get a financial crisis it’s exactly when somebody comes along and says, “I know, I can make us grow way faster. Let’s just take away all the rules and regulations overnight.”\n\nThat happened in one country after another. It works, until you blow up. So you’d have to say that, by and large, it was managed rather well. We grew. The rest of the world grew. It took time for private markets to develop. One thing I should’ve emphasized was that our debt was very high after World War II, about what it is now. But there was nothing else. There wasn’t all this private debt. That had all been defaulted on. I’m being slightly hyperbolic but maybe it was 50% of GDP altogether. Everything else, state and local debt, had been defaulted on. Now, it’s bigger than the federal debt by a wide margin. So it was a very different world, putting in financial repression back then, compared to now when that’s a big part of our business models in the financial sector.\n\nJust to make sure we’ve completed the concrete scenarios, basically your prediction is that there’ll be some crisis, some surge of inflation, then there’ll be austerity. And then what happens? Is growth really slow afterward because the government can’t spend as much? What do the next few decades look like in your world?\n\nI think it will be quite a wake-up call for Americans, having to adjust under difficult circumstances. Most likely, we get hit by a shock. We want to borrow a lot. The bonds are rising faster than they did the other times we did. And we're not able to do as much. It’s not the end of the world. During the European debt crisis from 2010 to 2012, most European countries raised their retirement ages. They didn’t do it right away. They did it 10 or 15 years out. There’s stuff you can do.\n\nSo I want to be careful here and say it’s not like the end of the world, but it’ll be pretty unpleasant. This will affect the entire world, since the global system is very dollar-centric. It won’t be good for our franchise, the dollar being so used everywhere. As other countries start using the dollar less, our interest rates will climb even higher. I’m an academic. I’m not trying to push my ideas by being maximally hysterical. But hysterical is definitely within the realm of possibility here.\n\nWhat I’m saying is more likely than not, not that it’s not definitely going to happen. We could have growth. We could have a whole lot of high-skill immigration. We could make changes. There are a lot of things that could go well. On the growth thing, Europe’s growth has been pretty bad after 2010. Japan obviously has had pretty bad growth after their crisis. Why will we be in a different position if we do have this kind of crisis? Why will growth continue apace?\n\nNo, it’s going to cause a pause in growth. The main reason debt crises happen is we don’t have an automated system of working it out. When the stock market crashes it’s painful, you’re looking around for who got hurt. But when you have debt crashes, we take five years, ten years, to figure out who owes what. It’s that process of allocating the losses that causes problems.\n\nThat, by the way, is why so many people thought, “China’s fine. The president will just tell everyone what it is.” That turns out to be not as true as they thought.\n\nIs it possible to believe both that AGI is near and that America’s fiscal position is untenable? What do you mean by saying AGI is coming?\n\nAny job that can be done purely through computers is automated. So white-collar work, the work we do even, is automated within 20 years. Anytime you get a big productivity boost, it’s fantastic. If it comes quickly, yes that can solve problems. I will say that historically, there have been lots of times when countries had good growth—even higher than their interest rates—and they still got into trouble because fiscal policy isn’t mechanical. It\n\n\nIt’s political.\nIt’s about how much you spend, who wants what. It’s not an arithmetic question.\nLet me say it another way. Nobody ever defaulted or had high inflation because of arithmetic, because they couldn’t pay, or couldn’t have called in someone who knew what to do. They do it because of political pressures.\nI think if AGI came that fast and that big, it would make the populism phenomenon we’re facing now seem like nothing.\nIf AI is going to be massively deflationary—if it makes all these goods so much cheaper—should we be printing a bunch of money to still stick to 2% inflation? Or does that not matter anymore?\nWell, we certainly can run monetary policy the same way. You don’t automatically get deflation just because some goods are going down. You can do things to increase demand so that there are upward pressures on final prices. Even if the AI workers aren’t demanding anything, you can put in a lot of demand so firms charge a lot, not just for the services that AI is replacing but also for the raw minerals and materials that go in.\nFundamentally, when you have productivity, it makes it easier for the monetary authorities—the Federal Reserve—to deliver low inflation and good growth. That’s what they’re trying to do. It makes their job easier. And I think it takes the pressure off them—somewhat—to inflate, because things are going pretty well. So there aren't the same pressures.\nBut should they be trying to fight the deflation at all, in that world? Because traditionally we need inflation to root out the rentiers and to fight downward wage rigidity. But now the AIs have all the jobs, so we don’t need to worry about that. There are a bunch of biases humans have that we need inflation to correct for. Do we even need that in a world with AI?\nOkay, that is a very good point. Frankly, Keynes founded modern macroeconomics. He was an incredible Renaissance person, having both sides of the brain.\nOne of his insights that just transformed things was this.\nBefore Keynes, we used what we now call general equilibrium models: demand and supply, prices moving to keep everything in line. But Keynes was looking at the Great Depression and said, “Prices should be coming down. But they’re not. Why aren't they?”\nThat’s really a cornerstone. At the end of the day, it’s mostly human behavior. It’s mostly workers. So if you have these docile AI workers—they’re not workers, they’re just firms—and if you have firms that are willing to let prices fall, then certainly you can do that. I mean, we’re still going to have some human workers? I don't know.\nBut here’s a question on what monetary policy should be. Do you think interest rates are going to go up or down? When we had deflation last time—from demand-deflation, like after the financial crisis and the pandemic—interest rates went down.\nMy intuition here is that interest rates would need to go up. I mean real interest rates, real inflation-adjusted interest rates. And then, deflation isn’t such a problem. You just don’t let the interest rates go up as much.\nLast time, interest rates went to basically zero. That’s a whole other line of discussion. They felt they couldn’t lower them into significantly negative territory. So they were sort of paralyzed. There was this deflation, or at least too-low inflation. Monetary authorities thought they knew how to create inflation, but that’s always been by cutting interest rates lower. When they hit a bottom, they don’t.\nI have a whole book about negative interest rates and that’s a whole other thing. If we’re imagining real interest rates going up, then it’s not much of a technical problem. You just let the interest rates rise a little less so you’re not getting deflation.\nDo you expect interest rates to go up? Because one factor is that you want to invest in the future, the future has so much more potential. Another is that maybe you want to consume more now, because you know you’re going to be wealthier in the future anyway. You might as well start spending as much as you can now.\nI think AGI and AI are upward pressures on interest rates for lots of crude reasons. The huge energy needs. Traditionally, when you did a lot of investment it raised wages, but it’s possible— there are economists like Daron Acemoglu who’ve shown it can go both ways, it’s not difficult to show that—if you're really just substituting for workers, it’s making capital more valuable, you just invest even more.\nThe pressures on monetary policy will depend a little bit on that. In principle, it makes life easier. If it did push the interest rate down to zero, there are interesting questions around that, but maybe your audience might not be as fascinated by them as I am.\nLet’s talk about it a little bit. If we expect interest rates to go up because of AI, what should the government be doing right now to be ready for that? Should they be locking in hundred-year bonds at the current interest rates since they’re only going up from here?\nI’m going to get to that. But first, just where we are… I follow interest rates today all the time. Maybe a lot of people who listen to you don’t. But let’s talk about inflation-adjusted interest rates. There’s a 10-year bond that’s indexed to the inflation rate, issued by our Treasury. Inflation-indexed debt is only about 10% of our total debt. There are tax considerations—it’s not perfect—but it’s a pretty good measure of what we call the real interest rate. It had gone to minus one at one point after the pandemic. It averaged zero for about 10 years, from 2012 to 2021. And it’s higher now.\nThat is, for a macroeconomist, the biggest question in the world. Because it affects asset prices, it affects risk, it affects volatility.\nI regard it as just a normalization. I think it was likely to happen. If you go around and talk to some of my younger colleagues, or folks at other places, there’s quite a debate about that. A lot of people think, “We’re getting old, we’re not inventing anything...” I know you’ve just been arguing against that and good for you.\nI tend to think interest rates are more likely to go up than down, going forward. I’m talking about these long-term interest rates—the Federal Reserve just sets the overnight interest rate—these long-term interest rates are set by markets, and I think they’re more likely to go up. But I think AGI is only a piece of it. Debt is rising everywhere. There’s the remilitarization of much of the world. Needing to deal with climate change. Eventually if we’re not dealing with it, then we’re dealing with climate disasters.\nThere’s growing populism, geopolitical fracturing, many things.\nI tend to think interest rates are going to go up but not just for the good reason that we’ve gotten more creative and that everything’s going to be better.\nYou've said in the book that you expect a rebalancing from US equities to foreign equities. US equities have outpaced foreign stocks for the last couple of decades.\nYou say you expect this to change or that there will be some rebalancing. What causes that?\nWhat I say very concretely is that when the dollar is really high, you should expect the euro to go up. I feel strongly about that. My first important paper was about exchange rates. That’s why the book’s about exchange rates. When Japan’s really weak or when the dollar’s really strong—it’s very hard to predict exchange rates—but I think the euro will do well.\nThere’s a lot of room to catch-up in Europe. I actually think I’m nuanced in what I say in the book. Trump hadn’t been elected yet, but I say Europe seems to be under pressure to re-militarize. I was aware that Harris was probably going to cut the US defense budget, so that would put pressure on them.\nRe-militarizing would actually be good for the euro. It would be good for technology in Europe. It would give them more geopolitical power in the system.\nNow, just so your listeners can calibrate this, my first book was a very mathematical one, Foundations of International Macroeconomics. In theory, you should diversify. You shouldn’t put all your money in the United States. I did a video with Zbigniew Brzezinski, Mika Brzezinski’s father. For those who don’t know, he was Carter’s Kissinger.\nI did a video with him that Merrill Lynch produced. It was about why international diversification could be good. What they got me to say was very, very limited. I feel quite fine about what I said. I wasn’t doing any consulting at the time, just academic work. I didn’t do speeches, I didn’t do consulting. I talked to central banks a bit, but I didn’t do anything for money. But I did get paid for that.\nIt circulated half a million copies of it. A lot of my friends teased me and said I would’ve made a lot more money if I hadn’t followed my own advice. I can think of plenty of other examples like that.\nBut yes, my instinct is that—this idea that our US premium should just keep getting bigger and bigger—these things have some regression to the mean. Maybe not with AI all being in the US, I don’t know.\nIs it that you’re predicting that the S&P keeps growing at 8%, but foreign equities do even better?\nI’m just going to safely say foreign equities do better than dollar equities.\nBut not because the growth in US equities slows down, it’s just that foreign equities do even better?\nLook, you have a lot of friends who spend all their time doing this. I wouldn’t pretend to. I hold a very neutral portfolio because I talk to policymakers and world leaders even on occasion. I don’t want to be someone who’s talking about regulating Bitcoin and owning a lot of Bitcoin, to pick a random example.\nSo I wouldn’t regard myself as great at this. But yes, I think there’s a case for international diversification, particularly into Europe at this point because they have so much potential catch-up.\nJust as in California, where you’re from, there’s a little bit of dim awareness that it might be overregulated and you might want to do things differently, I feel that’s happening in Europe.\nIf you look internationally, if you'd been betting on catch-up, I wonder how you’d backtest it. There’s some intuition there that if you’re poor and you’re further from the frontier, it makes sense that it would be easier for you to catch up. But there’s another intuition that if you’ve been persistently behind the frontier, there must be some deep endogenous reason.\nYou’re absolutely right. For example, Asia has a lot more governance problems on the whole. There’s a reason that their price-earnings ratios are lower, because you don’t trust the governance. You’re right.\nThat’s fair and a lot of people are just betting on that. But I don’t think Europe is so hopeless that it can’t pull it together.\nI can make a comparison. I'm a basketball fan. The Boston Celtics just got crushed by the Knicks, just before we’re taping this. Part of it is because our star, Jayson Tatum, was injured. You may not have gotten any better, Europe in this case, but if somebody’s hobbling the United States—I do think that’s going on to some extent now—you do better.\nIs there some institutional reform we could make that would get us out of this political equilibrium we're stuck in.\nBoth parties, when they're in power, are incentivized to increase the debt and there's no institutional check on that proclivity.\nThere have been a lot of people who’ve tried this, for example by having what are called fiscal councils. I did a paper once with Julia Pollak, who’s a brilliant economist, when she was an undergraduate. That was quite a while ago. A number of countries experimented with fiscal councils, but it hasn't worked.\nThe country that's done the most with this is probably the United Kingdom. George Osborne, when he was Chancellor, set up this fiscal authority. The big thing they did is they made predictions so the government doesn’t get to make up different predictions.\nYou don’t necessarily have to go by their numbers, but they got to say whatever they thought.\nOur CBO does not get to do that quite the same. Our Congressional Budget Office is very good, but they are constrained to believe what Congress tells them.\nIf Congress says, “We’re putting in this tax hook, but it’s going to go away after ten years,” or “We’re doing this policy, it’s all going to change,” then they’re forced to use those parameters. The UK version is more independent. There are lots of complaints about it, but that’s a very poor man’s fiscal authority, just somebody who says, “This is what your deficit looks like.”\nIt’s the same thing as our CBO, but with more independence. It helps. But I think it has to go to our electoral system, right? Our campaign financing. Do we have term limits?\nYou think that would help? I think, if anything, if you’re longer in office, you might have a more long-term incentive. To the extent that a lot of the deficit\n\n\nProblems are caused by populism. I don’t know how much campaign finance would help. Maybe you’re right. I don’t have a magical solution to this. It’s all over the world. Nobody's finding a particularly great solution to it. The only encouraging thing is that these things go in waves. So maybe this one will end. But we’re certainly in a really difficult situation right now.\n\nSomebody asked me, “If you were advising a Republican president or something, what would you do? What problem would you face?” The biggest problem is that in a few years there’s going to be a Democratic president. They’re going to do exactly the opposite of what you wanted to do. It’s the same thing for the Democratic presidents. How do you have some continuity? How do you have policies put in place that the public can rely on?\n\nWe’ve done well in the United States in some ways because our government’s been kind of weak and hasn’t been doing stuff. The private sector can work around it. I’m not saying it’s perfect. There are lots of things we should do. But look, this is out of my paycheck, so to speak.\n\nYou're the former Chief Economist of the IMF! All right, but that’s economics. These are very political questions. Brexit’s an example of democracy gone amok. What a dumb idea. I don’t know if Brexit was right or wrong. I feel like we’ll know in 50 years. But you shouldn’t be able to do it with a simple majority vote. You should need a two-thirds vote, or something like that. There’s a whole government department here with people specializing in what we should do. Actually, I think there are experiments. Washington State experimented with different voting choices. Maine did. There are these ideas out there, but we’re a long way from converging on anything.\n\nIf you think people are underweighting how big the debt issue is, are you especially long on countries which have a low debt-to-GDP ratio, like Australia or Norway?\n\nIt's not the only thing going on in the world, your debt is just one thing. Countries like Australia and Canada, for example, are what we call commodity exporters. They know that sometimes the sun shines and sometimes it's a dark winter. They don’t quite sell oil, but they sell some coal, natural gas, and some oil. They understand things move around and that they need to save for a rainy day. Norway is in a whole other league. But yes, there are lots of factors to whether a country will do well. The lower-debt countries have less of a problem. But Canada and Australia face very volatile income streams because of commodities, so they tend to be more nervous about debt. By the way, they also have a lot of housing debt, in Canada, for example, that's been a big problem.\n\nBut I’m bullish on the United States. Don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying everyone should leave the United States and go to Canada, although my wife thinks that sometimes, but for other reasons.\n\nWhen I was playing chess in the late 1960s, I was living by myself in Europe. Nixon got elected. I felt about Nixon the way I think a lot of people in your generation or at least millennials feel about Trump. I didn’t want to come back to the United States. So there are a lot of people who talk that way. But I think the United States is great.\n\nCountries that are smaller, that aren’t the reserve currency, that don’t have access to these deep pockets of domestic and foreign borrowing—and all of those countries fit into that framework, they need to be more careful. This \"exorbitant privilege,\" as you talk about it, is it possible that one way in which it's bad for us is that it allows, or incentivizes us, to take on more debt than it's wise to? And especially if this isn’t a permanent advantage we have. When you’re at the top, you take out this cheap debt. And over time you lose your reserve status, or it weakens at least, and you have to refinance that debt at higher interest rates. So in the short term, you’re incentivizing this behaviour which is not sustainable in the long run. Is there a political economy explanation for why that might be bad for us?\n\nI've heard that argument, but I basically think it's great for us. It's not just the government. It’s all of us who borrow less. Do we wish we were paying higher interest rates? Probably most people who are getting a mortgage right now feel like our interest rates are plenty high. They don't need to see them higher. I think with the exorbitant privilege, there are some drawbacks we don't need to get into. But it's basically incredibly fantastic if you owe $37 trillion as our government does, to be paying half a percent to a percent less. We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nOur ability to see what's going on everywhere. A lot of what our spying does is using our exorbitant privilege and the dollar network. Sanctions. I mentioned, I was in my teens at the end of the 1960s when I didn't want to come back. One reason I didn’t want to come back was the Vietnam War was pretty terrifying. I had many friends get drafted. Their brains got fried by heroin even if they didn’t get killed. And, sanctions. I'm not saying that we've solved all our wars with sanctions. But make no mistake, we have used that in place of military intervention a few times. So that’s been great. I think losing that, and not appreciating how important that is, is a terrible blunder that we might be making right now.\n\nThis is a very naive question. I know you address it at length in your book. I’ll ask the question in the most straightforward way and then you can explain what's going on. How should I think about the fact that we are basically giving the rest of the world pieces of paper and we're getting real goods and services in exchange?\n\nSure, at a high level you can say that they're getting this liquidity or they're getting this network and that's what makes it worth it. But I don’t know, are we fundamentally getting away with something?\n\nSo just to note, the United Kingdom is not the reserve currency. They're not the dominant currency. They used to be, a hundred years ago. They look a lot like us now, with big current account deficits. That’s actually why Trump was able to strike a deal with them. Because they weren’t really running a surplus against us, anyway. They’re over-financialized, even more than we are.\n\nThe core of the benefit we get is that we borrow by issuing safe assets—if you want to call our debt safe—and we invest in risky stuff. Charles Kindleberger wrote one of the great books on crises. I had him as a professor at MIT. He called us bankers to the world. He said “Yep, we’re running this deficit, they’re holding a lot of our Treasury bills, but we are making money hand over fist.” It’s the same thing as the equity premium where you hold stocks and it’s not always, but on average better than holding bonds. So that’s been very good. You have the fact that the dollar is very liquid, the markets.\n\nSay you're a Silicon Valley firm and you're big enough to issue debt internationally. I don’t know if any Silicon Valley firms ever issue debt, but if you did, people will buy it because it’s in dollars. If you're the same firm in France, forget it. They don’t want to hold euros. Even if you promise to pay in dollars, they’re not happy about it because your income isn't in dollars. So it’s been fantastic. This is something that's been debated.\n\nStephen Miran, who was a Harvard student, he's the head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Very smart guy. He's made this clever argument that because everybody loves our currency, it makes us less competitive in everything else. It partly hollowed out our manufacturing and that’s terrible. There’s a little bit of truth to that. First of all, the dollar goes like this, so it’s not always high. Second, I mentioned the United Kingdom is kind of in the same boat. We’re good at a lot of things. We’re good at tech. Tech makes the dollar stronger, make no mistake. We’re good at biotech, agriculture. We’re good at a lot of other things that make the dollar high. And if you’re good at these things, it’s harder to be good at manufacturing. It bids up the cost of everything. On the whole, we’re performing this banking function. That’s really the big thing. It’s been going on since the ’50s and ’60s. That’s the core of our so-called exorbitant privilege.\n\nThere’s a really interesting book by Charles Mann. I think it's called 1493. It’s about how during the Ming Dynasty in 17th-century China, they kept issuing different paper currencies and it was super unstable. People in China wanted a reliable medium of exchange. So tens of thousands of tons of silver from the New World, from the Spanish, would be exchanged for enormous amounts of real goods exported from China. So from the Spanish perspective, they’re getting shiploads and shiploads of real goods, and all they’re giving up is this medium of exchange. I don’t know how analogous that is to the current situation.\n\nThere are countries like Ecuador and others that dollarize. They literally use the dollar and they need dollars. We’re able to have them hold dollars. It’s not silver, but we print it and they pay very low interest rates. They’re holding Treasury bills, not physical dollars. Yeah, it’s fantastic for us. We definitely pay less on our debt because of that.\n\nThat’s a fascinating example you bring up. The Chinese actually invented the printing press. They invented paper currency way before the Europeans. But then, what do you know, they kept printing a lot of it and had a lot of inflation. I hadn’t read that book, but it’s a great example. I knew they were using silver, but that number is bigger than I had heard.\n\nFinal question. A big part of your book discusses the different countries which seemed at different times to be real competitors to America. You talk about the Soviet Union, Japan, China today. We've discussed why they didn’t pan out. We can go into the details on any one of those examples, but in the big picture is there some explanation that generalizes across all these examples of why America has been so competitive? Or why it's been so hard to displace?\n\nIt’s not just that we’ve stayed on top, we’ve just gone like this. Remember, in the 1970s, Europe actually peeled away from the dollar bloc. But the rest of the world started globalizing. China globalized. Eventually the Soviet Union, and the dollar just colonized all these places. They were all holding dollar debt, using dollars. It’s much bigger than even the British pound was when the sun never set on the British Empire. So it’s been amazing and surprising to people like myself. If you read what everyone was saying at the time, it was just that it kept going up. That our share of everything kept getting bigger and bigger.\n\nDefinitely, to some extent, we’ve been lucky. We talked about Japan. I think China made a big mistake by sticking to the dollar so long. Europe should have delayed bringing Greece into the Euro, because their crisis wouldn’t have been so bad. So we’ve been fortunate with blunders by our opposition. We’ve done some good things. But I think the thing Americans forget is that we have been lucky a lot of times. I worry our luck is wearing thin.\n\nI quote a chess player—the great Bent Larsen, who was number two to Bobby Fischer when I was playing. He was asked, “Would you rather be lucky or good in a chess game?” And he said, “Both.” So I think Americans forget. They know we’re good and we are good. We’ve talked about dynamism, this secret sauce that we’ve had so far. But I think we’ve also been lucky. If you ran it all again, it didn’t have to go the same way.\n\nIt’s a very scary kind of luck. If it’s so easy for these other countries to make some mistake that causes them to totally fall behind, it should update you in favor of the idea that, in general, it’s easy for a country to get itself in a rut. It’s like the Fermi estimate thing. The fact that you don’t see other alien civilizations is actually very scary, because it suggests that there’s some kind of filter which makes it really hard to keep your civilization going.\n\nI hope not, but we’ll see. It’s certainly been amazing how the dollar’s done and how the US has done. I hope we continue, but we are doing a lot of things right now… I don’t think Trump is the cause of the dollar being in gentle decline. That’s just wrong. I think it would’ve happened with Harris winning. But he is the president at the moment, and things like Liberation Day… I’ve talked to tech people who think it’s just brilliant. I understand that. We can debate it. I’m happy to debate it with them. We look at the rule of law. Okay, I’m sitting at Harvard University. Naturally it feels that way. But also we talked about the president being able to remove all the independent agencies. It used to be that if you were a foreign investor and you invested in the United States,\n\n\nYou thought you’d get your money back.\nMaybe the stock would’ve gone down.\nMaybe the real estate you bought would’ve gone down.\nBut you’d get paid.\nI think we were more exceptional than most about that.\nThat’s in doubt now.\nThere’s no question.\nThe book’s about a lot of things besides exorbitant privilege, the whole arc of the US.\nBut when I was telling people about the book, “I don’t know, I’m looking at the numbers, I’m looking at what China’s doing, I’m reading about Europe and their central bank digital currency.\nI think we’re going downhill.”\nI showed it to academics, I showed it to financial people, I showed it to tech people.\nThey said, “You’re nuts.”\nThey didn’t want to think about it.\nI don’t know if I’m right.\nBut I think it’s worth thinking about.\nWhen I was in China, I met up with some venture capitalists there and they were quite depressed in general.\nEven founders say it’s hard to raise money.\nI was asking them why, and they said investors don’t want to invest because even if you invest in the next Alibaba, who’s to say the government doesn’t cancel the IPO?\nThey’re in trouble.\nYeah.\nI think Europe has a bright future in this context, of being the team that doesn’t have as many injured players.\nBut yeah, China… it’s not going to be forever, but I think for five or ten years they’re going to stay in trouble.\nOkay.\nThank you so much for sitting down with me and also answering all my questions.\nI’m sure there are many misconceptions and naive questions and so forth.\nI appreciate your patience and you educating me on this topic.\nNo, it’s an honor to be on your famous podcast.\nI heard from so many young people when I told them I was talking to you.\nThey were like, “You're with Dwarkesh?\nJust fly back from here!\nDo whatever you need to do!”\nSo I’m glad you were able to come here.\nIt’s really been interesting, and I’m glad to learn more about everything you’re doing.\nThe honor’s mine.\nIt was great to be able to travel here and speak with you.\n",

It envisions a future where \"Mega Steve\"-like AI systems, processing vast amounts of data, will outperform human CEOs. The discussion highlights how AI could revolutionize social organization, similar to the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to modern corporations. The episode also explores the massive scale of AI firms compared to current human-led companies and the profound differences in evolvability between AI and human-led organizations.",

They discuss the devastating impact of plagues, particularly the Plague of Justinian, and how it decimated the population. They also explore the role of climate change, specifically a mini Ice Age caused by volcanic eruptions, which led to famine and societal instability. Harper and Dwarkesh delve into the economic aspects, including the use of slave labor and its impact on technological advancement. They also touch on the broader implications of agriculture on human health and cognitive function, and the potential for future pandemics. Finally, they discuss the use of AI tools in historical research and the concept of de-extinction.",

They challenge the common framing of \"alignment\" and the plausibility of an intelligence explosion, instead focusing on the potential for rapid economic growth. They discuss their 2045+ timelines, the limitations of current AI models, and the factors that will drive future advancements. The conversation covers topics such as the automation of work, the impact of AI on the economy, and the challenges of predicting the future.",

They discuss the potential for rapid advancements in AI, focusing on the role of coding in triggering the explosion and the economic and societal shifts that could follow. The conversation covers topics such as the race between countries like China and the US, the challenges of AI alignment, and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, including the risks of misaligned AI and the need for careful monitoring and regulation. They also touch on Daniel's experience leaving OpenAI and the importance of transparency and whistleblowing in the AI field.",

Daniel resigned from OpenAI in 2024, rejecting a non-disparagement clause and risking millions in equity to speak out about AI safety.\n\nWe discuss misaligned hive minds, Xi and Trump waking up, and automated Ilyas researching AI progress.\n\nI came in skeptical, but I learned a tremendous amount by bouncing my objections off of them.\n\nI highly recommend checking out their new scenario planning document: https://ai-2027.com/\n\nAnd Daniel's \"What 2026 looks like,\" written in 2021: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like\n\nRead the transcript: https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/scott-daniel\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dwarkesh-podcast/id1516093381\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/4JH4tybY1zX6e5hjCwU6gF?si=6efdf727ae6c48ae\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSponsors\n\n* WorkOS helps today’s top AI companies get enterprise-ready.

          "description": "How the rivalry between China and India reshaped Asia forever\n\nI’m thrilled to launch a trilogy of episodes: a lecture series by Professor Sarah Paine of the Naval War College, each followed by a deep Q&A. \n\nIn this first episode, Prof Paine talks about key decisions by Khrushchev, Mao, Nehru, Bhutto, & Lyndon Johnson that shaped the whole dynamic of South Asia today. This is followed by a Q&A with me. \n\nCome for the spy bases, shoestring nukes, and insight about how great power politics impacts every region. \n\nHuge thanks to Substack for hosting this! \n\nSponsors\n\n- Today’s episode is brought to you by Scale AI. Scale partners with the U.S. government to fuel America’s AI advantage through their data foundry.
