    "cleanText": "[Music]\nOkay, let's move on to Merge 2. There was a piece of news in mobile gamer biz again where one of the trail mix GMs, Felicity Gracie Hurst, gets on to talk about a lot of Love and Pies, which is a game that has done really well in the merge 2 space. Has been one piece of news, and it was interesting on why she's doing this PR push or what's up at Trailmix. And then we got a separate piece of news from Tristan Clark, who is a co-founder at Trailmix, reporting on LinkedIn that this is going to be his last week at Trailmix. So there's two things going on here. There's the merge genre news and there's how Trailmix fits into it. Jen, what's going on in merge?\nYeah, so I took a look. I used to love this genre as a human. I have since pivoted to your favorite all-in hole and the royal kingdom and royal matches. Had no time left in my life to continue to play Merge 2. Uh, it's on fire. So, I looked at Sensor Tower US year-to-date data. So, that's what we're going to look at here. It is the number two top revenue subgenre in puzzle. It's number two right after the royal matches of the world. And more importantly, it's the number seven top revenue subgenre overall of all subgenres, right behind squad RPG. One of our favorites. Again, this is just US year to date. Love and Pies is a top seven game in Merge 2. Gossip Harbor's number one, $100 million year to date in the US alone. Super, super impressive.\nCrest, it's not mice nuts anymore, right?\nMhm.\nNot mice nuts. That is next one is just basically showing that the genre during the last 12 months has doubled in terms of in-app purchases, which is quite a growth, and you know, we're talking about declining market and this and that, but look at Merge 2 just growing. And then I put in few of the top games as well as Love and Pie to just see how well this Trailmix title has fared as the genre has doubled. So, Gossip Harbor is essentially the game that is driving the growth on the genre as a whole. And of course, there's plenty of new games that came in. Travel Town, Seaside Escape, Merge Mansion have been kind of holding steady, but Love and Pies has actually, you know, it's tiny compared those four largest one. Love and Pies has actually lost about 30% of its monthly revenue since the beginning of the year. So, it's not fairing too well for Trailmix. And looking at Merge Mansion, which is another Supercell-owned SL-backed company in the same genre, Metacore, right?\nMetacore. Yeah, they've been they've been holding steady. They used to be the number one. I think they took the position from Zingga, and now they're at number four. And so, everybody else is kind of keeping steady. Seaside grew a little bit, but it's really the Gossip Harbor that is absolutely just crushing.\nYeah, they're crushing it. And then Travel Town, uh, which was taken over by a Chinese company,\nTravel Town. Yeah, that's Israeli.\nOh, Israeli. Okay.\nYeah.\nWhat's going on in Puzzle is really interesting is that especially in the last year or so, it's really broken into all of these different subgenres where you can really get into what's working and what's not working within each of these. Love and Pies is basically the original for Merge 2. They're the OGs. That's what everyone copied. And I think they've just had a difficult time keeping up with what everyone else is doing and how they've really added in all the monetization. They've taken a lot of social casino monetization components, meta collections to to really drive the category. So, oh, let's go back to shooters cuz you know it's not a podcast with us if we don't talk about shooters.\nSo, uh, life service shooter game comes to a premature end, and this is Steel Hunters from Wargaming. It's a mech game that we actually covered to quite a detail on this TWIG episode a few episodes ago. We talked about Steel Hunters versus War Robots, and Chris Sides was actually a guest host on the podcast, and he came pretty hard at Steel Hunters, talking of their gunplay and how they used the UE5 templates, if I'm correct, what he was mentioning, and it felt very generic. It looked different, but the play was not that interesting. And he was right. So, it looks like Steel Hunters didn't make it. And Wargaming still continues with tanks and a little bit of ships. I don't remember if they have plates.\nWe need to talk about this next week, but I think the biggest story in all of this is Mecca Break, baby. Like, Mecca is on [ __ ] Steam. It broke over 100,000 CCUs. It is a Japanese free-to-play Mecca game, and you have a deep, deep layer of customization. It goes full, full eastern, and I think this thing Oh my god, I'm so excited to play this. I haven't I'm not deep enough in to provide a review. Let's talk about it next week. My aspirations for the Gundam franchise are held in this this video game.\nOh wow.\nIt looks really cool.\nWow. It's a shooter like action.\nLike but like you're like flying. But wait till we get to the home menus and look at progression is what I say.\nMecca break.\nOh\nyeah. Look at all the character customization. And let me tell you, this is uh different different cultural norms.\nYeah, they look really enhanced.\nReally enhanced. Yeah. Anime uh pushed to the limits.\nYeah.\nAll right. Well, in the hope of being somewhat positive about what's actually working in the game industry right now, I came up with a topic to talk about is like basically the top seven games outside of puzzle that have done well in the west for the last two years, mind you, are the following: Pokemon, TCG Pocket, Dark War Survival, Top Heroes, Kingshot, Archer 2, Capri Borrow Go, and Lassie Survival. And I know we've talked about kind of like the essences of these, but I just want to reiterate because I keep getting people saying kind of the same thing is that everyone seems to be wanting to build games that delight themselves, right? Versus games that actually do well in the marketplace. So, um, I came across some article that was written, I've never met this or heard about this person, Ailen Yaziki. Does anybody know her? It was actually a really, really well-written piece on two particular games, a Century Games, White Out Survival and then Kingshot. And I've been playing Kingshot like a [ __ ] crack addict. Part of the reason I wanted to talk about this, I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on this game for me. And the whole point of all these games is the same thing I've been talking about since [ __ ] we were in Turkey like three years ago, right, when IDFA happened. is that all these games have the same recipe. First of all, they're all made in China, right? Second, they are casual gameplay with deep monetization design, right? Full stop, right? And they are deep. And when I say deep, I mean deep. Like they have so many different elements of engagement on these games, spending syncs and you know, upgrade all these different mechanics and and systems that are geared towards building up your power level for your games. And so she wrote this piece about these two particular games and it's basically saying how the 4X genre is kind of evolving with like you know these hybrid casual mechanics which reduce complexity in terms of the funnel, but then it makes it again a much more deeper game when you get into it, right? By doing that, it's much easier to acquire users and and less expensive in in the hope to get the whales. And the whole concept here is that the fact is that the majority of the of the money is being generated by a very, very, very, very small percentage of the people, and so you need to capture them in some ways with deep monetization design. That is what's critical to this business. Right? So she kind of writes about this on on how the forex genre is evolving. Um, all I really wanted to say is that mass market gameplay helps bring people to the game, but the demonetization is what actually makes money for the game and justifies all the UA spend. And so again, stop focusing on Warcraft Rumble and games that delight. It's just all about figuring out ways of monetizing them. And even these games like Grow Garden is egregious. Absolutely.\nPeople have no idea. People have no idea. It is like the absolute worst in terms of extraction of all possible. Like the most casual game is [ __ ] gross. Absolutely gross. That's what it takes to make games successful nowadays. That's what it takes.\nBut that game is going to be here today, gone tomorrow. But these games are actually sticking around and growing and continue to attract user. So, I just wanted to say this is what's working in the marketplace right now at scaling outside of puzzle, right? Puzzle is kind of a different ballgame, but from a core type gameplay and game mechanics.\nI did a little webinar on the Grow Garden. I looked into that one cuz I worked on Farmville and it's basically Farmville for kids with Phil's love of monetization, rarity, scarcity. I mean the whole thing\nmutations stealing stealing stealing the live ops people don't understand there's a real live ops strategy in Grow Garden, there is\nnot only that there are chained offers remember these are very young developers like implementing the best of monetization practices\nand there is no place where there is not a tentacle that monetization will go in Roblox games\nand it's out of New Zealand, right? There's two teams, like there's the original developer, yeah, there's a 16-year-old kid and then someone else bought, I think, a share, and so they co-develop it, and there's there's some headcount on the project now. It's it's not just a small team anymore.\nYeah. One of the guys from the new company that took it over, he's a basically a Roblox influencer himself. And so once they took it over and I think they have like 49% of the game and he started to talk about it, it blew up. And then every Saturday morning and I think it's 7:00 a.m. Pacific time, you can just watch the CCU spike with the update. So every week they've got brand new live ops, brand new events, brand new things to buy. And the way that they do it is just, you know, like Phil, it's the deepest monetization that you would see in some of the hardcore games just added to this silly farming game. It would make the original Farmville developers from Zingga blush, you know, in terms of the monetization design. I mean, it is unfucking believable, right? It is sickening. Absolutely sickening. But again, it's going to be gone in a few months. I think like we're not even going to be talking about this in a few weeks. So, it's not a sustainable model, but it's certainly\nI think you're still missing the headline, Eric, which is Roblox's ability to grow hits like this. That's the real story here, which I think is interesting because they took someone from nothing to something based on organics basically alone.\nYeah. This is just like Zinga and Canvas on Facebook. This is exactly the same thing. You extract as much money as possible from the consumer and move the [ __ ] on. You know, that's why Zinga was like a destined to fail is because they just extracted as much money from the users and then moved them on to the next game which monetized less. They pulled the means of distribution right from under their [ __ ] noses, you know? And so I don't think Roblox is going to do that. But the next like sickening game is going to come out and they're going to move on to that, you know, like that's the way this business is going to work. I'd paint it in a better way. Like I think at Zinga they called it like the Death Star. Like they're building the Death Star and you just kind of like point it and launch it. Like that was always Farmville is like they cross-promote things and like Aldderon like explosion. I think the real story is that Roblox like it sounds like they finally have their death star which is the platform. Like just point this thing and\nyou know they can scale any game on the platform. I mean that's that's incredible. This is the most played game in the [ __ ] world. Even if the arpoo is really low, which it is, that is not insignificant.\nYou're not giving enough credit to the influencers that draw people in to make this a thing.\nNo. Influencers are at the other end of the funnel. Influencers cannot make something that's not popular popular. Like they are just as much writing the demand wave as anyone else. Like most popular games are the top stream games. CS GO, Dota, League of Legends.\nDude, when Farmville was coming out in Canvas, people were saying the same exact thing, right? This is the most people that have played a game in the history of man.\nAnd that matters, right? Like that mattered for Candy Crush. That matters for Farmville. Like they rode that for a long time. That wasn't insignificant. that mattered for Fortnite.\nOf course, it matters. And Fargo, by the way, is still around. I know it's crazy, but\nthe difference is they maintain these audiences for the successes like Fortnite and Candy Crush.\nYeah.\nThese audiences are going away, right?\nYeah. And I think that's fair. You know, let's look at how this one holds up. Let's also look at other platform titles like Adopt Me. Like there are games with like stable live service.\nYeah. I'm not condemning Roblox. I'm just condemning, you know, the the hit driven like games like this. Like it's amazing, but it's not sustainable, right?\nI don't know. Uh that a lot of the games in the top Roblox charts have been there for a while. Yes, it's going the hype is going to die down because squirrel because you know these kids have an attention span of 6 to 8 weeks and it's summer. They're likely going to stay addicted all summer and then maybe it'll drop down when school goes back in. It's not going to maintain this level, but it might not go out of the top 10 or 20 unless they stop supporting with live ops or if something else comes in to take its place. You know what's interesting here is it's finally the farming genre. I know it's crazy to think that farming and kids is like the next genre, but you know, if I'm a Roblox developer, I'm going to go mine all of the other\n\n\nGames for 60-year-old women, which is the irony here.\nIt's like that was the audience for Farmville was like 60-year-old women in Iowa who love that game for a very different reason.\nThey took all of the like Pokemon trading card mechanics and put it into a farming theme.\nAnd so I think you're going to see a lot of that if I had to guess is go find a different theme and then just, you know, layer in all of Phil's favorite monetization mechanics.\nAll right.\nYeah, I think that's everything.\nAll right.\nMecca break next week and uh yeah, we'll see you next week.\nTill next week.\nPeace.\n[Music]\nWhat are you doing?\n",

    "cleanText": "Hey everyone, welcome back to another latest space lightning pod.\nThis is Allesio, partner and CTO at Decibel, and today I have Akshay Agrawal from Marimo on the studio.\nWelcome.\nThanks Allesio.\nReally happy to be here.\nYeah.\nUh, thanks to Samuel Calvin from Pantic for the introduction.\nYou know, we saw him at the AI engineer summit in New York and he was like, you should have you should have these guys on on the pod.\nSo, um, and we've had previously, you know, Brian Bishop from Hack, who's now at TRVC.\nSo we cover notebooks in the past, and I think there's now a resurgence of AI plus previous data you access.\nWe have a quadratic episode on the spreadsheet side.\nSo welcome to the show and maybe give people an introduction on Marimo and what you guys do.\nYeah, definitely.\nSo Marimo is an open-source notebook for Python that's built entirely from scratch.\nSo it has no dependencies on Jupyter, and it's designed specifically for AI and data work.\nSo some of the main things that are different from like traditional notebooks is Marimo has like reactive execution.\nSo you run a cell, Marimo knows what other cells need to run and also has built-in UI elements.\nLike the upshot of these things is that it lets you work with data and AI models in entirely new ways.\nAnd it like really puts your data front and center in a way that sort of you don't see in in traditional notebooks.\nAnd these things are a lot easier to demo.\nSo, we'll jump into a few demos in a bit.\nBut, I guess a couple other things I'll say about Marimo and sort of the things that are um fueling sort of the the strong traction that we're seeing is that um not only are they really good for rapid prototyping, they also let you go from prototype to production.\nSo, they're stored as pure Python.\nSo you can version them with Git, you can share them as data apps, you can execute them as scripts or pipeline.\nUh, you can they have SQL built in and you can connect to your own databases or data links.\nSo you can think of it as a modern replacement for not only Jupyter but also Streamlit, Radio, Paper Mill, and yeah, so we are seeing pretty strong traction this year.\nI think last I checked over 300,000 monthly downloads on Pi, more GitHub stars than Jupyter Notebook for whatever that's worth, and we're used at companies like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cloudflare, BlackRock, universities like Stanford and Berkeley.\nThat's the high-level overview.\nYeah.\nHow did you decide on the notebook shape?\nI think there's many critiques of Jupyter notebooks from the kernel and like the way it interacts with AI models and ideas.\nWhat was kind of like the initial idea maze that got you here?\nYeah.\nSo I started working on Marimo after, so I was at Google Brain.\nIt was a while ago, but I was an engineer on TensorFlow, and then after that I did a PhD at Stanford in machine learning research.\nAnd you know, one thing I noticed and even for myself too is that like people have a lot of complaints about Jupyter notebooks, and you know, I did too, which is sort of why I'm working on Marimo today.\nBut at the same time, they provided something that was really invaluable for people who work with data and AI, which is the ability to write code and like interact with the output of the code, interact with your data in an iterative way.\nAnd I think one thing that's constant, like, you know, back then it was machine learning.\nNow it's more generative AI.\nThe thing that's that has been true is that you got to look at your data, and notebooks are like really good for that, even though they they have traditionally had like a lot of problem other problems like hidden state, reproducibility issues, the file format making it, you know, unable to version with Git.\nSo after finishing my PhD, I noticed that look, I not only does a lot of data work start in notebooks, you know, with you know, the rise of AI.\nSo at that time, that was end of 2021, so ChatGPT, you know, was just bursting onto the scene.\nI think it became clear clear to me that people were going to spend even more time working with data, evaluating model outputs and stuff.\nSo I thought I wanted to design something that kept the interactivity that that notebooks are really great for, but that had sort of the guardrails that like regular software has, like reproducibility, no hidden state.\nYou can actually reuse your notebooks as apps, as as scripts, and yeah, so that that's sort of that was the genesis of the idea.\nCool.\nYeah, let's jump into a demo.\nI think that you know most of the audience is technical, so feel free to um keep it engineering focused.\nAwesome.\nSo let me share my screen.\nCool.\nSo I can share a few demos.\nSo this is an example of a Marimo notebook.\nYou have cells of Python code.\nYou have some markdown and then you have some visual outputs.\nSo this is we're going to start with classical machine learning with MNIST data set and then we'll go to some generative AI applications.\nSo over here we're looking at a a scatter plot of a a 2D embedding of MNIST, which is a data set of numerical digits.\nAnd so each different color in this scatter plot corresponds to a different digit.\nSo one thing that is immediately different between how a Jupyter notebook works and a Marimo notebook works is that this notebook is going to react to my UI interactions and also my code interactions.\nSo what I'm going to do here is I'm going to hide the code.\nI'm going to click this button and then I get a app at app view sort of of my notebook.\nOne thing that I can do is that I can actually make a selection in the scatter plot.\nAnd as I make this, you can see down below I'm getting a live preview of the underlying images that have been embedded into 2D.\nAnd workflows like this are like one I think really important whenever you work with data, like you actually really need to see your data and two like very painful to like get working in traditional notebooks that are sort of based on Jupyter.\nAnd in contrast, like if you look at the code for this notebook, it's really quite simple, just a few lines of code, you create an Altair chart and then you just wrap it in one special Marimo function and that that makes this thing totally interactive.\nAnd then what's happening behind the scenes is that I have this chart object.\nIt has a value property and that value is just the data that's been selected.\nSo if I select here, you'll see that the data frame gets sent back to Python and you can see a visualization of it.\nAnd then you have downstream code that can manipulate that data in any way.\nAnd so that's what I mean by reactive.\nI interact with a notebook and then Marimo knows how to automatically update outputs.\nAnd this is um one-to-one compatible with notebook.\nSo if I already have a notebook, I can just kind of copy paste the cells over or what's the process almost?\nSo our file format is different.\nBut yeah, you can copy paste the the files over the the cells over or we have a command line utility, Marimo convert my notebook.ipynb to my notebook.py and it'll do the conversion.\nThere are there are some restrictions on the kind of code that Marimo lets you write.\nBecause Marimo does have a dependency graph basically on your cells.\nThat's how it knows what cells to run.\nYou can't redefine variables across multiple cells.\nBut our conversion tool will fix that up for you.\nAnd we have things like local variables and other things that sort of make that work.\nYeah.\nUm, awesome.\nYeah.\nAnd so I have these other little UI widgets here.\nI can click this widget, for example, and it changes the embedding again, like if you were doing this in a Jupyter notebook, you would probably have copy pasted the all like six cells like multiple times and then you wouldn't even have the sort of drill down interactivity.\nSo that that's one way uh that Marimo brings data to life in sort of a more classical sort of machine learning context.\nCan look at another demo.\nThis one is pretty fun.\nIt was made by Vincent Warmerdom, who is Marimo Mo's resident creative genius.\nAnd so this one, okay, so if you're looking at this, first thing you might notice is, okay, wait a minute.\nNotebooks are traditionally linear.\nYou're looking at some columns here on the screen.\nWe have three columns of code and outputs.\nUm, Marimo's actually pretty flexible in like the way you can arrange your code.\nAnd we recognize that like, hey, monitors are wide and you might want to use that screen real estate.\nSo you can configure it to show things in columns and the way that the order of execution works is just based on variable declarations and references kind of like Excel in some sense, right?\nYou can have columns, things just kind of execute in the right way.\nSo this notebook is is kind of fun.\nSo what we have here, we have a few cells.\nWe have a little custom widget that Vincent Vibe coded.\nIt's Microsoft Paint in a Marimo notebook.\nAnd so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to draw in this widget.\nAnd first thing you see as I'm drawing, my image is being rendered here on the right and that's based on that reactivity.\nI'm going to draw a little graph.\nAnd then this graph is going to be used as part of the input to a query that I'm going to make to a multimodal model.\nAnd I'll ask Gemini to give me a representation as a mermaid.\nOkay, there we go.\nSo, I have the markdown code for the mermaid graph.\nAnd like this is the kind of thing that you really don't think if you think Jupyter Notebook, you don't envision yourself being able to make workflows like this for yourself.\nBut like, so I I I hope like a demo like this shows like how Marimo really makes you rethink what a notebook can do and really sort of brings your data to to life in new ways.\nDo do you have any kind of like AI native utilities to call these models or are people just writing like all the API calling code or do you think that's kind of like an interesting direction?\nYeah.\nSo we do have some AI native capabilities to write these uh call these models.\nSo I guess it's in a couple of modalities.\nSo right now this notebook is just calling the client API.\nIf you want to, you can just generate code.\nSo speaking of um a recent podcast that y'all did for on quadratic, the AI spreadsheet, you know, there we saw a lot that you could use natural language to generate code and actually Marimo lets you do similar things.\nSo like I could there's a generate with AI button here at the bottom right.\nSo I could write some code.\nI can tag data frames and other things that I have.\nAnd uh I'm actually not sure what I want to ask it to to show here, but I could say, you know, create mapp plot of a sign curve.\nAnd I can just do that.\nI'm missing some packages here that I'll need to install.\nAnd then we can try again.\nYeah.\nHow do you do all the packaging?\nIs it there's like a requirements .txt file just like you would in uh actually scriptor.\nYeah, it's a little cooler actually than that.\nSo see this time.\nSo one thing that you'll notice that when I tried to run that generate with AI code button and I didn't have a package installed, there was like a little toast that like say, hey, we can install this package for you and it just kind of did it.\nSo we actually have a tight integration with um the UV package manager from Astral.\nSo we can actually store dependencies in line in the notebook file itself in like the notebook header and this is something that UV supports.\nSo then you can just actually ship a notebook file around and it contains all its dependencies.\nThat's like kind of opt in, but that's one way thing that like really makes notebooks a lot more reproducible.\nAnd so we'll see again, we don't have the packages, but I can install them and then there we go, they're installed, the cell reran and I have sort of my output.\nYeah.\nSo when you're asking AI to generate any AI generated cell can kind of like doesn't have to think about the broader requirements of the project.\nYeah, that's right.\nYes.\nAnd the AI has context to sort of like all all the data frames, all the variables that you already have imported into your notebook as well.\nBut yeah, it can it can readily use other modules and we'll just sort of do the right thing.\nI have another fun demo also made by the one and only Vincent Warmer that I kind of want to show.\nAnd this is a a demo sort of in the vein of bringing sort of data to life and like really working with your data.\nThis is like a data annotation demo.\nAnd one thing that you'll notice actually, so in my hands here, I've got a PS5 controller.\nYeah.\nAnd you'll see this little thing here, moped widget, and it says gamepad connected.\nAnd I'm moving around my mouse, and you see some like inputs changing here.\nAnd so like to really drive home how interactive Marimo is and like how many different ways we can use to sort of interact, like not only can you use your mouse to change UI interactions, you can build custom extensions to control your the applications you make in a Marimo notebook with anything including a PS5 controller.\nSo this demo here we have like a bunch of papers from archive and we've indexed them using Chroma into like a basic vector database and now what we're going to do is we're going to make a query to get a bunch of papers related to data quality and there's two embedding models and the goal is to compare like which embedding model do we prefer.\nSo the embedding model embeds the query and then you know, uses vector search to pull related papers.\nSo if I submit this, I get a a summary of the paper.\nIn this case, it says we provide an overview of the standard data resources for training multilingual reasoning and out language models.\nThat seems sort of related to data quality.\nSo I'm going to accept this.\nAnd I could accept by clicking this button, but I can also accept it by pushing X on the gamepad.\nSo I push X.\nOh, we have more fun.\nYeah, you see that goes through.\nYou see that I have this editable data frame thing here that shows me the the annotation result.\nAnd I can just keep going.\nI don't know.\nThis one also seems sort of related to data quality.\nSo maybe I'll say accept.\nThis doesn't seem as related.\nSo I'll say reject.\nAnd what's happening over here is that I'm plotting the beta distribution of the two models to sort of get a belief of which model is better.\nAnd I can just kind of jam this quite quickly in a way that, you know, would be really annoying if I were using my mouse and I would just quickly get carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSo another way that like Marimo really brings your data to life and really makes makes your work a lot more interactive than\n\n\nIt might be otherwise.\nThat's great.\nCan we maybe talk about the blank canvas AI use cases?\nSo, you know, I want to do some data analysis.\nYeah, I like the notebook like UI.\nHow do I start from scratch?\nYeah, that that's actually perfectly teed up.\nThat was the next demo.\nSo, this is how you start from scratch.\nThis is an empty notebook.\nI can zoom in a bit.\nAnd so, there is a code cell and there's this generate with AI button.\nSo to get started, I will just like populate this with some data.\nUm, and I'm going to use Vega data sets.\nI'm going to import a data frame about cars.\nOkay, so I have a data frame and I'm say I'm kind of new to polar.\nI don't really know the syntax, but I kind of know what I want to do.\nSo you can click this generate with AI button and you can just start typing.\nSo maybe the first thing I want to do is get a histogram maybe of one of these columns.\nIt's just so I can see it sort of in more detail.\nSo I can say something like generate a histogram of miles per gallon maybe from and then I can give the data frame as context to to whatever model I have connected.\nSo I can just tag it with at.\nAnd you'll see here that if I write tag at df, it actually is going to pass in all these columns and their data types as context to the to the language model.\nIf I do that, I hit enter, it's going to turn a little bit, generate some code, I can edit it a little bit uh to sort of clean it up.\nDon't need to convert it to pandas.\nThen I can accept and just run it.\nAnd then boom.\nSo you have your you have your code.\nAnd so that that kind of really accelerates rapid prototyping and you don't really have to leave your tab and go to check GPT.\nYou can just do it entirely in here and you can like just sort of vibe code your way through your entire analysis in this way.\nAnd I guess like one thing that's kind of interesting to talk about that maybe is kind of subtle but like if you think about doing something like this um I don't know in cursor or chatgpt or something like this.\nWhat's unique about doing it in Mimo is the fact that not only does Mimo see your code but it sees all the variables in memory and it can also see your database connections etc.\nSo it can really provide rich rich completions.\nSo like it knows the name of the columns for example.\nOh, how are you doing the context formatting?\nLike when you do add df how are you showing that to the to the model when you send it over?\nWe like basically I think we do like df.head to just like get like a preview of the columns, the data types and then like a few sample rows and just kind of shove that into the context window.\nYeah.\nSo let's see.\nI can ask like another query like maybe I can say something like so this data set has cars by a bunch of different countries as well and maybe I want to understand sort of average statistics by country of cars like are US cars more efficient or less efficient than cars from Japan etc.\nSo I can say something like let me understand uh average statistics for for DF across origin column which is the country and then boom it starts writing again.\nAnd what's kind of cool is that you'll see it knows all the column names here.\nAnd then again, I can fix up the code a little except try it out.\nAnd there it is.\nUm, a lot faster than going to to the API docs.\nAnd we have other workflows too for for working with AI.\nSo you can also there's like a chat bar here where if you don't necessarily if you want to sort of have a multi-turn conversation, you can execute it here as well.\nAnd you we have a bring your own keys model.\nSo right now I'm using an open AI key, but you can also use local models with O Lama or anything you like really.\nSorry for jumping in late here.\nI think you probably guys Yeah, you guys probably discussed this earlier.\nUh but this is all running in WebAssembly, right?\nUm actually not ex not entirely.\nMimo's actually this is running just on my laptop, but we can run WebAssembly.\nSo I guess similar to a Jupyter notebook, Mimo is an open-source package that you can just install and run wherever you like.\nSo pip install Mimo, run it on your laptop, run on a cloud server, wherever you like.\nBut to make Mimo really easy to share, we've also made it possible to run it entirely in WebAssembly.\nSo actually, if you go to new, this opens a little notebook playground in your browser.\nAnd this is running entirely in WebAssembly.\nSo you can just\nYeah.\nI was I was just kind of curious if there's any part of the Python ecosystem that you know is not compatible with this.\nI I'm not aware of what the restrictions are.\nYeah.\nNo, so that's a great question.\nSo if you're using Mimo just the local library on your laptop on the cloud server, you can use any item package you want.\nIf you're using it in WebAssembly, so for example in this playground, there are restrictions.\nSo you try to import torch, it's not going to work.\nIt's not going to be able to install it.\nBut there are certain packages that just don't work.\nAnd actually for that reason, so whereas I I think the WebAssembly really like democratizes interactive computing to a large extent, it doesn't totally.\nSo for that reason, our team has actually been really hard at work building a cloud hosted collab like uh notebook that we're going to give away to our community for free.\nand we're calling it MoLab.\nThis is like a preview of the page and great name.\nYeah, it's a it's a funny story.\nSo, Mo from Mimo.\nUm, and it's at moab.marimo.\nIt's a pretty simple service.\nYou can create a new notebook.\nYou can import a notebook locally or from GitHub.\nAnd these run in cloud instances.\nCurrently, they're running on modal.\nAnd so here you can use any package you like.\nYou can have configurable CPU and RAM.\nYou can also upload your own data and we store them in Cloudflare R2 buckets.\nYou know the name.\nI mean one thing that's actually kind of funny for the origin story of this is that a lot of our users were asking us for something like Collab based on Mimo.\nActually, if you go to Google Collabs GitHub issues page, um they have one and sort by thumbs up.\nWe are like I guess the sixth or seventh most upvoted issue.\nSupport Mimo in Google Collab.\nAnd I don't think Google was ever going to do that anytime soon.\nSo, we decided to kind of just do something like that on our own.\nSo, that's sort of the origin for where Moab came from.\nYeah, it's a funny the issue was opened in June of last year as one of our users who we've communicated with over at GitHub for for some time.\nUm, yeah, amazing.\nWhat's kind of like missing here in your mind as you think about other things that you want to add to it like features or like maybe trying to break out of old habits?\nI think you've done a great job of keeping the familiarity of like cellbased execution but adding things like column and things like that.\nUm yeah, what do you what do you think is next?\nYeah.\nSo a bunch of there could be a bunch of things.\nSo in terms of like breaking out of old habits, you know, we talked a little bit about how Marimo has some restrictions on the kind of codes you code you write and actually that ends up leading to much better code is you can't reuse you can't redefine variables.\nYou kind of have to write things in a functional way.\nSo so in that sense it does sort of break some old maybe bad habits.\nOne of our users called this gentle parenting.\nUm, and another way of breaking out of the notebook that that we actually do have.\nSo, I mentioned notebooks are stored as pure Python.\nSo, if I go uh let's I can open a notebook file and we can take a look at what it actually looks like.\nOops.\nYou'll see has a py extension embedding mnest py.\nI'm going to zoom in and you'll see it's just pure Python.\nAnd this is generated for the user but you can also edit it yourself.\nEvery cell is decorated in app.ell decorator and there is an app.run sort of at the bottom which suggests you can run this as a script and like indeed you can.\nSo if I go to my terminal and I can just use uvun embedding mnest.py.\nIt just starts executing as a script.\nit loaded a cache data set did some other stuff that didn't print to to the terminal.\nSo that's that's one way that we help folks break out of a notebooking workflow.\nThe other way is you can actually run any Mimo notebook as a data app uh similar to streamlit.\nSo I can say Mimo run embedding mnest.p\nAnd then it it'll run it as a readonly web app in my browser that you can also deploy and share with other other users or you know maybe non-technical folks.\nDo you see a world in which you made this right too?\nSo the when I meant read only it just means that the the consumer of the app can't change the code but yeah you can have like you can write to databases from the application and things like that.\nSo definitely you can have right back.\nYeah.\nUm yeah, other things that we're working on besides MoLab, we do talk about improving like going further with the AI assistance that we have.\nYou know, agents are obviously sort of a natural thing to to think about.\nThere's actually a really cool project by a PhD student at Stanford where they uh they worked in genomics and they actually forked Mimo.\nThey have a project called Mimo agents and they added a new type of cell an agent cell where you can type English and then it kicks off an agent that generates your Python code and then adds it to your notebook and then you have a record of the prompt.\nSo things like that we're looking into exploring too.\nNice.\nUm awesome.\nI thought this was great.\nany call to action for folks?\nAre you hiring?\nAre you looking for obviously more users?\nUh, anything?\nYeah, we're always looking for more users.\nSo, if you want to try Mimo, easiest way to get started on your own machine is to pip install it and then just write Mimo tutorial intro.\nPip install Mimo.\nMarimo tutorial intro will get you get you going.\nTry out MoLab if you want a cloud hosted experience of being able to use any package sharing notebooks with links like just like you would with collab.\nSo that will be at moab.marimo.\nOtherwise we love contributors.\nWe have over 100 open source contributors.\nCome follow us on socials.\nWe're mimo_io on Twitter.\nI think this this mission is great and know I think notebooks are still underrated by a lot of people and like requires a dedicated team with like a strong vision like you have to reinvent one of the core workflows of most uh research scientists and engineers.\nAppreciate it.\nAwesome actually.\nThank you so much.\nThank you guys.\n[Music]\n",

    "cleanText": "ChatGPT has officially entered the agent wars in a way that is much broader than just deep research or operator alone.\nToday we're going to look at what ChatGPT agent is and some early use cases that are driving value for people.\nWelcome back to The AI Daily Brief.\nIt is always a fun day when we have a very hot off the presses new tool or model that has people chattering and thinking about new possibilities, and we get to go check it out and see how people are already getting value out of it.\nI'm talking, of course, today about ChatGPT agent.\nNow, it's been clear for a while that OpenAI was headed in an agentic direction.\nWe got operator right at the beginning of the year, and just a couple weeks later, we got deep research.\nAnd while operator hasn't necessarily become a frequent user for most people, deep research very much has.\nNow, in the time subsequent to Deep Research being launched, we got some of the first credible multi-purpose agents that people have actually been using outside of just novelty.\nMaybe most notably was Manis, the Chinese agent that had a viral moment earlier this year and attracted a ton of attention.\nYesterday, OpenAI announced that they were going to be announcing something today.\nAnd it was pretty clear that it was this agent.\nAnd then 3 hours before the live stream, they posted ChatGPT, handshake emoji, deep research, handshake emoji, operator.\nAnd that combination of things is very clearly at the center of this effort.\nSo much so that Shawn, better known as Swix, memed a version of Steve Jobs' famous introduction of the iPhone when he said, \"Today we're launching three revolutionary products, a new internet browsing device, a new phone, and a new iPod.\"\nNow, the joke, of course, was that they were all one thing, and that was the introduction of iPhone.\nAnd Swix put this in the new ChatGPT context, writing three things: a deep research model with enhanced search browser, a revolutionary computer use operator, and a sandbox terminal to execute math and code.\nA browser, a computer, a terminal.\nAre you getting it?\nThese are not three separate agents.\nThis is one agent, and we are calling it agent.\nPerfect tweet.\n10 out of 10.\nNo notes.\nGood job, Swix.\nNow, honestly, this is just a very natural evolution of the capabilities of operator on the one hand and deep research on the other.\nDeep research is good, as they put it, at synthesizing information, and operator can interact with websites.\nAnd it turns out that combined with ChatGPT's general intelligence and conversational fluency adds up to a whole that is potentially greater than the sum of its parts.\nIn their announcement post and in the announcement live stream, they talked about how each of those different tools, operator on the one hand, deep research on the other, fell short in different and kind of complimentary situations.\nOperator could scroll, click, and type the web, but it couldn't dive deep into analysis or write detailed reports.\nDeep Research couldn't interact with websites to refine results or access content requiring user authentication.\nIn fact, they noticed that many queries that users were attempting were actually better for the other tool in some way.\nSo the way the ChatGPT agent works is that it has a text-based browser that can read text of websites, a visual browser that can actually interact with the web in the graphical user interface way that the web is designed, terminal access to code, direct API access to ChatGPT, and the agent can also leverage ChatGPT connectors, which give it access to data sources like Gmail or GitHub.\nJust like selecting deep research from the drop-down menu on ChatGPT when you prompt it, you select agent when you want to use this new agent tool.\nChatGPT agent then spins up its own virtual computer that becomes the home base for the whole initiative.\nNow, one of the really cool things about this is that ChatGPT has clearly learned that people really like having some sense of what's going on under the hood.\nSo as agent is working, it's giving you both a real-time look at the websites that it's browsing as well as providing chain of thought and a narration of its activities.\nPart of what makes that valuable is that it's also interruptible.\nIf you realize that there's something that you forgot to ask it as part of the initial prompt, you can even as it's working go in and say, \"Hey, also do this other thing.\"\nOpenAI made a big point of pointing out that that's a much more natural mode given that that's the way that you'd interact with another human who was working on a set of tasks for you as well.\nIn other words, you wouldn't just assume that you were going to give them one set of instructions at the beginning and that would be that.\nYou might anticipate that there would be clarifying questions, or when they ran up against a problem, they might come back to you.\nAnd that's more of the type of mode and interaction that you're going to get with ChatGPT agent.\nNow, this being a new product launch, there had to be some benchmarks.\nAnd although you know that I'm a little bit skeptical of over-reliance on benchmarks as a determination of whether a tool is useful or not, preferring instead to see how it does in the real world, there is, I think, a core story here which is really valuable to help us understand the likely evolution of AI and agents.\nThe TLDDR is that ChatGPT agent did really well on a lot of benchmarks.\nThe first one they share is, for example, humanity's last exam, which is expert-level questions, kind of PhD-level questions across a bunch of different academic topics.\n03 with no tools gets a 20.3% on humanity's last exam.\nDeep research, which has access to both Python and browsing, gets a 26.6%.\nBut ChatGPT agent, which has access to a browser, the virtual computer, and the terminal, got 41.6%.\nOn Frontier Math 03, which had access to Python, got 10.3%.\nThe optimized for math04 mini got 19.3%.\nAnd ChatGPT agent again with access to a browser, computer, and terminal got 27.4%.\nAnd this was repeated over and over and over on data analysis, data modeling on a spreadsheet bench.\nSpeaking of Steve Jobs, there was this famous story or analogy he used to tell about an article in Scientific American in the early 1970s which compared the efficiency of locomotion for various species.\nBasically, they were looking at how much energy it took different animals to get from point A to point B and then ranking them.\nJobs would point out that ultimately the Condor one is the most efficient and that humans were somewhere in the middle of the pack about a third of the way down the list.\nHowever, when you instead tested the efficiency of a person riding a bicycle, that human hybrid was twice as efficient as the Condor.\nAnd the point that Jobs was making was that what made humans humans was their ability to create tools that amplify their inherent abilities.\nThis is where the idea of computers as a bicycle for the mind came from.\nWhen I look at these benchmarks where ChatGPT agent having access to a set of tools is outperforming these other models in their raw state, it's reflective of that same idea.\nI also think that this really matters for our understanding of the future of agents given how important tool use is going to be in terms of shaping how performant agents are.\nBut now let's talk about five different use cases that people have already started to explore for ChatGPT agent at core to me.\nIt seems like the use cases that are most interesting, at least on first glance, are basically deep research style prompts with an action attached or deep research style prompts that require a bit wider and more diverse access to information than just stuff you might search out on the normal web.\nSo use case number one, understanding product and customer feedback.\nOne of the experiments that Dan Shipper over at Every ran was that he asked ChatGPT agent to identify and profile both their core customer as well as their biggest missing features for their Kora tool, which is all about email efficiency and automation.\nNow, Dan writes that to complete the task, agents scanned through more than 1500 support emails, hundreds of support forum posts, and even looked people up on LinkedIn to put together a report on who really likes them, who doesn't like them so much, why they don't like them, if they don't, and what it all says about their ideal customers.\nSo again, you see here a task that has a combination of a more diverse information set and both outputs and inputs that involve going and browsing around non-public websites.\nAt the end of this, I'll come back to another observation that Dan had.\nBut next, let's go to a second use case, which I'll call new business generation, but is really about an expanded ability to plan and theorize.\nProfessor Ethan Malik writes, \"ChatGPT agent is, I think, a big step forward for getting AIs to do real work.\nEven at this stage, it does a good job autonomously doing research and assembling Excel files with formulas, PowerPoint, etc.\nIt gives a sense of how agents are coming together.\"\nAn example prompt he shared was come up with an innovative startup idea in the AI and education space.\nDo market research on it.\nCome up with the financials and build me a pitch deck.\nAnd so again, you can see here there is an element of what deep research might have done.\nYou're basically taking 03's insights for coming up with the idea.\nDeep research's ability to do market research, but then coming up with financials, building a pitch deck that starts to get into both the coding and terminal access.\nNow after asking a few clarifying questions, agent went off and worked for 38 minutes.\nThe idea it came up with was skill AI microlearning and alongside the idea and also put together those financials as well as a short deck.\nHe also showed how after he had gotten all of that, he was able to in much the same way he would with a colleague ask it to modify one piece of its work.\nBasically building out a tab in the financial model with detailed cost structures.\nIt worked for an additional 2 minutes and added that in.\nEthan reflected, \"It feels much more like working with an actual human intern capable of a wider range of analytical and computer tasks.\nAnd like an intern, you want to give it feedback and work back and forth.\nNot all the way there yet, but the paradigm is shifting from prompting to delegating.\"\nNow, he also noted that for those of you who have used Manis, that while he thought that Manis might be capable of somewhat more complex tasks, ChatGPT agent is better at integrating research and doing a wider range of tasks.\nNext up, since it's come up a couple of times, let's talk about data visualization.\nOne of the examples they gave during their presentation was basically asking agent to go into the ChatGPT agent of val numbers from the Google Drive connector.\nRemember, it has access to connectors which provide access to specific data sources and make slides based on the performance numbers it found there.\nYou can see in the demo that it's using the terminal to code to create these data visualizations, and it even has a sense of what is or isn't high enough quality and goes back and refines itself.\nData visualization all on its own would be a use case that would bring me to ChatGPT agent pretty frequently as it's something that even some of the best raw models struggle with.\nUse case number four I'll call complex scenario planning.\nRowan Chung of The Rundown tested this by asking agent to build him a complete early retirement plan.\nHe said that to complete the task, agent found local tax laws where he is based in Vancouver, analyzed average monthly spending rates, calculated savings needed to retire at 30, researched optimal investment allocations, found a bunch of tax optimization strategies, including some he'd never heard of, built multiple FIRE or financial independence retire early scenarios, and turned it all into a downloadable presentation.\nAnd again, the value here is integrating things that would have taken a bunch of independent steps otherwise.\nYes, you could use deep research for some of this, but it might have had tougher access to certain parts of this information, and it certainly wouldn't have been able to put it all together in a presentation in this way.\nNow, one interesting thing that Rowan pointed out is that this is actually illustrating a new skill set, he calls it agent management.\nAnd not only do I agree with this as an important new skill set, I basically think that it is the new skill set.\nAnd the faster that today's upskilling platforms can shift off things like pure play prompt engineering as their focus and into things like agent management and personal agent orchestration, the better off we're all going to be.\nRowan writes, \"Agents are finally becoming capable of doing real work autonomously.\nSo, anyone who learns how to effectively orchestrate agents will have a huge advantage.\"\nNow, related to that complex scenario idea, the anchor example that they gave during their live stream was all about this multi-step planning around a wedding.\nThe prompt was basically, I'm going to a wedding in this place.\nResearch what clothes I should wear based on the dress code on the website.\nFigure out what I should actually buy to match that dress code and also figure out my hotel options.\nNow I put this all together in a dossier with a bunch of links that also included screenshots that help provide a trace for where it got the information.\nAnd so, although this is a research dossier in some way, it's not something that would have been quite as easy for Deep Research alone to do.\nAnd it also wouldn't have the ability to actually then take next steps like go out and actually buy those clothes, which it could have if it had been prompted to do so.\nNow there are a bunch of other ideas floating around for use cases for this.\nFinancial modeling was actually something they tested in the benchmarks that ChatGPT Agent performed super well on.\nDan Shipper from Every had a bunch of other ideas like UX audits.\nAnd yet when it comes to whether this is going to be an everyday tool, it's not clear yet.\nDan basically argued that for a lot of his tasks, 03 was still totally sufficient and that he wasn't sure after a couple of weeks with this thing how often he would find himself using it.\nHowever, when he did need it, it was for a very specific reason that just wasn't possible with the other tools.\nThe point being that I think it's going to take some time for us to really start to uncover where the most frequent uses of these general agent tools actually is.\nI think at the beginning it'll be different for different people, and it's going to take not only experimentation but a bunch of sitting around and seeing where you find yourself using these tools in ways that you might not have expected.\nOne last note though to point out just the profoundity of the continued progress here.\nOne of the lines that really stood out from the announcement blog was this one: on an internal benchmark designed to evaluate model performance on complex economically valuable knowledge work tasks.\nChatGPT agents output is comparable to or better than that of humans in roughly half the cases across a range of task completion times.\nThis is the first version of OpenAI's general agent.\nIt's its third bite at the agent apple if you include operator and deep research separately and within 6 months basically of\n\n\nThe first being released.\n\nAnd already, at least by this internal benchmark, it's outperforming humans in roughly half of knowledge work tasks.\nIf you don't think things are changing fast, man, I do not know what to tell you.\nThen again, if you're listening to this show, you are probably not in that camp.\nIn any case, that is going to do it for today's episode.\nI am excited to dig into ChatGPT Agent.\nMy guess is that like Dan and every I won't find a ton of use cases that I immediately jump into and switch my behaviors towards, but I have a couple in mind that I want to get trying.\nWhen I do and if I see how they perform, especially relative to Deep Researcher 03 independently, I will of course let you know.\nBut for now, that's going to do it for today's episode.\nI appreciate you listening or watching and until next time, peace.\n",

    "cleanText": "We've got another rousing CSS Battle for you today, folks. We're going to be creating an ALIEN EYE with CSS. We're going to be seeing who can write the smallest CSS and HTML to get us to the highest score possible. If you want to compete, this is number 136 in CSS Battle.dev. Set your own clock for 15 minutes. Hit go and see if you can beat us in that amount of time. No cheating. You guys ready? Ready, go. All right, here we go. I am going to Last time I used CSS radial gradients. Worked out for me. So, I'm going to right ahead go for a background image radial gradient circle blue. Start at zero. Go for 200 px. And then we'll do transparent. The shortest way to do transparent is with the hex code with two things on it. And that is zero. Okay. So that's a full circle. I came to play. All right. BG color. BG color equals. Yes. Okay. So I'm pulling out all the stops here, folks. I'm going to do this with one P tag. All I need is one P. Uh first things first, let's get the background. Let's remove all these extra styles and that and that. probably just have a div with nested, but we'll set the background color to this. I'm going to set everything's background to that color and also remove all the margin from everything. I'm going to be doing this entirely with one element. So, we're going to have a Yeah, I can do this with one element. These are all circles. So, width is going to be equal to something small like 200 pix. Um, it's not even that small. Height is going to be something like 200 pix because these are going to be the same size. Border radius is going to be 50%, not 500%, and let's go ahead and just get rid of these picss off the start here. I do like writing CSS. By the way, the reason why I'm using HTML tag here is cuz I've always wanted to vertically center them, but the body is not by default 100% height. So, instead of having to size the body, I'm going to just attack the tag. All right. So, the first one, background image, radial gradient. Um, now we're just going to do multiples of that. And then we need the dark yellow circle. So, that's going to be P tag here. We will have some nested elements in there, but let's style this P tag. I'm going to give it an attribute of X so that I can target it. That is going to have a background that's this dark yellow color. It'll have, let's say, a width of 200, height of 200, and a border radius of I'm going to try this Q unit. I think I mean 50% would be the same amount. That'll give us the circle. Okay, I'm not going to use the Q unit. I I learned about that in a comment, of course. Off the off the jump, nothing is showing up. Um, did I goof up border? Oh, I did. I I did goof up border rads. rad. Okay, but that doesn't Oh, I see it. I wrote a P inside of here for my attribute selector. That's why it didn't work. There we go. Obviously, I need this to be much smaller. Let's move it. Move it. Move it. Move it. Let's move it. Move it. Like uh Oh, those little mischievous guys from Madagascar. Okay, so the second one is this guy. 110 pixels. Oh, I got to I got to start with the smallest one. I'm wrong here. Okay, so we're going to start with the smallest one. And that will be this first color. This blue here. No, not the blue. It's going to be the gray. Gray. I'm going to fix position it in the exact spot. So, we'll make everything fixed position. And then this will have a top of 100 and a left of 100. Let's just get it in the exact right spot. We'll do a top of let's say 50, 60, and then a left of 110 120. Okay. So, it's just a little too small. This thing very well may be in the center. That's really tough. It doesn't look like it is. So, we can do style is equal to align content center. Margin is going to be zero. Auto that. Oh, that. Sorry, that needs to be on the P. All right, man. I've already wasted some time here. I need to get this ever so on here. And then we're going to do a translate 10 pix to move it over. Okay. Um, now that we can see that, we'll change this blue to that. Okay. Oh, I think that needs to go way smaller. 75. Okay, we'll fuss with that. And then there's two more here. And this third one is going to be the blue. And that will go 120. And then the fourth one is going to be yellow again. Maybe it is 180. A 180 circle. It is. Okay. So, that gets it exactly. Let me zoom in and out. Make sure that it's Yeah, that should be a perfect match for the the circle in the center. So, it's a 180 by 180 circle. Then, inside the circle, I want uh that dark bluish green circle. So, I'm going to have another P tag inside of here. We'll give this an attribute of Y. I'm going to style it the same way as the other, but then we could just override the background. Holy guacamole. That put it in the right spot. Okay, now it's time to do background or uh let's do box shadow here. I'm going to do box shadow for literally everything simply because I can and I feel like that is the right strategy. So, we're going to say 10 pixels. It's going to move 0 pixels vertically. It is going to be a spread. We're going to do zero. And we're going to say something like 10 pix for now. And it's going to be this color. And it's going to be 20 30 pixels. Okay. So, the spread is too or the I don't know if that's called the spread or not. What? What? But what? But what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what but what a tremendous guess that was. All right, we're in good shape. Um let's start sizing things down now. Let's start from the outside in. So I'm going to throw on diff 80 95. No six. Oh, these got to go way down. Okay, so we're going to do 35 45 here. Okay, good. First one. This one's got to be way bigger. 120. Man, this is this whole video is gonna be me just pushing pixels around. Almost there. All I have to do is position this one into the right spot. It's top needs to go down a bit more. So, like 70 80. And then left needs to be a bit more. So, we'll do 140. And then it's definitely too big. So, let's bring it down to like 130. And then let's work on the diff. Let's just get it centered exactly on the top like we did with the last one. Bring it over a little bit more. Yeah. So, let's 146 145. So, that gets the top exactly where it needs to be. Then, let's make it 140 by 140. Much closer. And then bring it over a little bit from the left. Yes. This next one is going to be let's say 40 pics like this. Okay. 40 pics might have been too much, but like maybe zero. I found the formula. I have found the formula. All right. So we have them all. Now we got to push them over. So my move here is going to be background position. You can use multiple background positions as long as you keep them in the order as you specified your background images. So the first one is the inside one. So X is going to be 10px0. The second one is going to be the yellow. Oh, that actually looks bang on. Okay, so I'll keep that. Third one is the blue. Oh, it's not actually even moving. Bang on. It wasn't even rendering properly. And then the third one is zero. Oh man, I'm almost there. Oh, is it because it's 50% border radius? Like if I were to do like 100%. Whoa, that sucks. How is this not creating a circle? How could that possibly be? That doesn't make any stinking sense because this, for all intents and purposes, is just about there in the border radius is now causing extreme discomfort. We're going to have to do this with another P tag, which sucks cuz this is adds so much more code to this. Uh maybe I can come back to this if I get this at least cooking a little bit here. Man, that sucks. Now, we need another yellow circle. We'll just do PZ and it's going to have all the same styling of the others. We'll just bring the width and the height down. So, this needs to be even smaller than 140. So, let's just do 100 by 100. Top needs to be more than the blue circle. So, let's go 100 there. And then left. Try 100 there. 20 130 140 seems close. That's exact. I guessed it exactly. Okay. Um, and then let's get that last circle inside of there. 17. Okay. It's starting at the right spot, but it has to be much bigger. How much smaller? 70. Yes. Okay. Now, we're going to move it over to the left. 15. A little less. 12. That's looking pretty close. So, this will be another P. We'll give it an attribute of W. We'll style all of those in the same way. And then W has a width even smaller. So let's try like 50 and a height of 50. And it's going to have a background of this color. And then top will need to be even more. So we'll try 140, 130. And then left will be even more. So like 160, 170, 180. And I think the trick I learned here is like get the top of the circle aligned exactly and then you can find the width. So let's just get it aligned exactly. Oh man, I hate this. I hate this because I was really cruising on something that was working and now I'm adding a whole another element here. Translate. We could say 50% 50% and then left 50% top 50%. And right now it's sitting I know I I'll tweak this in a second. Right now it's sitting um above everything, but if we move this here it will sit below. 99.8% match. What's goofed up? Let's work on the yellow one. The yellow one is the third one. It needs to be slightly larger. Oh no, that's not the right one. The yellow is the one. Oh, the second one. 51 pixels. Okay. And then maybe -1 px. Oh, that made it worse. What does the What does that mean? Is if it's showing that means mine is too large. And then bring it over a few more or a few less. Left 180. Okay. So, this looks exact. Let's submit and hope that it's not 99.999% match. 100%. Yes. Beautiful. Okay. So, we've got 100% match. Now, let's work on getting it as small as possible. The diff stuff is always tough because you can get so close with these diffs and especially if you're zoomed in. Okay, that's 100% match. So, I I very most definitely want to get this to be at a certain state where I can say this is the smallest best code. And we have about 6 minutes left. So, maybe I can find some units that'll bring the sizing down. Like I know I don't need this last curly brace. Actually, the only spot I'm using a unit is on the radius here. I don't know if I can get anything smaller. Let me just double check that I'm not missing any spaces anywhere. 99.8% match. 99.9% match. The biggest one is too big. 89. No, it went down. It was fine. If these three elements were children, then the position absolute potentially the top and the left values would be smaller cuz instead of making them fully fixed position, then their position just relative to their parent. I don't know if I have enough time to do that. So, there's only 5 minutes left. So, I'm actually just going to going to copy my current solution, but then try to get it working where all of these are nested elements with position absolute. I mean, that's a pretty high score. I'm going to copy and paste this right now just to say, hey, I can at least get one more character off of here. I can get rid of this semicolon there. Is there any other minifications I can do? I can get rid of this semicolon. I think I can get rid of this. That better be 100% or I'm quitting. 100% match. Good. Okay. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. All right. So, now we got to figure out how to make this as small as possible. So, we can take the style tag off. Can I combine these two things? Why did all the colors just go weird? Oh, I'm dipping it. Oh, there we go. That's That's why I can't do that. We need to turn P of X into a container. And then I think Well, that's going to be even more cuz I think I have to close all of these so that they become children. Everything else is going to have position absolute. Yeah, I don't I don't like this path cuz there's going to be so many more characters to have the closing tags and that's not going to be enough to save us. Let me just stare at this a little bit more. We have two and a half minutes left. I'm just going to stare at it. See if I can find any last minute optimizations. But otherwise, pretty happy with this. We have two box shadows that are the same color. Would it be shorter to say color is equal to this? And then you could eliminate this. Could you? Let's undo. Undo. Undo. Undo. Undo. Can I leave off this curly bracket? Yes, I can. Beautiful. Okay. Okay. Looks like I can eliminate that space. And that's good. Can get rid of those. Get rid of those. This is like extreme optimization time here. I wish there was a better way to put transparent. You know, the word transparent. A CSS variable is technically one character less, but instantiating that variable is going to add, so I don't need that. Oh, there's a space right here. Yeah, I couldn't find anything. I thought of potentially replacing 50% with another unit or like 180 with the percentage, but it's all three characters\n\n\nSo, this is as short as I got. Let's see how the other boys did.\nDid I just find a way to remove six more characters?\nI don't know how I could have done this any better at this point. I'm annoyed.\nOh, I think time's up.\nYeah. Yeah. How'd you guys do?\nI killed it with radial gradients again.\nRad is my new move.\nOh, that I think you may. Yeah, I think radial gradient might have been the move here. And I'm uh sad to hear that.\nAll right, I got 624 and that's great.\nWe've always. You remember during the live show we were trying to vertically center something in the body and we couldn't figure it out. It's a background and it spans the entire height, but the body element itself is not 100% height unless you explicitly add 100% to the HTML element and the body. So, I was like, screw the body. We're we're we're styling the HTML tag. So, I used a bunch of radial gradients and then I use background position to just scooch each of them left and right.\nYeah, that's awesome.\nAmazing. Yeah, I I do want to push back. The reason why the align content didn't work in the live show was because of Firefox because I used align content on the body. No issues here. Filled 100%. No problem.\nCan you uh explain radial gradients?\nI've never used them. What are the arguments? What's going on here?\nBasically, when you're sizing a radial gradient, you can tell it where to start and stop. So, you can say start at the furthest corner and they will span from that. And then the trick that I'm using is that I'm using hard stops. So I'm having a circle radial gradient starts at zero goes for 50 pixels and then you immediately put a hard stop after it and then I've had to use a transparent. This is again this is the smallest possible way to represent transparent in CSS and then by putting the hard stop in there right if I didn't put that in there it would span the entire thing I guess. Actually I don't even know how that part works.\nYeah.\nSo what am I looking at? So which circles did you draw in which order?\nLike what's the first one?\nYou start by the center and go out. And I guess cuz they stack backwards. Now I I did it opposite the first way. I thought like you would you would stack the back one first, but you start with the opposite the one in the middle and go forward.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAwesome.\nI did have to have two elements, which I should have only had to have one element. And so with a box shadow, you just did a box shadow and and scooch it over with the position. What I found is too that they were all multiples of uh 10 and then 20. So if I scooched over by 10 and then 20, the next one would be zero, then 40, and the next one is going to be 10 and 60. And that was like the the thing. So I figured that out really quickly. But the problem is, guys, check this out. This is insane to me. And I did not I don't know how to fix this. If I go the next step up, which is 60, and then I make it red, watch what happens to this box shadow. It's not a circle anymore. Yeah, it flattens. What's going on there?\nYeah. And so my only assumption is that it has to do with the fact that this div is 60x 60 cuz if I went to 80 by 80, it goes to being a circle. But then what I figured this out too late cuz what I would have done is I would have gone to 8080 uh scaled all the math and then used a CSS scale to to get it down to be the right size. And then I would have been at here for for sizewise.\nThe thing with border radius, I learned this when researching how squir the squirles work is that once it passes more than 50% of the greater of the width or height, then it just flips to it. It maxes out. So you think a box shadow is just going to make repeat the shape. This is bizarre. And I was just like I was like, I'm cruising. I'm going to finish this with 10 minutes left and get 100. And then it was like, what? What is going on?\nIt's just being clipped.\nBut my high score was 618. Uh 5'9, 100% match. Uh really bummed out that I couldn't figure that out. Couldn't take really good though.\nIt's nice when it's all 10 base, too, as well. You're not fussing with pixels here and there.\nBut that would have been so short, Scott, if you didn't like you would have that entire last selector would been not have been on there.\nOh yeah, I know. Huge.\nYeah, you would have killed me. Well, that's great for me because you got faster.\nWe tied. We tied with a completely different approach. 322 characters.\n1359. Wow.\nYeah. So, exact same score as you.\nYeah. Exact same score. But I just I just have position fixed with four circles. You position that yellow circle in the right spot and then the blue one and the other yellow one and then the olive one.\nWow.\nYeah. 322 characters.\nCould you use inset instead of top right, bottom left? Dude, I will tell you what. Inset Wes does not work in this. I don't know why. I I used position fixed, inset, auto, auto on mine. Nothing. Inset 100 pixels, whatever. Nothing. Uh, every time I go to inset, it does not work in CSS battles.\nSo, you probably would have destroyed this if you could use inset.\nOh, but then I probably have to use pixels. So, that makes it a little bit longer. Yeah.\nOh, you have to use pixels with inset. You have to put at least some unit on there to get it to work.\nCool.\nNice. Wow, this was a this is a nailbiter. Very very close.\nYeah, I didn't think you'd get anywhere close to the brevity of mine, but the the radial gradients is a lot to type.\nA+.\nYeah, everybody pulling a string of W's together.\nJust coming out from the I don't know any sports analogies, but\nall right. Of course, I won again. Radio gradients for the win. That's all I'm using from here on out. Uh, thanks for everyone for tuning in. If you want to watch us do any other ones, we have one right here. And I don't know if they still do it, but another one right here. And uh thanks for tuning in. Comment below who you think did the best job, except in unless you're going to say CJ. And we'll catch you in the next one.\nPeace.\n",

    "cleanText": "This is episode number 96 with Dr. Jason Corso, professor at the University of Michigan and co-founder of Voxel51.\n\nWelcome back to the SuperDataScience Podcast. We've got an exceptional guest for you today. It's Dr. Jason Corso. He's professor of robotics, electrical engineering, and computer science at the prestigious University of Michigan. With over 20 years of research experience spanning video understanding, robotics, and AI, he's published over 150 academic papers in that time that together have been cited over 20,000 times. In addition to his academic work, he's also co-founder and chief science officer at Voxel51, a leading platform for visual AI development. His work bridges academic innovation and obviously real-world impact, earning him major honors that I don't have time to list, but there's a ton of them. Today's episode skews a bit more towards hands-on practitioners like data scientists and ML engineers, particularly anyone tackling computer vision problems. That said, Jason is a charismatic and exceptional communicator, so perhaps any listener to this podcast will enjoy today's episode. In it, Jason details how his research spin out Voxel51 is solving the biggest bottleneck in computer vision, the surprising way autonomous vehicles learn to handle accidents they've never seen, and why the secret to better AI models isn't better algorithms, it's something else that's hiding in plain sight. All right, let's jump right into our conversation. Jason, welcome to the SuperDataScience Podcast. Where are you calling in from today?\n\nUh, great to be here, Jon. I'm calling in from Western New York in Buffalo.\n\nNice. It is a town that uh it's it's the airport that I frequent most in the world. I actually I love that airport. It is tiny, efficient. Uh it's kind of just the right size. It has everything you need, but you can get in and out of there very quickly. And so I frequently am going between New York and Toronto, and Buffalo is my airport of choice. Uh lots of interesting there's there's a famous art museum in Buffalo, isn't there?\n\nUh there is. Uh, it recently had a renovation. It's called the AKG now, but it's used to be called the Albbright Knox Gallery, and it was actually designed by a local architect by the name of Eie Green. And in fact, when I uh when I used to live here uh some 15, 20 years ago, I owned one of his houses as well, and it was such a cool little house on the west side. Buffalo is a great old city, old architecture and stuff like that.\n\nFor sure. It's something that probably people don't expect if they've never been there, but it's stunning. You know, you can kind of from the highway, you can kind of look, you can there's a lot of great vantage points of the architecture in the city as you drive around it. And it's beautiful.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. Good people, good views, and uh we got the Bills as well. So, there you go.\n\nYeah, the Buffalo Bills for sure. That was my football team growing up as well. Getting that uh in Toronto, we had, you know, we'd get American broadcasts over the lake, over Lake Ontario. And so my local football team growing up was the Bills as well.\n\nUh so I I lived through the was it four or five years that the Bills made the Super Bowl in the 90s and never won.\n\nIt was four years although pre it predates my my Buffalonian status but um it still is painful for the region I think. Although these days uh the Bills kind of the city kind of rallies behind or the whole region kind of rallies behind the Bills. Uh but anyway yeah\n\nfor sure they're a strong club. Um, so yeah, so despite living in Buffalo, you are actually actually a University of Michigan professor. You're a professor of robotics over there as well as a professor of electrical engineering and computer science. Tell us a bit Jason or Professor Corso about the work that you do over there at Michigan.\n\nRight on. So please call me Jason. Uh, so so yeah, so I I live this dual life. I also have a family. My family's here. uh but um yeah I'm a 20some year veteran of of the generally computer vision um the angle I take in computer vision is uh what I call like physically grounded cognitive systems right so I'm interested in problems since my dissertation right my dissertation was called techniques for vision-based human computer interaction right so we had cameras watching humans and the humans would do things and then that would in you know create interaction scenarios you know in fact we built this thing called the 4D touchpad. I think it was at like a workshop at CVPR in maybe like 2003 or something like that. And it it used like gesture tracking uh and in some sense created multi-touch prior to there being like iPads and so on. But that's the type of of work that I've done over the years. My research group uh has focused on areas like uh video captioning. You know, we have the f one of the first if not the first paper at CBPR 2013 on video captioning. We apply that nowadays to guidance of humans doing activities, you know, like I'm cooking a dish in my kitchen or whatever, right? Like I'm about to reach for the salt, but the recipe is for sugar and and my AI can tell me, you know, don't don't use salt, use sugar. Or more more socially relevant perhaps is an exciting project we have right now, which is applying the same type of AI agentic guidance type scenarios in rural healthcare scenarios, right? like a major problem in the US and really worldwide is just a shortage of trained physicians. So our project is is trying to enable the upskilling of like RNs or physicians assistants or nurse practitioners who can go out into rural America in in say a mobile clinic or whatnot and do anything from like um cardiac ultrasound to like deep vein thrombosis in the lower limbs with um AI kind of guiding them through every step of the process, you know. So it's it's an exciting area. I really enjoy computer vision. are joining the boundaries of like computer vision and the fact that like humans are looking to be or or like we are trying to build systems that work alongside humans to upscale them or to basically um create you know a better world in some sense and maybe that's pie in the sky but that's that's a real driver right like we do things by by humans for humans and of humans right so so that's that's been a 20 year 20 year driver\n\nyeah and it sounds it sounds like cutting edge research it sounds like it would be very impactful. It doesn't sound pie in the sky either. It sounds like a real tangible way to be making the world a better place with with which AI with AI, which is perhaps the thing that we love most on this show uh above all. And you me you mentioned something there CVPR for our listeners who don't know what that means. It's the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. And you can correct me if I'm wrong on this Jason, but I think it's hands down the biggest most important academic conference on computer vision in the world. Uh it's definitely one of the two. Yeah. So there there have been two historically that are among the top. So CBPR is one of them. The other one is called ICCV um international conference on computer vision. Usually these generally there are two conferences per year and so it's CVPR happens every year ICCV happens every other year and then the third one is ECCV European conference on computer vision and that alternates with ICCB but generally those are the two key conferences in computer vision. there are many others that are that are amazing especially now as the as the field has been exploding you know in some sense I I wish there were even more conferences that were a little smaller right because I mean when I was a grad student CVPR had something like 500 papers max maybe a thousand attendees actually probably even had less than 500 papers you know 20 years ago nowadays I think there's like 2500 papers on average every year 10,000 plus attendees uh it's great to see the growth but it's also hard to know where to go how to focus like what what to you know what you know what you're going to learn at the conference and so on.\n\nFor sure. Interesting to hear about that growth over time. And so with all of this experience with this 20 years of experience that you have in computer vision, you identified about a decade ago some key problems that could be solved in this space with a technological solution and you founded you co-founded a company called Voxel51. You were CEO of that company for it looks like about seven years and then for the past few years you've been chief science officer. Tell us about Voxel51, how it got started, how it came out of your university research.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. So, so you know I as a as an individual um I identify kind of like as a creator. So I've always had like one hand on the keyboard while I'm lecturing or whatever or or meeting with someone because I just love to build things. And over time in you know in in the in the research lab we we began to notice that data was playing a key role alongside algorithmic or model work. You know usually when you when you're an academic you're writing a paper generally that paper's going to be about a new model or a new algorithm. And although you know there had been some early works in data sets like Caltech 256 or like in an imageet and so on like the the number of data papers was significantly dwarfed by the number of model papers and and it remains true today right it's just the the general mind the mindset however we began to notice that like as model capabilities began to improve for a given problem say object detection or you know even more concretely like pedestrian avoidance for autonomous vehicles just as an example, like we began to notice that you can kind of pull a model architecture off the shelf, one of maybe half a dozen or so, and the performance you got out of of the system you ended up training was more of a function of the data set you used to train that model than it was which of the six model architectures you chose. Uh, and you know, we we basically began to build this conviction around data is at least as important, if not more important than the model architecture you choose. And ultimately, Box Soul 51 grew out of that observation or that vision, right? Like this this notion that wait people need data. And it's not like we were the first to think this or the only to think this, right? But like our initial one of our initial mantras was better data, better models. And and we like truly believe in that. Um but and importantly as a creator or a builder like um there just was not enough tooling around how one works with data, how one analyzes data, right? like as a grad student, I had this data set where I actually went into the cafeteria early one morning and took some photos, you know, of of the layout I was trying to do m basically like semantic mapping of of the environment and I think my data set had a hundred images, maybe even a little less than that, right? So, like, you know, I could look and study the impact of any algorithmic modification on every single sample of that data set when I when I was doing this whatever it was 20ome years ago. Um fast forward to even just 10 years after that like 10 years ago when imaginet came around a million data samples or actually the the full image is 20 20 some million samples right nowadays you have five billion samples per data set even in some open source data sets like the Lion 5B you may have heard of or like I know the Florence the Florence 2 data set or Florence 2 model was trained on a five billion sample data set it's just impossible it was it was becoming impossible to like basically put your eyeballs on enough of the data samples to build an intuition over what when you work over with your model how it's going to be impacted by the data and vice versa and so on. So, so ultimately box 51 is a company that tries to speed up the work you do with your data and the work you do with your models by providing the right dev tool in some sense for visual AI. Um, we are an open source tool. We released the open source tool in August of 20.\n\nUh it's been a while ago now that I'm forgetting. It's either 2019 or 2020. Don't quote me on which one of those it is. We have about uh three million installs of of that or more. Um and you know we've always tried to have the like the IC like the ideal user ideal customer of the of that tool is really a like heav heavy technical data scientist or computer vision scientist. And so it's, you know, super flexible and you can write plugins for it or, you know, extensions for it for the front end and the back end. And um, yeah. Anyway, great. So that's a quick overview of where we were and sort of why we got started. Um, not sure if you have any questions about that.\n\nUh, no, it's it's a it's a great story on the origin. You identify a painoint through your expertise and then you're able to create a product to solve that painpoint. and you've already had a huge amount of success with three million downloads and uh the GitHub repo which so we'll talk about I realize the open source is a little bit different but it also gives some perspective on how important solutions like this are when the GitHub repo has 10,000 stars like your stuff.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYep. Um and uh have you ever heard of um so there's we actually recently in an episode in episode 901 which came out a few weeks ago um we we had someone on the show named Lilith Bat Leah who she runs um workshops at ICML and I clear two other big uh machine learning conferences which obviously you know Jason but just for our audience um and uh so she ran working groups or she runs working groups at uh on datacentric machine learning. Uh so it's a DMLR, datacentric machine learning research is kind of like the acronym that's used there. Have you come across that that acronym before? It sounds similar to what you're describing.\n\nUh absolutely. I mean I mean datacentric ML can mean a lot of things. Uh but even at Voxel we we used to use that in our like outbound communitydriven marketing material as well. Like I mean I you know it I say it can mean a lot of things not to put it down but it's it is like it's it's critical to recognize that you know when we think of building technical technological software systems we think of writing code and then we're you know we hope that you know like we can debug a software system like the the tool we're using right now to record this right. Um but when you think of machine learning there's code and then there's the data that goes into the code in some sense like it gets kind of transformed into data weights or coefficients or something something like that. But these two things are inseparable and and as the evolution from you know what what some folks have called software 1.0 just code to software 2.0 which is essentially just a different type of code. It's just humans can't\n\n\nReally write it.\nWe write other code to train it from data.\nUm, you know, so like data, data has been used to train up machine learning systems for decades now.\nBut I think there's just an when we, when we collectively as a, as a research community or a user community, think of datacentric machine learning, I think what, what I was saying earlier, where we tend to emphasize that, oh, wait, it's not just that there's data in this code and the code is more important, it's that you really cannot separate or divorce the two things, right?\nLike the data and the structure, the model structure, or even like the ops underneath it.\nThese are, these are wed together in a way that is critical to understand all facets.\nAnd if you really want to build a successful ML system or AI system, you really need the right tooling around analyzing the data, analyzing the models, analyzing the ops, and they, they do need to work in concert so that you have a good sense of what's going on.\nIt seems really obvious when we say it out loud like this, but it, it is amazing how much attention, you know, in terms of new releases go on to, you know, some exciting new model.\nBut in something like this in computer vision, where you think about it's probably easy for users to imagine something like the machine vision problem of an autonomous vehicle, where you have sensors on a vehicle that are driving through streets and you wanted to make safe driving decisions.\nUm, obviously as close to 100% of the time as possible in that kind of scenario.\nIt makes it kind of easy to imagine how, you know, the model, if it has, you know, some percentage improvement over some other model, like that's great, but the model isn't going to be valuable at all if you don't have data covering the whole gamut of situations that that autonomous vehicle is going to run into.\nUh, you know, if you, if you only train the vehicle on situations where there's no car accidents, it's like, never, there's no possible world where that AI system could know how to handle, uh, you know, seeing an accident happen right in front of it.\nAnd so hopefully, you know, that's a very simplistic example that I just gave, but hopefully that, you know, it kind of allows us to visualize pretty easily the critical importance of data in having any AI model work effectively in the real world, which computer vision systems, I think, basically always are operating in the real world.\nYep.\nSo, I mean, I think you're, I think you hit it on the head, really, right?\nLike that, like, and I, and I think it's a great example, especially because, um, you know, I mean, I, I have an 18-year-old recently taught her how to drive and so on.\nI'm wondering like, how many miles does she have to drive before she's going to see even like a near miss or even just a situation where like a kid runs out into the street, right?\nUm, so I think the number is something like, um, it's in the tens of millions of miles driven for every accident that's recorded by like the US government or Nitsa.\nUm, and you know, and so like, actually finding the hardest part about this, this, this world of building highly successful, like 99.999, whatever percent accurate systems is getting your, getting the data, then getting the data labeled, and then training the model and figuring out what are the failure modes, what are the success cases, what are my failure modes, and where do I need to add more data and begin this process, right?\nSo actually, something I'm really excited about at Voxel51 right now is this new direction we've taken our product, you know, like I think annotation companies, right?\nThe problem of going, taking raw data and and labeling, put box boxes or class labels or classes or whatever on your data samples to train the machine learning algorithm on it, um, those were probably like the first wave of companies in, in computer vision, at least in modern computer vision, machine learning based computer vision, um, but Voxel51 never identified as an annotation company.\nWe were always in some sense, we, we explicitly decided strategically, are we are not an annotation company.\nWe actually don't even support.\nYou can do a lot of things in Voxel51, including load varieties of different labels into the software tool and visualize them and so on, but until this coming summer, you will not have been able to edit them in our tool.\nLike we were so against it, almost like we had almost like a one button mouse challenge that Apple had over the years, right?\nUm, and, and, um, you know, nowadays, like that, that annotation problem is so, has been so central, but I think it's transforming based on this, these two, these decades of progress.\nAnd so with, um, performant foundation models now, we have this tool, this new product line called Verified Auto-Labeling, which can take this raw media, automatically generate labels on it via foundation models.\nAnd obviously, like there's a, there's going to be a spectrum of performance, right?\nFor certain classes that the foundation models have heard a lot, have seen a lot, like pedestrians or bicycles or other vehicles, it's going to work pretty well.\nFor other scenarios like teddy bears or, you know, certain types of hats or coffee mugs, whatever, maybe it'll work less.\nBut the, but the critical aspect and what's I think really exciting from our perspective is the V and the verification part of that, right?\nUm, what our workflow is, right?\nYou take your raw media, you apply foundation models, and we have like a battery of them you can apply against it, and then we have our custom ML that will rank the outputs from those foundation models so that you can in batch have high confidence that you're like automatically going to accept something like 70% of them, you know, and already that's a huge amount of money that you're saving and like in time and so on.\nAnd then for the remaining 30%, we can still rank them again.\nSo you can have your human labelers, your human QA people only spending time on the challenging scenarios, right?\nThe scenarios like the ones you're pointing out, like the corner cases, the hard cases that we really need humans to look at and humans to verify and so on.\nVery cool.\nSo this Verified Auto-Labeling, this new initiative that's, you said summer, so we're talking northern hemisphere summer for our international listeners.\nSo it's kind of like around the time that this episode is coming out is when this Verified Auto-Labeling starts to be something that people can, can use in Voxel51.\nYeah, actually it, it recently went into alpha with some customers.\nSo it's already, it's already in alpha and we are improving it and it will be, uh, in every release over the, over the coming two months, probably, it will get more functionality and more users, um, to adopt it.\nYeah.\nFantastic.\nAnd it sounds like this is then solving what is the biggest bottleneck in computer vision and you're doing that using intelligent techniques so that, uh, it makes it way more time-efficient and cost-effective orders of magnitude relative to having humans be annotating the data.\nAbsolutely.\nYeah.\nI mean, the, the, the, like the tagline that I like, not approved by marketing, but that I like these days is like, uh, curation is the new annotation, right?\nLike, I mean, annotation 1.0, know, if we want to use that analogy, was basically, I don't really know how to filter my data, so I'm just going to send it all to humans to label and I have to pay for all that and it's time consuming as well, and then I'm going to get it back and give it to my machine learning engineers and maybe one, 1%, maybe 10% of that's useful, you know, it's hard to say, you don't really know, it's kind of like walking in a dark hallway without any light switch on, right?\nWhich door are you going to try?\nI think nowadays we're probably in like the one, you know, annotation 1.5 era, where it's, it's obvious to apply a foundation model even for something like prefiltering, just so you can rank your data so you're going to send it to humans to label.\nAnd I think the like Verified Auto-Labeling is farther along the line in saying, wait a second, sure, pre-filter your data, only apply certain things, but we're also saying, wait, you also, you still don't have to have humans annotate everything, right?\nYou, you can like, you can rank them, filter them and so on, so you can just accept the automatic labels out of the box.\nAnd where do I think we're actually going?\nLike, what is actually annotation 2.0, and that this is not what we're releasing this summer, but it's likely coming in the future, right?\nIf I have my way, um, you know, is this notion that instead of the humans asking the foundation models what they should label or what the labels are or or what have you, there's, it's more agentic, where like there's a problem statement given, you know, behemoth amount of unlabeled data, and then the models are able to actually ask the humans questions just when, when it's necessary, um, and, uh, it's more, more driven by the, the AI agent, if you will, so even fewer, less human involvements that's needed.\nThat is awesome, Jason.\nSo, it sounds like Voxel51 has figured out how to leverage the latest technology in terms of what we can do with automation to allow people to get the highest quality data for building high performance computer vision models at a fraction of the effort and the cost.\nThat's cool.\nAbsolutely.\nPut a nail on the head right there.\nYep.\nNice.\nUm, so yeah, fantastic.\nI mean, that's, that's a, this is a Friday episode, so it's, uh, it's, it's, it's not amongst our longer episodes, and so, you know, we, that was, uh, a short but very rich episode with you, Professor Corso, Jason, uh, we could certainly, I mean, we could easily have had an episode that was like, you know, Joe Rogan style, three or four hours with you, I'm sure, uh, on computer vision if, if we had to, because, uh, you have such rich, such a rich understanding of the space.\nUm, before I let my guests go, I always ask them for a book recommendation.\nWhat do you have for us?\nUh, cool.\nSo, I am an avid reader and I was just, just saying, well, if you want to do a saying in my head, if you want to do a three or four hour hour episode one time, maybe when we're both stuck in the Buffalo airport in a snowstorm, we, we can record then.\nUm, avid reader here.\nUm, I guess one of the best books I've read in the last few months is a book called Quit by Annie Duke.\nAnd it really puts the, you know, like I'm, I'm a, I'm a hard worker.\nI'm a grinder, right?\nSo like, I'm always one to like, really just want to see a project through.\nAnd it really puts that type of grit, which every founder needs in some sense and every professor really needs these days as well, up against this notion that like, make sure you're being smart about how you spend your time and how you're planning, pre-planning when you might want to deep switch or quit, quit, quit an angle and go in a different angle.\nI think for, for really any adult, I think it, like the lessons learned that, you know, that she writes in this book were fantastic, are fantastic.\nI like that a lot.\nYeah, it's, uh, it's tricky for those of us, probably a lot of our listeners, you know, if they, if the way that you choose to spend your free time is listening to a technical podcast about data science and AI, uh, you're probably somebody who has a lot of grit and is really pushing their career, and yeah, but this kind of thing, it becomes important, especially, you know, as opportunities accumulate, as you, as you focus and have more grit, more and more opportunities come up and you can't keep doing everything.\nYou know, it's a, it's a tricky thing.\nYou know, even just things like I used to be pre-pandemic, I used to be able to be inbox zero and respond to anything that should be responded to.\nAnd you know, there's things that's a simple, silly example.\nI mean, it sounds like this quick thing is kind of more about big strategic decisions, but just figuring out what you have to let go so that you can make space for even bigger things.\nAbsolutely.\nI mean, there's no, in terms of like the strategy and the tactics of decision-m, there's nothing too small to think about, frankly.\nSo like the notion of email inbox, like or inbox zero or whatever is highly relevant.\nI think the way I would put it is one of, one of our investors uses, has used the term, um, indigestion, right?\nLike if, if you're so successful, you're going to get indigestion over just trying to do too much, and, uh, it's, it's definitely something to be to watch out for, I think, and, and the author Annie Duke really does a good job of explaining that.\nNice.\nSounds like a great book.\nAnd then so for people who want more literary recommendations from, uh, your avid reading brain or, uh, you know, more insights on what you're up to with Voxel51, computer vision research, where should they be following your work?\nAbsolutely.\nYeah.\nSo, uh, I guess number one would be to follow me on LinkedIn.\nUm, I, I do try to post two, three, two to three times per week, uh, various opinions and so on.\nAlso, you can find the Voxel51 open source repository at github.com/voxel51.\nThe word 51.\nUh, and you can also find me, find me on, on Blue Sky at Jason Corso as well.\nI knew you'd be on Blue Sky.\nI called that before we even hit the record button when I said that this question would come off at the end.\nI was like, you have the right profile, uh, to also have a, a Blue Sky account.\nUh, I'm gonna have to get in there at some point.\nI'm not academic enough anymore that I have to have one, but, uh, yeah, I'd like to, I'd like to still pretend that I'm academic enough.\nUm, nice.\nThank you so much, Jason.\nThis has been an awesome episode.\nThanks for joining us, and I look forward to that, uh, three to four hour episode that we record in the snowstorm.\nRight on.\nIt was great to chat, Jon.\nThanks for having me.\nThanks to Jason Corso for coming on the show and providing such an informative and entertaining episode.\nIn it, Professor Corso covered how he discovered that model performance depends more on the quality of training data than on the choice of algorithm architecture, leading to Voxel51's founding principle: Better data, better models.\nUh, he also talked about how Voxel51's Verified Auto-Labeling uses foundation models to automatically label data, then ranks output so teams can accept about 70% automatically and focus human reviewers only on challenging edge cases, overall saving massive time and cost.\nHe also talked about how we've moved from annotation 1.0, sending everything to humans, through annotation 1.5, where we prefilter with AI and are now approaching, uh, annotation 2.0, where AI agents actively ask humans questions only when necessary.\nAll right, I hope you enjoyed today's episode.\nBe sure not to miss any of our exciting upcoming episodes.\nSubscribe to this podcast if you haven't already, but most importantly, I just hope you'll keep on listening.\nUntil next time, keep on rocking it out there and I'm looking forward to enjoying another round of the SuperDataScience Podcast with you very soon.\n[Music]\n",

    "cleanText": "Bankless Nation is the third week of July. It's time for the Bankless Weekly rollup. David, it is Crypto Week this week. Okay. That's just not, that's not just me. Are we talking crypto this week? Yeah. No, this is Trump declaring it Crypto Week. He said, \"Happy Crypto Week.\" Did you see this? Where did he say this? He said this on social. Yeah. Yeah. And the reason why is because the Genius Bill is in front of the House as well as the Clarity Act, some other house bills for crypto. So, he's declaring you and uh everybody at BANKLESS a happy Crypto Week. We got to talk about the Genius Bill. It is a happy Crypto Week. I felt that actually this week. Okay, so the Genius Bill at the time of recording, we don't know whether it has passed or not, but I'm going to go ahead and say it passed. Okay, Bankless listeners, they're living the future. We're recording this on Thursday. The bill uh is going up for vote at 4 p.m. today. We don't know the outcome yet. You guys do. I think it passed, David. Okay, hold me to that prediction. I'm assuming that it's passing. It's going to pass. And also, I don't think that that is why the MARKETS has pumped, especially Ethereum has pumped. I think that the market will pump more as a result of this passing. After it passes, after it passes. Oh, it has passed. Of course, it has passed. It has passed. Yes. Uh, also, we got to talk about Bitcoin. Hit an all-time high. We got another all-time high week back to back. But, I do feel like all eyes are on ETH this week because there's not a Bitcoin story this week. No, there's been a vibe change. We talked about that last week. But now we've got ETFs, ETH ETFs, breaking all-time high records. We also have Tom Lee saying he wants to buy 5% of all ETH supply. That's a true story. How much? That's like 6 million ETH. And he is not anywhere close to 6 million ETH right now. No, he's got to work his way up, but he's getting there. And then of course, I'll cover the PUMP ICO because we don't want Ryan to do that. How did it go? Who bought in? What happened afterwards? And then Coinbase launched its everything app, brand new release out of Coinbase. We're entering in the world where crypto companies like Robin Hood, Coinbase, they are doing their own internal like, you know, jazzy marketing campaigns, marketing like streams like Steve Jobses and they're doing the the they're doing their own road shows in their own kind of context, which is pretty cool. Uh we're going to talk about the Roman Storm Trial as well. And remember that one time the Polymarket founder got raided by the FBI? Yeah. Uh we're going to hear more about that story as well. But first, before we get into the MARKETS and talk about all the different ETH treasury companies that are up like 40% on the week, we're going to first talk about fundamentals. Uh and all those fundamentals you're going to hear are at the Bankless Summit. The Bankless Summit is a one-day event that we are throwing at Dev Connect. We are recruiting all the greatest speakers in Ethereum to give 20 to 30 minute talks, no panels, just straight information about Ethereum. The newest speaker is Donna from L2B. He is joining the ranks to talk about native roll-ups and all the research that he's going there. But we've also got Justin Drake, Ongar, Tamas, Arjun, Uma, Roy. It's going to be a who's who. It's a TED talks for Ethereum the second day of Dev Connect. So, if you are going to Dev Connect and Bonosaris, which I highly recommend cuz all you're going to go do is you're going to go down to Bonosaris, you're going to talk about ETH, you're going to eat steak, you're going to drink Malbeck, and then you're going to talk about ETH some more. I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to go to Bonosaris. They are the people that adopted stable coins and ETH. They are the people that built Maker Dow. They are the the people over at Open Zeppelin. It's a great place to just be a crypto person and then once you're done being a crypto person, you just eat steak. It's great. Anyways, uh I'm very excited about it. Uh this is again happening the Tuesday of Dev Connect. Get your tickets before I increase the prices. Prices are $80 right now. They will not be $80 in the future. They are going to track ETH. Uh and so they will be about $160 by the time we run around to Dev Connect. That's an ETH price prediction. Okay, that's a 6K ETH if I'm doing the math right. No, 7K ETH. Oh my god. Wow. We are bullish on the week. Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin price because we got an all-time high this week. Not quite at the time of recording, but previous to that, what did we hit and where are we at right now? Uh we are currently coming in at $19,000. Bitcoin is up 7 uh% on the week. A good old 7%. The new all-time high $122,800. I think I think it did hit $121,000. Uh so a pretty number. Yeah, it fell off. It fell off all the way, all the way. It crashed, Ryan. Bitcoin crashed this week from $123,000 all the way down to $116,000 and has since come up to $119,000. See, they always told not to buy because it would crash. They It always crashes every time. Not only that, why you never buy Bitcoin. Well, you know, part of the story this cycle, of course, has been the uh infinite institutional bid for Bitcoin, the asset. You're seeing that in no no better place to see that than in BlackRock's IBIT. So BlackRock's IBIT, of course, is the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. It just became the fastest ever to hit 80 billion in AUM. And David, I got to tell you, it's not even 80 billion. 80 billion. My god. Did I say million? You said million. I got to up those uh up those numbers. 80 billion. Bear got in your mind. Okay. But look at this chart. It's like it's like, oh, it's the fastest ever. Okay. Nothing else is close. It's four times faster than the nearest competitors. It looks like like all the all the nearest competitors are like all within a pretty similar range to each other, like pretty neck and neck. And then Bitcoin is like I am four times faster than all of you. This is why Wall Street is so bullish on uh on crypto assets this cycle is because they're providing a lot of the crap uh a lot of the capital flows here. Um the question is, is Bitcoin fair market value or not? Well, if you look at some charts like the long-term holder net unrealized profit and loss, the the nuple, okay, this is basically how how up are Bitcoin holders. I believe it's measure uh that it's that kind of measure. We're actually not in froth market territory. Okay, we're between the npples are not frothy. Yeah, the npples are not frothy yet at least. We're somewhere at 69 and that's the uh the below the 69. Have I been sabotaged with this week's agenda? My god, is this an even a real metric? Forget this. Let's go to the classic rainbow. I like this chart much better. This is the classic Eric Wall rainbow price chart. It's way easier to chart than long-term holder net unrealized profit loss. What the is that? No, you just look at the rainbow chart. We are clearly still on the lower side of the rainbow chart. We are in the accumulation zone. We are not in the massive deal. We are not in the fire sale. We are not in the buy by buy section. We're in the accumulation zone, which is a modestly leaning bias towards buying, but not overly so, but we are definitely on the lower side of the Bitcoin price. We want we what we want to do is we want to get into the yellows and oranges slowly. We want to get into the elves and oranges in like 2027 which would put Bitcoin somewhere between one and $2 million if we got if we got to the orange red area where like FOMO is happening and then also as a sell signal. Yeah, this is a much better I feel set up. I think I was set up with this week's agenda and talking about I gave you the opportunity to kill this car, but you just walked right into that one. All right. You wanted to talk about this. So there's a new denomination. I think this is so cool. This is okay. So this is we all like to talk about price, you know, Bitcoin, there's only 21 million uh, you know, price targets, blah blah blah blah blah, there's also like the cultural element of Bitcoin acceptance and like, you know, the the tolerableness of Bitcoin and this is an indication that Bitcoin is just becoming so understood. Do you remember the first time we got into the Bloomberg terminals? That that was huge. That was a huge moment for us, right? And we're not $3,000 or $7,000 or something. Okay. The cool thing that's happening right now, I maybe this is small, maybe I'm over hyping this, but if you want to go look at Bitcoin in the Bloomberg terminals, the pricing chart on the right side, like the graph where you see the prices, the little tick marks, yeah, they are denominated in millions of dollars. So right now on the price of a Bitcoin according to Bloomberg when you go up and open up Bloomberg, you see a Bitcoin price of 0.112 million, not $112,000 or whatever, you see, you see it denominated in millions of dollars, which means if you imply, if implied it's going to be worth millions of dollars, like it wouldn't be worth million dollars, people don't assume it's going to hit 1 point something or 2 point something, the fact that we are denominated publicly on mainstream society that we are denominating Bitcoin in millions of dollars, I think is a huge historic land like cultural milestone. I choose to believe that and also you need to make room on the graphs, right? So every 10x you got to you got to move the uh, you know, the point somewhere, right? So pretty soon we're going to denominate in like what, I don't know, tens of millions of dollars, maybe. I is that is that what's next for a million? I think I think Bitcoin needs to get to a million dollars and then we can start talking about that. Yeah, this cycle, you think that's happening in this cycle? Well, what I just said, yeah, sometime in 2027, one to $2 million Bitcoin. That's what the nuples tell you. Or the rainbow. That's what the rainbow tells me. Yeah. Okay. But the but the nuples are also pointing in that direction. We've had enough here. Uh let's get to the ETH price on the week. This is uh tell us about ETH price. I am very excited about this number, but why why don't I let you say it? The number, the number for ETH, $3,420, up 23%. Not just double digits, but double digits with a two handle on it. Mostly driven by massive ETH Treasury accumulation. I woke up every single day to three different ETH Treasury companies announcing they are purchasing of somewhere between 10 and $300 million of ETH. And I got confused as like, okay, was this yesterday's announcement or is this tomorrow's announcement? Which announcement is this? Is this a repeat from the last one? Which which BTCS exactly like MNBT like treasury company is doing this? I don't know. They're all just buying each one is buying like somewhere between like 20, 10, I think like 20 was the smallest number that I heard, like $20 million, and then the largest I heard is like $300 million. But it just happened. It was just a big week. And then and then and on top of that, we're going to talk about this. ETH ETF inflows had its largest number ever. So, BlackRock ETH ETF took in 500 million of ETH for a total combined 700 something something $700 million of inflows. 726 million yesterday. That's all time. That's the biggest inflows ever for Ether, the asset from the ETF by far. By far, it was a big week for ETH. Really big week. also kind kind of close to flipping uh Bitcoin on that on the daily. Remember that's a kind of a in terms of daily, which is already massive because Bitcoin is still four times larger than ETH right now. It is massive. We've got some other measures of that. Maybe maybe we'll just talk about that for a second. So, uh this is Nate Jerassi saying we have record daily inflows for spot ETH ETFs, nearly 720 million. Obliviates the previous mark of 430 million. Obliviates. Just obliviates. Oh, obliterates. Obliterates. I'm using Harry Potter language. That's how bullish I am. Okay. Um, if you want to get into Anthony Cissano level bullishness though. Oh, yeah. That's I don't know. You can't go any higher than that. You start. Yeah. That's max. That's like, you know, your power maxed at Anthony Cissano, you know, bullishness. So, he likes to do this and he's been doing this on the daily basis. He likes to take the net inflows and then he looks likes to look at the the the net ETH issuance. So, we got net net ETH inflows of about 720 million. And do you know how much ETH supply was minted that same day, David? Not that much, less than that. 6.7 million. Okay. So, I'm not going to use the words ultrasound money here because that's not what we're talking about. But we are talking about um like a lack of supply in this market because this is the demand, the inflow demand was 110x the amount of supply issued. Okay. So much so that there are reports uh where I got that of OTC desks running out of ETH. Okay. Winter just said that Wintermute said, \"Yeah, we don't have any ETH on our desks. Everyone bought it.\" Can I be nitpicky about Sazzle's tweet? No, this is a bull, this is bull mode. Oh, we'll allow it. Okay, you get you get one one bearish thing. Go. This is we're what he's doing is he's he's like kind of using the whole this happened with the early days of the Bitcoin uh treasuries, too. But the difference here is, well, actually, actually, wait a second. This is a bullish interpretation of Anthony's tweet. Bitcoin miners have to sell their ETH. And so when we look at the\n\n\nThe Bitcoin miners have to sell their ETH. You lost me that when they when Bitcoin miners. Yeah. Uh, excuse me. Sorry. When Bitcoin miners mine Bitcoin and they have to sell the Bitcoin to pay for the expenses because it's very competitive, very low margins. And so when when the the sailor was accumulating like three times more than the Bitcoin mining sell pressure, there was bullish Bitcoin because like, oh, like all the supply is being soaked up by the by like Michael Sailor and the Bitcoin treasuries. Anthony is doing that same thing of alluding to that same effect. And it's just even more like there's an even larger discrepancy here between the $720 million that was purchased versus the $6.7 million of ETH that was minted. But the thing is, are you staking ETH, Ryan?\n\nI'm staking ETH.\n\nDid you Well, do you do you sell the ETH rewards that you accrue?\n\nUm, it depends. I mean, mostly, mostly not because I continue to be bullish at these prices.\n\nYeah. And so you just you just stake that ETH, too, right? That's what most ETH stakers do. They stake their ETH and then they get some rewards less their tax bills.\n\nLess tax bills, whatever. Yeah. Uh, you you pay for those in other ways. You you you take when you stake ETH stakers when they st they take their ETH rewards and they stake them again. They keep on accumulating ETH because they don't have very much costs. So they don't have to sell, right?\n\nAnd so like the there's not even any sell pressure there. It's actually just accumulation. There's just accumulation going on.\n\nYes. And the story behind the last bull market again, we're we talk about put this in perspective, right? We're not even at all-time highs. We're not even at December all-time highs. December, we're still 40% off of all-time highs.\n\nYeah. Okay. So, like at some level, this is a pump for ants still. Okay. We still have a lot more to go. I mean, 2021 was crazy. Do you remember all of that? 2020, 2021, we were rangebound from like 150 to 300 for a very long time and then went to $4,100. People don't remember uh that era of what ETH can actually do. But at that time, what was really interesting is the ETH uh monetary schedule kind of sucked where issuance was like what like 5% or something. This premerge. Yeah, it was like three ETH per block in a proof of work context. Yeah, it wasn't great.\n\nYeah, it wasn't great. This time around you have much less supply. Annual issuance is like 0.45%\n\n[Music]\n\nin a bull market under the paradigm of both proof of stake and EIP1559 which came in 2023 and 2024 2022 and 2023 respectively. See?\n\nUm, and so, yeah, the other thing I saw this week, which was interesting, there were actually days where Bitcoin was down, but down in dollars and ETH was up in dollars on the 24 hour. And again, this is this is segments of time, but I I just like, do you remember the last time we've seen this?\n\nThat has not happened in a long time. Sometimes you've had days Sometimes you've had days where ETH outperforms Bitcoin, right? Those have been rare, but I can't even remember a day this cycle where Bitcoin's actually gone down and ETH has gone up. So, this is some more story of the of the winds changing gear. We got more to talk about ETH in the in the treasury section. We're we're we're not done talking about ETH, but do you want to talk about macro really fast, though?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to know what happened here in the in macro world?\n\nYeah, in macro world in trad world. Can you start with is it bullish or bearish?\n\nOh, actually, before we get to that, um can can we just check in on coin um total crypto market cap because I feel like we might be all-time highs or coin. We are tied for all-time highs on the MARKETS. We are $3.9 trillion. We hit $3.9 trillion four months ago, 5 months ago.\n\nOh wow.\n\nSo we are tied for a total crypto market cap and that is inclusive of uh Bitcoin dominance being very high.\n\nUm yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nGood stuff. Good stuff. All right. Here's what's going on in Macro. So we had some CPI numbers in the report. Inflation picked up a little bit, but like it really wasn't that bad. It just ticked up a little bit, but it was pretty much as expected. And I think the big story here, oh I should say the numbers 12 12 month was at 2.7%. This is still the highest since February but pretty much in line with expectations. Do you know the story that was going on like uh 3 or 4 months ago about tariffs causing Inflation? We just haven't really seen that in uh the data yet. In fact, if you look at Polymarket compared to that point in time where you had US recession odds in 2025 at about 64% during a tariff craziness, it's down to about 20%. Now, of course, we have less time in the year, so the prediction gets you know like you know a little um a little more crisp uh but 20%. So recession fears have kind of evaporated from the market pretty much. And Trump of course used this as an opportunity to to to beat Powell over the head. He said, \"Consumer price is low. Bring Fed bring down the Fed rate.\" Now, he's talking to Powell, of course, about this. And I don't know if you saw this, David, but there was actually the New York Times reported that President Trump actually drafted a letter to fire Chair Powell. All right. So, he had the letter all drafted. Got to wonder what that letter said. But he had the letter. This is what the New York Times reported.\n\nI'm sure it was extremely cordial in respect.\n\nOkay. But then reporters asked Trump, um, do you have the letter? Have you drafted a letter? They say Trump said I haven't drafted a letter.\n\nReporter said, I have concept of a letter.\n\nTrump, the reporter goes, so you didn't show it to Republican lawmakers last night. This is what the New York Times was reporting.\n\nI talked about the concept of firing palace.\n\nThat's exactly what he said.\n\nNo, he actually said the word concept.\n\nYeah, this is a quote.\n\nDid it again. Verbatim that guy's a meme lord, dude.\n\nIt's great. It's great. So, uh, Trump on Jerome Powell, he said he's a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed apparently forgetting to remember that he was the guy that originally appointed Powell actually. So it's all you know great stuff. Uh but what a circus it is a circus. I mean, lots of clippable stuff you can talk about on the week, but the the bottom line for me is like what what's the probability that uh Jerome Powell is out as the Fed chair? Again, this would be unprecedented, never happened in US history, right?\n\nPolymarket gives that an odds of about 20 21% chance happening this year. Okay. So, still pretty low odds.\n\nPretty low odds. Can I get my macro take?\n\nYeah. I don't want to rock the boat. Uh, I think if you are just like irrationally or uber bullish, you want Trump to fire Powell so that he can like lower down interest rates. You think you want that? That's I don't know if you want that. I think I think that's naive. I think some like naive bulls are like, \"Yeah, just cut the interest rates. Fire Palp cut the interest rates. Let's take this to the moon.\" Which will probably happen and then there will be a massive hangover all throughout 2022 and it's going to just delay further wealth. Like it's short-term wealth. It's short-term. I don't even know if it's like who knows how the market might react to that. They might react in the opposite way. They might be like, \"Okay, that, you know, central bank impartiality is totally screwed. The US is down.\" I think that's a black swan. I think we don't want to rock the boat. We have a good thing going right now. The SPY, the S&P 500 is up 2 and a half% from its peak in uh January right before the tariff dip. So, if you just ignore the tariffs, we are we're at all-time highs right now. Like, things are good. Like, let's just not keep it going. Don't change anything. I'm kind of inclined to agree with Polymarket that I don't think it's going to happen. It's like 20%. But the odds that Trump continues to talk about Trump pal. What are the odds of that?\n\nWhat are the odds of that?\n\nI don't I don't want pal's doing fine. Give that 100% odds. Okay, coming up next, David, we got to talk about this race to a billion dollars in ETH treasury. Seems like all of these treasuries are racing and uh we may have a winner already on the week. Somebody first to a billion in ETH. Also, we've got more Bitcoin. More more Bitcoin mining companies. They're pivoting to ETH treasuries. And also, Peter Teal is making a big bet on Peter Teal has entered the chat. Yeah.

It's been a race and I got to say the race may have concluded earlier than I thought. Like it's moving faster. We've got number one. This is a strategic ETH reserve. By the way, I'm going to I'm going to filter by Treasury companies here. We got a new number one and it's just over $1 billion in ETH uh uh worth of ETH. That's uh 300,000. This is Bitmine Immersion Technologies. Okay. This is Tom Lee. This is team Tom Lee. This is the the horse that Tom Lee is the jockey of. He's riding. Yeah. He's riding this Bit Technology course and he just But he just like he just took the lead. Okay. Kind of last minute. It looked like Sharplink Gaming was going to be first. Joe Luben. That's Joe Luben's the jockey of Sharplink Gaming. Yep. That's SBET. Uh we'll talk maybe more about these tickers. Maybe people will remember. Maybe they'll forget like I do almost on a weekly basis. We got so many tickers going on. But uh Luben with SBET, he got up to 960 million at least publicly disclosed. He may have more that's not yet been been publicly disclosed, but will be. So just short of a billion. So David, Tom Lee may have won the first round here to $1 billion worth of ETH. I think um that's great for him. uh $1 billion of ETH, but but he's at 300,000 Etherish and Joe Lisman's at 280,000 Ether. Like the better number is who's first to 1 million Ether.\n\nOh, okay. Okay. But I think that's a much better race because it's it's roughly three times more than what we need where we're at right now and it's ETH denominated and so the ETH price doesn't like actually because because then we're measuring dollars of ETH price and we just why denominate in dollars like it's millions of ETH on the balance sheet is what we want.\n\nOkay, Tom's thinking the same thing.\n\n\nDavid. He's already ahead of that line of thought. Okay, this is a quote from Tom Lee. We are well about Bitcoin. We are well on our way to achieving our goal of acquiring and staking 5% of overall ETH supply. David Tom Lee wants to buy 5% of total ETH supply. What are we talking about? What's the math on that? If you want to do ETH denominated, what's ETH denominated 5% of total supply?\n\nWe are at 120 million. So times uh 0.05 is 6 million ETH. He Tom Lee wants 6 million ETH. He's got 300,000 now. He wants to get to 6 million. He's basically at zero. He basically doesn't have any ETH. That is what that is probably one Michael Sailor worth of uh ETH supply if you do the comp to uh to Bitcoin, right? Uh Sailor have three 4%. No, he might maybe he has 3% 2.5. He's trying to do a 2x sailor. All right, I've got the number. It's a 2.86% is Michael Sailor. This is Michael Micro Strategy or Strategy, I should say. Michael Micro Strategy. Michael Sailor Strategy owns 2.86% of the total Bitcoin supply. All right.\n\nSo, so Tom Lee wants 6%. And Joseph Le, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's actually interesting. ESB actually um has more ETH now publicly than the Ethereum Foundation. Okay. So that was so the Ethereum Foundation made a sale of ETH this week to fund do their normal funding operations, but they just sold it to Micro Strategy or excuse me to to ESB to Joe Luben. So it never actually hit the order books.\n\nYeah. Uh and everyone was very bullish about that. It's like, oh, the EF's not going to dump on us. They can just buy it. It's going to get absorbed by ESB. But like also at the same time it's e it's just neutral because then the ESB dollars don't actually hit the order books.\n\nThis news came in. I don't know if this is recent, but it just came in with the Edgar filings. I can't believe I'm talking about Edgar filings. Okay. This is where one of us has to do it. Okay. Uh Peter Teal bought 9% of Tom Lee's ETH treasury company. That's the bit mine. Okay. So Peter Teal is in on all of this too. Uh he's providing some of the capital for I guess these uh these ETH purchases. That seems kind of bullish to me of big money, institutional money coming into these ETH treasury products.\n\nThe thing is too, there's more human. Okay, so it's not just these companies, there's other horses that are going to enter this race. I'm pretty certain of that. Um maybe let's look at the the stock prices here. These are the ETH treasury companies that are all, you know, publicly traded in the US. So the first is SBET. So this is Sharlink. Uh look at this chart. That is an unreal chart. That is a chart that just is a parabola up starting at the very beginning of July. Okay. But before that, do you remember that? Do you remember this right here? Weird spike where it was announced and had already pumped from like a dollar up to $50 and then it crashed back down and then everyone on Twitter was like grave dancing on it. That was such a weird What happened there? What happened? Like such a lowflat like thing to do and then it seems like just a bunch more float has hit the market. The market's behaving much more orderly right now.\n\nIt it is. But this was literally I think crypto investors misinterpreting the Edgar filings, the SEC filings. They thought all the all the original holders of this were like exit uh selling and they misinterpreted it. Yeah, people were wrong. And since uh not fully recovered, but I mean it's back to um 34 actually. I don't I don't think there was much volume. Sorry. Go back there and look at the volume under the very the very big spike that happened like in June. Oh yeah, just no volume. Absolutely no volume. Good point. And so so like people were like, \"Oh, like Joseph Luben and ETH people are dumping on you.\" It's like it hit $100 for a blip because like people were FOMO. We're trying to like snipe it. Now the volumes under it are like 10 times larger than the than when it was at like $100.\n\nOkay, this is um this is Bit Mine. So this is the BMNR. This is the Tom Lee. I can't believe we're looking at stocks so much on this. Okay, dude. This is ston season, man. Okay, so I I don't know what this chart is showing you. like I would Yeah, I don't really know. It looks like um looks like that one uh mountain in the Midwest I'd like to climb. This is bit digital. Another mountain maybe you want to climb here. Uh is because it's going up. It's a nice thing here from I mean has all the price action. All these are just not really doing what ESB is doing. Yeah. And then there's BT. This one's nice. Um BTCs. Yes. The these are what I'm what I'm quoting are the top four. And if you if you're noticing all the B's in these um in these ticker symbols, it's because it used to be Bitcoin mining companies. Yeah, these are all Bitcoin miners, which is kind of interesting that Bitcoin miners are like, you know what, mining sucks. We're going to accumulate ETH.\n\nLiterally, I mean, this is the um the founder of Bid Digital told us uh we have an episode coming out with the founder of of Bid Digital and he bas he basically said it was a he said it was a business. Yeah. And so instead they've diversified into staking ETH which is also validating a chain. Um there there's another company that just uh just this morning another Bitcoin company pivoting to ETH. This is um BTC digital. This is something we hadn't c we hadn't talked about yet. This is BTCT. You got another one.\n\nThe this I wonder how far this is the brand of this is indicative. Like does Wall Street see notice like all these are Bitcoin mining companies becoming ETH treasury companies and do they take that into account as to like what's going on? Because like my narrative here as a crypto native who's familiar with these subjects is like oh yes this is highly indicative of Bitcoin long-term security problems and you're actually seeing Bitcoin miners being like, \"Okay, well we are not paid much by Bitcoin. We're not paid enough to keep on doing what we're doing. So let's do something else.\" And all of a sudden when something good lands on their doorstep, they immediately jump ship to that other good thing which is ETH which has a sustainable I mean I don't know they don't really have to do that the capex expenditure of ASIC mining and like electricity and all that stuff. They're just doing the ETH the capex is buying ETH capex is buying ETH but like yeah right but that doesn't deteriorate like the electricity and the actual hardware that they were to buy. So it's a better business and to me to me that is indicative of the security budget stuff story that we've told for years. I think that's a longer term story. I I think probably Wall Street is not looking at that right now. I think right now they're just looking at oh my god, could this be the next Bitcoin? Right. And they're very excited about that. And looks like it's a Treasury asset from early indications. One other thing that um the strategic ETH reserve actually added was the uh price to the MNAV. Very key metric.\n\nYeah, this is the premium above basically the uh the assets the ETH assets under companies. Well, higher is more of a premium. higher is more expensive. Like I don't know necessarily if it's better. It depends on like you know if you own it it's better if you're a buyer. If you are Yeah. It's not great for the buyers. If you already own it it's better because that means that's the premium that you're getting for ETH holders. You want to see higher. Higher means that there's more premium to squeeze to buy more ETH. So the premium eventually turns into buy pressure for ETH.\n\nYeah, I think that's true. Also, I think it's indicative of froth potentially in the future. Right. There there's a time where these premiums will go down and there is a time where the where the premiums will be under one but when they're above one we're not yet anyway so we got um a range you know uh ESBAT is 2.63 63 MNAV whereas Tomley is 2.19 MNAV. Anyway, investors can look at this and all the data is on the strategic ETH reserve. So, wow, that's the Treasury story and it seemed to come out of nowhere. David, there's also another Treasury on the scene this week. I don't know if you saw this. This is the Hype token getting its own treasury. Sonnet Biootherrapeutics announced I believe this is its second treasury reserve company. Hype Hypes second treasury reserve company which is pretty crazy. Uh this new company will hold 12.6 million hype tokens at $570 billion. Uh they also have $35 million of cash which they are going to use to buy hype. Uh and then also the investors in this you will hear recognize their names. Paradigm Galaxy Digital Pantera Republic Digital Digital uh Paradigm co-founder Matt Hang said we've been investors in Hyperlquid since November 2024. We keep hearing from our stratify friends that they'd like easier access. So, I'm pretty sure Paradigm just like had their hype bags and then they did the inkind investment into this new vehicle and then they get shares back and so now they have the shares and we're like why do you want those? Well, because they traded a premium.\n\nYeah, it's a free premium. That's the thing is as excited as I am about all of these treasury entities particularly for ETH and kind of the propagation of you know ETH as a as a reserve asset treasury reserve asset first right you can also start to see the signs of how this gets too bubbly and too frothy and almost how it ends right so some of these are funded by this goes for all treasuries inind contributions as you said so somebody already has a bag let's say of ether or bitcoin or hype and they just contribute it to this entity before it goes public essentially and then they get an MNAV premium. Okay? And then they can quote unquote exit to retail. All right? I'm not saying that's what's happening yet, but you start to always in the beginnings of these big narrative uh you like exciting bubble type things. You can sort of if you squint hard enough, you can see how it's also going to end. So be excited now. And also at some point in time probably it's going to get overheated and buyer beware. I don't think we're close to that yet, but you can see a little bit.\n\nI don't know if it's necessarily retail. It's squeezing the juice out of public markets, out of the trady markets, retail included, but also in also large investors, right? Like whoever is buying in their brokerage is that's that's who is paying for the premium and that's the premium turns into converts into buying the L1 asset.\n\nLet's talk about another exciting uh retail product that uh Coinbase just rolled out. This is the Base App. So, I believe this used to be David, correct me if I'm wrong, this used to be the Coinbase wallet, and they've rebranded to Toshi. Toshi turned into Coinbase wallet. Yeah, it used to be called the Toshi wallet. That's a long time ago. I remember that. Was Brian Armstrong's like cat or something or dog. Okay. So, that was a long time ago. I don't think most people even remember. Can congrats if you remember what Toshi was, but then it Coinbase wallet now it's the base the base app basically, but it's um totally revamped. So, they've added a bunch of things. What uh what have they added here? It's just that Coinbase and Bass and Jesse really leaning into onchain social. So, they're just continuing to double triple down on the whole onchain social thing. So, it is a Farcaster client. So, when you go on there, it's Farcaster uh is their own client. So, their competitor a competitor to Warpcast. Uh and so you can do tweets and all the things that Warpcast Farcaster likes allows you to do. You can buy They're using the Farcaster protocol. Importantly, Exactly. Yeah. And so you can like you know tweet and you can share out tokens that you buy and and do any do any of the other features that Farcaster has. Zoro markets for example uh there's like ENS then there's also payments. Uh and then they're doing the whole mini app thing. So there is an open graph for mini apps as well. Uh they brand it as a uh an everything app. It's a super app is what Brian Armstrong called it. And so it does a bunch of different things. Uh there's also an encrypted chat. Um and then you can just like trade tokens and like I said make payments. Uh and so kind of encroaching on world apps uh territory was because they're doing the mini apps too. Telegram the Tom Blockchain also doing mini apps. So mini apps are are a thing and now now the base app is also doing this. Um and then yeah they like emphasis on really leaning into the creator economy. They had uh Gary Vee and Peopleleaser and one other creator that wasn't familiar who talked about how NFTs and the creator economy just helped them with their careers. So they were kind of doing like a narrative campaign for the creator economy and like branded it with the base app. Um so yeah, pretty pretty cool presentation.\n\nWell, all the posts can be minted, right? To your point about the creator. So they've also integrated Zora. What I think is interesting here is it's just feels like it's a coming together of a whole bunch of narratives from like circa 2015 2016 for Ethereum. So you got money, okay, that's obviously stable coins. That's um ether the asset. You have identity. So they've integrated ENS in this thing. So you have one single identity. You also have social. So this is the forecaster platform. That's a little web 3. And then you also have the ability to create mint post. That's that's uh the creator economy stuff. You have markets. So you got Uniswap in here. Very easy to trade things. You've got all of the dexes in here. And then you've got the communication uh protocol XMTP which is decentralized permissionless communication. And they slapped it all together in a nice polished retailfriendly uh userfriendly front end. So, this is like this almost feels like the contours of crypto\n\n\n's version of a super app of an everything app. I haven't used this yet, so I'm looking at videos at this point in time, but I could see some potential here. I could see it all coming together.\n\nYeah. Yeah, it is definitely like a dream come true from very early narratives up to like 2021, 2022 on Train Social like you said. I was listening to this presentation and I was like, I don't think this app is for me. Like I'm still yet to become a post collector or things of that nature. Uh, and this is I feel like this is kind of like a shared sentiment. Like I want Coinbase to do this and to win and to make this a reality and to take onchain social mainstream and to have like collecting content and the creator economy. I want that to work. It doesn't work for me and I don't think my last time you been on Farcaster has it been on uh well I was perusing through this um uh the this app yesterday not on my phone but on a friend's phone who had the access to it.\n\nIt's like Farcaster's kind of putting it together. Uh I go on Farcaster and I enjoy it. I also feel like it's somewhat overwhelming uh with all of kind of the mini app experience but it's evolving very fast. I I don't know. I mean I think it might be for you David. Maybe not yet, but coin the creator economy and coining content. And I don't you don't want to coin your post. Look at this post. This is a perfect kind of post to coin. This is uh Brian Armstrong and Jesse Pollock from Base doing a little fist bump handshake kind of exchange here. That was a nice moment.\n\nAnd I think they are going to coin that on on the uh the Coinbase Base app. So there you go. I'm I'm not totally I'm I'm supportive of Jesse and I want him to win. I' I have not been coining content pill.\n\nYou haven't been you coined any content yet?\n\nI have not. Uh no, I have not.\n\nWhat do we got coming up, man?\n\nComing up next, Crypto Week in DC, the Genius Bill. We're going to talk about that. We talked about it at the intro.

That's what Trump declared. This is uh Bo Hine. So, he's an executive director in the president's council, a council of adviser basically for crypto. He said huge week ahead. It's crypto week in the house. Genius heads to the president's desk. That's is a genius bill. Clarity. Another bill moves to the Senate. Time to make America the crypto capital of the world. Donald Trump echoed those sentiments. You know what? We should start with the the genius bill itself. Of course, you guys know we've talked about this for a long time. That is the landmark stable coin bill that passed in the Senate with a decent majority, even got some Democrat support, and is now in the House. Okay. by the time that um you are listening to this, I am predicting I think you are probably predicting David that that will have passed. So assuming that's true, we have the first stable coin act, the first largest uh legislative action out of Congress for crypto ever and this is a milestone moment. I do think Scott Besson is right. The passage of this bill, we're going to see trillions in stable coins on chain. Okay, Scott Bessant echoed sentiments of three trillion by 2030. So that in it of itself is significant. Um there was last minute some some jockeying around. They tried to package all of these bills together. There were actually three bills. There was the the genius bill. There was the clarity act as well that's you know defining what the difference between a commodity and a security with respect to crypto is. And then there was like an anti- central bank digital currency bill of some sort. And some people wanted to package all of these things together. And so you know it was difficult to get all of the Republicans on board last minute. So, you know, Trump tried to knock some heads together in his own party and get some of the those that were uh that were not voting yes to actually vote yes. So, that's probably happened right now, which means huge progress for crypto in the US. So, while this was going on, there was also a campaign by some Democrats. Um, this is Representative Maxine Waters. She actually announced an anti-cryptocrion week and uh she said, \"I'm sounding the alarm in MSNBC. She wrote an op-ed about this. GOP crypto bills don't just fail to protect uh consumers, they greenlight Trump's billion-dollar cryptog invite the next financial crisis. I think I'm kind of with her on the first part. There's a little bit of a grift going on. I don't know about the second part. And I want to play this clip for you, David. This is Elizabeth Warren on the Genius Act in some of these bills.\n\nGuard rails to make sure that crypto as it is to blow up our entire economy. So, I'm very worried about that. But I want to add one more twist and that is the clarity bill has all those problems but it also has a provision in it that would let any company listed on the New York Stock Exchange opt out of SEC regulation by just digitizing themselves. put themselves on the blockchain and all of a sudden it turns out that Amazon or Meta or General Motors is no longer governed by the SEC.\n\nYou can just put yourself on the blockchain and then all the rules just go away. That's how it works.\n\nYou can just digitize yourself.\n\nDo you hear what she said? That could literally blow up the value of the New York Stock Exchange. All right. You know, I that's why that's why I'm in crypto because I understand that if I'm on if I'm just on the blockchain, then no rules apply to me.\n\nThat's that's what I'm here for.\n\nHe's he's he's being sarcastic. Okay, in case this gets clipped, you just digitize yourself and you put yourself on the blockchain and then you get to be God. I just I'm just kind of annoyed at the doubling down of a clearly on a clearly losing position. Talk about the anti-corruption, that's fine. But to to talk about crypto as if it's going to blow up US capital markets, that is just crazy at this point.\n\nYeah. I before crypto before Elizabeth Warren came after crypto, my f my family was very pro lives with Warren. I'm like, \"Oh, okay, sure.\" She's like anti- big banks. I'm like kind of into that. Uh and then when she goes on crypto, I'm like, \"Oh, wait. You're just lying about stuff. You're just lying through your teeth. None of that's true.\" And now I can't trust anything that you say ever. And now whenever my family is talking about Elizabeth Warren, I'm like, \"Bro, she's a snake. How is she Why are you guys supporting her?\"\n\nYeah, it's pretty disappointing, I think, to uh to some that are watching this. Um David, tell me about the PUMP ICO because I don't think disappointing is the word we would use for that.\n\nUh actually, uh some people are disappointed about that actually. Yeah, it started paying attention.\n\nYeah, this is See, this is why I'm learning this actually. Okay, it started off pretty good. Uh, and we are now down a decent bit. So, we are coming in at a $2 billion market cap.\n\nOh, wow. Wait, really? Bull down that much?\n\nNo, no, no, no, no. Yeah, market cap $5.6 billion fully diluted. Okay, so they're doing fine.\n\nThey're doing fine.\n\nWell, why are people just I the way I saw this was basically they had an ICO on Chain. It was a successful ICO. It was filled in like I don't know 6 minutes or something like this. You tell me. 12 minutes. Okay.\n\nAnd a chain didn't go down. Some of this activity happened on exchanges. Some of this happened on Solana.\n\nThere is like some sort of a revshare component. It's not 100% but they announced they started doing their initial buybacks and then the token pumped up to its like now current all-time highs. Uh which I mean the token is actually not volatile. I remember talking about how it's going to be volatile. I was actually wrong about that. The token price has become pretty is very liquid and it's pretty stable in the grand scheme of things. Okay. So why are people mad? Who's mad?\n\nUm well because it gone it went down. It went down 10% while ETH went up 20%.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd so like it didn't track I I don't think you actually tracked beta. If you if you did the ICO, I think you're okay. But since launch, it hasn't done anything. So I think people's expectations are are dashed. Uh just to put out some stats, this makes PUMP the third largest ICO in history. Uh raised $600 million. EOS is number one. No one's ever going to beat that. Uh $4.1 billion in 2017. That was also crime. Uh, Telegram did $1.7 billion in 2019 and now uh PUMP is now number three at $600 million. Um, I mean there's a lot more stats here. Overall, I think uh it's successful and the the buyback is pretty cool and we could see more of that. Um, but I think people were were having higher expectations than what happened. Um, I do have some breaking news, Ryan, stuff that's not in the agenda. So, we're actually going to go back into Ethereum uh conversation because uh BlackRock's Eyesshares ETH treasury just filed for ETH staking uh while we're recording. So, they have filed to have ETH ETF ETH in the ETH ETF. The ETH ETH A the BlackRock EyesShares for for the ETH ETF filed for staking and BlackRock gets what it wants.\n\nThat that that's not going to help the ETH pump ratio there, David. So, uh, you know, I guess the ETH pump ratio.\n\nYes.\n\nAre you looking at the ETH pump ratio?\n\nNo, dude. You you made reference to it. I'm trying to riff off something you did. Also, Binance doing a um a uh what what is this?\n\nYeah, Binance is doing Launchpad. Okay. Actually, maybe perhaps one of the reasons why PUMP hasn't had the solid performance is this other launchpad called Bonk continues to maintain volumes against PUMP. And so it's taken a little bit of um of the wind out of the sales of PUMP. And then also Binance has unveiled its own launchpad on BNB chain 4. Meme number four.\n\nForme meme is now the pump fund of of BNB. And so that's out there. And then Ryan, I'm going to read you a headline and you're going to guess what year it's from.\n\nSnoop Dogg sells $12 million of NFTs in 30 minutes. What year is this headline from?\n\nYeah, I mean that I know it's now. That just happened this week, but if I were to hear that in isolation, that would be so, you know, 2021 coded.\n\nThat's what was happening all of the time.\n\nSo, this was on the TON blockchain, and this is part of the sticker pack. So, the stickers you can use in Telegram can be like unique fungeable assets, nonfgeible assets. Uh the tokens in the collection included vintage cars, swag bags, a digital dog, a marijuana related objects of course, and a mix of other items and symbols. Uh there so it's a Telegram gift that people can purchase and uh because it was on Ton, it's integrated into Telegram. Yeah. $12 million in 30 minutes by selling stickers, NFT stickers on Telegram.\n\nI'm not feeling bullish on the JPEGs these days, David. You know, it was you're not you're not a buyer of a of a lit blunt, Ryan. It's a hard It's been a hard four years on the lit blunts uh JPEGs. Okay, so I'm gonna wait this one out. I'm gonna let other people go first. Um David, this was actually big. Okay, this is Shane Copin. Do you remember it was what is it just like November? It was November of last year because it was just right before the election. Yeah, no, it\n\n\nIt was eight days after the election. Okay, after the election. So Shane Copan from the founder of Polymarket, the FBI just showed up at his apartment. I believe he's in New York. Busted in without due process, without a warrant, busted in, uh, arrested him and took a whole bunch of his equipment, including his phone. Yeah, including his phone. This is the founder of Polymarket. Obviously, we talk about Polymarket all the time. Incredibly successful prediction market. This is a startup founder in the US. Okay, an update on that story. This is from Shane. Eight months ago on election night, we were on top of the world after Polymarket called the election. You remember that? Eight days later, the FBI broke down my door at 6:00 a.m. and took all of my computers and phones, looking for anything that could imply foul play. While traumatic, it etched the story of Polymarket's accuracy and enduring resistance into the history of American politics. And today, here's the news part. I'm happy to announce that this, uh, this chapter of the story is over. After cooperating and engaging, we've been cleared of any wrongdoing. Justice prevailed.\n\nOkay, so the FBI was like, \"Oops, sorry. You didn't actually do anything. But what kind of evidence did they have busting into his house at 6:00 a.m. in the morning and confiscating all of his stuff? Is that not crazy to you? And let me ask you this. Do you think that the outcome of this investigation would have been different under a different, uh, president?\n\nI don't know. I don't know how to think about that. I don't want to think about that. It doesn't make me feel good to think about that. I do enjoy the juxtaposition of an application that speaks truth to power gets, uh, harassed by the FBI, and then they just have to, the FBI just has to let him go and be like, you did nothing wrong. Uh, but like this, this technology that's anti-authoritarian gets authoritarian, like the eye of Sauron gets pointed straight at Shane Copan, and then because at least we're in a good country with the good court system, Shane gets through that process and it's just completely Scott clear. Brian Armstrong says this was one of the most egregious examples of law affair from the last administration that should never have been possible in America. Imagine having your door broken down for predicting an election. The onus was on the government to prove, to prove there was something worth pursuing here, and they failed to do that. This is how you lose trust in institutions.\n\nUh, all right. So that's good news though. He was exonerated. Shane Copelan. We got another trial that started this week. Uh, this is the trial of Roman Storm, the Tornado Cash, uh, trial. And as you'll recall, Roman Storm faces charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate US sanctions, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business at a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. 45 years, David, the stakes are incredibly high. Roman Storm raised a whole bunch of funds from the crypto community. He still needs more, I believe, because this trial is going even longer than everyone suspected. Um, there is a judge in the case, uh, Katherine Pula FA. She is not exactly cryptofavorable. Okay. Not exactly, it seems like favorable to, um, to Roman Storm's case. Of course, we don't know for sure, but this has been indicated from some of the pre-trial, uh, statements and some of the things she allowed in the trial and things she didn't. So the prosecution, this is the, the government in this case is, um, alleging and and trying to prove that, um, Roman Storm turned a blind eye or he enabled some of the criminal activity that happened on Tornado Cash. Whereas the defense is of course saying no, this is a decentralized open protocol. Roman Storm had no ability, no control over how third parties would actually use it. This is similar to, you know, HTTPS, the internet, cryp cryptography, criminals, good guys can use it. It's a tool. Bad guys can use it as well. Uh, and this case is is ongoing.\n\nSo, like Brian said, this court case has just started. So, we're going to be continuing to watch this and we'll provide updates probably towards the end of every weekly roll up moving forward just to keep an eye on this. I don't feel like anyone really knows what the outcome here is, which is kind of the scary thing. The fact that this is like close at all, uh, to Roman Storm losing is automatically scary. Uh, it definitely definitely doesn't deserve to, to have anything happen to him. Uh, and so it's something that we're going to be keeping an eye on, uh, moving forward over the next four weeks, I think, is how long this case it's expected to to take. So, uh, we wish the best for Roman Storm, and we'll provide more updates as they come. Guys, we got to end with this. Of course, you know, even though it's been bullish on the week, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.\n[Music]\n",

    "cleanText": "Hey, it's Arvid, and this is The Bootstrapped Founder.\n\n[Music]\n\nToday we'll talk about keeping up with an avalanche of audio data and how I built Podscan's transcription infrastructure. This episode is sponsored by Paddle.com, my merchant of record payment provider of choice, who's been helping me focus on Podscan from day one. They're taking care of all the little things related to money so that founders like you and me can focus on building the things that only we can build, like a massive podcast transcription infrastructure. Paddle handles all the rest: sales tax, credit cards, those kind of things. Don't need to do with it because they do. I highly recommend checking it out. So, please go to paddle.com and take a look.\n\nNow, when I started building the first prototype of Podscan, I very quickly realized that this was going to be a different business than any that I've built before. The difference had everything to do with one fundamental challenge in this field. Unlike most software service businesses, the resources that I would need from the start wouldn't scale with the number of customers I had, but would scale with something completely out of my control: the number of new podcast episodes being released worldwide every single day. So no matter if I had one customer or a hundred, if they wanted to track every podcast out there for a keyword, I needed to deal with this from day one. And that's hard because if you ever investigated the idea of stoicism, you will know that there are certain things you can control that you should care about and certain things that you cannot control that you shouldn't fret about at all. That's kind of the idea. Like a very rough description of stoicism here, but you know, like it's deal with the things you could deal with and don't whine about the others. So that's exactly what I did. I focused on what I could do to make transcribing every single podcast out there a reality. And I didn't complain about the fact that there are tens of thousands, millions of shows being released all the time with tens of thousands of shows being released every day. That's kind of the framework here. I had to deal with it. I think I'm currently tracking 3.8 million shows, and roughly every day there's somewhere between 30 to 70,000 being released. Depends on the day of the week. And I want to talk about this herculean effort of building transcription infrastructure, how I got it from being extremely expensive to manageably cheap comparatively, what the trade-offs were along the way, and how much of the development of new technologies has impacted the feasibility of this entire project for me. Now, for my first prototype, I obviously didn't try to transcribe everything at once. Like, I knew that that didn't make sense to try it all, but I had found my source of podcast feed data, just a couple of good podcast feeds to try it out with through the podcast index project. It's very interesting. If you're into podcasting, check it out. It's an open-source approach to listing all the podcasts everywhere. It's free and it's openly available as an API and a database of podcasts that provides where they're hosted, the names, descriptions, and links to episodes as well. I think maybe not necessarily all of them, but some. And they even have a full SQLite export, like 4 GB of just one big file with all this data makes it very easy to jump start any system. But they even have a great API, and the podcast index API has a very beneficial endpoint for trending shows and newly released episodes. So my first prototype used that API and just grabbed the most recently or most popular released episodes and transcribed those with the existing resources that I had. And when it comes to the tech, I'm just going to share everything here because why not? I already had been experimenting with an open-source library called Whisper for a previous project called Podline, a voice messaging tool for podcast. That was the idea. I was going to take in voice messages through the browser, transcribe them on the back end, and then send a notification to my customers. And I had found that Whisper, which is supposed to be run on GPUs, could also be run on a CPU, so without a graphics card at all, through a project called Whisper.cpp, albeit quite slowly. But for Podline, where I needed to occasionally transcribe a short one-minute clip, this worked perfectly. It may have taken 5 minutes to transcribe it on one CPU core, but that's okay. There's many cores in modern CPUs. And if I have 5 minutes, sure that people will take the notification a bit after. That's all right. And since Podscan, my current business, was initially a marketing effort for Podline because I wanted to know where people already talk about having voicemail. So, I built a tool that would figure out where people talked about it. I had all the tech laying around, but obviously there's a stark difference in transcription scale here, right? Podline needed to handle occasional short clips, but Podscan needed to reliably transcribe 50,000 shows per day. And those are often shows that go for 40 to 80 minutes, right? That's not just 30 seconds. That is hours of material. And if you look at Joe Rogan who reliably puts out four-plus hour shows, that system needed to be fast and good enough to get the whole conversation and transcribe it. So the first smart choice that I needed to make was treating this as a queueing system, not as something that would happen synchronously to when stuff was released. I needed a queue of podcast episodes that would just wait to be transcribed, and whenever I had time and resources, I would transcribe the next one in descending priority. And this required a priority system to determine which episodes should be handled first. That is a whole thing that I could probably do a full episode on. I've come to a system where I have three cues right now that are high priority, middle priority, and low priority. And the high-priority shows would be the Joe Rogan's of this world that would get like a preferential treatment because I know that anything set on this show, if it triggers an alert, then that would have the biggest impact on whatever my customers might need to do with it. So, I need these episodes to be transcribed early. But then there are maybe mid-tier podcasts that can wait a half an hour or so before they get transcribed or that could even wait a couple days because they're just not that important. And that descends them in priority. There's also an immediate priority queue which skips all the other cues for like custom retranscriptions. If I ever have an episode that needs to be retranscribed or somebody really needs this episode right now, there's a bypass version, but effectively that's the priority system that I have. And for that queue, my initial setup was really just one consumer, and that was the Mac Studio that I was developing the software on. And that has right now a microphone that I'm speaking into where I'm recording this podcast. Like I was running my full queue for my production system on a local computer. So running whisper.cpp locally on a Mac. That's really cool because it will use the GPU if I can connect to it. And the MacBook's unified memory system like the MPS system is capable of running these models really, really quickly. And I was getting about 200 words per second, which is really something. And this meant I could fetch a couple hundred episodes per hour with some parallel processing on my local system. So then I realized that to deploy this as a business properly, I needed a transcription server running on a different cloud system very likely because I couldn't just keep it running locally at home. If my internet ever goes out, my company wouldn't work, right? So I started exploring companies that would offer access to computers with graphics cards where I could install whatever stack I had locally and keep it running there 24/7. So the first thing I tried was AWS with their G-type instances. The G, I guess, stands for graphics cards, I presume. I don't know. But these were quite expensive instances that didn't really have much power for the work that I was doing. The ones I could afford, I think it was around $400 a month, just weren't powerful enough, particularly compared to my local server here. I would have preferred them to be either cheaper or better. So, I quickly stepped away from AWS. And even to get them, you have to apply for quota there and they have to verify it. It's quite hard to get there. So, I looked for alternative, easier solutions. So, I looked into Lambda Labs, which was one of the first reliable options for GPU systems that I found, and I used them for quite a while. Lambda was helpful because they offered different servers with different GPUs attached. So, you could rent an H100, like one of the most powerful Nvidia GPUs at the time, for about a,000 bucks a month or a bit more, which was quite expensive obviously to rent a GPU. Or you could have an A100 or an A10, which were much cheaper and actually perfect for transcription purposes. So, I spent a couple months experimenting with my own personal money, testing whether an A10 would outperform an A100 or an H100, not in terms of raw throughput, but in terms of words per dollar. That's kind of the unit that I had. And I think I shared this on Twitter where I did some math there. I deployed my transcription systems to different hosts with different graphics cards and I ran experiments with a very number of parallel transcriptions just to see how it worked. And I found a working solution eventually. I think I settled on 12 to 16ish servers with A10 graphics cards. That was just uh the best. These became my transcription fleet for a while, but even then got quite expensive, which made me realize that I needed to do something about this price cuz that was also pre-funding for me. I didn't have any funding at that point just yet, but I was paying thousands of dollars a month personally for my personal money. So, I needed to figure something out. And the most effective thing that I did was to look for hosted servers outside of services that are focused on renting AI. That I just needed to look for other people that had GPU-based servers that were not yet in the AI hype space. And those services tended to offer sizable graphics cards like that. The ones that do AI for inference, which is great if you need impressive GPU power, but in most cases for transcription, that's actually not what you need. You need some graphics card that can do some transcription and the cheaper the better because transcription doesn't require a lot of VRAM. It just requires some time on a GPU. And I found this solution in Hetzner, the German company well known for being an affordable hosting company. They had just started offering GPU servers and they also have auction systems where you can get really great hardware quite cheaply. But they offer servers I think what is it called? GEX-44.\nThat's the one that I use. They have an RTX 4000 SFFF ADA generation GPU and I think they cost €200 a month just to rent. And these servers are spectacular. They have 64 GB of DDR4 RAM, 4 TB of disk space, like for $200ish dollars a month to rent this. That's really cool. Like you can rent, how much do I have right now? Like 10ish of them and have a significant GPU-based workload running 24/7 on many different servers for $2,000 or less. The key insight from all these experiments was that transcription has very different requirements from other AI tasks like inference. You can run transcription quite reliably by using somewhere between 4 and 20 GB of RAM. Depends on the model that you use, which is something that if you use Whisper, you can choose different models, right? There's a tiny, a small, a medium, a large model, and they all use different sizes of gigabytes of this RAM that these GPUs use. And the smaller ones obviously are faster and use less of that RAM. So, you can run a couple in parallel. And it really doesn't mean that much if it's just a couple of gigabytes, but it's definitely enough to get the highest quality transcription data, particularly if you use a model called Whisper V3 large Turbo. That's the one I currently use: fastest and best quality. And when I switched all my transcription servers from these A10s at London Labs to the Hetzner systems, I picked up steam dramatically with these. It was so much more effective. So I could get by with half the number of servers and still have a higher throughput than before. So that's where I'm now. Self-maintained servers running transcription scripts 24/7 on the Hetzner platform being highly efficient over time. And the solution that I had with Whisper CPP, that was great in the beginning, but as Podscan started gaining customers, they had more requirements than just default transcription. So I needed diarization, which is a fancy term for determining different speakers in an audio file and word-level timestamps for precise interactivity. People wanted to be able to have like exact cuts in videos or in audio, I guess, so they can extract stuff. So they needed to know exactly where the sentence starts and where it ends. So for that and knowing who's speaking, I needed something bigger. So I switched from whisper CPP to another implementation running on top of faster whisper, which is a library that uses these models more efficiently that includes both diarization capabilities and granular timing data. But this revealed a couple of surprising technical challenges. So if you're into transcription, this is going to be very, very useful so you don't have to fall into the traps yourself. Diorization is more resource intensive than transcription. Detecting speakers takes much longer than actually transcribing what they're saying. You would think it would be easier to determine somebody's speaking here, then somebody else is speaking there. But it's actually harder to figure out if it's person one, two, or three than it is to determine the actual words that this person is speaking. And from the start, I needed a careful prioritization system here because I only could diarize what I really needed. If I know that a podcast has only one speaker and has had for the last 200 episodes, well, I don't need to diarize it and I can save over 50% of the time. But if it's a popular show with different guests all the time, then I guess I need to prioritize it and it's going to take double the time. At scale. Turning off dorization for some shows where it doesn't matter or has not yet proven to matter means that I can transcribe twice as many podcasts in any given day. And that's massive. If that means that I can do all the shows in a day and still have resources left, then I can step back in time and get some of the older episodes that might be still very interesting for search purposes. So, that's the trade-off that I'm dealing with here. Finally, there's something that I learned after a couple of weeks of experimenting with this. GPU\n\n\nMemory limits affect the quality of the transcription.\nIf you do a lot of parallelized transcription, the GPU reaching its memory limit, where it gets full, that can cause transcription quality to decline.\nI initially had a thought like this: graphics cards have 20 GB of RAM.\nEach transcription process uses at most 4 gigabytes, so it can run five at a time, fill up the whole graphics card, right?\nThe whole RAM.\nThat tends to be true most of the time that it works.\nBut if one process runs a little bit longer, maybe it's a three-hour Joe Rogan podcast yet again, and then another process spawns and five or six processes are fighting for memory, or even just the five on there that should have four, one of them is like 4.2, right?\nQuality quickly degrades on all of them simultaneously because there's something in there that just breaks down and then it just hallucinates stuff.\nI have since reduced parallel processes to two or three podcasts at any given time.\nThere's a small chance the GPU isn't fully utilized when you know all of them spin up at the same time.\nBut that's okay.\nMost of the time it's in full use anyway without quality degradation, and I would rather not risk it because I want these transcripts to be reliably good.\nBiggest learning in all of this has been that bigger GPUs aren't necessarily faster or better.\nAnd not just from a words to dollar ratio, just even from a usage of the GPU.\nJust because the GPU is bigger doesn't mean it's faster at transcribing.\nSurprisingly, you would think, but it's not.\nWhen I ran transcription on my local machine and then on A10 and A100 GPUs, I got quite similar results, like always between 150-200 words per second.\nAnd those things cost 200 bucks a month max.\nBut then I rented an H100 GPU and the word count stayed almost the same, maybe going up to 225 to 250 words per second.\nBut that GPU had 5 to 10 times the monthly cost.\nAnd you couldn't really run it in parallel there either because then it would start degrading quality.\nSo for transcription specifically, it is way more effective to run on smaller and maybe slightly slower GPUs at scale.\nAnd this has turned out to be the only feasible way for me to do this.\nAnd we're just talking about like self-managed transcription here because there's an alternative that puts everything into perspective.\nIf I were to transcribe all 50,000 episodes that come in every day using OpenAI's platform, their AI platform, their whisper endpoint there, I would pay a five-figure amount every single day.\nAfter many months of optimizing and experimenting with transcription setups, I have obviously not done this.\nI have turned the whole thing into just a few thousand in expenses a month by having my own infrastructure.\nThe cost savings are significant because when you run your own infrastructure, even though you aren't able to do as many parallel things as you could by using Whisper and Open AI or other transcription systems like Deepgram, but instead of paying like a $100,000 a month, you pay four or two, right?\nIf you do it well, the daily cost that these commercial models can incur for you is easily in the thousands of dollars.\nAnd I've gotten it down to just a hundred and change on a per day basis, which is quite significant.\nThe biggest expense for Podscan at this point is not transcription capacity.\nYou would think, right, that this would be the most impactful expense.\nBut it's a database where all of this information is stored.\nAnd that's the next big challenge that I didn't ever think about in the beginning because when I initially started tracking a couple hundred podcasts, yeah, it was totally fine to have my SQL database store all of this data without doing anything specific around data storage, right?\nJust throw it in and figure it out.\nBut once I turn on the full fire hose of podcast data, all 50k a day, it became a massive challenge.\nIf every transcript is like 200 kilobytes to one megabyte in text size because that's what text is.\nIt gets massive, right?\nIt can be megabytes of data.\nAgain, Joe Rogan, thank you so much for filling my database with massive transcripts here.\nThen every day you're adding several gigabytes to a database.\nSo if you're trying to do full text search or quick lookups with some filtering, this becomes a problem.\nEven if you have index there for a full text index or just regular string index, it is so hard to get this right.\nI had to build infrastructure that prevents my database from overgrowing or slowing down to a halt.\nOlder transcripts are actually transferred to an S3-based storage and loaded by the main process when they are requested by a user on the front end or in the API.\nI don't keep all my transcripts in the database 'cause that would easily be 6 terabytes right now just in raw size, which is super expensive to maintain and super clunky for database access.\nNow all transcripts live on S3 as JSON files and can be loaded on demand for anything older than a couple months for regular transcripts and anything older than just a couple days for the word level timestamp transcripts that we also save.\nThat is probably the biggest one.\nJSON data for every second of a show, and this has been very helpful in ensuring that the database stays at least a little nimble in comparison.\nWhen it comes to search, I'm using an open search cluster also in AWS where I just pipe the full transcript in there and then have its own inverted index.\nI think that's what it's called, built to be able to search for full text there.\nSo we're not doing full text search in the database.\nWe have an additional secondary database that we feed all these transcripts into and facilitate search by just having what is kind of an elastic search fork deal with all of that.\nIt would never, never, ever work in this MySQL database and probably also not in Postgres if I were to have a full text search there just because data is so massive.\nI was using mighty search for a while and that also works like all these search engines that can deal with large text, they are good at it, but transcript data is so big that even those databases struggle a little bit.\nSo you have to build something that works right, you have to save them in a way that they can be looked up reliably, and you have to save them in a way that they can be searched reliably too.\nNow there are other challenges, not just storage.\nThere's also a quality problem.\nYet again, podcasting is full of quality problems.\nThere's no normal standard for quality in podcasts.\nAnd I mean the audio data for that matter.\nSome people record into what feels like a potato and others have extremely high-end setups like this fine podcast.\nAnd you never know reliably which one you will encounter if you listen to one or if you try to transcribe it.\nSo transcription systems expect at least a certain kind of quality and they struggle with low-quality audio or non-speech content like music that people throw into this as well.\nSo I had to implement a transcription quality checking system that tries to determine if a transcript is acceptable or if you need to retranscribe it with different settings.\nWhisper is pretty good by default, but there are edge cases where you need multiple attempts to get it right and that all costs money.\nBiggest problem, and that's probably also why Podscan is actually so impactful for the people using it, is that transcription systems like Whisper, but also others, struggle with names and brands.\nAnything that a human could easily get right from context, they don't get right because they don't have context.\nThey just have a voice pattern, an audio waveform, and they don't get it right most of the time.\nAnd what works really well here, but is extremely expensive, is taking the full transcript from Whisper with all the little mistakes in there and having an AI do a pass over it with context from the podcast name, the description, and maybe prior episodes data.\nAnd you get extremely high-quality transcripts that way, but at scale.\nThis costs several dollars per episode.\nBecause imagine what this would mean to use an AI system.\nLet's say you have 500 kilobytes of text, that is, I don't know, 2 hours of a podcast, and you pipe that into even a cheap LLM that is hosted on, I don't know, on Anthropic or in OpenAI's platforms.\nSo you have like half a million input tokens and then it does some stuff and then it has half a million output tokens, and that's the expensive part.\nOutput tokens are probably the most expensive stuff for LM right now to create, and that does not work at scale because that again would cost me $50,000 a day.\nWhere am I going to take that money?\nNot happening.\nThat might be very limited to a very limited number of shows, but even then it gets super expensive.\nSo that's an unsolved challenge.\nCurrently, Whisper can take 120 or so tokens of context, just like things like the title of the show, maybe the episode title, and a couple of names of people that will be mentioned.\nSo, that's what I throw in.\nI just give it what I know is true about the episode.\nAnd back in the day, I experimented with giving it all the brands names from all the possible.\nBut Whisper actually started finding these words in places where they weren't actually there.\nIt was gaslighting me into believing that it found certain words where they didn't exist.\nSo I quickly stopped piping all of these brand names in there.\nSince then, I only provide context that I can reliably infer that will be in that particular episode.\nAnd the big benefit of the system that I've built so far, like the whole installable on some VPC somewhere system, is that it's pretty easy to set up.\nIt's a Laravel application that I can deploy through Laravel Forge onto any new server.\nI have an install script that fetches a couple Python libraries, and I can spin up a new server quite easily that then automatically attaches to my API and starts fetching and transcribing new episodes.\nIt's really nice, quite scalable.\nIt's not on a Docker container level scalable, but I'll get to that in the future, too.\nAnd as Podscan's infrastructure grows, we can quickly add more systems so new episodes are transcribed faster with even more quality because, you know, they can be run in less parallel with less little outlier errors faster.\nAnd as models evolve, they might even become better at transcribing.\nEventually, I think I can increase the number to get diarized and get more good data that can then be fed into AI systems for what my customers want.\nWhen I first set up the fleet of servers to transcribe all my podcasts that I wanted to transcribe, all podcasts everywhere, it probably would have cost me $30,000 a month, even on my own hardware.\nBut I'm now at a point where through proper optimization and balancing my customer needs with the expense requirements, I can reliably capture the majority of podcasts at good quality for just a couple thousand a month in expenses.\nAnd I think that's really cool.\nThe fact that that is even possible for a solopreneur to build.\nI don't think that would have been a thing a couple years ago, but the tools are all out there.\nIt just takes a year and a half of 24/7 work.\nSo, yeah, it takes a while, but it still is possible.\nThe key insight for all of this is that when you're building a business that scales with these factors outside of your control, like the global output of an entire medium, you just need to think differently about infrastructure optimization and trade-offs.\nSometimes the most expensive solution will not be the best one, like OpenAI's hosted whisper just doesn't work.\nAnd sometimes the constraints that you think are impossible to work with actually force you into more creative and ultimately better solutions.\nThe kind of challenge that makes building businesses both terrifying and accelerating.\nThat's exactly this.\nYou can't control how many podcasts get published worldwide every day, but you can control how cleverly and effectively you solve the problems that stem from this.\nAnd that's it for today.\nThank you so much for listening to The Bootstrapped Founder.\nYou can find me on Twitter at Arvid.\nIf you want to support me in this show, please share podscan.fm with your peers and those who you think will benefit from tracking brands, competitors, their products, all kinds of things and names on podcasts out there.\nPodscan is this near real-time podcast database with a really solid integration system.\nWe allow a lot of people to build solutions to get leads, to get information on their clients and all of that.\nSo, please share the word with those who need to stay on top of the podcast ecosystem.\nThank you so much for listening.\nHave a wonderful day and bye-bye.\n[Music]\n",

And we are here to enchant you in this very special episode of Stuff You Should Know, which we like to also call the facts of life, too.\n\nYeah. I mean, alchemy, I think a very appropriate topic. Taking something mundane and turning it into something fantastic.\n\nOh, yeah. I guess we are kind of alchemists in that sense. Or were you talking about a different podcast?\n\nNo, no, no. I was talking about what I what I aim to accomplish today.\n\nHey, man. Not only do you aim it you or aim for it, you hit it right on the head.\n\nYeah. Uh, alchemy, baby. Let's do it. Clumsy attempt at a compliment. Yeah.\n\nWell, yeah. When we're talking about alchemy or alchemists, for me at least, and I would assume most people, kind of conjures images of like some some magician wearing like a a robe with stars and moons on it, maybe even a pointy hat to match.\n\nSure.\n\nHe's lit by candle light. He's in a strange little laboratory. He's doing all sorts of weird stuff to basically create some sort of magical potion or do something like that, right? If you know a little more about it, maybe you think of um charlatans who trick people into investing in their alchemical schemes of turning, you know, lead into gold. But um it turns out that there's a lot more to it than I ever realized. And the people involved were not they were a lot more interesting and a lot less dumb and fraudulent than than history has kind of cast them as.\n\nYeah. I I always thought of alchemy as um just from what I knew as a youngster which was just turning something like a a boring metal into gold like you were talking about.\n\nBut it is I think interesting that uh modern science now looks back and said and says hey you know what I mean sure it was a lot of bunk and BS involved uh but some of the foundations of modern chemistry were there even though that wasn't their intention really.\n\nYeah. And you can also make a pretty strong case that the alchemists were the ones who laid the groundwork for the scientific method.\n\nYeah, in some ways. Sure. What's cool about it too is that, you know, the Europeans, the medieval European, you know, monks and sages and scholars are the ones you typically think of, at least in the West, when you think of alchemy. But it's a I don't want to say worldwide, but it it really kind of ties together traditions from a bunch of different parts of the world into a mad pursuit for immortality and glory.\n\nYeah, totes. So we should say that um you can kind of trace the western tradition of alchemy, the Europeans as as you think of it um all the way back to Egypt. Egypt was like the starting point for the western tradition but Egypt even um seemed to get it from other places specifically even even back before Egypt. It seems like China and India uh were possibly in on the pursuit for immortality which seems to be the thing that initially gave alchemy like its birth.\n\nYeah. And they may have called it like you know the art or something like that or may maybe you know some other word that they had that meant you know some sort of transformation might be taking place.\n\nUm the word alchemy itself was first used in Arabic uh and then eventually French and English in medieval times. Uh but yeah, I think it's interesting that it followed that route. And it's also not surprising that, you know, China was one of the first to get involved in something like this because I feel like anytime we're talking about ancient um practices, China always seems to be sort of leading the way in one way or the other.\n\nIndeed. Um, one of the reasons China was so heavy into it was because the the early alchemical um like pursuits or purposes were to create an elixir for immortality. The reason they cared so much about that was because um the country had a huge dowist population and daoism is very much interested in achieving immortality one way or another. And so China and its uh alchemists put together mercury, arsenic, sulfur and said, \"Here, drink this.\" Uh, a lot of times and surely a lot of people died from drinking those things, right? I mean, you can't drink a a concoction of mercury and still, you know, just wipe your mouth with the back of your hand and walk off like time to get to work, you know?\n\nYeah. I'm sure I'm sure there were some people that suffered under uh alchemy experiments over time.\n\nUh but they also you know on the other side and this is sort of the um the plus side and minus side of some of these experiments. They also whether or not purposefully or not gave us things we still use today um like you know potassium nitrate. So they sort of accidentally discovered gunpowder and ammonium chloride which is used today as nitrogen in fertilizer like for farms and stuff like that. Mhm. So yeah, there were that is kind of a tradition in alchemy of you know they were trying to do something else but they still found useful stuff that we still you know make or use today. And China's whole jam with alchemy kind of started to dry up as Buddhism spread uh throughout the country because Buddhism is much more focused on rebirth and mellowing out about the whole immortality thing. And so the pursuit of, you know, immortality through special elixir just kind of became a moot point or a moo point. Sorry.\n\nUh yeah. I mean, I guess the Buddhists were like, \"Yeah, maybe it's really not possible to live forever. Maybe we should set our goals a little more reasonably.\"\n\nRight. Let's just pretend like we don't care about living forever. uh as far as India goes uh they were also not seeking immortality and they were also kind of like post uh Buddhist China like let's try and promote health let's try and cure some disease um maybe we can try and transfer something into gold uh but you know you'll see that kind of popping up that's why I think a lot of people the first thing they think of is turning something into gold because that was the pursuit of a lot of alchemists because gold was so revered uh either as like you know the the the best metal. Uh, go ahead and make your white snake joke.\n\nI wasn't going to. I was just thinking of of gold wearing a t-shirt that says the best metal.\n\nYeah. With like the devil's hands. The devil devil horns fingers.\n\nSure.\n\nUh, and and you know, also thinking like, you know, perhaps like drinking something that uh maybe liquid gold, but it's really not liquid gold. It just turned the color gold could make you healthier or maybe live forever. Yeah.\n\nAnd in India they were trying to make gold not to get rich but because like you were saying they were trying to um balance health, restore health like it was just associated with healthy living essentially. Gold was\n\nYeah.\n\nSo then um we reached the Mediterranean that was another ancient place and by the time Alexander the Great invaded Egypt in 322 B.C.E. um they found pretty quickly that the Egyptians had already been developing their own tradition of alchemy for a while. And the Greeks said, \"Hey, I like your style. Let's mix together our philosophy and our understanding of physics and astrology with your alchemy and let's produce something really great that medieval monks are really going to go nuts for.\"\n\nYeah. And I think this is like I know we're going to say this quite a bit, but I think they were these early scientists were taking a stab at at some at something, you know, like sure there were charlatans and stuff like that, but this was so early on in the game like science was brand new and they were like, \"Hey, let's try this thing and see if it works out.\" Uh, and maybe didn't always follow modern best practices, but you can't expect them to either. So, like, I don't know. I feel like over time on this ep on this uh podcast period, we've kind of tried to shine a little bit of light on some of this stuff is like, hey, they're they were doing their best back then, trying to get trying to get involved in science at least. Uh\n\nright, at least they were doing something, you lazy s.\n\nYeah, exactly. Um I mean, this is when the first books on it came out. There was one called uh the translation is natural and mystical things by an Egyptian named Bolos of Mende. This is around 200 B.C.E. Uh a lot of this was again about making you know um valuable metals like gold and silver but again it was uh it was the first kind of preserved writing that we have on this.\n\nYeah. Right. No for sure. And uh he was also somebody who wrote pretty straightforward about alchemy and the recipes and the processes which um would come to be very rare as alchemy developed. It became much more secretive.\n\nYeah. But this um Greco Egyptian creation, this melding of uh different traditions to create this this specific kind of alchemy, it's called henistic alchemy that laid the foundation for western alchemy to come. Um one of the other big things that came out of it or another indicator of how important it was is there was this kind of legendary figure that developed among the medieval um alchemists, the monks. Um, his name was Hermes Tris Magestos, which is a great name. Not a good hotel check-in name, but it's a it's a great name regardless.\n\nCould you spell it again, sir?\n\nLike, how many times are you going to hear that?\n\nRight. And you would say it just like that, too. Like real uncertain and unsteady like Hermes, I think. Um, so it was a combination, a straightup combination of th or toth, I think th the Egyptian god who invented writing, the one with the ibis bird head.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd Hermes, the Greek messenger of the gods. Like this was a complete synret syncization of those two. And later medieval monks would ascribe like alchemical text having been written by Hermes T.\n\nYeah, Hermes T. That's a that's a better check-in name by far. Really?\n\nIs that tea, sir? or te e\n\nI think it means like Hermes third the best I I think is what tis meisto translates to\n\nall right that's pretty good\n\nand this is this is one of those episodes too Chuck where when we say words we might accidentally cause somebody to go poof and something either appears or disappears so everybody be prepared for something to vanish\n\nyeah I agree uh and no one knew it that you know like when you look back on stuff like this it's kind of hard to parse out like who was who was first who is influencing who it's just sort of spread around the world. There there's is a theory that um India's belief system was basically just sort of um brought over as a maybe not as a book but you know brought over wholesale from protoarans in central Asia and they were in the area between four and 5,000 years ago. So it's you know I don't I don't know if there's a lot to be gained from sort of debating who was coming up with what first you know\n\nright? Yeah. Uh yeah, I mean it does really matter. It's it's those historians, they're kind of fixated on that kind of thing.\n\nUm but you know, it is interesting to wonder like where culture came from because so much of it influences so much else, not just in alchemy but in in all things basically. But um you mentioned Bolos of Mende and he actually came after the guy who uh the western tradition of alchemy is kind of like based on like this guy was the guy. He's like, \"Here's how it's done. This is the ground rules for alchemy, okay, everybody?\" His name was Zoamos of Panopoulos.\n\nUm, and Zoamos of Penopoulos wrote something like 28 books on alchemy. And for a while, they were like, \"We've only got a couple of letters of this guy, but we knew he was brilliant.\" Um, apparently they've been finding his stuff all over the Arabic world um in libraries uh that they didn't realize they had it before, but a lot of his writings have recently been rediscovered. Yeah. And his stuff, he's another one of those that was pretty detailed in his writing. And to have like stuff like this preserved is is pretty amazing.\n\nUh he was because he was an alchemist, obviously transforming metals or or you know, trying to transform metals. Uh but he like I said, he was pretty specific. He would have uh writeups on like exactly what tools he was using, on what methods he was using. Uh, a lot of this stuff was obviously uh repurposed from the kitchen like kind of cooking stuff or maybe craft work, not the van, uh, but you know, crafting and, uh, like like a bedazzler.\n\nYeah, like a bedazzler or perfume making. And he credited a lot of this stuff with a a Jewish woman named uh, Maria. And he was like, you know, a lot I've taken a lot of her methods and a lot of her methods also transferred over to early methods of uh of cooking, like you know, French and Italian cooking methods.\n\nYeah. Like a water bath. A balmarie or a bano Maria is, you know, like you know when you melt chocolate chips in a pan that's inside a pan that has water in it.\n\nYeah. So you don't scorch it, right?\n\nExactly. You can thank the Jewish woman named Maria who has lost a history aside from Zoamos of Penopoulos's writings, but she apparently taught him.\n\nYeah. And he he said, \"Hey, you can use a lot of this stuff to to not make gold from lead.\"\n\nYeah. I mean, he he definitely came up with some processes that he figured out himself. And like you said, these people were taking a stab at it. They were like, \"What happens if I do this and what what happens if I if I try that same thing with a different metal or a different powder or something like that?\" So they were experimenting. They were starting the beginnings of experimentation that would lead to what we understand it as a science. Zozimos was doing this. Like he was one of the first to to do this. Um I also saw a definition. I'm not sure if I sent it to you or not, but he had an explanation or a definition of what alchemy is. He said it was the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying and disemboding, drawing the spirit from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies. And what he was saying, like if you stop and think about it, it's actually pretty comprehensible. Yeah. He he's saying alchemy is the study of, you know, all the things we've observed about the world around us trying to figure out how that stuff works. Like how does a soul come into a body and become attached to it\n\n\nHow does it leave after death? What's the deal with water? Uh, that kind of stuff. So, like, it was just them seeking to apply essentially a protoscientific understanding of the world as they understood it.\n\nYeah. Like, what happens if I distill this thing down to its base form or uh, create, you know, you're going to hear a lot of talk about vapors. Um, like, you know, boil something or heat something to create a vapor and then smash it together with this thing. And now I've just learned, you know, I'm trying to make gold maybe, but I've all of a sudden discovered that uh, it changes properties of both materials if I combine these two things. And while they may not have understood what the heck that meant, chemistry later on would say, \"Oh, actually what they were doing was this.\"\n\nRight. Exactly. Yeah. So, um, this whole, this whole jam that was laid down by Zamos and Bolos and the the early Egyptians who eventually kind of combined their stuff with the Greek understanding of the world, which is really important because Aristotle's thoughts about, you know, what made matter up, like earth, wind, fire, and air, the four elements, that was the understanding of the world that they were working from. They were trying to figure things out within that context. So, Aristotle had a huge contribution to alchemy early on, which as science would later kind of um, decide was just a huge wrong turn at the outset, especially considering that Democratus, who was around the same time as Aristotle. Remember him? He was the one who's like, everything's made up of atoms. I just am not going to use the word atoms yet.\n\nRight. Exactly. Uh, good place for a break. Yeah, I think so. All right, we'll take a break and we'll uh, talk a little bit about the move into Europe right after this.\n\n[Music]\n\nOkay, Chuck. So, things were just kind of hanging around from, you know, 300s BCE, um, where the Egyptians and the Greeks had kind of come together and created that version of alchemy. Um, and eventually the Arab world started to rise, and it started to go over here and go over there, and wherever it went, it kind of took this and that from each culture that it found interesting. And one of the things that they did, they showed up in Egypt and um, they said, \"Hey, I like this alchemy stuff you guys have been doing for the last few hundred years. Teach that to us.\" And that actually helped lay the the groundwork for the incredible amount of learning that took place around this time in the Arab world.\n\nYeah. And you know, logging stuff, describing stuff, uh, that would later on, again, you know, lay the foundation for for legit chemists of the future. Uh, and one of their theories was that production of uh, different kinds of matter starts out basically, you know, with the basics, which are heat, coldness, dryness, moisture, and combining these in different ways are going to have different outcomes, uh, like to produce those vapors. You're going to have uh, cold water basically and combine that with some sort of uh, hot moist air to create a vapor. And they would, you know, mix these things together, and they would combine it with uh, mercury or sulfur or something like that and trying to make gold once again, right? I think it's called chrysio pouya.\n\nYeah, that's the the technical term, I think, for for trying to make gold.\n\nYeah, exactly. Um, and there are a couple of big, big names. There are a few big names, but two that still made it all the way through history: Razis, who's known as the greatest physician of the Muslim world at the time. He was an alchemist. Uh, a contemporary, I believe, of his named Jabir. Uh, he was well known as a a early scientist. Some people call him the father of chemistry. Um, and these guys were, they were contributing by saying, like, hey, don't just throw a handful of powder at something, like, you know, do a thumbnail and and use the same amount every time. Just, just little contributions like that. Um, what was a huge contribution, too, was that they took a lot of these ancient texts, translated them into Arabic, and then those were eventually translated into Latin, which is when things started to spread like wildfire throughout Europe in like the 12th century.\n\nYeah, I promised talk of Europe, and I just forgot we had to stop by Arabia first. Mhm.\n\nBut this is beginning in about the 12th century when it moved into Europe. And this was a time when uh, Europe was shifting, you know, to a university sort of a more academic uh, way of looking at things and away from the monasteries, who were, I guess, some of the more early, you know, science-minded people.\n\nYeah, and Christian scholars at the time in Europe, um, they started to become a little more open to say, like, hey, maybe we should, you know, uh, look to other texts, ancient texts, even look, look from other cultures to try and see if we can learn something from them, and so they started experimenting with uh, mineral acids, uh, boric acids, sulfuric acid, stuff like that, uh, and trying to develop um, elixirs, and this is where you'll hear more about things like, you know, um, immortality, like the elixir of life, philosopher stone, which we'll get into, and stuff like that.\n\nYeah. And we should say, now that I think of it, I'll bet a lot of this transfer of knowledge came from the Crusades. Europe just showed up and was like, \"Give us everything,\" including all of your books on alchemy. You know, that would be my guess. But yeah, around this time, so I, I read that the European alchemists, following this tradition, believed that in the ancient world, they had already um, found what was called the philosopher's stone, which just sounds so cool. It'd make a really cool, like, title for a Harry Potter book or a Willie the Wizard book or something, you know? Are you making philosopher's stone?\n\nUm, no, I think it's just kind of like, it, it's just na, it fits naturally, you know.\n\nWell, that was the original title of the Harry Potter book. Uh, sorcerer stone.\n\nOkay. I, That's why I asked if you were joking.\n\nNot the sorcerer stone. It's the philosopher's stone, wasn't it?\n\nNo, they changed it to the sorcerer stone from the philosopher's stone.\n\nWhat a ripoff.\n\nOkay. Well, we're talking about the philosopher's stone, and that was a term for this substance that supposedly was all over the place, but we just didn't recognize the the magical properties of it that you could turn immediately anything into, like, gold or whatever the perfect version of that thing was.\n\nBecause that was the thing. Gold to the alchemists was the perfect version of a metal. And all other metals, whether it's lead, tin, silver, whatever, are we, we're seeing them in the process of moving naturally into gold. That's how they understood it. What they were trying to do is figure out how those processes worked so they could speed it up, right? And do it, do it by, like, that's where they got the idea of taking lead and turning it into gold. That's what they were trying to do was move lead into its more perfect natural state, which was gold. And the way that they thought you could do that was with the philosopher's stone, which would make that happen automatically.\n\nYeah. And you mentioned earlier that um, that they would operate a little more in secrecy later on, and this is kind of where we are now, uh, now is they would operate, maybe they would have their apprentices and stuff like that, but it was kind of shrouded in secrecy a lot of times. Uh, they would use, like, codes and symbols and metaphor and stuff when they were uh, like, recording their experiments. Uh, and there were a handful of u, European alchemists that, you know, we should probably go over a little bit. Uh, the first of which is Albertus Magnus or Albert the Great. He was a German philosopher in the 13th century, and he was a friar, a Dominican friar, and he studied the the work of these Arab alchemists because, like we said, it kind of came over from there and the ancient Greek philosophers, which, you know, as we mentioned, kind of melded those two worlds of philosophy and science or this kind of science.\n\nRight. Right. So, um, there was another guy, I mean, there's a bunch that we could talk about: John D, Arthur D, Roger Bacon. They were all alchemists who contributed to our understanding of the world. Um, one I hadn't heard of was Jealad Tad.\n\nJealad, I think I got it that second time.\n\nIt sounds good to me, but German is my non-spe.\n\nHe was um, he was uh, he was trying to figure out chrysopou chrisopooya, um, which is again, transforming things into gold. The thing is, and this is a really good example or way to point this out, he was a Franciscan monk. He didn't care anything about getting rich. As a matter of fact, he had taken a vow of poverty. Um, so, so many times the alchemists are like, all they wanted to do is, like, just make gold and be rich. They were just greedy magicians essentially.\n\nNo, that's not the case. They wanted to create gold to end poverty. They wanted to find the elixir of life to end disease. Like, they had really big, big goals that they were trying to reach, and he was a good example of that. He wanted to give the Catholic Church the ability to make gold so that they could fund themselves better, essentially.\n\nYeah. I took a vow of poverty in my 20s. I think you did, too.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah. It was forced on me.\n\nUh, so one of the things that he did, too, which is pretty interesting, I think, is he God talked about sort of distilling things down to their purest form. Mhm.\n\nHe did that with booze, and he distilled it down to aqua, uh, how would you pronounce that? Vita\n\naqua vite.\n\nAqua vite. Um, he called it the fifth essence of wine or the uh, quinta essentia. And this goes back to Aristotle again. This idea that um, you know, it's something different than those four classical elements that we're talking about. And I, I forgot how he pronounced his name, but let's just call him Dr. R. uh, said that, hey, when I create this distilled wine down to its purest form of alcohol and I put meat in that stuff, the meat just kind of stays like it is. It stops this decay. And it, he wasn't, he didn't think he had tapped into a new way to preserve meat. He thought, like, hey, maybe this stops things from aging, and maybe this alcohol is a cure-all, right? He went on to create the Mai.\n\nOh, nice.\n\nAnother one. This guy's my favorite, Pariselus. Uh, his real name was Philipus Theoprastus Orololis Bombastus Von Ho Hohheim, but we'll call him Phil Hohenheim.\n\nHoenheim.\n\nYeah. Well, he went by Paracelis. I think we talked about him in our poison episode or there was some episode because he was famous for saying uh, the dose makes the poison, like, you can take enough of anything and it's going to kill you, which is a really important understanding at the time. But he was one of the ones who led the way of secrecy because he believed that what the alchemists were doing was dealing in, like, the nature of the universe and that this information was way too potent to just have out there. So, he was one of the ones that led the charge in that. He also was known as um, questioning Galen's thousand-year-old idea of the four humors being the cause of disease.\n\nParacelis was like, \"No, I think that there's, like, external factors involved, like, maybe even little tiny bugs or something like that that get in your throat and then into your stomach and then just really screwed things up down there.\" Yeah.\n\nUm, that's me paraphrasing him. That was Paracelis. So, he was a a straightup genius for his time. I'm a big fan.\n\nYeah. I'm sure they came right back at him and said, \"No, no, silly man. It's just black bile. That's the problem.\"\n\nHe's like, \"You sure? Like, this other stuff could be making us sick.\" He's like, again with the bile.\n\nUh, there was also Nicholas Flamel, I guess, or Flaml, I'm not sure how you would pronounce that, but\n\nI think I think Fl Okay. Um, he is the one who is credited to have discovered the philosopher's stone. Uh, he was just a mere book seller in the 14th and I guess uh, 15th centuries, and he said, I got a book, I got, I purchased a book, and it was in a language that was so hard to translate. It took me 21 years, but once I finally cracked that code, in that book was the information on how to produce the philosopher's stone. And this is what I don't understand. He got rich, but did he get rich off of selling this? Like, that's what I couldn't figure out.\n\nNo, the the later alchemists, like, starting around the 17th century, they created a legend about him saying that he had created the philosopher's stone. So, now he could turn anything into gold, and that's how he got rich.\n\nYeah. But how did he, where, how did he get rich? I still don't get\n\nfrom\n\nbecause he wasn't turning stuff into gold.\n\nNo. From what I saw, his wife was rich.\n\nOh,\n\nthat's the likeliest explanation. But this legend grew up around him because he really was well known. He's recorded historically as being very rich. Kind of suddenly, uh, they, they endowed, like, a ton of hospitals, a bunch of um, schools, churches, um, that are some of them are still around today. And he was known for putting alche, alchemical messages um, kind of encoded in the buildings, like, on plaques or in archways or something like that. Yeah.\n\nSo, he definitely was an alchemist. He definitely was rich, but it was this legend that grew up around him that he was one of the few who actually found the the philosopher's stone. I almost said sorcerer stone, man.\n\nSee,\n\ngets in there.\n\nUh, another legend is that he perhaps maybe lived to be 114, but um, records say he was between 80 and 114. So, that's a pretty big uh, gap there. A wide range.\n\nYeah.\n\n34 years.\n\nIt is pretty, pretty wide. But even 80 back in the 1400s, early 1400s is pretty respectable, I guess.\n\nNo, agreed.\n\nSo, we talked a little bit about the philosopher's stone. That was one thing that, as far as we know, no one ever created, right? But all of the alchemists in Europe were after this, trying to figure this out. While at the same time also performing all these other experiments just in case they didn't figure out how to do the philosopher's stone, they were figuring out how to do it the hard way, too. Um, there was also another thing that they were famous for trying to create, which are called homunculi, which are essentially artificial people in miniature, uh, that they\n\n\nI wanted to create so that they could study how life begins or um or like Zazamos had said, you know, how the how the the spirit bonds to the body. Like that's the kind of thing they were trying to figure out by creating many humans, and they had all sorts of, I think it's fair to call it, wacky ideas of how to create a homunculus.\nI think it's pretty fun. I mean, the word homunculus is fun in and of itself, but uh yeah, there's something called the book of the cow. Uh, this is an Arabic book in the 9th century uh that apparently Plato had something to do with. And there was a recipe for a homunculus in there, which is one hunculi.\nAnd it involved in siminating a a U, which is I guess that's a female sheep, right?\nMhm.\nWith human sperm. Don't ask how. I'm not really sure how that happened, but I'm sure they had not too many ways to do that back then. I'm sure they had their methods, and you would have a birth, and it would be some sort of shapeless form at that point. And then you need to treat it with specific stuff, uh, materials, put it in a glass container, and then it grows into a tiny person.\nYeah. I don't think that this ever worked, but they some I I guarantee some people tried it for sure.\nOh, I bet. I mean, you have to have some excuse for when you're found with the sheep, right? Oh yeah. Oh my god. Oh.\nUh, that's going to stay with me like sorcerer stone. Chuck, every time I see the word you, ew we, it reminds me there was this Happy Days episode where Richie was writing in chalk on the sidewalk a message to some girl that he liked.\nWell, in a place where he knew that she was going to walk home from high school, right?\nI remember this. And he he drew I and then the heart and then the U like a sheep, and the girl comes up on him while he's s sitting there finishing it, and she's like, \"I love sheep,\" and he's like, \"It's a you, I love you,\" but the way that she said, \"I love sheep,\" just always it stuck with me like the weird thing you said about um inciminating sheep and sorcerer stone will always stuck with me, and and it probably taught you the lesson like never put yourself out there with a\nThat's right. Yeah, that was definitely the line you got from Richie Cunningham. For sure.\nI to I I had forgotten completely about that, and as you started to tell that story, I completely remembered it. Just like flooded back to me. That's funny.\nThere there's one other one, too. This was a Brady Bunch one that I always think of whenever I think of Ihe Heart Sheep when I see the word you. So, we're like three or four inceptions from this original thing.\nUm, there was a a Brady Bunch where Greg and his friend stole a rival school's mascot, which was a goat.\nOkay, I remember that.\nIt just so happened that like a bunch of officials from the school were came over for coffee to the Brady house while the goat was there. And they had to move it from room to room and hide it. And Greg finally gets discovered with the goat in a closet holding it in this really awkward position. And the face he makes when they open the the closet door. It's I I can't imagine how many takes they did to get it just that perfect. But it's a it's one of the great alltime shots of 70s television if you ask me.\nDid the goat Was he wearing like a like a cape or something?\nYeah.\nYeah. Yeah, I remember that.\nYeah. I'm going to send you that clip because it's worth watching.\nAll right. So, I guess we need to take our second break.\nYes.\nAnd then we'll come back with more talk of 70s television right after this.\n[Music]\nAll right. So um we have talked um sort of hinted at the fact that alchemy is not looked back as it was for many years, and there's a more modern sort of view of it as like that, hey, they were doing the best they can, at least that's what Chuck said, and some of the foundations they laid for modern chemistry are actually kind of valuable.\nUh and that's kind of where we're at now. Um, a lot of like metallergical processes were created that were legitimate. Um, maybe accidentally creating medicines or things that led to medicines happened, which is also valuable.\nMhm.\nWhat else?\nOh, uh, well, I mean, just the very fact that these guys were carrying out experiments like before then philosophers just said like Aristotle, like this is what everything's made of. Earth, wind, fire, water.\nTrust me.\nNo one asked him exactly. No one asked him how do you know that or anything like that, and he really, you know, I'm not saying he was a fraud or anything, but he didn't use any scientific experimentation. It was the Alchemists who started that. They they were the ones who started working in the lab with specific measures of materials and then very importantly recording their results. Um, so they were documenting what they were finding. These are all just the the basic outlines of the scientific method today.\nYeah. And I mean, the word chemistry actually comes from alchemy uh in about the 1780s, which is pretty interesting.\nAnd alchemy is also like the other definitions of alchemy, um, doesn't it also mean like some sort of romantic chemistry that can happen?\nYeah. You know, like romantic chemistry, right? So, a romcom, what they have in there, romantic chemistry, that understanding and use of the term chemistry actually predates the use of the word chemistry as far as the scientific discipline goes by almost 200 years.\nYeah, it's a good point. And there were also some pretty major players that we, you know, revere as our scientific forebears that were involved in stuff like this who maybe tried to keep a little quiet like Isaac Newton. And this is like well into the 18th century when Isaac Newton was doing his thing, and he was like, \"Yeah, maybe we could make gold from other materials, and maybe I'm not going to, you know, I'm also into some occult and spiritual con concepts, but I'm going to kind of play that down and keep that all under the table for now, and it will only be discovered later.\"\nYeah. Underneath his ruffled puffy pirate shirt, he had the best metal t-shirt on. Well, and people that were in charge of sort of keeping up with his story and his records, they kind of buried that stuff over the years to protect his image, didn't they?\nYeah. Newton was such a genius that he was pursuing two lines of inquiry into the nature of the universe. One like the the physics genius, the mathematician that we know and love is like the world's first true scientist.\nAt the same time, he was pursuing alchemy as well. Like he was looking into the whole thing like hedging his bets.\nYeah. Essentially he was trying to figure it out. He he apparently believed or his paper said that he thought alchemy was this ancient wisdom that God had directly given humans and that alchemists were figuring out, were learning, like that this was like divine a divine delivery of like knowledge essentially, and like like you said, his papers were kept private just to preserve his image for centuries, and then finally they started to get published, and people started to understand him a little more, and I saw a really interesting quote at some point that one of his biographers said that Isaac Newton was not the first scientist. He was the last alchemist.\nWhoa.\nYeah. And I mean, it doesn't necessarily make sense to you if you when you first hear, but it's very much like how um say a bird evolved out of a dinosaur bird. The dinosaur bird was not a true bird. The first bird was the first true bird.\nYeah. And in that same way, the point they were making was Newton was the thing that the first real scientists evolved out of, but he was not that. He was part alchemist, too.\nYeah, it's a good point. Uh there were, you know, even some more modern world leaders that were like, you know, these guys were trying to make gold, and I know it didn't work out, but like maybe we could try because it'd be great if we had a lot of gold. um Maxmillian II and Rudolph II. And this was 16th and 17th century uh Holy Roman Empire stuff where they were like, \"Hey, why don't we just sort of uh help financially support these alchemists because you never know, maybe they can maybe they can tap into this elixir of life or get us untold amounts of gold.\"\nYeah. I also saw Henry V 6 um not only uh gave some like I think 15 or 16 alchemists official royal licenses to produce alchemical gold. He took what they used and minted it into coins. So supposedly there are coins.\nNo, it was a combination of mercury and copper sulfate with a little bit of water, and it produces some alloy once you clean it up that looks a lot like gold, but it's much lighter. He he like there's coins out there still today to collect that were basically alchemy gold that that Henry the 6 um commission and that Britain's gold coins were made out of for a little while\nwhich ironically are probably worth a lot of money\nI would guess so, and that is ironic, isn't it?\nyeah a little bit, don't you think?\nyeah I would even say more than a little bit, I'd say a lot of bit\nokay uh the Academy Royale de Sciences in France is founded in 1666. And that's when they said, \"All right, um, this philosopher stone stuff is not going to be in our curriculum anymore. We're not going to look at astrology. We're going to move into the modern era, uh, of the 17th century version of the modern era.\"\nAnd that's what they did. They kind of shut all that stuff down um, as like the official scientific as far as official scientific pursuit academically goes.\nYeah. And the whole thing kind of continued on. The 19th century still had alchemists in it. Um, the upshot of that whole thing was that they were frauds, charlatans, and they were really the ones who gave alchemy a bad name to our modern ears. But also, science when it was really when it really developed, it it had a tendency to turn on its predecessors, the things that it evolved out of, like witches, herbalists, that kind of thing. Um, same thing with alchemist. Like, it was just so dumb and and backward. Science is the the the truth. Um it just basically disavowed alchemy even though it directly evolved out of alchemy.\nYeah.\nBut now it is nice kind of refreshing that today science is ready to be like, yes, it's a little embarrassing, but this is our grandfather.\nYeah. Well, you know, I I feel like grandfather is usually less embarrassing than father.\nI don't know. It depends on the era the grandfather's from because they can say some really inappropriate stuff at Thanksgiving, you know.\nYeah. I I strive to be, if I ever am a grandfather, just to be the sort of sweet daughtering old guy that everyone just thinks is is fun and funny.\nYou definitely will be, man. No doubt about it.\nI think you're also though one of those grandfathers who's also a beloved dad, too, which is\nWell, so far so good.\nThat's hard to do.\nYeah.\nUh, one more thing about alchemy. I when I was studying listened to a bunch of dungeon synth. I know I've mentioned it before,\nokay? But in particular, I was listening to albums by Witchbolt.\nOkay.\nIt's really good stuff, man. If you're into any kind of like instrumental synth music,\nI am.\nYou could do a lot worse than listening to Witchbolt.\nAll right.\nAnd then it also joged my memory. Um I when I mentioned Dungeon Synth a couple years ago, uh we got an email from somebody named the Lone Enchanter who has a Dungeon Synth label called High Mage Productions. And you can go check them out on Band Camp. But they sent us a couple of jingles that apparently were lost because I sent them to Jerry, and she's like, \"I have never heard either of these.\" So,\nwe can look for some High Mage Production jingles coming in in the future. Thank you very much for that.\nYou\nfantastic. I'm going to check out Witchbolt. What a great name.\nIt really is. And their album covers are amazing, too.\nOh, I bet.\nOkay. Well, that's it for Alchemy, everybody. We did it, Chuck. And we're done. And that means it's time for listener mail.\nUh, this is a correction on me. I can't believe I missed this. I feel um like a dummy. Hey guys, when you mentioned Heavy Metal Parking Line on the Sunset Strip episode, the greatest heavy metal short documentary of all time, uh, Chuck attributed it to Penelopey Spirus, uh, she made Decline of the Western Civilization.\nMhm.\nSo, I I goofed that up. I was totally thinking of uh, Decline of Western Civilization. Another great documentary. But have you seen Heavy Metal Parking Lot then?\nI have. I just misattributed the the filmmaker. Apparently, uh Jeff Krulick and John Hayne made heavy heavy metal parking lot. It's beyond satire and encapsulates a moment in time that was magical. Uh they also made and this I didn't know. Uh they also made a documentary called Neil Diamond Parking Lot. No. So that's pretty fun. I'm going to have to check that one out. Uh that is from uh that's with best regards from Matthew T from Cleveland, Ohio with a PS. I love you both very very much.\nThanks a lot, Matthew T. Right back at you. Uh and if you want to be like Matthew T and correct Chuck. Chuck loves that kind of thing.

I fill the marketing and publishing role on the podcast. Today we have aircraft strategy investing. 10 years, 10 years of my Gossamer consulting. I hit my anniversary. Yeah.\n\nCongrats.\n\nI actually, I forgot about it. I started in August after my stint at Cabum and have been doing it ever since.\n\nAnd Gossamer comes from the tentacles of the spider, right?\n\nNo, Gossamer was my character in World of Warcraft.\n\nSo, what is it like? Blizzard gives you a sword at 10 years or a shield or some [ __ ] What do you get? What do you get at your company?\n\nI guess I get a plushy of customers.\n\nI think you can finally wear the vest now. The puffer.\n\nOh, that's true. I should get a puffer vest. So,\n\nwhat do you mean you should? Aim sent you one.\n\nYeah.\n\nAll right, let's keep going. Phil.\n\nPhil monetization zar.\n\nWhere does the zar come from?\n\nWell, you remember like it was like the Obama administration. Everyone was getting like this Zar title and like everyone was embracing it and I was like [ __ ] who doesn't want to be a Zar.\n\nThat sounds awesome. Like a there's always like a drugar in the United States for some reason.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nI remember Cryptozar. That was the uh the best side character we had on the show.\n\nKing of Spain. Come on.\n\nKing of Spain. I like that one. So uh the founder whisperer. Let's go. Let's start the podcast. Nobody is interested in us. Everybody's interested in the news.\n\nWe have a lot. So, first Crest is going to go full 60 minutes and be investigative reporter on the Crafton Subnotica 2 drama. I'm so excited for this one. It's like Real Housewives of the game industry going on. Roblox announces a new IP licensing platform. European mobile game makers are still able to raise money, especially Turkish ones. And a surprising French dev, too. Crest is going to lose his mind. Moon Active takes a direct shot at Scopely. Maybe AI really is taking all of our jobs. It just asked the folks at King London about this. And apparently I have no power over Mishka to uphold my supercell ban.\n\n[ __ ] You missed the most important news that came out today. I was just playing Rebel Moon Bloodline on Netflix. It's the quintessential Super Evil Mega Corp stuff through and through. Superdetailed, dark environments, realistic proportion in an isometric game, sci-fi that it's hard to understand. Very well done, beautiful BFX's, beautiful, you know, story line. I haven't played it too much, but I think I'll be playing this for the next week. Any um guesses on how many downloads this does. After all, it's one of the worst franchises Netflix has. So, uh what is the overunder on this couple? Wow, that's really low, Phil.\n\nIt's all just rounding errors. There's nothing for anyone to add except fulfilling a contract obligation. Like, everyone's just going through the motions at this point. Like, the fact that they're still using this engine is incredible. Like, they're just dragging this thing. Like, I've known a lot of developers who have basically lived off like someone subsidizing their engine and then just using that for every single IP they can throw at it for like mouth-to-mouth jobs to survive. It's incredible.\n\nLet's let's let's banter it up. We actually watched the Minecraft movie as a family for the first time in four years we've been able to watch. So our daughter is our youngest is four years so she can actually sit through it. Eldest is eight. She absolutely loved it. And the next day we had to go to the toy store to get the chicken jockey Lego set. And now she's like she's, you know, finishing it up. She didn't want to go to Taekwondo today to get the camp because she just wants to build this finish up the set. And next she wants to Dennis the wolf. And interestingly enough, like we do have Minecraft and she didn't even ask to play Minecraft. Like it didn't even pop to her head that this is an actual game. So I'm asking Jen, is this the trans media as its finest? Like have we has the family cat been transmediated?\n\nThis is as old school as it gets. This is my entire first part of my career.\n\nOh man, I want to do Can I do an impression?\n\nYeah, do it. Do it.\n\nNo, no. I I mean like look, let me just whip out my funnel. Like you got understand marketing is a funnel and at the top of the funnel is like brand awareness and then that converts. Like how does it go? Like there's a funnel. You're always coming to this funnel. No, you're awful. Okay. All right. All right. Here, let me do let me do my Here's my short version of franchise management.\n\n[ __ ] this trans media stuff. It's franchise management. Kid goes to see content. Kid bugs the [ __ ] out of parents for toys and consumer products. That is like the tale of as old as time to also repeat Disney. So, what's the same is like it movies and TV used to be the thing that you would go see and then go want the toy. And by the way, you big boys do the same thing when you see that like car ad and you're like, \"Oo, I really want to go get that Porsche.\"\n\nPerhaps somebody on the podcast might relate to that. The new school is that YouTube shorts, games, and Roblox are becoming the sources. So, welcome to my world of franchise moneymaking, which is what I used to do at Disney. So, we're actually in a resurgence of this. So, PG movies are on fire. So, Comscore data has found that PG-related films have collectively grossed 1.72 billion in North America the first six months of the year, which is about 42% of the box office revenue. That's up from 31% last year. And last year, full year, actually had Inside Out 2, Moana, Live Lion King. And so this year, what we're seeing is that like kids content and PG or family content is back. Superman lightened its tone. Did you see it? Actually, it was okay. I didn't love it. and I'm a DC fan. So, this year it's been Minecraft, How to Train Your Dragon, Lilo and Stitch. Fun fact, I actually worked on Lilo and Stitch.\n\nOh, kids love it. Well, I don't know what's going on with Lilo and Stitch, but it's like it's huge.\n\nYeah. Anyway,\n\nit's been huge since the beginning. I got to work with the director who is the voice of Stitch and he reprised his role in the new one. It is like the most adorable that this should be your next one. It is a boy character. Disney doesn't have a lot of boys characters. Ignore Marvel and Star Wars. And so Stitch became one of the leading and only boys character because he's kind of naughty. I didn't even go to my awareness funnel. Anyway, let's keep going. Shill Mishka quick show. So Gamescom, we got two events finally. Links to both of them. The links are in description 19th and the 20th. We got the whiskey water tasting. We got the Heroic big party. So I think Heroic Party has already 400 signups. So drop your name there. Going to get to 800. It's going to be a big party. Other show is I did an episode about Pakistan the gaming ecosystem growing. I had Sad Hamid from Game District. He came on the podcast. I actually met Sad in Abu Dhabi last year. Super nice guy and has a pretty interesting operation like 17 studios. I think 3 to 400 employees. Their biggest game did 125 million in downloads. They got 50 games at over 10 million downloads each. Most interestingly, no VC funding. So imagine what this guy can do with some growth capital actually. It's really interesting. Got a lot of requests on LinkedIn from Pakistanis to connect after the episode.\n\nSo and just just for information, I'm not accepting if I don't know you, I'm not accepting you. Anyways, that's that one. I suggest you listen to it because I think this is kind of like one of those up and coming areas just like Vietnam was a couple of years ago. I think Pakistan is next. I got message even from Google is like let's go champ like let's do Google stuff. So that's my and then we also released Jen your episode.\n\nYeah. So I interviewed Scopely CMO Ben Webbley at MAU back in May. We have a kind of an shorter version of that that we just posted. Goes into a lot of, you know, cool topics around creative testing. So check that out. It was really, really fun. He's a great guy. I've known him at my Zinga time, my EA time. And so\n\nMeta Time.\n\nOh, he worked at Meta. didn't. But yes, I mean, he's just like number one is just a great human. And so any chance to talk to him about what Scopely's up to was great. So check that out.\n\nAnd hopefully we can release the unedited version again. Scopely, please. The one is 10 minutes. The real conversation was 30. It's okay. He didn't say anything wrong. Let's go with the full one. Let's go unedited.\n\nYeah. I mean, you know, they they like to leave a little bit hanging for people to come in in real life.\n\nCover their six. You know,\n\nI will tease it starts with a really fun Monopoly fact, so just buckle in.\n\nOh,\n\nthe opening segment. I've I've listened to the podcast.\n\nOh, thank you. Oh, that's so nice.\n\nEric, you doing okay over there?\n\nI'm still upset with the Circon guy who put together some [ __ ] analysis on April. And the more I think about it, the more I'm just like, it's like seems so political what he was doing. It had nothing to do with reality. I feel like apparently we didn't push back hard enough against the Gen Z point and I will push back against Jen on the Gen Z point about disposable income. So if you remember last week there was Sconoid data saying Gen Z's spending on video games was down right and the source was prior year. So like listen I don't know I just want to say that's what the chart said exactly. So I think what's important here is to weight that evidence by the strength of the evidence the strength of that and so right now we have like basically you're comparing one month over one month which Eric pointed out right could be affected by one game we don't know the source of the data how it was collected right it was appeared in the Wall Street Journal so is it credit card panel data is it server data who knows how many players it was collected from who knows and then what we have is we have a Federal Reserve working paper which looks at the amount of income in the United States after taxes and transfers Gen Z have on a cohorted basis. So like by age 20 comparing Gen Z to Gen X, Boomers, Silent, all of the different generations, Gen Z is the best off in terms of median income after taxes and transfers adjusted for inflation. And I think that is important data that is more important than a random Circon survey.\n\nYeah, exactly. All right, moving on. I just profoundly disappointed in that analysis. All right, moving on. I'm I this is a long diet tribe. I apologize, but it is kind of a complicated situation given the fact that there's huge two sides of this thing. So, Crafton is delaying Subnotica 2 ahead of a $250 million payout that was promised to the developers based upon performance, right? So the story fundamentally is that Crafton is postponing Subnotica 2 to 2026 for a lot of reason but one is that the co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max Magcguire along with the CEO Ted Gil were recently removed and replaced by Steve Paputsis of Striking Distance Studios. So the delay basically came right before they were potentially going to be able to earn a $250 million earnout in 2025. And so the allegations is that the postpone is a strategic move to basically eliminate the ability for them to pay this out. But Crafton is publicly claiming that the game simply isn't ready and needs more polish. And then Unknown World's ousted leadership is obviously insisting the game was ready and the staff had expected substantial bonuses. I guess to start this thing off, we have to understand the background here. So Crafton acquired Unknown Worlds after the success of the original Subnotica in 2021 for 500 million. Since then, they've only had one release, which was Moonbreaker, which is an absolute disaster of epic proportions. Like, it didn't do anything, right? So, to be clear, similar to what they did with Zinga, they put an impairment charge, a loss of 190 million in 2023 related to this acquisition. So, clearly, this acquisition has not gone well for them to date by any measure that I can see, right? But the absolutely critical part of this is the release of the sequel to their huge hit of Subnotica. And by the way, Subnotica was an absolutely amazing game, a game before its time, built by a small team. It took the world by storm and it is a very, very fun and great game. All right, so here's Crafton's argument. Crafton is saying they're delaying the game for quality. The content was missing in the game. The leadership was not managing this process and they had other commitments and other things\n\n\nthat they were doing. And they\nare claiming that they were basing it on\nproject status, not the $250 million\nearnout for the executives. And Crafton\nis basically suggesting that they want\nto make sure that this game is ready and\nthat they get a long-term success, not\njust like a one-shot like revenue hit,\nrevenue bump in the year. Unknown Worlds\nis basically saying the game was ready\nand argues that it was ready for early\naccess. That they are accusing Crafton\nof basically delaying the game to avoid\nthis $250 million playout. There's a\nbreach of trust and they're they were\nunjustly dismissed by the company and\nnow they are filing an legal action\nagainst the company\nthat is sealed. Yes.\nWhat\nthe lawsuit is sealed, which was\ninteresting.\nOh really? Oh, because there's a lot of\ninformation thrown around about this\nthing. That's why it's so complicated\nbecause it's just\nYeah. I read up on it like before, like\nthe latest this morning, and that was\nlike, \"Oh, I'm like, oh, that's kind of\nfascinating that you all are complaining,\"\nand but the lawsuit is sealed anyway,\ncontinue on.\nSo, okay, so, so here's my take on this,\nright, fundamentally, right? And and this\nis tough because obviously we don't know\nall the information, but like there's two\nkey questions that doesn't seem to be\nasked by anybody. I don't know why, but\none question was asked. The second\nquestion was not asked. But the first\nquestion is, is the game ready for\nrelease? Right? Like that's actually a\nfundamental question. Is it ready for\nrelease? And by these leaked quote\nunquote documents that suggested what\nthey anticipated for the early access\nlaunch to what they are planning on\nreleasing for the early access launch,\nit is really relatively clear, if you\nbelieve these documents, that the title\nwas not ready. Right? The title was not\ncontent complete to release. And I\nplayed this game enough to know that\nwhat they were releasing was not enough\nto keep players engaged and to create a\nservice that would generate significant\namounts of revenue for them going\nforward. Right? It's just 50% of the\ngame was not ready for release based\nupon what they originally assumed that\nthey would do. So it, I don't know. They\nseem to be off-target. Right.\nYeah. These slides have been verified by\nCrafton that they are real from the\nmilestone meeting. Just that's the\nlatest,\nright?\nSo these are legit slides that we're\nlooking at.\nI know. But it's so gross that these\nwere leaked. Clearly they were leaked\nfor a reason, right? They were. Anyway,\nso but I think the more important thing\nhere that no one seems to be asking, and\nI did read it on a Slack channel thing,\nbut like given the performance of\nMoonbreaker, which would also be\nincluded in this calculation, like is\nthere any way they would have gotten to\nthe earnout bonus, right? Like if\nthey're going to get a $250 million\nearnout bonus, they have to make more\nmoney than $250 million, right? And\nMoonbreaker made nothing, right? So, can\nyou tell me for certainty that like in\nthe next, like in the back half of this\nmonth, like the last three months of\nthis year, that they would been able to\nrecoup the $250 million and above that\nin order to earn it?\nThat's not how earnout works. Like, they\nmight have had different triggers for\nthe earnout. It could be production\nrelated. It could be review related.\nIt's not necessarily how much they\ngenerate. Usually, it's earnout is some\nkind of a milestones that you achieve\nand then out of what you generate, you\nget a percentage. So above of 250 they\nwould have gotten percentage from sales\nI think. Like that's typically I've\nseen,\nright? But everyone keeps throwing this\n$250 million number out here like they\nwere going to get a [ __ ] check.\nLike it's guaranteed. Yeah.\nYeah. Well, that that's how it works.\nLike the way I understand and the way\nI've seen earnouts being structured. So\nthey already got the 500. So the\nfounders I think got 90% of 500 or\nsomething like that and then the rest\nwas left of 250 of the total earnout.\nAnd there were milestones like one must\nhave been the release of this game and\nthen usually there's no\nfirst of all that is dumb, right? Like\nthere was no way that anybody would ever\nstructure a deal in which it's just\nbased upon release.\nYeah.\nIt's based upon performance.\nNo.\nLike no, no\nI've never seen an earnout structure in\nmy life.\nAre you being sarcastic?\nYes.\nOh,\nI've never seen one, never signed one,\nnever worked at a at a big publisher, and\nthey would for sure not pay for reaching\ncertain milestones.\nBut look, if you're a financially\nmotivated company, a publicly traded\ncompany, you're not giving a $250\nmillion check for releasing a game.\nYou're getting it from performance on\nrevenue. Like that there's no way that\ndoesn't even make sense. Okay, so I'm\nnot going to comment more, but let's say\nI have seen different and I you're\ncoming from the right perspective of how\nstructures should be, but the way I'm\ntelling you is often times there are\nother metrics that are tied to the\nearnout and then on top of that there's\nusually a revenue share that comes from\nso that component is like these are\ncrazy contracts. We're talking about\n2021 contract. It is absolutely\nludicrous. But I would assume that the\nrelease of this game would have\ntriggered a big portion of the earnout.\nYeah, it just seems like half of their\npurchase price at 250 seems like a lot.\nAnd then the way that the 250 allocation\nworks, 90% went to the three founders\nand then the last 10% goes to the\ncompany to the employees. The argument\nis that the three founders said that\nthey were planning on distributing some\nof their earnout money to the team, but\ncontractually that's not listed in\nanything that we've read. So that's a\nlittle bit of the disagreement as well\nthat Crafton is saying that the\nfounders didn't intend to distribute\nthat. Whether that was going to happen\nor not and how that was going to happen,\nI think we don't know.\nJust saying Chris, it could be it could\nbe much crazier than you think. I see\nhere the likely scenario is that the\nteam was just not on track, right, to\nhit the earnout, right? And Moonbreaker\nlike literally was like a big part of\nthe calculus here and they just it was a\ndisaster. It was just an absolute bomb.\nI don't think it generated more than\nlike three or four million dollars,\nright? So again, if you're talking about\na $250 million earnout and they want to\nbe whole and cash flow positive on this\nthing, they have to hit significant\namounts of revenue on this game. And\nfrankly, Subnotica, despite its success,\ndid not do that much revenue. Like over\nits life, it certainly did, but\ncertainly not initially. So anyway, it\ndoesn't seem very likely that they were\non track to earn the earnout. So what I\nthink is that Crafton is delayed\nSubnotica so that they would be able to\nrecoup as much money as possible from\nthis acquisition that's gone sideways,\nright? And management said, \"No [ __ ]\nway. We want a shot at earnout.\" Or\nmaybe you're right, maybe part of the\nearnout at least. But realistically, I\nmean, this wasn't likely going to\nhappen. And again, based upon\nperformance to date, like it didn't make\nsense for Crafton to release something\nnow, but it makes much more sense to\nrelease it later when it was actually\nready for prime time and it could\ngenerate significance amounts of revenue\nand deliver on the promise of the game\nitself for that matter, right? And so\nlike the cynical part of me basically\nsays that basically Crafton's claimed\nthat management kind of checked out and\nwas working on other projects and wasn't\nreally focused on this game development\nand this is why it was delayed and why\nthey didn't have any of the content that\nthey promised, etc. that they weren't\nbeing leaders in the company. My my\ncynical side is basically saying, well,\nlook, if they didn't believe they were\ngoing to hit this earnout, then maybe\nthey did as creative people focus on\nother things, right? But the reality is\nI don't think they would have abandoned\ntheir child, right, of this game. I\nthink they would want to get this thing\ndone in effective way. So, I think\nthat's a little bit like cynical to\nthink that they would have have done\nthat and abandoned their baby type\nthing. On the flip side, like releasing\na game like Subnotica with the level of\ncontent that they were suggesting just\ndoesn't make sense like logically,\nright? Because the part of the\nengagement is the amount of you the\nbiomes and and all the content that they\nyou need to get through like the\nSubnautica fans of this game would get\nthrough this content in like less than\nlike 24 hours, you know? I was like that\ndoesn't work for a game like this. So, I\ndidn't know that they actually closed\nthe lawsuit, but um I I imagine we'll\nget more and more details as they go\nthrough discovery, but if they're trying\nto keep it on the hush hush, which I'm a\nlittle bit shocked given how much\ninformation was thrown out there.\nAnyway, that's all I got.\nYeah, really good breakdown. Thank you,\nEric. For my point, just three things\nlike I I think you're absolutely\ncorrect. I think, you know, even based\non the reports, it's quite typical for\nthe founders to check out. And I think\nthey were doing other projects. I think\nthey earned 500 million already and took\n90% of that to the founders. So each of\nthem was doing quite well. Uh probably\ntraveling between Vegas and Honolulu on\nthe regular.\nI don't know. I'm just just throwing out\nthere. But you know any of us could\nimagine how their life would change if\nyou go from grinding on this development\nstudio to having 70 million in your bank\naccount. There was interesting off-topic\ncomment on LinkedIn from a person who\nused to work at Garina Corpdev. I\ncouldn't find it. I tried to look at it,\nbut he basically commented that um yeah,\nI looked at this case and some sort of\nlike we passed because of the founders\nor something like that. I'm\nparaphrasing, but I remember seeing that\ncomment on maybe it was your LinkedIn\nwas full of this news, but I remember\nseeing that it was weirdly open comment\non it kind of like signing that there is\nan issue with the founders and that's\nwhy the Karina passed on it and I do\nbelieve that Crafton did pull the plug\nto avoid the earnouts and I think that\nthe earnouts were milestone based in\nthis case and that's why they pulled the\nplug. If they weren't, if it was about\ngenerating 250 mil, then I think there\nwouldn't be any kind of a rush of\npulling the plug because this game that\nis not ready clearly wouldn't make that\nmoney. And yes, there would be bad PR\njust like with the Minds Eye type of a\nthing, but that would have just, you\nknow, killed the studio. So, in this\ncase, if they knew that they would have\nto pay significant amount, then it they\nsaved $250 million by essentially\nescalating this this case into a\nlawsuit.\nI'm not going to let you go on that one.\nThat doesn't make any sense. Like,\noh, the milestone based earnouts.\nThese are smart people that know how to\nlike negotiate terms. They're not giving\naway money on a release. Like, that's\nreally that's just doesn't even make\nsense.\nI'm not going to comment on that. What\nwe could do is we could talk to the\nsmart folks at ARM who deal with with\nsales and earnouts a lot or any of the\nVCs who see earnout sheets and they can\ncomment if they have seen if you're a VC\nor an investment banker and you have\nseen earnouts where it's tied to release\nand production milestones, holla at us\nDM. We will not tell who it is. We will\njust say you're from reputable company\nor if we're wrong on this then also DM\nus. So, um,\nI'm not suggesting that there aren't\npayouts based upon\nmilestones. I'm not saying that. I'm\nsaying that a $250 million payout,\nholy is not based upon mileston.\nYeah. I mean, that seems extreme.\nSo, in this case, it could be something\nlike 50 mil is unlocked when they pass\npre-production. 50 mil is passed when\nthey pass production and then there\ncould be like 100 mil when they reach.\nBut there are elements that are tied to\nactually launching a game. In some\ncompanies that have live operations, it\ncould be passing the test launch phases.\nSo I've seen those with different\ncompanies.\nI think we agree.\nThey are significant. They're like 30%\nof the earnout when you pass the\nmilestone.\nAll right. So the one thing I wanted to\nmention is I have never seen a statement\nlike this from a big company on their\nwebsite going into this dirty laundry. I\nwas absolutely shocked. Listen, I kind\nof applaud it. I applaud the\ntransparency, but holy [ __ ] was it like,\nyou know, get your popcorn out moment.\nThe second thing I wanted to get Phil's\nperspective on really quick is early\naccess means a lot more now than it did\nin 2021. When you early access a game,\nit is almost like a launch. And so, do\nyou think, Phil, that had anything to do\nwith this? I think people just want more\nmoney for enzoy development crafting.\nJesus Christ. Yeah,\nthank you for answering my question.\nWhat a troll. What a troll.\nI actually I I actually did forget to\nmention that like I think they're\nfeeling a bit burned too, right? Inzo\nwas a disaster. Calisto Protocol was an\nabsolute train wreck.\nPUBG New State, how about that?\nPUBG is [ __ ] delivering by the way.\nWe haven't covered that. PUBG is doing a\nton of crazy awesome [ __ ] right now.\nPUBG or PC PUBG.\nThe PC PUBG.\nNo, that's a Jacob. I Philip, that has\nnothing to do with this. This is all\nabout\nDid you just like mix up your son's name\nwith Phil?\nYeah, I do that all the time. Um,\nwe should call Phil. We're having all\nthese deals that they signed since the\nsuccess of PUBG and just have not worked\nout, right? Particularly for the Western\ndevelopers. Like, they're having their\nNetIs moment where they're just\nbasically pulling back on all things,\nright? And so, you know, Kalisto\nProtocol was a train wreck of epic\nproportions in terms of money spent and\ndollars earned. And so, I think this is\nlike actually part of that as well. I'm\nsure management was just not happy with\nthese investments.\nAll right. So, I'm going to cover\nRoblox's new IP licensing platform. Get\nready for what looks like their new\nUpwork or Fiverr for the Roblox\nplatform. So, they announced this\nyesterday on July 15th. It's a new\nlicensing platform including license\nmanager and the licenses catalog. So\nwith this launch creators can build\nexperiences with popular IP. So if you\nknow anyone can kind of apply to work\nwith different IP rights holders\n\n\nGet a new self-serve.\nSo I thought this was interesting part of it.\nThere's self-serve IP management tools making it easy to provide licenses to their IP at scale for use at Roblox.\nSo the two big components here is one is if you're like an IP holder, you register, you can create a new IP.\nYou can customize the terms that govern it.\nYou can proactively scan experiences for IP usage.\nSo this will become important later on.\nOffer license uses directly to creators and automatically collect revenue.\nHopefully the revenue is not in Robux, which is a pain in the ass, but you can do that automatically.\nSo the other piece of it that it does is you can offer license use of IP to creators by identifying experiences that might qualify for the use, listing your IP that's available, and then creators can browse and apply for use of the IP.\nSo through the platform, the IP holder can actually approve or not approve people to use different things.\nSo here's what they're launching with, which as you know, someone who knows licenses, I was a little bit embarrassed for them.\nCan we get a drum roll for like the premiere licenses?\nTo kill it with, go slay, genen?\nWhat a rip.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, the four studios are Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kadanchu.\nLike, I actually don't even know how to say this.\nSo, Like a Dragon.\nHere are some of the IP they're launching with some of this.\nI'm like, what is this?\nLike a Dragon.\nDon't know this.\nNow You See Me.\nOh my god.\nThis is like the a card poker movie from 10 years ago.\nJesse.\nJesse Eisenberg or something.\nRemember there mystical elements.\nIt's like uh Oceans 11 with\nYeah.\nThere's there's weird [ __ ] at the end of that movie.\nOh, all right.\nOh, that's right.\nSpoiler alert.\nYeah.\nSquid Game, which by the way is done.\nStranger Things.\nThe Divergent series.\nOh my god.\nFlashback to something.\nBut only Twilight.\nOnly the movie right, only based that are based on a young adult book series.\nTwilight series, Go Team Bella from 20 years ago and the extremely kid-friendly Saw series.\nIf you don't know the Saw series, it is the big rated R gory, like the guy with the mask, like puts people in a room and makes them kill each other.\nSo like really appropriate for the Roblox kid audience.\nThey say longterm they're going to open it up.\nSo these are the test subjects for this.\nSo, just for a little context and comparison, it's extremely similar to what happens with Epic, Fortnite's UFN licensed IP platform.\nSo, they have Lego, Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Walking Dead.\nThey actually have Squid Game as well.\nUh, all of that's live now.\nAnd so, you can imagine with Disney, the Disney deal that they're going to have Disney IP coming later.\nSo, when you look at Fortnite.gg, you can see that some of these games using this IP have done well.\nThe ones that get made by the platform experts that know how to make on UEA make games for UFN, those are the ones that end up doing well.\nAnd so remember that typically in licensing there's about a 15% rev share that goes to the lensur.\nSo here's where I wanted to break this down.\nThis is not the holy grail that you know, this isn't the licensing model that you're looking for.\nYou know, in the words of the great Obi-Wan, these aren't the droids you're looking for.\nSo, the biggest win isn't actually going to be what you would expect.\nI would say it is going to be the ability for brands to police and take down people infringing on their IP and all of the knockoffs.\nSo, ask any anime game and they'll tell you knockoffs are out of control.\nSo, you know, One Piece as an example of, you know, just take a big IP.\nOne of the biggest games on Roblox is a ripoff of the One Piece IP, which was Blox Fruits.\nThey actually had to change their name from block piece to blocks fruits and they had to change some things in the game to uh comply.\nAnd so when you look at this, you know, sadly too, the IP games actually don't even perform that well.\nAnd so IP in a sense doesn't always matter to kids.\nWhat matters is making a great freaking game on the platform that kids want to play.\nSo they actually, you know, like the licensing may or actually not be the most important thing.\nSo on revenue, this also might not be the answer that you would expect.\nYou're like, Jen, there's so many more ways, you know, people can make games with an IP.\nSo remember that when you make money, if you're a developer, you only get 21% of gross to net because of all the platform fees, all the Roblox fees.\nSo imagine then you've got 21%.\nNow if you're a developer, you're going to pay 15% to a license.\nSo for lensur this is like collecting pennies from the bottom of you know a fountain, like the revenue is not even going to really matter that much.\nThe big win for you is going to be you know maybe one of these games actually takes off, but it's like playing the lottery on that.\nSo this is also really disruptive.\nIt's going to piss off a number of these agencies out there that specialize in IP and brand based games.\nYou know our friend Ethan made a Lego game for somebody that he worked for.\nSo those people are going to be super pissed off because, you know, those brand people aren't going to be needed as much if there's now a platform that you can go to.\nOn the flip side, this actually democratizes the ability for a teenager next door to go make an official Squid Game, Roblox game.\nHe's probably made a fake one, so now he can do an official one.\nThe one thing I can think of on the plus side is time to market will dramatically shrink, meaning more franchise opportunities, formerly called trans media.\nSo maybe now there can be some IP that gets out in time.\nWe always complain about like why didn't Fallout have more new products?\nWell, maybe this will allow it, assuming they can upload all the assets in time, which also like never really happens.\nSo in short, brands, you know, they'll probably need to be there, you know, but they're going to need to be there to play defense, not offense.\nSo that's my update for everyone.\nAnd if you care about licensing,\nhey, are you building a game, launching an app, or considering an acquisition?\nWell, in

think they're number one in Turkey.\nSo, Gorkham and crew at Latan are crushing it out there, which is good because I'm an adviser.\nSo, there we go.\nUm, full disclosure, we've left the show section.\nYeah.\nThis is big news.\nYeah.\nSo, good good for them.\nYeah.\nWell, staying on the uh on the Turkey topic.\nI mean, there was a news that mobile game developer Circle Games has secured over $7 million in seed funding led by BigCraft with backing from A16Z speedrun, E2VC, Play Ventures, API Ventures, and so forth.\nThese funds will go towards blah blah blah blah blah.\nAnd they're making a puzzle game.\nAnyway, so so just to cut this short, dude.\nAll I have to say is Bitcraft and A16Z is the tail wagon.\nThe Laton Ventures dog, dude, these guys are just following the lead of Laton Ventures and Mr. Gorkum, you know, eat our dust.\nYeah.\nWell, and they are crap.\nFirst of all, they're very differentized funds and they do work together.\nSo, let's let's be clear.\nThey're following a trend, you know, they're just like way behind the eightball, you know, like always.\nJust, you know, let let me open open this up before before you put your Laton t-shirt on.\nSo, pretty big raises in the market in the East Bowl market as of late.\nSo, Bigger Games just recently raised $25 million series A.\nI think Rain led that.\nGood job Games raised $23 million.\nI think it was Seed or Ser, it doesn't matter.\n$23 million and that company was quite established.\nGrand Games, which was that's Laton venture company, actually raised $30 million series A.\nSo they have been very big early stage raises in the market, much bigger than we've seen in other areas.\nI don't think we really see these big of a rounds in other markets at the moment, especially on mobile.\nAnd so why I think this is happening is is kind of four things.\nSo what Turks are really good at is that they focus on business and not what they like to play and would like to play.\nSo they don't make a MOA because they and they do love MOBAs.\nThey really focus on what's good business and good business is casual games at the moment.\nThe second thing is that I've noticed is that they have this relentless attention on details when it comes to both product and marketing.\nLike it's crazy how deep these guys go into making the puzzle levels and and really polishing the pixels and polishing the gameplay and polishing individual creative assets.\nLike it's you know down to a science or a craft however you want to put it.\nThe third thing that in my opinion separates this market from many other ones is how talented and super hardworking people are talented in the sense of the top talent from universities chooses gaming, which is very not typical in US, they would go to finance or or AI or whatnot, but in Turkey they actually do go to gaming and the second part with hardworking is like when I'm in Istanbul, like it's hard to have a dinner with people at 7 or 8:00 p.m. because everybody's at work and it's quite normal to be from 10:00 a.m. till like 11:00 p.m.\nThat's a pretty normal working day at a startup.\nSo, they do work really really hard.\nAnd then finally, the reason why A16Z, BitCraft, and everybody except Lighteed is investing into these one is that they have the traction.\nSo, Graham started with the exits.\nPeak kind of sealed the deal with that 1.2 1.6 $6 billion exit and then Dream converted essentially everybody who was on the fence.\nThey they could say, \"Well, mobile's kind of dead and we're not going to do it.\"\nAnd then what Dream took 5 years for a $5.5 billion essentially exit to private equity.\nSo those are the reasons why the Turkish market is so hot and why bigger funds are also trying to get in and getting in at pretty high valuation.\nBut I think there's a lot of limiting factors when it comes to this market as well.\nOne limitation is talent.\nThere's only 90 million something Turks and these companies only hire Turks, like some of these companies do have an office in London maybe, but that's only marketing.\nThe second part is because they're attracting through these exits these big VCs, they're getting a little bit overpriced, everybody wants a piece and then so you're able to raise like what Spike raised $55 million seed, like I think that's been the record, so that increases the valuation and um you know they're not overpriced yet, but that moment can\nAnd I think it's going to be very interesting what happens to these big VCs who are following, who are not leading, who are not on the ground level, what they're going to do when some of their bets go south, like when they have invested tens of millions at later rounds to some of these companies that are bound to fail, like it is normally in venture capital.\nSo that's going to be interesting.\nAnd will they move capital elsewhere or how long they will, you know, support this ecosystem and continue to raise the prices.\nSo dude, A16Z will just go chase the next like\nWell, A6 Well, let's be clear that A16Z check came through speedrun.\nSo they came in super early.\nThat's a speed check.\nThey weren't even involved in the second round.\nNo, I'm sure they did the uh Pro Rada, but they were actually really really early.\nSo it's Bitcraft that put in the uh the bigger check at a higher valuation.\nIt's A6Z that that got moved around on Light Speed's moved on like\nYeah.\nLight speed's doing.\nSo I think I think overall just talking about the future of Turkish market for what little I know about it.\nI think we're expecting kind of expansion to other platforms.\nI think PC makes a lot of sense.\nMaybe different type of games but no you're saying no PC.\nOkay.\nSo let me tell you no way.\nNo [ __ ] way they do AAA double A.\nNo not AAA.\nNot I'm not saying AAA I'm saying they have success on PC when it comes to Steam games.\nBit battle bit is out of Turkey.\nLayer of liars is out of Turkey.\nSo, they have some really good like kind of 1A 2A hits coming in already.\nI've heard from some of the founders who have moved from the crazy mobile gaming grind where they're saying, hey, we can do a cool game and get $15 million.\nAnd they've actually succeeded in getting that.\nAnd they're like, I'd rather make a fun game once, kind of put all my effort into it.\nLet dude, this is [ __ ] There's just no way that as a collective can move on to like AAA, double A,\nnot move on.\nAnd I think opening up new avenues and I believe that will happen more and more.\nI think they will expand to tools, tech and platforms.\nThey are\n\n\nSpending so much money on adtech. Why isn't there a Turkish adtech company? There are few, but I think it makes sense. And finally, global expansion, like these teams that are growing, and they're competing so hard for talent, and I think at some point they have to unlock studios in other locations, and it will be interesting to see how that works. Can we hear from the Turkish VC advisor on what he's seeing in the market?\n\nYeah, Mr. Crest, put your puffer vest on. Let me...\n\nWell, I mean, tell it like it is, man. Like, don't, don't make funny faces. Like, let's... Come on, man. This isn't Wario. Let's go. What you got?\n\nShow up. Show up to the club.\n\nThe Turkish group has a very specific expertise in which they are leveraging to the [ __ ] hilt. But the idea that they're going up end up higher and putting studios in different locations, that might be they want, might want to dream the dream, but I don't think that's a realistic expectation, right? Is that they can move upstream or something like that. They're crushing it where they are. That's been their focus and that's their expertise.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it's a bottle.\n\nThis is the same tide thing. It's like, you know, why has King made puzzle games for the last [ __ ] 30 years, right? Because that's all they [ __ ] know how to do, you know? Like they tried other things. It's not a function of not trying. I'm not suggesting go, go for it. But like, I mean, obviously, very cynical way of looking at things. Just no way that this is going to happen. So look, if you see some big data points that suggest that they're actually making some headway there, fine. But like a small, like Rinky Think game on Steam, that's...\n\nBattle Bed was pretty big. Like yeah, it was done by four people. They couldn't run it.\n\nOkay. So there's Stumble Guys, there's Turkish Stumble Guys. What does that say about Finland? You know, not, not much, right? But speaking of rinky dink games though, with data points and a country that is growing and diversifying, Airrest's favorite, uh, Mishko, would you like to talk about French developer Million Victories?\n\nSo, we have to just drop this here just because it's a French company.\n\nSo, French mobile game developer Million Victories has completed a funding round, raising almost 40 million, more than any of the Turks. Exactly.\n\nTo be used in expanding operations and global presence. This funding comes from Havlli Investments, and to be clear, Havlli is private equity.\n\nEquity. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And it says from Austin, Texas, which will partner with Million Victories to focus on recruiting talent and accelerating investment in production, marketing, and user acquisition. So, super operational role. It's not we're backing them. It's like, no, we're helping you to operate. They have a flagship title, a 4X strategy title called Million LS World of Conquest. I believe this is a title which has human animals, like, you know, like a, like a lion with with a human torso. I [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] the most.\n\nIf you have human, if you have a mandal is a rhino and then there's like a girl that is a fox. I'm not [ __ ] downloading or touching it with a long stick. But Phil, talk to me about the uh, the numbers.\n\nAll right. So, oh man, 40 million is crazy. So, they made a 4X game. We'll talk about the 4X game in a moment, cuz it's a fascinating 4X game. But that being said, you're looking at a game that's only done 20 million life to date, is slowing down in terms of monthly active users. It's just slowing down in terms of downloads. I think the thing that I would point to is it looks like downloads started falling off after they may have secured the deal. I'll leave it to like better judges than myself, but like if you look at downloads really around February, they start to peak. And I am curious based on the timing of the deal when this gets signed. So I don't have any inside information, but I'm like, damn, like, goo, who's the UA?\n\nPhil, based on like little I know, talking to private equity, maybe they do a proper due diligence because they are coming in as operational partners. This is not DC who is following it in.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That, that's cool. That all right, makes sense. Just something that was interesting. The thesis behind the game is fascinating because they were trying to take on 4X with no base building.\n\nHuh.\n\nIt was all combat. And so they have a very clear thesis. They're still using timers to generate troops, but the thing that really matters is XP, which is earned through combat. There's so many things that reloop you back to the combat loop. And so you get this huge bonus from beating players that are targeted on the map. So they can kind of influence things and just run live ops, but it's all about combat. And don't me wrong, they're like, they're still loot boxes. They're just more limited. I would say the Gotacha is much weaker. Peace shields are not, you know, to the same degree. But the thing that they'll also do on the monetization side, which I, which I absolutely love, is they'll have SKUs that are up to $900 for like full legendary items or all gold items.\n\nYou know, I wanted to just take a moment cuz Forex is so hot right now. What people don't understand about systems like this and especially in games like Game of War is that they would constantly talk about inflation and you would see complaints on player forums saying like, \"Oh my god, now I pay a dollar and I get like 10 million coins when I used to pay a dollar and I would get 5 million coins.\" And there's a very specific reason for this, which is that you have servers which have a certain number of players. And those shards or those servers start to die out in terms of active populations once you seed them with a certain amount of players just by natural retention. And so if you pump new players into the shard, they're going to be at a different power score and a different layer of progression. And not only that, your track is moving out, right? You are adding more things to the Elder game. And so like the reason you see these things particularly in Forex game is that there's planned inflation that essentially functions as like an XP boost to move people along the progression curve. And that I think this game, you know, at least executed against that, I would say to a really healthy degree, which is wonderful to see. But by and large, like when you just look at the Forex market, it's still just a very small drop in the bucket. There's almost nothing going on here. Yeah. So, I mean, I hats off to them.\n\nAre you 4x if you don't have base building?\n\nLike, what?\n\nExpand, explode.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can still do the X's.\n\nExplore, exterminate. Yeah.\n\nYeah. French don't have time to build no bases.\n\nLet me, my, my commentary is on this. This game is tiny, right? Like $40 million. I am hoping to God that Havlli, who is doing UA financing, by the way, that a big portion of this is UA financing and not direct investment because $40 million in investment on a game that's barely like making any money is ridiculous, right? I, I don't think my buddy would do that. So, I'm hoping that this is actually UA financing and not an equity investment. I think again this probably is partially UA financing, which is just more of like a debt vehicle on cohorts and stuff. So, we shall see if they can scale this game. But, if we track this like funding round,\n\nfunding round,\n\nI know, but it was I, I read the press release, it seems a little bit since they're the only ones right there. There's no one else in this round as far as as the pest, but that's that's typical with private equity. They do take the other full round.\n\nWell, can we look at the next investment to shed some light on this?\n\nLet's stay on the other Forex. Yeah.\n\nGlobal Worldwide closes funding round, bum bum bum. Let me just go through this oversubscribed funding round led by who else than big ventures. Bitcraft is throwing money. So, this was very confusing press release. It had some jokes that people probably did not get. It was talking about like how the founders were building agricultural products and whatnot and now they're into games. Anyway, it was really confusing. Global Worldwide has made a game called Kingdom Maker. It's a Forex game that was kind of like accessible. It had this interesting looking graphics. It was picked up after uh, what, test marketing phase or or beta phase by Scopely, and Scopely essentially published it to a larger audience and it tanked. Uh, it could not scale. Didn't have the IP. This was before Fleet Command, I believe.\n\nNo, it was after Fleet Command. That is incorrect.\n\nIt was after Fleet Command. Interesting. So they had, they had the success of Fleet Command. They were like, let's double down. Kingdom Maker looks really cool. Yeah. Well, well, well, I'm thinking that they had the learnings and so nothing to do with with Fleet Command then, but nevertheless, so they looked at this game. Apparently, they had good early numbers. They couldn't scale it. I think there were layoffs regarding this particular studio that was working on Kingdom Maker. What makes Kingdom Maker and Global Worldwide so interesting is it's because it's led by the CEO and founder, Will Harbin. And Will Harbin, for the old dogs, is the CEO of Kixeye. that was for a brief moment the king of Facebook games and they had this recruitment video. Just go to YouTube, Kixeye recruitment video, and it is [ __ ] on the industry. Like they made this, this, this toxic masculinity promo piece which by the way I loved. Uh, it was all about like they had Mark Pinkis as this little boy throw throwing money at a company called Jenka with two dogs shagging each other as a logo. It had EA shown as E A RP games with like this old scenile person. Then they made fun of product managers with like the Asian dude at Kabam by the way.\n\nYeah, Kabam. Yeah, that's true. Kabam is the quintessential PM company.\n\nThey called it Kerploop.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then it ends with with Will Harbin being himself at [ __ ] like there's a Spartan helmet in his in his office and essentially he leaves the office on a helicopter in this video. Then it's all about like just you know be cool, make cool games and work for Kixeye. And Kixeye was making some of the most awesome games on Facebook. And then the platform shifted. Games moved to mobile. Kixeye stayed on web. They actually doubled down on web and their own platform. They couldn't pivot in time. Uh, they made a mobile that was there. At some point they were like, you know what, I think what we need in our portfolio is not mobile is mobile. And they got absolutely ravaged by Supercell. So if you ever played Backyard Monsters and you play Clash of Clans, you can kind of see the evolution that is happening from one platform in one game to another. The end of Kixeye was not, you know, beautiful. They had a fire sale. They were acquired by Stillfront and naturally that two ended up with litigations with Stillfront about earnouts by the way, just like the Subnotica and they lost that. So I just checked it recently. That was the end of Kixeye. You know, good to add probably before like I'm not mocking Will in any way, like good to add that before actually his gaming career. He was in another kid-friendly industry known as Energy Drinks and and and sold the company to Monster. So, I think this is his fourth company. So, he's been quite successful as an entrepreneur. Anyhow, I think it's great and I congratulate them on the race. It's very difficult and he had a LinkedIn post about how difficult it is to raise in this era of AI and hype. I am very hopeful that they ship a good game and I'm certain that the journey will be very entertaining to follow whatever happens because Mr. Harbin is at the forefront of this venture. I can't let this go. This one too because Will, it wasn't that they missed the boat in terms of moving from canvas to mobile is that Will was like so arrogant in his assumptions that mobile was nothing and that you know PC and his own platform was the way to go despite all the evidence to the contrary. He kept that strategy going for years after mobile was like a [ __ ] rocket ship. you know, like he mismanaged the entire company based on the arrogance that he was right about this particular part of the business, which didn't even make sense. Like I was living it through it with all these people that were working at Kixeye and they were just like befuddled at the situation, you know, and so it's like, you know, buyer beware, dude. Like this guy is is is alone, you know? He's like he's a little bit nutty.\n\nI wouldn't go that far. I can say I've met Will and I met I think I met him in 2014. So this was right about the time where mobile was really crushing it. Like from my perspective, I think the the recruitment video, he wasn't playing a character that's as well. He's a very confident person. Let's put it that way.\n\nYeah, you could tell from the video which was iconic and amazing and you know, if you talk about building culture to, you know, everything you talked about last week, that certainly built a culture.\n\nYeah, he wore that suit. Like he looked exactly like that when I met him. Like he had the button up open in San Francisco. Nobody wears this in San Francisco. So I can just say...\n\nYeah. What's interesting is Scopely doesn't have many failures and sadly this was this uh, this was one of them.\n\nYeah. They, they really put their back against it.\n\nWell, well, I don't think we know that at all. What do you mean? I think there's...\n\nWell, if they launch it and goes to like, like...\n\nNo, I mean, look at, look at the scale of DAU here. We're looking at maybe 150,000 active users. This isn't like a, you know, what one Scopely GM referred to as a scorched earth launch to number one. This is something much more moderate that was moved on from at some point. And I don't think this entire graph by the way is under Scopely's tenure. I think they picked it up for as a publisher later into it. The thing I also want to point out similar to million victories is like they did some fascinating things to like the 4X core and so Will had spoke at the Play Adventures conference and one of the\n\n\nThings he points out.\nAbout *Kingdom Maker* is like, \"Where is the freaking sex in games?\" Like, you look at *Game of Thrones*, like half of that is about lineage, half of that is about creating dynasties. There is none of that, like player storytelling, in 4X. And what if we brought that, and they did that in *Kingdom Maker*? Hence, the maker part is like you making your kingdom, and so, like, you can make it, baby, right? Those are things you can do. You can create...\n\nThere is still a fascinating core here that I feel like has been underexplored, and I think makes sense in a 4X context. It was a fun game. Like, it was a standout game, and Kixeye was known to make really standout games in this category. Yeah. I don't know. It's, I think they have as good of a shot as anybody, but Chinese are kind of [ __ ] crushing this game, like 4x Chinese circuit. Yeah, the game of Forex. They're, you know, they own it. So, I don't know. Should we talk about other kings?\n\nYes. So, from Neil at mobilegamer.biz, anonymous sources within the mobile developer king have said that the staff have been laid off. So, if you might remember, as part of the Microsoft layoffs that happened, about 200 people were reportedly laid off from the King ecosystem. So, speaking to mobilegamer.biz, one staff member at the *Candy Crush Saga* maker said that many of the level designers had been let go after spending months creating tools that would build levels more quickly. So, in a sense, these teams were getting replaced by the AI tools that they helped train. Ouch. If that is true, Zinga had a similar thing where I remember people were training their counterparts in India, and then they got let go. Yeah. Then, and in some cases, it was even transparent, like, \"Go and train this team in India, and they will end up taking your job, and maybe you move on to the next project, or maybe you move on to the next company.\" Yeah, it's pretty, pretty brutal.\n\nI've read this among the people laid off who are also narrative designers, and that kind of stuck with me because I was like, \"Who are the plural narrative designers working on the *Candy Crush* franchise?\" I, I maybe I'm missing the uh, the narrative of the *Candy Crush*. There's an absolutely deep plot with the *Candy Crush*, for sure.\n\nYeah, my wife plays *Candy Crush* like crazy. I need to ask her, like, \"How's the story?\"\n\nThe other part in the article was interesting. 50 people were laid off from *Farm Heroes Saga*. Oh my. I was like, \"Oh, I totally forgot about that game.\" And so, not all of the 200 were directly on *Candy Crush*. Just kind of another FYI.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, *Monopoly Go* with KO.\n\nWhat the [ __ ]\n\nThis is, yeah. Yeah. I mean, *Moon Active* takes on *Monopoly Go* with Komas Co.\n\nSo, *Monopoly Go* with *Coin Master* board. All right. *Moon Active* is going after *Scopely* in a big way. They have launched, in a sense. It's like a take on a take on a take. So, you had *Coin Master*, then you had *Monopoly Go*, which kind of used those systems. Now *Moon Active* is doing a version of *Monopoly Go* with the original kind of version that they came up with. And *Coin Master* was a take on another game, the pirate something. Pirates... No, no, it was a pirate something. Uh oh. *Board Kings*. Yes.\n\nNo, no, no. Those are both. It was a pirate kings or something like that. It was another jelly button game that played. Anyways, everybody's stealing from everybody, just to be everyone. Uh, inspired by is what we'd like to say.\n\nI, what I love about all of this is that this is like industrial espionage in open, in the [ __ ] open, dude. This is like what's good for the goose is good for the gander, dude. You know, [ __ ] *Scopely* copies *Moon Active* completely, right? And [ __ ] layers on some [ __ ] amazing *IP*, right? Now Moon's copying them right the [ __ ] back, right in their wheelhouse with their [ __ ] *IP* as the headline, right, of the *Coin Master*, right? So, it's actually [ __ ] brilliant, dude. It's absolutely brilliant, right? So, I love it. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if this is going to be successful. We'll see. But having the *Coin Master* brand is huge here. But, dude, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. You know, you want to [ __ ] with them, they're going to [ __ ] with you. Okay. So, don't think about them, you know.\n\nHold up. You think the brand matters here? The *Coin Master* brand.\n\nI don't know if it does. The search is going to... I mean, they might cannibalize their existing game, but maybe they don't care. Maybe they're hoping OnePlus 3. My understanding is that the feeling is, and I, and I talk to these guys once in a while, is that in some ways, *Scopely*, you know, grew the addressable audience, like, probably moving people away from traditional casino games and putting them in these type of games, which is more compelling, you know, like, I don't know, there's like all kinds of ideas here. So, perhaps I think what I would think is that they're just going after straight after *Scopely* share, right? So, they want to maintain their share on their game and then just go after and start stripping share away from *Scopely*, right, to build their business overall. They're going for the jugular. They're not [ __ ] around, right? And so, *Monopoly Go* better, you know, get back on track with terms of features and stuff like that, because I think what'll likely happen, I haven't looked at the game too closely, is that they're just going to be a better version of the *Monopoly* game to some degree would be my guess. I don't know. We'll see.\n\nThe *IP* is a beachhead, right? I feel like we've spent so much time talking about this, though. It's the unique combination of *Monopoly*, which was already successful in gambling environments, like the McDonald's game or Vegas slots licensing. Like, that is a beachhead. Like, that is a *CPI* effect that, like, that is your *TAM*. That is Jen's fun fact you will see in the first five minutes of her YouTube video, which you can catch with Ben Webb. Link, link in the description.\n\nBut like, that, that was an important part of, like, this isn't like, this isn't *Empire Strike Back*. Are you kidding me? Like, this *Monopoly Go* genre. Like, this is small potatoes.\n\nAll right. So, I'm actually leading towards your point of view on this. So, I'm just kind of talking on both sides of my mouth right here. But like, at the end of the day, *Monopoly Go* is at a point in which they are doing insane levels of TV advertising, which we all know is [ __ ] [ __ ], right? And their revenue is completely deteriorating, right?\n\nNo. No. So, they, *Scopely*'s team pulled it out of the ass this quarter. Like, you can look at it. Downloads flattened, but revenue went up. I mean, don't get me wrong, the long run trend is still there, downward sloping. But you can clearly see Javier just like...\n\nOver, over them.\n\nAnd they have a web shop, and they have a web shop called... I don't care about the web shop. I don't understand why we don't care about the [ __ ] web shop. It's money.\n\nWhat actually, what *Moon Active* likely will do, because these guys are [ __ ] ruthless, right? Is they are going to *UA* the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of this thing, right? They are going to go after every single [ __ ] person that's playing *Monopoly Go* to get into their game, and they're going to spend whatever it takes to get there, dude. And so, like, yeah, it's an arms race.\n\nYeah, it's a [ __ ] arms race. And I think, I think the Israelis are going to win this one. I mean, I think they potentially could win this one. They... Israeli Saudi showdown now.\n\nWell, I don't mean to be political, but these guys are kind of ruthless about getting that what they need done. I have my faith in *Moon Active* to get this, get this done.\n\nCan't they both win?\n\nI mean, they're kind of growing together. I, I honestly don't think that's the goal. I don't think that's the goal for both to win, right? But they kind of grow the category together. Like it seemed like...\n\nI mean, puzzle... I mean, you think about the puzzle category and how many match three players there are now. I guess can they grow the pie for this kind of a new genre? This, like, I think they call it coin looter as a sub coin battler.\n\nOh, interesting.\n\nAnd by the way, love the art style. They would have done a different execution if they were trying to expand the market, right? Like, they wouldn't have done exactly what *Monopoly* is.\n\nThey should have done that, though. Like, this, this is what I don't understand, Eric, is like, you'll admit that *Monopoly Go* is at the edge of user acquisition, and so they're like turning to TV ads because *CPIs* are so high. And now you're telling me that the Israelis are going to show up with *Coin Master* board, and they're going to spend a bunch more against the same pool of users. Like, this market is filling up. This is not what we should be paying attention to. Like, to give you an example, like, this market is already getting clones. Like, just as an example, *Peggy Go Clash of Coin* is like [ __ ] that appears on this list.\n\nIt's been for a while that this game has been for a while. It's like a love and stake.\n\nAnd this has also already beenified.\n\nSo, the other thing that we haven't covered is something that has like a hyper casual loop to bring people in, which is *Carnival Tycoon*, which is basically an idler, which is dripped off from another idol game called *Idol Theme Park*, which builds in a slot machine. Like, there's a lot happening in the subg genre, but like, this is not a good strategy to get there. And you know, what are you going to do on the *CPI* side? That's interesting here. It's like, what's happening in Forex? Brand matters, but it's like, what's happening in Forex? How Forex started to take in *RPG* components, gotcha character, collector, these coin looters or coin battlers are now combining all of these different hyper casual things together.\n\nI do think that brand matters, and you know, back when I was on the Hasbro business at EA back in when Facebook started, that's when Zingga came out with a ripoff of Scrabble called *Words with Friends*, and there actually was room in a sense for both because of, like, a little bit of the innovation that they did there. The interesting thing here is going to be, you know, how close can they get and not infringe on the *Monopoly* trademark, which, by the way, is, it's only limited to a few different things. It's limited to, like, the four corners of the board, like the chance and community square things. So, I, I think they can still go after it, but brand matters.\n\nOkay. I think, I think we're focusing on the wrong things right now, right? We're talking about, like, these peripheral, like, design choices and casual games and all this other stuff. We're talking about a *UA* war, right? We're not talking about, like, product. We're not talking about features, right? We're, we're talking about the fact that this is like *UA* arbitrage at its finest, right? In terms of how companies are going after... So, like, when you talk about Puzzle, for instance, the only reason Puzzle continues to grow is because Dream Games is spending insane amounts of money with 24-month paybacks, right? Like, insane *CPIs*, right? And so, that's where the battle is being...\n\nYeah, but isn't this the entire mobile industry? Like, it...\n\nNo, I know. But, but you guys are bringing up these [ __ ] chachki games that aren't even making a dent in the industry. These are irrelevant, right? These are absolute mice nuts, right?\n\nWhat I'm saying is that these are the big boys with the biggest budgets that are private. They don't give a [ __ ] about profitability, really, and they're going for the jugular, right? And Dream Games has the same idea. Like, even though they're private, like, they were just basically spending with reckless abandon in order to gain as much share as possible, right? Like, it's a different world, right? Than when we were back in canvas days or the early days of mobile. This is like just a [ __ ] gunfight, you know, and, and, and these guys are ruthless, right? And so, and so is *Scopway*. *Scope* was absolutely ruthless with their game when they came out against you topping coin *Coin Master* and then completely just like burying them on the *UA* side. That's not what we're... because what we're, what we're arguing is not necessarily what the intent is. Like, maybe they'll have the big war chest, maybe they won't. But even if they do, I'm just arguing that it's very silly because we're already seeing *Monopoly Go* hit a wall. There's also the *IP* as a moat. So, you got to consider those two things, which I think make it a poor strategy. I mean, look at, it's only going to be x number of dollars in development cost, and they are going to have a rorowaz number, right? I have a hard time imagining, Eric, that they're going to continue to shove coal into a rorowaz number that's declining. That can continue infinitely. And the reason I'm bringing up these quote chachki games is because I'm trying to show you that in this *UA* game for coin battlers, we're starting to see the frozen city white out survival playbook emerge in *Carnival Tycoon*, which is what I'm trying to point out to you, is an idol game that turns into a game that has a *Monopoly Go*. Same thing with [ __ ] *Fish of Fortune*, which I, I want to talk about at some point, cuz it's such a fascinating game, but again, you're seeing other people go after this in a bigger strategy. No, they're not scaled right now, but these are the real attempts.\n\nThey're bringing like plushies to a gunfight, right? They don't have the means. They don't have a hundred or $200 million to throw a user acquisition. These like Chachki games can't even compete. They're not even in the discussion because they don't have the money to go after it, right? Plenty of match three games. There are plenty of match three games that compete at all levels. No.\n\nLike, just because King exists.\n\nNo, absolutely not.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Like, *Tactile Games*...\n\n\nLily's Garden, one example.\nDude, those guys spent all kinds of money like sure they spent money, but I'm saying they exist at all sizes.\nLook it.\nYeah.\nAgain, like again, that is a completely different market, right?\nWe're talking about the big boys going after each other right now.\nBut Lily's Garden survived in the wake of, let's say, the UA war between Royal Match and, you know, another big match three titan, which by the way, Candy Crush continues to like drive crazy downloads.\nSo, I'm just saying like you can survive in this market at different equilibriums.\nSo yes, there are the big boys and yes, there are people there's the whales and the and a little bit of like the minnows that can still exist and make money as a smaller company, but you said that, you know, people like Kavali are coming in and doing UA financing.\nThere's the opportunity for these games to get acquired by one of the bigger companies who then want to invest in a game that has great KPIs are you know rorowaz positive and maybe their goal isn't to do it on their own but is to wave their ham and say by me cuz I have a product that can be scaled is is that like a strategy worth it for some of the smaller ones?\nI mean I think to Phil's point which was astute which is this the new what's working in forex you know it's it's Voltron it's like all of these parts coming together make something bigger.\nIs that in a sense the strategy that we're now seeing in coin battlers showing up is what was successful in Forex.\nThe second part I would say is that yes, like we're seeing a more casual approach to these social casino style games that are attracting a broader audience but also extracting from the existing games like you know all the big fish casino and all those rest of the games are continued to deteriorate right so yes I mean I think in essence like these big guys are capturing not only expanding the market but capturing lots of share in the market at the same time so that's great but it's again a battle of the big, right?\nLike the companies that are gaining all the share are basically, you know, Scopely and Moon Active, right?\nYeah.\nAnd post IDFA, it's it when the market is not growing, when these big ones grow, they actually take it from the small ones.\nAnimals and coins, which was now bought by Blade Tikka, that was a one game.\nThey did what like I I forget, but that was acquired.\nThey are right here number two on this list in terms of downloads in the last year in the United States.\nOkay.\nThe part of the reason I was thinking about this is that Frank Jabbo was on a podcast recently and he it was really Christopher Driggs and so Frank is the most pragmatic person I've ever met.\nLike he's just brilliant.\nAnd what he said and it really resonates with me is that you don't care if it's a red ocean if you're a shark, right?\nAnd that's my whole point, right?\nThere's just a bunch of sharks going after this in a [ __ ] completely red ocean and they are destroying everybody, right?\nLike it's so hard to compete, you know?\nAnd that's why I love like this like battle of the huge, you know, that are going after this market with games that are almost identical to each other.\nAnd it again, it is industrial espionage right in our faces, you know, it's like it's brilliant, right?\nAnd so that's where the market is right now or that's the biggest part of the market.\nSure, people are maybe winning on on the smaller side here and there, but like can you compete with a 24 year payback?\nThat's not a rorowaz that you can actually bank on, you know?\nLike that's crazy.\nI want to just add two comments.\nI think the the art style is beautiful with the latest Moon Active game.\nThat's 100% the art style.\nYes, I I do have to say it is it is really beautiful compared to the previous one.\nIt's really cute.\nAnd then I want to give a kudos for not doing any press releases or celebrity campaigns at least yet.\nIt's in tech testing.\nIt's in the Philippines.\nI I'm not surprised that they do it and I will be equally as dismissive with Moon Active as I was with Scopely and Dream.\nSo, I bet they will not do press releases though.\nThat's one thing that they will not do.\nThey're going to do a brand campaign.\nPaul Lebron\nKardashian, let's go.\nCourtney Cox, Lisa Quudro, you still there?\nOh, we got a game for you, right?\nBut I got to go.\nBye everybody.\nYou did it.\nYou made it to the end of the episode.\nAs a fan of the show, it would help us out if

    "cleanText": "Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out.\nThe Joe Rogan Experience.\nTrain by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day.\nThank you for having me here.\nMy pleasure.\nIt's a joy.\nIt's a joy to have you, sir. I've been having a good time hanging out with you at the club. So, it's been great.\nFeel like we got to do this.\nThis is very Man, I'm trying not to spin out. This is I have watched this on a phone before. This is great.\nWell, it's weird for me that it's weird for people because to me it's still the same thing. It's just sitting down and talking to people. I've gotten so used to it. Even when it's like Trump or Elon or some [ __ ] huge cultural figure, it's still\nYou must have spun out at least one time.\nI spun out a bunch of times in the early days. I still spin out every now and then like uh you know like you like Mel Gibson's on the podcast like oh that's really Mel Gibson. Mike Tyson that's another one. Um, yeah.\nYeah, he was, was this where he said he became erect when he wanted to beat people up?\nThat was in uh California.\nOkay.\nYeah, that was\nIt's a classic It's a classic all-time great moment.\nHe was He was scaring the [ __ ] out of me, man. I spin out when I first got to the club, I was going it was every week I would uh\nIt's weird, right? When I first met James McCann,\nI've seen you you deny the Holocaust. I love you.\nNot really. We should be real clear.\nNo, he was a Nor McDonald under a bridge.\nIt was a Nor McDonald bit.\nHe features in that book a lot.\nWell, Adam's an amazing guy. Yeah.\nHe's the reason he's one of the reasons why I went back to the store.\nWhen I was banned from the store for seven years, Adam came to\nSeven years.\nYeah. Well, I banned myself for seven years. They banned me. They were going to ban me for like a few weeks. I'm like, [ __ ] you. Like, nay.\nWhat did you do?\nThis is the whole Carlos Mia thing.\nThey ban you for that?\nYes.\nYou won the court of public opinion on that.\nWell, not only did I not really get banned, the guy who banned me was eventually fired. He was the manager there. But Mity gave me a spot that night. It's like before they called me to tell me I was banned. Mity was going through a lot of health problems, right? And you know, Mity was I was very close with her. So I called her when the whole Mensia thing happened and I said, \"Listen, this is this guy's been a problem. It's a it's a real issue. People are worried about do doing materially in front of them. It's like this is a giant problem.\"\nAnd you know, I told her the whole thing with the video and she's like, \"All right, well, just keep away from them. What time do you want to go up tonight?\" And I said, \"When do you want me to go up?\" And she said, \"How about 10:30 or whatever it was?\" And I said, \"Thank you.\" Okay. I love you. Bye. We said bye. And then uh like [ __ ] an hour, two hours later, I get a call from this manager telling me that I'm uh banned from the store for two weeks.\nAnd I was like, \"What?\"\nI go, \"For two weeks?\" For for I go, \"Listen to me right now. I'm not coming back.\" I go, \"I'm not coming back. And you're making a decision that's going to [ __ ] this club up because you're choosing to take the side of plagiarism.\"\nYes. over someone who's exposing it.\nLike the the agents won't expose it. They're making a [ __ ] ton of money. And if the comedy store is not going to side with the artists, I'm like, listen, this is the same conversation I had with my agent. I lost my agent too for that.\nI feel like that those are both important moments in a\nlike a everybody seems to have a problem with their agent violent, but also the number of people who've been banned from comedy clubs. I was Brian Simpson has told me about how he got banned for ages when he was homeless. Uh who there was like people were all doing banned from comedy club but he was uh he he had some sort of an issue with someone there and this was like when Brian wasn't Brian Simpson from Netflix, you know, it's like Brian Simpson upand cominging door guy that people go, \"Oh, that guy's funny.\" But like if you get a run a foul with certain things,\nthis is what I'm trying to avoid. I did this in Australia a lot.\nYou ran a foul.\nI was a problem and uh I couldn't work in certain cities for some time just cuz I was I think unpleasant.\nWhat were you doing wrong?\nI you know I started comedy. I would go around telling people that they sucked and they should quit. And I went to like the head of the Melbourne Comedy Festival. I was in I was in the comedy competition. It was like my fourth gig and I was like you're picking all the wrong people to win these. This guy's the better.\nAnd it just Anyway, I'm we grow older. I was also 18 and I was\nYeah.\nUm\nOh, I get it.\nVery No, it's\nYeah. A lot of feuds, a lot of telling people that they sucked.\nWell, when you enter into comedy, you know, a lot of times people treat it weirdly like sports, you know, like they talk [ __ ] playing basketball, so they try to talk [ __ ] doing comedy. It's like it's weird.\nI'm I've gotten better at it. I think I've purged it for but sometimes\nWell, it depends on the environment you're in. If you're envi in an environment where a lot of people are doing that, it's not fun. But this is I find it easy here because people are I don't want to I don't want to say that everyone in Australia is bad at comedy. There are many great comics. But I could not for the life of me like there there were times where it's like oh this could be helpful for your career to get in with someone and have them guide you. And it's like I just hated everybody's comedy that I met and hung out with and people who were great would often leave or not be around.\nAustralia's kind of a different\nWe've got great people out there but low listen you got Jim Jeff. I think you're the funniest guy that's ever come out of Australia. You believe that?\nNo. We have Barry Humphre. I'll never be better.\nOkay.\nYou know Barry Humphre?\nNo.\nThe first\nI think we watched a clip once in the green room. But you know the problem is the green room is so loud and\nYeah. I'll watch the man. He would dress up like a DNA. This is in the 70s. He's conservative man. Dress up like a housewife. Like a very dowy drag act and uh was like super funny. Really broke through in the UK. And then the festival turned their back on him. He started the Melbourne Comedy Festival and then he made some like trans remark and Hannah Gadsby I think was like I'm not taking this award in his name and then the funniest Australian.\nI lose out to Hannah as well. You forget about Hannah. Hannah was a great club act. I tell this to people all the time.\nNo one in No one wants to believe it.\nWell, listen man. It's just she did a different thing. A lot of people got mad at that. But I don't get mad at things that are not for me. It's not it's pointless.\nIt I think it was like a revolutionary act for Americans because you don't have comedy festivals in the same way here. But like\neveryone in Australia was doing the I got raped show or the I wanted to commit suicide show. Really?\nYeah. You show, you know, everyone does an hour. That's the only way you can. There's only five cities. So the comedy festivals are the only way you can really break through and make money. There's five clubs and once you've done two of them, you got nothing.\nSo every you have to have a new hour every year. There was the Oh man, there have been some great I Was Molested shows. Shout out Corey White for one of the greatest I was molested shows ever. Uh who? Dave Quirk had the I had an Affair show. That was great. Uh Dad's Got Cancer. Big show.\nOh no.\nBig show. Mom died when I was young.\nSort of like more like um spoken word thing than you would say standup comedy. You just No one's even People do all the jokes they wrote that year, which gets you to like 35 minutes. Mh.\nThen you tell a 10-minute very sad story about\nAnd then and then I I finished my chicken curry and I thought I'm ready to die.\nAnd then then you bring it back with a gag at the end and\nYeah. I\nAnd that was like standard.\nYeah. It's still going on to this day.\nThere's a lot of that and I could never do it.\nYeah. You're I don't I couldn't imagine you doing that. You're so like funny heavy.\nLike your your comedy is very funny heavy, you know? It feels important for comedy.\nIt's the [ __ ] most important thing.\nIt's fun to get interesting ideas out there. It really is. It's fun to talk about interesting subjects, but it's got to be funny.\nI mean, I when people have a theme, I Colin Quinn does this all the time and it's great. He goes like that.\nOh, yeah.\nGoing to therapy show, Red State, Blue State, History of America in New York is great.\nHe's a genius at it. He's probably the best at it about like telling interesting subject matter, using interesting subject matter, telling you things you didn't know with comedy. He Yeah.\nAnd highlighting the ridiculousness of it all.\nHe was at the club and that was that was crazy.\nHe's great. He's such a\ntime usually like you time is dragging on when people are on stage and you check how long it's gone. Even if it's great and you go,\nI thought we were at the 20-minute mark, it's been six minutes or something. Time just disappears for him.\nReally blew me away is Jimmy Carr.\nYeah. Oh my god, he was so on when he was here. He was doing new stuff.\nI saw him running the new with the pages.\nYeah, with the pages. But the polish, like while he was doing the new stuff, he's so good off the cuff that even if the new stuff was going sideways, he figured out a way to turn it around and would address it and like, oh, he was so good.\nHe just sits and writes apparently.\nHe's an animal. He teaches it, too. He teaches it. He has a program that they actually ran at the mothership for up and cominging comics.\nCan you teach it?\nI'm always wary of that.\nWell, I don't think you could teach comedy necessarily, but I think you could teach you could learn how he does it and you can learn how certain people do it. And I think some of that you can apply.\nUm, and school of comedy, you've got to take a lot of heroin and put your hair right over your face.\nI think you can What you can do though is teach work ethic.\nYeah.\nAnd I think that's half the battle. Half the battle is just sitting down and and actually writing. And know everyone comes up with an excuse. It's like a cold plunge. Everybody comes up with an excuse why they don't want a cold plunge.\nAnd everybody comes up with an excuse why they don't write in front of a computer or on a piece of paper. They always write only on stage.\nWell, I mean doing the same thing over and over again was I for I don't know seven, eight years at the start, I struggled to do it. I had no I had like five bad hours of comedy and it wasn't until I probably impregnated my wife. It was like I should I should make sure there's a good five I should really boil this down to a good five minutes or I'm in real trouble.\nWell, sometimes it's something like that has to happen in your life where you really take it seriously cuz we all know comics that like we started with we're like, \"Oh my god, this guy's going to be huge.\" Yeah. And for whatever reason, they didn't put in the work. They [ __ ] off. They self-sabotaged.\nEvery town you go to, there's the guy who was going to be big.\nI think if we can encourage more people, we can make less of that. And I think we can give more people a chance cuz I I think we all could have been that person who quit.\nYeah.\nAnd I know in the beginning I thought about quit a bunch of times. One of the things that helped me not quit is I tore my ACL.\nOkay. So, uh, I couldn't train or compete anymore. Yeah. Because I was still like kind of on the fence of whether I'd go back to fighting or because I was terrible at comedy. I was I was like good every now and again.\nACL took that away from you. You got one option now.\nI was like, \"Okay, I can't fight anymore. I need to get surgery. Um, I got to take this seriously and I got to really pick one thing.\" And I completely stopped competing. So, that was like a year into comedy. So that was an important thing like it needed a thing where it was like okay I've got no options now like I can't just enter into a kickboxing tournament and say [ __ ] comedy this is too hard.\nYeah.\nAnd it's just there was it was a weird thing. It was like I had to make a complete mind shift from someone who didn't care at all about other people's opinions. Someone who was like I will show you. I will show you. Like I don't give a [ __ ] what you think. I will show you.\nYeah.\nTo I have to get you to like me.\nYeah. I have to be f not just funny with my friends, but I have to figure out how to make these people my friends where I was always very standoffish with new people. It was a weird thing to try to adjust to comedy.\nWell, also if you can't make it work, you have to stop at some point.\nOh, you have to.\nIf you can't make it work, you But I did make it work sometimes. I just had to figure out what what was consistent when I was making it work.\nThat's a real\nYeah.\nI\n\n\nI don't know how I mean so few people get passed at a club.\nI know.\nIt's hard.\nUh, cuz you you have to come back and do it a couple times and see.\nBut I see people have a great, like a one-off great one, and then you go, \"Where did that go?\"\nOh dude, there's a girl that I saw once in 1990.\nNo, 1995 or six.\nThat's what it was.\n1995 or six.\nShe did a set in the belly room, and it was one of the funniest sets I've ever seen in my life.\nIt was like I was watching a female Sam Kenisonson.\nI was like, \"This girl is on fire. Like, this is insane.\"\nAnd then never happened.\nI don't know what happened, you know?\nI don't know.\nPeople just never really get it together.\nThey, they, whatever the [ __ ] they pulled off that time, they can't do again.\nLightning in a bottle.\nOh, but it was in there.\nLike, it's in there.\nThat comedy was in there.\nI was like, if this person with the right encouragement could have been [ __ ] huge, man.\nYeah.\nI remember I saw my friend Amos on that day.\nHis girlfriend broke up with him, and he went and did, he was meant, he was booked for 10.\nHe did like 25.\nUh, he was just heartbroken.\nHe was just complaining about being devastated.\nAnd it was all the things that were wrong with his comedy beforehand were like gone.\nHe was used to be like unpleasant in people's face, and then he was like free and likable and good.\nIt's like, oh, you can't engineer to be broken up with every show.\nYou can't, you can't engineer that, right?\nYou shouldn't.\nWell, that was Kenisonson in the early days, right?\nCurly.\nKenisonson in the early days was all about like how you know, like meeting the devil, and the devil's like, \"Oh, you've been married?\"\nYeah.\nThis is all [ __ ] nudy.\nYou know, this is all old hat to you.\nOh, this is where we torture the souls.\nLike, I never had it.\nOh, you were married twice.\nLike, remember that bit?\nI, I never, the first time I realized that he was a big thing was when that poster went up backstage at the mothership.\nOh, really?\nYeah.\nWe didn't, we didn't get him.\nWow.\nWe didn't get him.\nWe didn't get, uh, I mean, maybe some people got them.\nWe got Ron White cuz he was on Comedy Central.\nSo, I had seen his special like a bunch of times.\nThat's crazy.\nBut in terms of American comics, I didn't get Kenisonson.\nI didn't get, uh, who we got?\nChappelle cuz we got Chappelle shot.\nYou must have got Hicks.\nPeople around me had Hicks, but the, I was late to Hicks because the men who loved Hicks were uh, nuts, right?\nYou know what I mean?\nLike, you go, there's something good here, but it's going to, I'm going to have to come back to it where they...\nWell, he was so good and so unique in the kind of comedy that he did and so smart that it made a bunch of guys try to be like him.\nYes.\nYeah.\nThere's many such cases.\nGuys who are great, but they destroy, dude, there's a lot of little Casey Rockets running around who think they don't have to write anything and...\nOne of the all-time great, I mean, if you, one of the all-time greats is Richard Jenny.\nI mean, he's an all-time great.\nAnd um, when I saw him in like the 1980s, he did a club, I guess I was probably 90, 91 maybe, East Side Comedy Club.\nHe did four different hours.\nAnd the MC wanted to quit comedy after he MCed for him the weekend.\nHe said he did four different hours.\nA different hour on uh, Friday night, first show, different hour, second show, different hour, first show, Saturday night, different, and all of them murdered.\nAnd he said it was insane.\nAnd he goes, \"I wanted to quit comedy.\"\nHe saw Hicks, and he said to me, like we were hanging out together, he was like, \"God, I got, I wish I...\"\nMakes me want to do more of that.\nYou know, I feel like sometimes I'm not doing enough of that.\nLike, wow, that's crazy.\nDo you know Ken Dodd?\nDo you know that?\nHe was a Liverpian comedian, I think, but he would come out and he would do his new hour, and people would like clap and say thank you.\nAnd then he would, he would say, \"Right, I'm going to do the hour I did last time I was in town.\nYou can leave if you want, but I'll do.\"\nAnd the second hour is the hour he did the year before.\nAnd then he'd do the hour that he did the year before that.\nAnd he'd just do hour after hour until the whole, until like if people had enough, they could get up and walk away.\nWow.\nBut he'd be there for like seven hours.\nJesus Christ.\nYou know, he used to staff hated it.\nChappelle used to do that.\nHe used to pull up to the Laugh Factory and do like a 9-hour set.\nYeah.\nHe's still doing it.\nI think, I think him and Dane Cook had like a battle to see like who, who could do the longest set.\nI mean, I saw, I got to go to...\nI don't think Dave was like trying to battle, but I think Dade like took the title.\nShane took me to his, the, the YS Firehouse, the club that Dave has set up in uh, Yell Springs.\nYeah, it was on his birthday.\nAnd he did three hours, and he bombed at his own birthday.\nAnd he kept saying, \"I can't believe I'm bombing at my own club on my birthday.\"\nBut then in the middle, there was a guy with a coat, and he just did maybe 45 minutes about this guy's coat of crowd work on his, just a, it was magical.\nThe whole thing flew.\nHe could release an hour on this guy's coat.\nI think he's recording everything though.\nHe's building a vault.\nI think, I think he's got a Prince vault.\nA Prince vault?\nYeah.\nLike how Prince, I think every second album Prince would just put it away.\nAnd I think he's got, he must have hours in the vault.\nYeah.\nHe's got a whole system for how he creates comedy.\nIt's very unique.\nHe goes on stage, and he has some subjects, and he just [ __ ] around, and he gets a little drunk.\nYeah.\nGets a little high, and he's so funny that some of those things will wind up being bits.\nYes.\nAnd then he takes those bits, and then he, like, he has all of them recorded.\nSo he's just constantly stock, and he goes on stage like almost every night.\nI, there's nothing in my vault.\nEverything I've, I've gotten, I've got like...\nEvery time I go out there, I go, I've got nothing.\nIsn't that a great example?\nLike, not everybody has the option to just go on stage and rant for 3 hours.\nBut isn't it educational to any young comics?\nIt says, \"Okay, who do people consider to be the greatest, greatest comic alive?\"\nMost people would say Dave Chappelle.\nAnd Dave Chappelle is working harder than anybody.\nYes.\nIt's not a coincidence.\nLike he's effortlessly funny.\nYes, for sure.\nBrilliant.\nYes, for sure.\nBut also works every night.\nLike there's something to that, and works every night and does long sets.\nYeah.\nLike every night, like he's always, he's always there.\nHe's always getting better.\nHe's always covering to do it.\nBefore I came to America, I would do like, I would do an hour a month and be very happy with that.\nAnd I thought this was enough to get me where I needed to go.\nAnd uh, no, going every night is, it's also hard to go every night.\nLike you don't, you have a good time once you're out, but then you...\nComedy.\nYou got to avoid that feeling, right?\nSo it's a, it's a mental collapse.\nIt's, you know, familiarity breeds contempt.\nIt's not just in relationships.\nIt's in anything you do.\nYeah.\nAnd that's where you have to reset your mind.\nRight.\nSo like when you start to feel that coming on, like I can't believe I have to do another set.\n[ __ ] I don't want to do a second show.\nYou have to remember what it was like when you had nothing.\nAnd you have to remember what it was like when you would go to open mic night and just you wouldn't on the, weren't on the list.\nYou didn't make the list, but you just wanted to go on stage so bad.\nYou wanted to go on stage so bad, and you wanted to, you're like, I got to figure this thing out.\nYou got to have your Johnny Cash moment sitting backstage at the Falsome Prison looking at the water thinking about your brother.\nYou are about to go do a second soldout show.\nNo, it's silly.\nYou should be so pumped.\nIt's just a familiarity thing.\nIt's just a mind [ __ ].\nBut you can get over mind [ __ ], man.\nYou can get over them if you understand what they are and just recalibrate the way you engage with it.\nFiguring out a way to recalibrate that doesn't kill you in the long run is a good, like I know some...\nWell, you mean cocaine?\nI cocaine.\nPeople get like [ __ ] up or just play a video game all, all week, and then they can get back and do it.\nYou don't have to though.\nYou don't have to do those things.\nI think you got to do something.\nYou got to go for a nice walk.\nI started swimming.\nWe all need to take our health seriously.\nAnd let's face it, while the average modern diet might include some fruits and

nothing.\nAnd I go on stage, and I try and talk about how much I love the pool.\nI got nothing.\nYou might, like three sets where I stand there and go, \"Isn't swimming beautiful?\"\nThen I say nothing, and I wait for something to happen after that, and I go and talk about the next thing.\nWell, it's, you know, one of those exercises that because you're moving against the resistance of the water, it doesn't damage your joints.\nYeah.\nAnd it's like it feels like therapeutic even though it feels like exercise.\nYou can get yourself tired if you want.\nYou can slow it down.\nOh, yeah.\nYou can.\nYeah.\nAnd it's fun.\nI swim with my dog in a lake.\nIn a pool?\nNo, in a pool.\nMe and the dog swim in the pool.\nHe's the, he's the funniest.\nHe's such a great dog.\nI did find your dog Instagram account.\nAre you running the dog Instagram account?\nMy wife runs.\nOkay.\nBut he's um, he's so great that like he won't swim unless you're swimming.\nLike he knows he's not supposed to just randomly jump in the pool cuz then he comes in the house, [ __ ] everything up.\nSo he only allowed to swim when we tell him to swim.\nAnd so he sits there like, \"Are we [ __ ] swimming today?\"\nYeah.\nAnd then he finds out we're swimming.\nLike, \"Oh [ __ ] we're swimming.\"\nAnd he just jumps off the [ __ ] side of the pool.\nCoronated pool.\nSalt pool.\nSalt pool.\nI think it's salt pool.\nIf it's not supposed to be, it's not.\nI can float in that.\nI cannot float in the chlorine pool.\nAnd that brings me great.\nWhy not?\nI, my legs sink down.\nOh,\nI have no bum.\nHave you ever done a float tank?\nNever.\nOh my god.\nWe have...\nI'm afraid of what would be in my brain.\nYou need to find out.\nNo.\nThere.\nDig around that clothes forever.\nRepression is so beautiful.\nJust dig around, dog.\nI've been there for 5 minutes.\nI'll be back.\nJust push it down and get back to work at the factory.\nIt really, I'm a big believer in push it down and keep moving.\nHey, there's something to be said.\nI mean, you explode at some point.\nWell, the opposite is not good, right?\nIf you're constantly dwelling on your problems all the time, that's, that's worse.\nI was someone was...\nI got, I got circumcised at like 32 cuz I had...\nJesus Christ.\nLord's name.\nBut it was a beautiful experience.\nI enjoyed it.\nI had a nice time.\nDid you get a rabbi to suck your dick?\nI thought about it.\nI thought I could leave that in as an option.\nBut also it's fine.\nBy the way, for people, I'm not making a joke.\nThey do suck the, sometimes they have a tube.\nSometimes they have a special tube.\nYeah.\nAnd sometimes they don't.\nNo.\nSometimes they just get the whole, given kids herpes and babies do die from it.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's grim.\nBut circumcision in general, I'm in favor.\nWhy?\nCuz I, I know what it was like before.\nI know what it was like after.\nIt's not a big deal.\nBut there are people, what I'm saying, people make it their whole life.\nOne of one.\nYeah.\nI've experienced both as an adult.\nPeople go, I think most people would not want their dick to be cut for no real reason other than aesthetics.\nAnd people are like, \"Oh, it prevents AIDS.\"\nLike, shut the [ __ ] up.\nI got to go to the AIDS memorial garden in San Francisco.\nYeah.\nDid you show them your new dick?\nUh, well, people definitely would.\nIt's a lot of nooks and cr...\n\n\nAnnes in the AIDS memorial. Like they built the perfect place to have sex with a man in the AIDS.\nSomeone's definitely gotten AIDS at the AIDS memorial garden.\nYou think so?\nAnd they're [ __ ] away and they're going, \"Ah, I knew there was something I was supposed to remember. [ __ ] Now I have AIDS. It was very good. It was a beautiful park. San Francisco was lovely.\"\nHave you ever uh listened to people like um what is that guy's name? The guy that we had on the podcast a long time ago, Peter Dooberg.\nNo.\nIf you want to go down the ultimate rabbit hole,\nwhat was he doing?\nWas he in a park?\nNo. Peter Dooberg doesn't believe that HIV co causes AIDS.\nI've heard about this. It's the treatment.\nPeter Dooberg is uh he's a professional of professor of biology, University of California, Berkeley. Uh tenured and he's done like groundbreaking work on cancer. It's like considered to be a brilliant guy.\nSo in the 80s when all this was going on with AIDS, his assertion was that there was a thing that people were not factoring in is that almost all of the people who developed AIDS Yeah. were hardcore parters, hardcore drug users in the gay community. And no one wanted to address that. And he was saying, \"No, this is destroying their immune system.\" And then HIV shows up. He goes, \"HIV is a weak virus.\" He goes in most people and in what I had read what he said and I don't know if this is true maybe we could find out that babies if they're born they test positive for HIV without any treatment at all are HIV negative within a certain amount of time\nokay\nand so it all sounds nuts right because you go there's no way evidence for that because like African countries you would go healthcare would be bad malnutrition would be\nwell this is the thing are they really testing for HIV when they say these people have AIDS and is there other poss possible factors that could cause this immune thing. And if you're dealing with like it's all coming out of this gay community where there are a lot of partying, there's a lot of drug use, a lot of wild [ __ ] and these guys are burning it at both ends. And when you do that, sometimes you [ __ ] die.\nSometimes your immune system gets crashed.\nNow, clearly I'm not [ __ ] smart enough to know if he's right or if everyone else in the world is right because it's literally that, right? It's like him.\nI want that guy to be right, though.\nWell, there's a bunch of people that agree with him and silently agree with him. There's a bunch of people. It's actually covered in RFK Jr.'s book on Fouchy because it has to do with Fouchy.\nFouchi was in charge then, right? Like he was\nYes. He was the one that was giving people act, right? So ACT was a cancer medication that was killing people quicker than cancer was. It was a chemotherapy. And it not only is it a chemotherapy, this is the only time during the AIDS crisis where a chemotherapy was prescribed permanently because chemotherapy the the the agreement is like I'm going to take this poison that's going to destroy my body but it's going to kill the cancer and then when the cancer is dead I'm going to get healthy again, right?\nYeah.\nNo one gets hooked on chemotherapy.\nYou don't stay on.\nNo one's getting an extra. a super strong one. And you know, there was a lot of people that took ACT when they were asymptomatic. Like they didn't even have any of the symptoms. They just tested positive for HIV.\nAnd this is back when Carrie Mullis, the guy who invented the PCR test, he he's like famously on record saying like this is no way to test for diseases and Fouchy doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's doing.\nAnd it's the same guy that was in charge during the whole CO thing. And you're like that is the craziest conspiracy that HIV doesn't cause AIDS. But what he's saying is HIV is present is is present in people with already compromised immune systems and that this unique factor that they're all hardcore drug users was never taken into consideration.\nWell, they I mean certainly with co they didn't take it into account that fed people and weak people.\nThe thing is you got to look at it from a profitability standpoint. And I know this is super cynical and sounds disgusting,\nbut if you have a actual disease that you can prescribe medication for, that's valuable.\nYes.\nIf you have a bunch of people that are doing something that's super healthy that's killing them and you don't have a solution, that's not valuable.\nWell, they figured it out with fat people. They got the Ompic. I mean, people are just on the Ompic forever, bro. Do you know Ozmpic is like the number one most profitable medication in the country?\nI I believe it. But\nwhat is that true? Did I make that up? I think that's true. They're all doing it.\nSometimes I see things on TikTok and I'm like, is this China?\nAlso, some of them look great.\nOh, yeah.\nI mean, I know people on Empic who are they're spritly. They're bouncing around doing it.\nNo.\nThinking about it?\nNever.\nNo.\nNo.\nNo way.\nI'm a comfortable level of fat.\nIn America, no one has ever called me fat.\nNo.\nIn Australia at this body, all the time.\nReally?\nYeah.\nThey're all [ __ ] healthy over there.\nYou guys got to hike everywhere.\nI think the food is better for sure. I think the food I think I've\nfor sure\nI became lactose intolerant when I came to America. Uh cuz I had raw milk and then I vomited green bile for a couple of days.\nYou ate raw milk here?\nI had like a gallon of raw milk in a day.\nSo raw milk, not um pasteurized, not\nI got it from the farmers market. The guy looked really strong and healthy. I was like, I want that cool rightwing milk.\nGave you lactose intolerance.\nI don't know. I like the milk so much I like to believe it wasn't that. But it was the next day too much of it. I think I got some sort of weird bacteria, but I was Yeah. Oh, green bile. Both ends.\nReally?\nYes.\nLost.\nRight now, you're destroying the raw milk industry single-handed.\nI would like it. Also, it was the most beautiful milk I've ever had.\nYeah.\nI don't want to be negative about raw milk. If you're going to have it and it doesn't do that to you,\nI think you had the raw milk.\nI have.\nIt's like drinking a secret.\nI think raw milk should be like raw meat. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. I know how to cook a steak. Right. You don't You don't tell me how to cook a steak. Let me buy raw milk. Let me buy it.\nYeah.\nIf you let me buy raw meat, let me buy raw milk. Shut the [ __ ] up. Now, are you saying that it's killing people? Okay. Where's your evidence? And is pasteurization and homogenization, which does make it more shelf stable and make it so that you could, you know, you can keep it in the refrigerator for a long time and it's still fine. You know, it has a expired by date.\nYes,\nraw milk goes bad quick. So, should you drink the bad raw milk? No, definitely not. But is there anything limit on how much you should have\nsuper beneficial about drinking the raw milk? Well, there seems to be a lot of evidence as long as it doesn't have bacteria in it. Okay. Well, how do you prevent that? Well, I feel like we can do that. See, this I don't think the solution\ndoesn't feel especially well regulated at the moment. I bought it from a guy's muddy van.\nOh, yeah.\nAnd then as I was vomiting and [ __ ] I was like, this doesn't feel natural.\nYou got to get it from a reputable farmer. But if you get it from a reputable farm, they exist. There's like a whole list where you can find raw milk cuz people are raw milk nuts which is also what turns me off to raw milk. The raw milk I with for about 6 hours I thought I had the greatest insight anybody had ever had. This is the special milk we should all be having it until it started blowing out your body.\nMaybe you just drank too much.\nI did. Everyone else in the family was fine. My wife, my kids, they little bit. They had a little bit. Yeah, you probably drank too much. I mean, if you drank too much of anything, you'll get diarrhea. And think about like how much you're you're dealing with. How much like milk fat and how much liquid you can get diarrhea just from that.\nOverdosed on the milk.\nYeah, that's I wouldn't blame.\nI've never had a milk problem before then on the pasteurized milk.\nSo now you have a milk problem. How so?\nI [ __ ] uh Oh, a big heavy weird.\nSo it gave you lactose intolerance.\nIt hap I liked the milk so much I don't want to blame the milk but I will say it happened at the same time.\nOkay. So is\nBut from then on, are you getting lactose intolerant every time you drink raw milk or regular milk?\nRegular milk. Maybe maybe my body got used to the beautiful raw milk and it would only happen.\nHave a hard time selling that to the wife. We're getting the raw milk back in the house.\nYeah, that might be it, dude. I know that sounds crazy, but that might be it. Like your body might prefer real milk, and now that it knows what real milk Yeah. It's like [ __ ] you with this boiled\nwith the bread. But I think this happened. I mean, something something's happening with the bread in America.\nThat's like my hands feel swollen.\nI don't personally have any problem with homogenized and pasteurized milk. Like when I drink it, it doesn't make me feel bad. I don't feel great, but I I'll will do it if I have like cookies and milk.\nBut\nOh, cookies and milk.\nYeah. But I don't think that you should be able to tell people that they can't sell raw milk. I think you should tell people if you're going to sell raw milk, it has to meet some certain standards. You have to have certain standards of how you cool it, what you're doing, making sure everything's clean, everything has to be inspected. But they do that with other stuff. That's what's USDA standards are definitely put together by big business to crush small people.\nBut they do it that way anyway with meat. This is my point. There's USDA inspections. They have to make sure that the processing place is clean.\nEverything's supposed to be under and then even then they still do the like you know for a like a burger used to be one cow and they'd grind that bit up and now it's like a thousand cows coming together\nright I don't think there's laws against that right I think I don't I think that if you the the cow thing is a weird thing like when and you're getting burgers that have like a thousand cows DNA in it is a weird thing\nbut I mean it is just me right it's\nI think those standards are put there by the big corporate like I I was thinking about uh like housing zones and districting like in Australia the median house price is a million dollars. It's you just you can't buy no one in my generation is buying a home. It's a we there's so much land. There's a lot of stuff. You should just be able to like whip up a slum with the with your bros. You go to a valley where no one is. You all live in a that would be better to some extent rather than like renting in a horrible thing forever. You go used to be able to just like build a horrible thing. You know, there was no building regulations. Sometimes the ceiling would collapse and people would die. But\nso you think that's better to have no regulations?\nI Yeah.\nReally?\nYes.\nBut that's how like stadiums collapse on people in third world countries.\nNo doubt bad things will also happen.\nNo, that's a dumb idea.\nI I'm not saying no regulation. All right. I'm going to walk back. No regulation. But it would be nice if the regulation was somehow written just with the safety in mind and not so that I mean there are insane like there are buildings up now that are perfectly safe that wouldn't pass code if they were built today. You couldn't build them again. Now,\nwhy wouldn't they pass code?\nCuz they do things like, you know, the door has to be this far away from the stairs, the ceiling has to be this height, that it needs eight fire beeping detectors.\nYeah.\nIn the same way that, you know, like you can't cut hair without getting a degree. You need like a certificate to be a hairdresser. And they go, \"This is to make hair cutting safer.\" But like people were cutting hair without\nAll right, folks.

I think we should go back to the houses.\n\nAll right, go ahead.\n\nLike, if you want to save lives, you want houses that you can escape in the case of a fire. And if you don't absolutely if you don't hold the builder accountable, the person who's making that house, even if they're making it for themselves, they will then sell that house to someone else most likely, and that person will not be in a house that's necessarily the safest it could be. It just makes sense.\n\nIt would result in big problems.\n\nYeah, it makes sense for it. But it makes sense. No, no, no, no, no. It makes you. You have to be. Listen, when I was a kid, I grew up in construction sites. My father was an architect. My stepdad was an architect. So, when I was real young, I got to see like real shitty construction, how dangerous it is when people like [ __ ] around, don't follow code. Yes. What? How many like shady guys do a bad job? How many people try to like use lesser materials than they're supposed to be used? It's constant. And if you don't have regulation, you put people's lives at stake.\n\nI don't think America has the same problem with regulation here because you guys seem to be able to build houses like houses.\n\nWell, we have a lot of regulations though. Like that's giant contention with people.\n\nThere's a way to do it in a way that is just to help industry make house prices stay high. Well, that's true, too. Both things can be true. I think there there's definitely people that take advantage of regulation and there's definitely people that most likely stifle other businesses growth through promotion of regulation. That's probably true, too.\n\nBut also like for some stuff like for safety stuff in homes, you [ __ ] need regulation because if you sell it to my mom and she doesn't know how anything works and then the house catches on fire cuz Yeah. It's just do it the right way. They know how to do it the right way. People have established a system. Now, there's a bunch of [ __ ] that's arbitrary that gets aesthetic and I'm not in favor of that when people get to decide what, you know, the front of your house should look like or what color you paint it.\n\nI mean, you can make something safer forever though and there's no limit. There's no like there's no zero that you can reach of safety. Yeah.\n\nAnd there comes a point where the effort goes up to the extent where it's not.\n\nNo, but you hit a reasonable level and then you stop. And that's what the regulations say.\n\nWe never stop. I mean, I think with driver's licenses, you should have some uh test for competency to drive a car.\n\n100%.\n\nIt should be something. But when I mean in Australia when I was trying to get I didn't get my license till I was like 27 cuz it took forever. Like you got to get a 100 hours registered. You got to do a weird test. I got a driver's license in Ohio where I don't think road fatalities are that much higher than the rest of the\n\nWell, and you know, you get in the car, you drive around the block, the guy goes, you know how to operate this vehicle. We're going to say it's not going to cost, you know, $1,000 and yeah, it's more straightforward. There's like there's a balance to be gotten to be gotten right and\n\n100%. I think you're 100% right.\n\nI relish in America that you're closer to the freedom side of things.\n\n100% definitely much more than Australia is. And you got to see that during the pandemic, too.\n\nBut the the thing is like there's a difference between overregulation and wild west, right? There's like a fine line. There's like a there's a comfortable middle and I think that middle has to be fought for because I think it really is important to have people that are actually experts that their job is to make sure that someone builds a house correctly go and look and make sure you do. But then again, you open the door, the possibility that that inspector guy is a douchebag and then he's got a chip on his shoulder and he's got a big [ __ ] ego and people bribe him and you know, there's there's always a possibility of that kind of stuff happening too, where people love to have control over people. They love to tell you you can't build. They love to tell you you got to repaint your house because it's the the the color doesn't match our community.\n\nHow do you check that? How do you like what is the other than like everyone having a gun and getting ready to a simmering level of violence and revolution?\n\nYou got to fight back before they ever get to that point. It's real hard to regain ground once someone takes ground with like ridiculous legislation. Like look, they've been trying to legalize weed in this country for [ __ ] 50 years and it's they barely put a dent in it.\n\nThey've only done a state level.\n\nThey've only done it on a state level. But the point is it's like once you lose rights, you know, like if they tried to if marijuana was legal just like alcohol and all a sudden they tried to make it illegal, people would riot in the streets like what are you doing? You can't do that because it wouldn't make sense. People would be furious. But once it's done, even if it's the same exact situation, the same exact data, the same exact safety profile, the same exact number of people using it in the country. Yeah. It's just it's been it's been [ __ ] because it got put into this weird position.\n\nBut you guys you got prohibition somehow. You got alcohol taken off the streets for\n\nYeah. But it was it was bad.\n\nBad and it lasted a long time and it led directly into marijuana prohibition.\n\nYeah.\n\nSame exact people.\n\nBut you just need to find something to have prohibition against.\n\nHow about cartel prohibition? How about that? You know, how about fentanyl?\n\nDon't stop thinking about things. But then you you find out like, \"Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's a lot tied to this. It's like the alcohol lobby doesn't want marijuana to be legalized. So, they fight against it and they get politicians that are on their side. Hey, Ralph, you're going to vote for this issue on our side, right?\n\nThere's no way Ralph came over.\n\nRalph\n\nRalph Nader.\n\nNo, no, no. Not that guy. He doesn't do that. But, you know, that's that's part of the problem too, man. It's like there's a lot of money involved in keeping it illegal and like Jesus Christ.\n\nBut, at least you can have I think America is one of the only countries that primaries. You can actually like get into a political party and if there's enough will, you can do something. You can like change.\n\nThey wouldn't even allow it for the Democrats.\n\nThe primary\n\nfor the last election there was not even on presidential level they're more uptight. But on like\n\nwhat does that mean? What does that mean?\n\nThey got the superdelegates and they got secret emails and it's not good. But the fact that you could even have a system to [ __ ] up is I think unique to like in Britain the party picks who the person is. And if you're in the party, you get a huge benefit.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nThat you can't have like a grassroot. You can't have like the branch of the party go we're putting forward a guy who's we're going to primary somebody.\n\nYou really can primary people in America.\n\nYes, you can sort of. But not for president. Not not last time.\n\nAnd they they don't let certain people in the primaries like they're keeping RFK Jr. out of the primaries.\n\nYes. And then running as an independent is very bad.\n\nBut that's not good.\n\nI'm not saying you're living up to it. I'm not saying you're living up to the standards you set, but you're also the only ones who there's even like people go, we should be able to do it.\n\nPeople wanted Trump to lose so badly. They were willing to throw democracy out the window.\n\nThat's kind of what it is. I mean, kind of what it is.\n\nIf you if that was coming from the Republican side, people would have been outraged.\n\nTo do it in the name of democracy was very weird.\n\nWild. And then also I remember one of the\n\nso Orwellian\n\nso like my first week here there was a Biden speech where he was talking about how like violence has no he was like hopping on about January 6 and stuff and he was saying violence has no place in the American system but then the example he gave was the American revolution like I think that gets for you're meant to have I think Benjamin Franklin wanted everyone having an armed uprising every like 12 years or something to wipe the slate clean.\n\nYou're meant to that's part of democracy. Ah do you know about Castro?\n\nWhat about him? I've just I've I'm in a big Wikipedia wormhole about Castro. I didn't know that he hid that he was a communist until he he wasn't a communist or he kept that quiet. He was like a middle class revolutionary and then uh his brother was a commie but he was like he didn't come out and say he was a communist until later and the CIA helped him. I've been reading Castro speech helped him take over.\n\nIt looks like the CIA might have been and then towards the end they said we got to get out of this. This is no good. They really they changed horses.\n\nJesus Christ. They were really involved on both sides, but they were uh\n\nDo we do that everywhere?\n\nThere's one Aussie there's one Aussie that you might have done. Uh Goff Whitlam might have been taken out by the CIA.\n\nJeez.\n\nNo, he was uh he was also a problem and people were quite happy to have him go, but the governor general, man,\n\nbro,\n\nI don't have to go into too much detail is look it up Pine Gap. you have a military base in Australia and he wanted to like get rid of it or get off American energy subsidies or something and then all of a sudden he was removed.\n\nOh boy.\n\nAnd we haven't rocked that boat again.\n\nWe are so good at that.\n\nYeah.\n\nBetween us and the Israelis. The Israelis do the wildest assassinations. Like did you see the one of them that they did with the Iranian generals?\n\nLet's see. Make sure that this is true. Jamie,\n\nI can get my visa removed for criticizing Israel.\n\nNo, no, no. It's this is a this is not I'm impressed by their beautiful assassination.\n\nThis is not a this is not a criticism. This is saying like this is one of the most gangster things I've ever seen in my life. They made a fake phone call to all these military leaders and said everybody's got to meet at the bunker and then they blew the bunker up.\n\nThat's very Godfather.\n\nThey know what they're doing.\n\nIt's gangster as [ __ ] And then you add that to the pagers.\n\nThey they sent pagers out like didn't they send them out like a long time in advance?\n\nYeah, I think so. And they got in on the supply side of it. Like they made the pages and they managed to\n\nI mean you think about how incompetent some forms of our government are.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then how good they are at killing people that they want dead.\n\nThey could do that with holes in the Midwest. That would be great. We could move people out of the CIA.\n\nSame level of Well, that's not CIA. That's the MSAD. But that's the same level of int or the IDF or whoever does it over in Israel. But the same level of intensity with other things. You could dominate the world.\n\nI mean, we could get a train going an actual fix highspeed rail in Texas. I believe in it.\n\nImagine if they took that same kind of ingenuity and tried to fix poverty in America.\n\nBrian Simpson had said a good he was on stage for bottom of the barrel and he knocked like someone knocked the barrel over and they all had to pick it up and he goes, \"That's the one thing that could go wrong. We should really fix that. We're never going to. It's like America. We have the resources to make sure that never happens and we won't.\"\n\nYeah. No, we won't. But it's we put all of our effort into making [ __ ] that kills people quicker. That's like the most amount of money, the most amount of effort other than like consumer goods.\n\nI would I would say also sport is it at some weird very high level here because that's war.\n\nIt is. It is a very militarized society. Everyone's getting ready to\n\nYeah.\n\nI Yeah. I mean, football is just military strategy.\n\nHave you ever seen Serbians play basketball? Uh, yes,\n\nbro.\n\nYeah, I've seen clips of that.\n\nI've seen Crips clips together Serbian crowds play basketball.\n\nThey're big.\n\nIf that [ __ ] doesn't feel like war, the way the crowd is responding, the cheering, the [ __ ] enthusiasm, like, dude, I watch it all the time just for inspiration.\n\nThey're also the only guys other than black guys who can compete in. It's the only whites who are contributing to basketball at this point is the Yugoslavian.\n\nYeah. The giant whites from a warlike culture.\n\nYeah. No one else. Sometimes an Aussie gets through. We've had like two Aussies break through.\n\nBro, Serbian fighters are terrifying.\n\nThe dudes from like the Caucus region, like all the guys from like Dagistan for Georgia animals.\n\nThey couldn't get it to work, dude. Someone just printed something or posted something about the UFC's top pound-for-pound list and six of them are from the Caucus region.\n\nSix of them.\n\nThat seems high. But there's also sometimes that's like a genetic like all the like marathon runners tend to be from one mountain in Kenya. There's like the elite of the elite.\n\nYeah. Like people go black people are good at marathon running. But then when you boil it down it's like okay but 90% of them are from Kenya and then 90% of those people are from one mountain in Kenya where like the air is very thin.\n\nOh. So they've adapted.\n\nThere's a book called Taboo which is about race difference in the in like all sports.\n\nUhhuh. and they break and they're like you're this likely to you know you can't be a white corner now there is one I think but like rare that there are it's very rare and it's very strange and some of it's social stuff but a lot of it is uh like I was reading a thing about\n\n\nMexicans can't get knocked out.\nThat's not true.\nNo, there must be some, but there's like some gene that is very common in the Mexican population that makes it less likely that you'll be knocked out.\nWhat, really?\nI think that's why they have lots of boxes.\nAm I... I'm... I'm half remembering something I read on Wikipedia late at night.\nWouldn't that be crazy if they have such a history of boxing that boxing has somehow or another gotten into their genes to have strong chins?\nWhat came first?\nYeah, right.\nThe chicken or the egg.\nAm I right?\nAny connection between Mexican men, the specific gene ACTN3?\nSaw a video on how Mexicans are so good at boxing.\nMexico's produced 209 champions.\nThat's pretty incredible.\nVideo explains how Mexicans supposedly have a gene that has the ACTN3, which determines endurance and/or strength, one or the other.\nI was wondering, is there any truth to this?\nWhat's the answer?\nThis is about what I need to believe something is a Reddit post from four years ago.\nNo, if you... if you look down there, is this just one person's post?\nDid someone answer them?\nWell, I didn't want to get into the answers because you never know.\nThat's where, like, his point.\nYou never know where this goes, right?\nI was just going to start there and then start.\nLet's find out if there's... Yeah, anything to that.\nIt's fascinating.\nBut I would wonder because if, like, you think about, like, a history of boxing.\nYeah.\nBoy, Mexico has such a history of boxing.\nAnd also, there's a high level of poverty.\nSo whenever there's a high level of poverty, there's a lot of sports where you don't need a lot of money to play them.\nSoccer's one.\nBoxing is another one.\nYou just need gloves and you could just [ __ ] around and guys be good.\nIf I'm... so there's... I was doing a bit about this, and I could never get it to, like, really fly, but like Kyrgyzstan, they have a wife wrestling.\nYou wrestle a woman into a van.\nIf you want to marry a woman in Kyrgyzstan, you like...\ntoday...\nyeah, they call it Alaku.\nAlaku.\nAnd there's a big Wikipedia page on that.\nYou got to get this lady in the van against her will, and then once she gets in the van, she's so ashamed that she marries you.\nBut like, the one sport they're good at at the Olympics is women's freestyle wrestling.\nThey're great at that.\nSo what came first, the medals or a van?\nDid they have to get good at wrestling 'cause men kept putting them in vans?\nOr were they so good at wrestling the men were like, \"Let's let them show off their beautiful skills?\"\nThat's a really good question.\nI would imagine they were fending off men for a long time, so they had to develop technique.\nI assume it was a horse before it was a van.\nJesus.\nYou can wrestle because they only got the van quite late.\nThere's no way.\nAnyway, that's one day I'm going to make that fly.\nIf it's a part of your culture, I would, you know, Jesus.\nYes.\nBride kidnapping.\nJesus Christ.\nYeah, there's a lot of vice.\nUh, we are breaking the law, says Mediev.\nBut everyone understands the tradition and you can't change it.\nWow.\nMember of a local government, a small village outside of Kirr's capital.\nHow do you say that?\nBishquek.\nBishkek.\nYou think?\nI guess it's as good as mine.\nBut everyone here understands is a tradition and you can't change it.\nOh, okay.\nMedivh kidnapped his wife Elmyra more than 10 years ago.\nHe's one of many Kirrs men who have gotten married through the Central Asian practice of bride kidnapping.\nAnd they go like 80% of the time, it's consensual, like they organize, but then 20% of the time, you're just wrestling a woman into a van against their will.\nSo there are consensual kidnappings where two people know each other and it's kind of roleplaying.\nThen there's full-on off-the-street abductions.\nUnfortunately, they both look the same.\nYou really want a safe word for them.\nWhoa.\nIt could be hard to tell if the girl you see crying for her mom and clawing at the faces of her abductors is merely acting out her part for her boyfriend and his family's sake or is actually on her way to being married against her will.\nLike, what the [ __ ]?\nVery important to be able to tell the difference.\nI would say I don't want to pass judgment on the people of Kyrgyzstan.\nThis is the thing about the world.\nIf you go back like 6,000, 7,000 years ago, it was all like that.\nYou can go back to a hundred years ago and everyone... they were footbinding in China.\nThey were having beautiful...\nstill doing it.\nDidn't they... can't still be binding the feet?\nPhotos of it.\nThey still footbinding in China.\nI mean, I don't know how widely practiced it is.\nThey're older ladies.\nYeah.\nI know when they stopped, but I don't think it was that long ago.\nLike, there's people that are alive right now that have those feet.\nWell, I'm for it.\nYou don't want some filthy peasant foot on your wife.\nYou want a humble, graceful...\nbro.\nYou better keep those socks on.\nThey do.\nI was reading about those.\nThose feet are weird.\nThey are.\nThey look like they're folded in on themselves.\nIt's so painful to walk.\nSo I think it's Cameroon, they do chest bind, like they... they flatten a woman's... when she starts getting breasts, they, like, you flatten the breast.\nBut what's weird is that it's the Christian progressive people who are doing it because the culture is once a woman has breasts, she has to get married and she has to come out of school.\nSo because you love your daughter, you iron the boobs down so that she doesn't have to get married for a couple years.\nIsn't that funny?\nJesus Christ.\nThey should put an end to it.\nUm, last shoe factory making Lotus shoes closed in 1999.\nWow.\nIt could be some Michael Jordan lotus shoes.\nLotus shoes.\nOh my god.\nSo, when did this start?\n1200s or something like...\nWow.\nThe 1200s.\nOh, we got... Look at that lady's foot.\nLook at that lady's foot.\nLook at that.\nThat is so crazy.\nI just see... I just see beauty.\nI just see...\nI see painful pinky toes.\nHow is that lady ever going to take, like, an aerobics class?\nLook.\nLook how it's become part of the bottom of her foot.\nThat's so crazy.\nHow badly does that [ __ ] with your back?\nIt's so big on that screen.\nI'd never seen them that big before.\nBro, those feet are busted up.\nBut the commies stamped it out mostly.\nThe commies got rid...\nNo, you got to be...\nYeah, you can't partake in the great glorious revolution.\nOh, the Lotus shoe.\nThey are beautiful shoes.\nThat's so crazy.\nYou can't buy them.\nStraight to shopping.\nYou never know.\nIs that the same thing?\nNo, that's a brand name.\nThat's a brand name.\nYou walk into your house, it's all OJ Simpson merchandise and footband Lotus shoes.\nActually, is pretty good.\nThat's hilarious.\nWhat a [ __ ] up practice.\nYeah, there's a lot of them.\nYeah.\nWhat about the one where women put plates in their lips?\nOh, plates in the lip.\nThe neck extension.\nMhm.\nI love the ring neck extension.\nThe ring neck extensions don't even make sense.\nLike, how does that work?\nLike, if you take it off, will your head fall off?\nLike, do you have any muscles left?\nDo you have any muscles left to support your head?\nI would doubt it.\nLike, do you have to keep that on for the rest of your life?\nI don't think they're meant to be that long.\nNo, I think... Bro, that's [ __ ] insane.\nThat's insane.\nJust one guy saw a giraffe and he was like, \"Can we do that?\"\nSo in... Is that a Photoshop?\nIs that Photoshop?\nIt's the same person in multiple...\nThat's really legit.\nBut there's a young lady doing a photo.\nThat can't be real.\nThat can't be real.\nThat lady's head is 15.\nThat's like... That last one's like AI porno for neck guys, bro.\nThat's so dark.\nThat's so weird.\nLike, I don't like that at all.\nYeah.\nVideo of it.\nSo...\nOh, don't show me.\nOh, they just keep piling those things on and fitting them.\nYeah.\nWhat a... what a weird thing to do to your neck, man.\nThat's got...\nBut we do weird stuff.\nWe inject lips.\nBut, bro, that's crazy.\nShe's got a towel under her chin, but they could be watching it being like, you know, in America, they chop off a little boy's penis and they turn it into a pretend vagina.\nIsn't that sick and wrong?\nWell, they probably do that there, too.\nAnd I would agree with them.\nThat's a very important part of our culture.\nI wonder if they do do it.\nYou know, I... I... someone in the green room was saying the other day the reason why there's so many lady boys in Thailand was because being homosexual was illegal.\nIs that true?\nIt wasn't illegal everywhere.\nBut like this person that said it is just... they said it in passing.\nI don't know if it was true, and I was... I meant to Google it and I totally forgot until now.\nI mean, it could be...\nI'm pretty sure it was illegal all over the place and no one else was doing that.\nNo one else had that particular reaction.\nWell, you know, that's the... the thing about um... um... what is that [ __ ]?\nTuring.\nAlan Turing.\nYeah.\nAllan Turing was the guy who invented the Turing test.\nAnd he was gay and they...\nYeah.\nAnd they [ __ ] poisoned him.\nThey gave him, like, hormone blockers.\nWas it just 'cause he was gay?\nYes.\nThere were so many gay British guys, though, who they had, like, a long history of, like, Oscar Wilde.\nEveryone knew he was gay.\nAnd it was only when he went after a guy's son that I think they went...\nOh, yeah.\nI think he went after a guy's young son.\nWell, they could always target you for it, though.\nIf they want to get you for something else, they will.\nYeah, they use that.\nBut I think Byron was off.\nBut he was like hospitalized.\nLegality of samesex activity.\nPrivate adult consensual and non-commercial sodomy was decriminalized in Thailand in 1956.\nHowever, samesex attraction and transgender identities were still seen as socially unacceptable in many cases.\nThose with gender expression or behavior falls out of social norms are less likely to be tolerated or accepted.\nSo what happened?\nJust this year, they've allowed samesex marriage.\nAnd uh...\nthey've allowed adoption from this year, but uh, that's very late to it because I think a lot of gay couples have been going there to get children for a long time, and now they're saying you can have them here.\nLike, that's a big... that's not spoken about is the... the renter womb and the...\nit's kind of bizarre.\nI'm against it.\nIt's very strange.\nThe idea of a surrogate is very odd.\nLike, you're having a baby, but it's not really you having the baby.\nLike, okay, I get it.\nIf someone can have a baby, the couple wants to have a baby, they hire a surrogate.\nI get it.\nIt's your genes.\nIt's your baby, but it's still... it's like...\nbut also there's... I mean, I know Elon has, like, a lot of kids with different ladies, but then I mean, that's the public one.\nHe's like a... a one of the only public-facing billionaires.\nThere's got to be guys out there who are like, \"I'm getting... I'm getting 10,000 kids.\nI'm like, take my [ __ ] and move it out across.\nI'm going to be Genghis Khan with science.\"\nWell, guys have done that that are doctors.\nThey just put their own [ __ ]... there's a breakout case in one of those.\nThere's a guy who's... there's maybe a thousand siblings in Adelaide, my hometown.\nOh, man.\nIt's every time guys get a chance, they do it.\nSurrogacy has a long history dating back to ancient times with the real examples found in Babylon and the Bible.\nWhile traditionally involved natural conception, modern surrogacy, including artificial insemination and invitro fertilization, has been developed through scientific and legal advancements.\nOkay, but the thing is, it's like they're just playing with words.\nHold on.\nLet's go back because they're saying surrogacy for someone having sex with someone and getting them pregnant and having a baby.\nThat's not surrogacy.\nYou got a pregnant with...\nthat's a mistress.\nYou... Yeah.\nYou... you got another lady pregnant.\nThat's all that is.\nSo what we think of as surrogacy is you taking an embryo and inserting it into another woman's womb, right?\nYeah.\nThat's a completely new thing.\nAnd I think it's weird.\nIt's common in, like, wives of soldiers.\nThe other one's like an agreement.\nLike, if the wife can't get pregnant, but she wants to have a baby and she says, \"Listen, if you [ __ ] my best friend, she'll have the baby and then we'll... we'll take care of the baby.\"\nYeah.\nAnd I know that I can't have babies, but you... you know, if that's... if you guys were that kind of swingers and you're down with that, and that's... that's up to you.\nThat feels different from the science.\nIt's not surrogacy.\nYou just had a baby with a different human.\nNo, surrogacy seems right... bad and wrong.\nI'm... I'm... I'm digging in.\nWell, bro, it's going to go to artificial wombs.\nAll right, that's going to be the new one.\nAnd whether that's 20 years from now or 50 years from now, you're going to be able to make a baby outside of a human body.\nIt's going to get real freaky.\nWe got to be... We got to draw a hotline.\nWe pulled this up.\nI was... The IVF thing gave me a weird thought.\nI'm a little stone thought.\nIt's not possible how Jesus was born, was it?\nThey didn't have any sort of way to show fertilization back then.\nIVF just, like, forgot about it.\nCould be.\nCould be that they had that technique.\nTammy was the Holy Spirit.\nI'm just... I... I know what they say.\nI'm just...\nBut like...\nYeah.\nWell, devil's advocate, obviously, but...\nWell, for sure they could have um... inserted sperm into her without her ever having sex.\nThey could have impregnated her.\nI think there's like...\n\n\nDolphins that can do it.\nIf dolphins are on their own for a long time, then an egg can fertilize another egg.\nWhat?\nIt doesn't happen often, but there are examples of it.\nReally?\nYes.\nThat's nuts.\nI think I believe that I've read that.\nYou sure?\nI've said that loudly and confidently at a party before.\nMammals.\nIt might have been.\nThat sounds so crazy that a mammal could do that.\nDolphins don't lay egg.\nOh, inside.\nI guess inside of them.\nThey can.\nI'd be so happy if I was right.\nI think it's like a couple examples of auto insemination.\nSo, it's like one of the eggs has so much jizz in it that it leaks out.\nYou get a very butch egg.\nYou get a trans egg.\nYou get maybe one of the eggs is male and it just jizzes on the other egg.\nYou know, it's an early developer.\nYeah, just like comes out of maybe jizz is like in some of them out of the box.\nI think there's virgin birth in nature.\nIt's not common.\nDefinitely animals switch genders that the animals like especially like primitive reptilian type [ __ ] weird animals.\nYeah, they can there's certain animals that can switch their genders.\nI think seahorse ladies have a penis.\nI think so.\nAm I getting that?\nYou know hyenas have a penis.\nFemales?\nNo, I didn't know that.\nBigger than the males just for show.\nJust No, they dominate the males that they're bigger than they peg the males with their female hyenas.\nThey're one of the rare matriarchal mammals.\nSo, the females are bigger than the males.\nThey have more testosterone than the males and they have bigger dicks and they hold the males down.\nYeah.\nYou want some of this [ __ ] And then the male has to take his little dick and stick it inside of her big dick.\nWell, but the big lady dick just slapping against his belly.\nYeah.\nHey, you want to hear even worse?\n60% of all hyenas that are born suffocate to death during childbirth coming out of that dick.\nCuz they're coming out of They come out of the dick.\nThe vagina's on the tip of the dick.\nNo, it's it's really a vagina.\nIt's a vagina, but it's like a Can we see the hyena?\nOh, it's it's bananas.\nIt's bananas.\nI want to cuz I It's called They call it like a faux penis.\nNow, I think last time Shane came on here, I think you guys were talking about the trans penises, and then he just kept texting me the trans penises.\nOh, he's horrible at that.\nHe's horrible.\nJust wake up in the middle of the night to trans skin graph scars.\nYou're like, what am I looking at?\nWhy is it so much bigger than mine?\nWhy can't you have a humble penis?\nI've got to see.\nWow.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nSo, female hyenas have this giant fake dick and um Ah, yeah.\nIt's huge.\nThey have to put their penis the the boys have to put their dicks in Exactly.\nAnd that's how the the babies come out of that.\nAnd a lot of the babies die on the way out.\nDestroy all the hyenas.\n60% I think.\nI think that's the number.\nLet's make sure that that's the correct number.\nI'm pretty sure it is.\nI think it's the hyena people will be furious if they 60% suffocate during childbirth.\nAnd then on top of that, like then they fight over who gets the nipple.\nAnd some of them get killed.\nWell, that's why they're so unhappy all the time in the Lion King.\nThey're just in the most ruthless environment and they're not the biggest animals.\n18% mortality first time mother.\nThat's the mother dying.\nOh, 9 to 18% the mother dies.\nJesus Christ.\nThat's crazy.\nGot eyes out.\nCould you imagine 80% of the women dying because they they're giving birth?\nYeah.\n60% of all spotted hyena cubs uh die in the early stages of life, especially from the first litter.\nSome scientific observations place the survival rate of firstborn cubs at around 40% or less.\nWow.\nSo, siblide is huge.\nMhm.\nSiblide's very huge.\nThey they fight to the death over like little nipples and like stepdads I know come will in the animal kingdom.\nWell, that's also why female hyenas I think are bigger.\nI think they're going to protect.\nYeah, I think they're there to because the men hyenas are [ __ ] and the men probably eat the babies because that happens in other commun like that happens in bears.\nIn the bear world, female tigers or female bears rather.\nThe reason why when you stumble upon a female bear, she's ready to [ __ ] you up.\nLike that's the worst thing that can happen in the woods, you stumble upon a female bear with their cubs, you're in real trouble.\nIf you stumble upon a male and you let go, he might he might not have any interest in you at all.\nBut if you stumble, if you're too close to the Cubs, if like she is in front and the Cubs are behind and you're behind them, you run away.\nNo, bro.\nYou might not have the time.\nShe might just come for you and you can't do a goddamn thing about it because she's dealing with male grizzlies eating her cubs all the time.\nSo, she's always on 10.\nI mean, if we go to Yuseite, should we bring a gun?\nYou shouldn't go off trail for sure.\nYou shouldn't go off trail.\nYou should definitely bring bear spray if you're anybody.\nYoseite is in California, right?\nI've [ __ ] this up before.\nYellowstone has the grizzlies.\nWyoming.\nYoseite has the black bears.\nBlack bears generally aren't as dangerous as grizzly bears.\nAre they grizzly bears in California?\nNo, there's not.\nEven though it's the flag, the state flag.\nIt's the bear on the flag.\nThe flag misled me.\nWell, they killed um too many people and they they killed them all.\nBut they've got coyotes still running around.\nCoyotes don't really kill people though.\nThey kill your cats and dogs.\nMountain lines occasionally kill people, but grizzlies were killing a lot of people.\nI feel like you guys have way more animals that kill people than we do.\nOh yeah, for sure.\nPeople talk about our animals all the time.\nWe got a snake and we've got a spider that you want to watch out for.\nYou got saltwater crocodiles, [ __ ] Yeah, but if you stay away from the crocs, what are you talking about?\nYou just just keep away from far north Queensland.\nBut they are are Yeah.\nBut you So you have to avoid a whole part of your country because it's infested by monsters.\nWe were happy to give that one up to the Japanese.\nWe made a deal that if the Japanese invaded, we'd let them have the saltwater crocodile part of the country.\nHave you seen uh is Bob Kata?\nThis is like our best clip from a politician.\nHe's talking about gay marriage and he turns it into talking about crocodiles.\nNo.\nOh, Bob Kata crocodile.\nThis is my favorite.\nHe he wins his far north Queensland seat every year.\nHe's not in any party, but he's like I'm Yeah.\nLet let a thousand blossoms bloom.\nOh yeah.\nLet me hear it.\nI mean, you know, people are entitled to their sexual proclivities, you know.\nI mean, let there be a thousand blossoms bloom as far as I'm concerned, you know.\nBut I ain't spending any time on it because in the meantime, every 3 months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland.\nHe's the man.\nHe needs more power in our government.\nEvery three person is torn apart by a crocodile in North Queensland.\nIs that true?\nI believe it.\nJesus Christ.\nWell, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of people.\nThere's a lot of every imagine this.\nYeah.\nWhat if every 3 months someone got killed by a werewolf?\nWould you still go out at night?\nYeah.\nYes, I would.\nEvery 3 months someone gets killed by a werewolf in your town.\nI mean, how many people are dying on the roads every day?\nI understand, but there's something uniquely terrified about getting eaten.\nThe Crocs never got Steve Owen.\nThat was the That was the raise.\nI'm more upset by the rays.\nWell, how to handle the Crocs.\nWhat's that?\nFour deaths since 2020 and nine non-fatal attacks.\nOh, it's [ __ ] Well, that's No, it's still getting You just didn't die.\nYou got ripped apart, though.\nNine.\nYeah, but that's not three.\nThat's not like what he was saying.\nHe saying come down.\nHe was bad.\nWhat was his number that he was having?\nHe said three a month.\nDid what did he say?\nThree months.\nAlso seven years.\nEvery 3 months.\nEvery three months.\nOh, every three months.\nWe might have clamped down on it.\nThat's only four a year.\nYeah.\nBut also there's, you know, you're not walking through the city.\nYou're not walking through the city and going the crocs are going to come and get you.\nYeah.\nBut if you go anywhere near a lake and you make the wrong kind of vibrations.\nYeah.\nThey they were very I went to cans once and they were all very scared.\nThey come out so quick.\nThey come out so quick, dude.\nBut also, what a beautiful way to die if you have to die.\nNot beautiful at all.\nNope.\nNope.\nHe was eaten by reptilian evil.\nThe last moments of your life will be horrible energy that you will pass on to the cosmos.\nYou will die in the most horrific way possible.\nIt's not that.\nThey all fit on two pieces of paper.\nYeah.\nWell, he's over.\nHe's over.\nThese are all the people that have been killed.\nCans cans.\nBoth.\nCape York.\nCape York.\nThat's up north.\nSo, there's a lot of non fatals in there where dudes very few people here.\nNo one, you know, we don't have We've got Cans.\nThat would be the the biggest city up north.\nWait, are those uh as large as the Nile crocodiles?\nThe saltwater crocodiles?\nI don't know how big a Nile crocodile is.\nWell, I think I only just saw an alligator for the first time.\nThey're not as scary.\nWell, you got to see a big one, dude.\nLady just got killed in Orlando by one last week.\nSalt water larger, more vicious.\nSalt waters are larger than the Niles.\nMore aggressive.\nBro, you have the most aggressive crocodiles in the world.\nWe got them and we got It's a lot of koalas and kangaroos.\nKangaroos are so friendly.\nYou have the most aggressive dinosaur in the world in your country.\nThat's why to get torn apart by one would be an honor.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nIt would be No.\nYou know what I would like to do?\nI'd like to get together with some special forces dudes and kill those [ __ ] from the air.\nOkay.\nEverybody thinks you have to keep them around.\nLet that pass.\nYou got to keep them around.\nYeah.\nI think maybe we keep three in a zoo and everybody else is dead.\nThey're beautiful.\nTurn them into shoes.\nYou know about the cage of death?\nWhat's that?\nYou can get into a cage.\nYeah.\nIsn't that Don't you show me that.\nThat's a good cage.\nThat's a strong cave.\nYou'd be fine.\nNo.\nNo.\nNo.\nPeople, why do you want to do that?\nDon't want to do Jesus.\nThat is such a monster.\nSuch a [ __ ] heartless monster.\nIf that thing opened up somehow accidentally, it would love to eat you.\nWhat is wrong with people?\nThere's a lot of scratches on it, too.\nGod, he's trying to get in there.\nLook at that thing.\nIt's so big.\nThey're so terrifying, dude.\nI mean, it is a [ __ ] monster.\nAnd that's not even a big one, man.\nI have a a friend, his name is Jim Shaki, and he's a professional hunter.\nHe lives in Canada.\nAnd uh they sent him to Africa to shoot crocodiles because they were killing so many people in this one village.\nAnd he said when he got there, there was this one particular big croc that was there that was just killing everybody.\nIt everybody was like missing a foot.\nEverybody had one arm.\nLike for real, like the jaws, but for crocodile.\nYeah.\nHe said it was crazy.\nIt's like so many people in this town had been bitten by crocodiles.\nSo they had developed this system where they put posts in the ground in the water so that they knew the crocodiles couldn't get into that.\nRight?\nSo what the crocodiles did was go around it and sneak into the water when the people weren't around.\nThey're impressive.\nBeautiful.\nHave you seen in India when they get like a puma in the village and everyone's standing on the roof and the puma's like running around the streets and the guys are trying to throw a net on it?\nYeah.\nNuts.\nIs that it?\nThe Philippines.\nOh my god.\n20 It's over 20 feet.\nIs that a saltwater one?\nIt looks bigger cuz they're very small people.\nBut that's so big, dude.\nThat's so big.\nThat's such a dinosaur.\nAnd then we turn it into handbags and shoes.\nThank god.\nI went down a rabbit hole the other.\nIt's so funny that people want to keep them around.\nI know.\nI'm like, I want to be real clear.\nI don't want them to go extinct for sure.\nI'm just mostly just [ __ ] around here.\nThey shouldn't be in residential.\nIt is weird that we tolerate a certain amount of monsters.\nIt's weird.\nTo reintroduce them seems nutty.\nOh, when people are bringing the wolves back, bro.\nThe thing they're doing in Colorado is so stupid because this is what they did.\nOkay.\nColorado took these wolves from Oregon that had been preying on cattle and then they moved them into Colorado where they prayed on cattle.\nYeah.\nAnd then the people whose cattle they were praying on got pissed off.\nSo they took a bunch of them and removed them and put them in Pitkin County over by Aspen where they prey on cattle.\nIt's the dumbest thing.\nEveryone's like, \"Oh, it's going to balance out the wild industry.\"\nNo, they're dumb.\nThey don't know what they\n\n\n're doing. It's wildlife. It's ballot box who's like, \"No, it's the the governor. The governor and his husband wanted to do it this way. They wanted to reintroduce wolves.\" Like, and but wolves were already on their way to being reintroduced to Colorado. They were doing it naturally. There's wolves. There's a pack of wolves that was established that had already made their way into Colorado. Colorado boils borders Wyoming. Wyoming has wolves. So, they were getting wolves. Is this a tourism thing or they just like\n\nLook, there's some there's some like real thought that could be put into whether or not an ecosystem should be balanced with the proper amount of predators. And if you, the human race, were responsible for killing off this one major predator that was in this ecosystem.\n\nYeah, that seems irresponsible and maybe we can bring that animal back and it would balance out the system. This is the thought process behind it.\n\nThe problem with that is these animals have become accustomed to just killing cattle. They did it in Oregon, then they did it in Colorado, and then they're doing it where they are now. And everybody wants to pretend it's not happening. So they want to pretend they didn't do that. They didn't do a giant [ __ ] up. These are not wild wolves that are going to go out and hunt down elk and and make the population smaller. No, they're used to preying on cattle.\n\nYeah. So, they're killing cows all the time. There's a lot of people who want to hunt, right? Like there are people who want to take out the animals that the wolves would have taken out.\n\nWell, yeah, but you you should have a balance. You should have mountain lines. like it like the wild can't you can't sterilize certain aspects of the ecosystem because they're dangerous to you.\n\nBut what you shouldn't do is take these animals and then moved them into an area where nothing is prepared. The the ranchers aren't prepared. No one warned them. They moved them to that area without letting anybody know. One of my friends has a ranch there. They release some of the wolves on his property. And these wolves now all of a sudden wolves that are used to killing cattle are killing cattle down there.\n\nYeah, cuz it would be way easier. They're easier. They're all together.\n\nYeah. They don't run away. They They stand still and you kill the cows.\n\nThey're like like in Britain they got rid of all the wolves.\n\nThey got rid of all the wolves everywhere, dude.\n\nThere's a reason why they did it was because wolves are like the most intelligent. They're like psychic super predators. They're the most intelligent of all predators. They're the only predator that we have in North America that hunts in a pack and they're big. You're dealing with a 100 pound plus animal that hunts in a pack.\n\nThey're bringing back the direwolf as well.\n\nWell, so that's different. Okay. This is not\n\nBut they were not bring\n\nThey're not going to put it in the wild. They brought it back to show that this this gene editing that they do for animals is legitimate. So to do that, they reproduced an animal from the genes of one of them. What was it? What were the numbers, Jamie? One was like 50,000 years old and one was like 70,000 years old when Beth Shapiro was in here.\n\nThe the lady who's like the head geneticist and brilliant woman. Uh she was explaining it all to us and it's just the whole thing is bananas. So they essentially didn't even know what they were going to look like until they came out.\n\nIs the hope that we get the dinosaurs?\n\nWell, they're trying to build Jurassic Park. 100% that's going to come if they have DNA from a dinosaur. I don't think they do. I don't think it's possible. I think it's too degraded when it's that old that you don't find like But maybe they'll find some.\n\nBut the Tasmanian devils definitely they're always trying to bring that back.\n\nNo, the Tasmanian tiger. Tasmanian devil.\n\nTy devils is they're around.\n\nThat's a weird one because they get cancer from biting each other. They get face cancer.\n\nThey all have weird I mean all the koalas have chlamydia.\n\nDo they really?\n\nYeah. Some Australian.\n\nWell, they're very cute. They're very It's the uh It's the Dong of the land. Those Tasmanian um devils. They bite each other in the face and they get these horrible face deformities. It's like it's like um communicable cancer. It's like cancer that they transfer to each other. It's really weird.\n\nBefore we got there, I don't think it has anything to do with us. I I don't think that's I think it has something to do with like whatever the [ __ ] is in their mouth, you know? It could be just all the horrible [ __ ] that they eat.\n\nYeah. And then they bite each other and their teeth are probably rotten and disgusting. I don't know. Like find Why do Tasmanian tiger or devils rather give each other cancer?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nWell, what are they?\n\nI mean, we could let them know. What are we going to brush their teeth?\n\nCan't do anything unless you can come up with a medication that stops it from happening like an antibiotic or something. I I just don't understand like how cancer can be communicable like that. Like you can just transfer it by biting. Seems crazy.\n\nYeah. If you if you got covered in a tumor, you wouldn't get cancer, would you?\n\nOkay. Devil facial tumor disease. It's a contagious fatal cancer that um primarily affects the face and the mouth area of Tasmanian devils. Disease has significantly impacted the wild population, posing a serious threat to their survival. What is it? DFTD is a transmissible cancer, meaning it spreads through the transfer of living cancer cells, primarily via biting.\n\nThey didn't notice till the 90s.\n\nWow. The tumors usually start as lesions or patches on the mouth and on the face and grow into large disfiguring masses. The disease is almost universally fatal.\n\nWhoa.\n\nSo, we must have done this. We must be somehow. But if if it started in the '9s and now they're going extinct because of it, but that does happen with animals sometimes.\n\nYeah. That feels like weird timing that they were they were getting by for a 100,000 years and then 200 years after Whitey gets there.\n\nBut that's it's possible, right?\n\nIt's good to be cynical.\n\nWe're about to name a football team after them.\n\nThey're a crazy animal. You ever hear them the sounds they make?\n\nNo.\n\nLet's play that.\n\nPlay the sounds of a Tasmanian devil.\n\nThey sound so cool. Like he was my favorite character for sure in the Warner Brothers cartoons. The Tasmanian Devil. We'd spin around.\n\nIt was fun.\n\nI like Bugs Bunny. When I found out that was at university, people kept going like, \"He's black. Do you know he's black?\"\n\nBugs Bunny's black.\n\nThat's like a big thing that he was a blackcoated character. He's always like relaxed.\n\nOh, and he's got a cool plan that he's working on. He's like a zoot suit guy from the 20s.\n\nYeah.\n\nLet me hear some of this.\n\n[Applause]\n\nYeah, look, Devil was an easy name to pick.\n\nNo, no points for the guy who came up with that, right? I mean, if you called it anything else, I would be disappointed.\n\nI miss our beautiful Australian animals. I miss the trees. I got to go through California and see all the like the gum trees again. I haven't seen gum trees in forever.\n\nLook at that.\n\nThat's so nice.\n\nWhat a ferocious little [ __ ]\n\nSomething gets in the blood where it's like that's what I think an animal should look like.\n\nYou know what I saw? I think foliage should be close recently for the I think maybe the first time. Uh a wolverine.\n\nAre they real?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, the real animal.\n\nYeah. It was at a badger. No, it's a badger.\n\nIt's in the badger family, I think. Um but I saw one at like this uh nature preserve when I was on the road. was pretty interesting, man. You see those little [ __ ] like they're unbelievably ferocious. They scare bears off of carcasses and they weigh like 50 pounds.\n\nBut there are This is the year that I've seen the most animals cuz I've I've got kids and we travel around and I go I've been to like eight zoos this year.\n\nOh, cool.\n\nThere's a lot of zoos, but there Man, did you know in New York they had a guy at the zoo? They had a human zoo.\n\nWhat is he fighting here, Jamie? Yes.\n\nWait, that's the Wolverine?\n\nYeah, it's a Wolverine. If we get at the animal fight videos, I\n\nWolverine.\n\nI think he pissed himself while that was happening.\n\nOf course, he probably pisses himself all over the place. Just probably to make himself more ferocious.\n\nLike the wolf gets a hold of them. I've seen mountain lions get a hold of them and they don't kill them. They're like unbelievably durable. You ever watch the like the bird and the fish that goes on for like the bird and the fish?\n\nThere's like a heron trying to get a a small fish and they play it in slow motion. They put classical music behind it. Animals trying to get away from other. That's a big\n\nOh, I've watched a lot of those. Animals trying to get away from animals. Yeah. Running fast across the wilderness. You want them to get away.\n\nSo, your animals, you have a lot of weirdness going on over there, right?\n\nCuz you have kangaroos. Sometimes they get like an infestation, right?\n\nYeah. Then they go up in a helicopter and they gun down the kangaroos.\n\nWhat used to kill the kangaroos back in the day?\n\nI don't think anything was killing them.\n\nSo, how did they get to\n\nI think there might have just been less arable land. Maybe they had like less to eat.\n\nOh, really?\n\nI assume they would starve, but like I don't think anything kills the emuse. We lost all our big predators. Uh the predators aren't too dingoes and but dingo came. Dingo I think came from India.\n\nYeah, but here's the thing, man. Some kangaroos are like six feet tall.\n\nThey're [ __ ] huge. Like but they'll only bother you. There's that one video of the guy with the dog.\n\nRight. But what I'm saying is good luck to the dingo.\n\nYeah.\n\nThese [ __ ] get big.\n\nWell, they they're in packs, though. The dingoes are.\n\nYeah.\n\nOh, so the\n\nI think they're impacts.\n\nWell, they probably don't hunt the big males either, right?\n\nBro, look at all [ __ ] I miss Australia.\n\nDo you?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat do you miss the most?\n\nOh, I miss the football. I miss the Look at the accent. Look at all these [ __ ]\n\nI don't remember that. That doesn't usually happen. when we don't usually get together and what's called the demon cults.\n\nIt was during co when everyone was inside there was like kangaroos came back into the town. They were jumping about.\n\nSo this is a mob of kangaroos.\n\nThat was that does look like a mob.\n\nYou'll see them. You'll go on like a nature walk and you'll just see a kangaroo in the distance just looking at you.\n\nJeez.\n\nBut they're like, you know, they they seem friendly and mysterious and then they jump away.\n\nSo was there like more dingos all over Australia at one point in time?\n\nI think we clamped down on it at some point.\n\nClamp down on the that lady who lost a baby and she said a dingo got it and no one believed her and now they think the dingo maybe got that baby but also the dingoes are all in the I've never seen a dingo.\n\nImagine a dingo eating your baby and nobody believes you.\n\nYeah.\n\nIsn't that crazy? Like not only is it horrible that a dingo ate your baby, but then also think you killed your baby.\n\nAll right. My favorite one is the poet Ted Hughes. He's married to Sylvia Pla. He comes home. She's killed herself in the oven.\n\nOh, very sad. Very difficult.\n\nShe killed herself in the oven. I don't I don't think he came home. He'd left her by that point for another woman. She gassed herself in the oven.\n\nOh god.\n\nThen he the woman I think it's the woman that he runs away with couple years later. She also kills herself in the family oven.\n\nHis second wife. So like from the outside people in the British literary establishment start going I think he's killing his wives in the oven. You can't have a second oven suicide. That's it's a for me once type situation. Well, you could if the second wife obsessed about the death of the first wife to the point where boy, you'd be careful with wife number three.\n\nWell, you'd say, \"We're going electric oven.\"\n\nIt Well, these are ex-wives, right?\n\nYeah. Once they\n\nWell, I think he was still married to the second one.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nHe didn't have to leave her. But he\n\nSo, while they were married, she asked herself like that.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. Well, that guy's probably got shitty choice in ladies.\n\nHe I believe it.\n\nBut you be so cautious. I'm the second one in the same way.\n\nYeah, that's an issue. You'd be like, \"This keeps coming up.\" Um maybe I'm doing something wrong.\n\nYeah. If like that's the thing about like the Clinton body count. People go like if 51 of your friends commit suicide.\n\nVery sad.\n\nLike something's going on.\n\nThat's a That's a giant number. Most people don't have 51 close associates whack themselves in strange ways.\n\nSome people are unlucky.\n\nOne of one of the guys hung himself from a tree by um extension cord and then shot himself in the chest with a with a shotgun.\n\nYeah, cuz he was a hard worker. He was probably a good part of the DNC operation. He didn't want to leave it to chance.\n\nYeah, the mysterious suicide they keep it's hard not to get into the conspir I try not to have a conspiratorial mindset cuz I get unhappy.\n\nWell, we already talked about what Israel did. They made the fake phone call to the military. It was only because it was impressive and I thought it was cool.\n\nRight. It is cool.\n\nBut the beepers, they came out and they said, \"We did it.\"\n\nBoth of them are cool, but\n\n\nIt's a conspiracy. They conspired to whack somebody. They did conspire. Yeah, and they did it, and they pulled it off. Well, they also, they were getting like the last Nazis for a while. Oh, yeah. Over the latter half. Hunt them down. 50 years later, 60 years later, hunt them down. Yeah. You think they'd managed to clear up Hamas quicker? That's uh, one of the weirder... You ever see that show, uh, uh, Hunting Hitler or Finding Hitler? No. Okay. I've seen shows like that on the History Channel a lot. I don't know if I've seen that one. Tim Kennedy was on it, and they all went down to Argentina, and one of the things you find in Argentina is like entire towns where people speak German. Yeah. And so what... Italians, too. Well, yeah. Right. James Donald Forbes McCann's guys. Yeah. And so they found all these photographs of like SS soldiers on the walls in people's houses. Like there was a television show about it. We have a, we have a German town in Australia where they say there's a pub with like Nazi stuff on the walls. I've never seen it, but the Germans, there's like a, there's a Bavarian town where everyone's nice and relaxed, and then there's like a Prussian town where people are very... But also, sometimes you will go around to like a German guy's house, like they've got an old German family, and then you look over on the mantle piece, and there's a knife there. There's a very special knife. It's like, \"We can't get rid of it. That's grandpa's knife.\" The weird thing is, like, they have full towns down in Argentina that practice Oktoberfest. Yeah. They put on the lederhosen, the whole deal. Like, it's a German town. I think there's something about the black population disappeared. I don't know if this is... I think it might be Argentina that they had like a big black population, and then over a hundred years people go, \"I don't know where they are anymore, but they're not here now.\" And I think it coincides with the... maybe it was before the Nazis got there, but that's a weird... that's a weird rabbit hole. There's not a lot about it. So many rabbit holes. Some people say like they just integrated and... and what whitened up... like it's kids after kids, and you can't see it, but like there... what they had a big black population, then it... Am I right? I... I need that one. I don't want to just say that and have it... we have to look that one up. But like it disappeared, and this is Argentina. It could be Europe. Black genocide. The true history of the whitening of Argentina. Thank you. Travel Noir, a website. I've never heard of that website, but I assume it's a... Whoa. Today, many Argentinians hold the erroneous belief that Argentina neither participated in the slave trade nor witnessed the presence of Afroargentinians as if they had left the country naturally. Such misconceptions persist despite historical evidence. Former Argentine President Carlos Manm, uh, once shockingly declared, \"In Argentina, blacks do not exist. That is a Brazilian problem.\" No one's bringing that up. Whoa. Less than two centuries ago, black individuals compromised over a third of Argentina's population in 1800. That seems like a question. That seems like someone should find out what happened there. Holy [ __ ] Holy [ __ ] man. The factors be behind the disappearance. Sudden and profound disappearance of black Africans from Argentina is attributed to a confluence of factors. The 1870s though, first is the war against Paraguay, spanning from 1865 to 1870. Thousands of black individuals fought in the military during these conflicts and other wars, resulting in significant losses. The fatalities led to a considerable gender gap within the African population, prompting unions between black women and white men, which effectively diluted the black populace. In addition, many Afroargentines sought refuge in more welcoming political climates in neighboring Brazil and Uruguay. But you don't lose a third of the population by like a... They're saying all of them. Like there's no way these factors would make all of them go away. Another devastating factor was the outbreak of yellow fever in Buenos Aires in 1871, which claimed the lives of numerous locals. But still, wouldn't it be like... proport... here it is, but many sources point to a far darker and more sinister force at work. A covert genocide orchestrated by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who served as Argentina's president from 1868 to 1874 and played a pivotal role in decimating the Afroargentine population. Okay. So it is a genocide. Yeah. But this was about a hundred years before I thought. Wow. But then no one... no one's going after Argentina for this. Well, I didn't even know about it until everyone goes about like, \"America's a racist country, their racist history.\" Holy [ __ ] Why is no one talking about Brazil's slavery? Brazil had way more. Brazil was like, I think they kept doing it for 20 years as well. They were... It was huge. And then everyone just acts like Brazil is a cool place to go by the beach and relax. Maybe it is. Have you ever seen the City of God? No. City of God is about the favelas in Brazil in Rio. And it is, uh, it makes Eddie Bravo said this, that it makes Boys in the Hood look like Sesame Street. It really does. Like if you... you watch that movie, it's so violent and so crazy. And apparently when you talk to people from Brazil, particularly from the favelas, Yeah. it's actually accurate. Like the... there were gangs of kids like this. There were like young 10, 11-year-old kids committing murder every day. They had guns. They were moving drugs and getting money and like young. They still have it. Still an issue. I mean, they've done their best to try to like the, you know, the soldiers will like do raids into the favelas at times, especially when someone does something crazy. But I know I was saying positive things about slums before. There's negative things to have in slums as well. I would just like there to be more... more housing. Yeah, housing would be good, but good housing would be better. And there's enough money. There's enough money to do that. It's like you just have to... we have to prioritize like what are we spending money on? I mean, we shut... we shut Australia down for like two years. No one was doing anything. Yeah. You guys went nuts. We... if you ever lead the world in something bad, that's... I think a bad sign once you have the longest lockdown. What is it about Australians as a culture? Yeah. That allowed them to be kind of ordered around like that? We love rules. Is that what it is? I think about this a lot because it's... I mean, like, like driving in America is feels wild and free. Like no one's doing the speed limit. If you do the speed limit on the freeway, it feels way more dangerous than going five over. We have cameras every... you can't... if you go one, two miles over the speed limit in Australia, you get a fine. They've recorded you. You're in. And we don't push back. I have no idea why other than because people don't like it overall. People don't want to go through the bureaucracy, but maybe there's no... we have no like animating sense of freedom that people should be free. It's like, I think if the motto here is \"don't tread on me,\" we've got \"pull your [ __ ] head in.\" You hear that quite a lot. Pull your head in. Pull your head in. What's that mean? What are you... What are you [ __ ] doing? Pull your... pull your [ __ ] head in. Like get in... get in line. Go with the flow. Do what you meant to do. And for a while, I guess we were also prosperous for a long time, and that worked. If you just like laid low and you did what you know, you went to school, you went to uni, the government's going to pay for your uni, you get a... you get a nice job, you'll get a big, beautiful suburban family home. Don't buck the system. You don't have to do anything crazy. And as that falls apart now, which is falling apart quickly, the rents out of control, the inflation's so much worse, the... it's all... you know, the immigration is like... kind... it's silly, like we're not building houses in line with that. Um... and so it's like, I don't... a lot of comics are moving overseas, like in a way that no one moved overseas when I was... for the first 10 years I was doing comedy. I think a couple guys went to the UK, and that was it. And now Aaron Chen's here, Blake Freeman's here, Amos Gill's here... what do you think is the big motivator to... what was the biggest thing that was a problem over there that... post-co... I mean, co... was co... radicalized a lot of people? Is that what it was, just the kind of control they put down on you guys? It was, and then the... I mean, there... there's so much opportunity here. People keep saying the cost of living is going up in America, and it is, but it's like still... it's wacky that eggs are only 370 or something. That's so cheap for eggs for us. Really? How much are eggs over there? More substantial. Yeah. Like how much? Give me... I don't know. I'm buying... I'm buying free-range eggs 'cause we... my wife insists on it. But still, I would... I think if you did an... if you did like a milk to milk egg to egg, you dominate. Interesting. America has so far to go before it gets to be a revolutionary. 14 a dozen. Whoa. 14 bucks a dozen you guys pay for eggs. That's crazy. Oh man. It's... if you got coals and I mean, the dollars... the dollar is a bit different. So there's less opportunity. Things are more expensive. And also there's... I mean, but what about co... radicalized a lot of people. You got locked in your house for... I mean, it's literally in Melbourne. We were in Melbourne when it kicked off, my wife and I, and we had a newborn child, and she was pregnant with the next one. And, uh, they said, \"We're locking everyone down for six weeks. You can't leave your house.\" And it was... we had better not... better... we had like stronger state-by-state regulation. So if you moved back... we were from Adelaide in South Australia. They said it was two weeks if you came from interstate. So we just drove all night and got out, but then watched as people... It's like a 300-day lockdown. Jesus Christ. Uh, you couldn't do... It was one of the only places you could do shows was in Adelaide. We did have... I saw... I like Josh. He seems great. I saw him on here talk like about the... I think you confronted him about the concentration camps, and it's like, \"Yeah.\" We had camps where we concentrated people. I don't know what else you meant to call that. Yeah. Yeah. We had a disagreement too about myocarditis, and it was interesting. It was like you would get all these different... now it's like firmly established as a higher risk of myocarditis for young people that took it, but back then it was really confusing, and I was like, \"Why did I read articles that said it was a higher risk?\" And then he brought one up that said there was more of a risk of getting myocarditis from COVID itself, which really didn't make any sense even in the argument because back then we didn't know that it not only doesn't protect you from getting the virus, it doesn't even protect you from spreading the virus, so you still get it, so you still have a chance if that's true. Yeah. But it turns out when I talked to Dr. Masim Aim Mahhatra, who is, um, he's a part of this whole Maha thing, too, and he was another doctor that was initially pro-vaccine and eventually just realized there was a a bunch of horseshit going on with all of it. He said they... that's not what they measured. They were measuring troponin levels. They were measuring like what... what happens when you get sick, and that those levels are higher in a viral infection. And he was saying that that... that's not indicative of what true myocarditis is, which is an enlarging of the heart and a scarring of the heart tissue. It's like it's a different thing they're looking for. They're elevating the number of people that are getting it from COVID by doing it this way. He was saying, \"Oh, I can see why you...\" It's hard to lose trust in the establishment. Like you want to believe that the people running the medical side of things and who are setting all the rules have your interest at heart, and you should listen to them. Especially if you're in so certain social circles, right? So if you're in certain social circles where people are very pro-science and very logical and rational, and they are all in agreement of one thing, you don't want to be cast out of that social circle. You don't want to be thought of as being a fool. And so you don't want to have any opinion that's opposing what is this consensus narrative amongst these people. It's also... I mean, it's nice to be in that group because you get to... you get to live in a world where the government cares about you, and they know what they're doing, and this politician in a suit, like there was a... Yeah, but you got... the realm for personal expression and politicians was tiny for a long time 'cause it was... you were... you know, that's what you want. Trump's blown this up, but I remember like... Howard Dean did a weird scream, and his career was... that's what it took back in the day to ruin your candidacy. Yeah. Well, how about, uh... because they had to keep that illusion going that like these are very competent people who will not make a weird noise at the wrong time. Oh, for sure. That was all they would need to latch on to, and then they would like throw it in everybody's face. It would be all over the news, and it would be over. Yeah. There was no internet, you know. What a... I mean, isn't that a nice world to... that world... like that '50s world of like, \"Ah, you can... we've got a man in a white coat, and he knows what's up.\" You don't have to do all the... It's taxing to try and figure out how disease works. Oh, it's... Yeah, it's not fun. It's not fun to not trust anyone and always want to read like hundreds of different articles on any complex subject to try to get an understanding of who's telling the truth and who's not. It's a pain in the ass. And the cost for getting it wrong is in... like if you get 19 things right and one thing wrong, they just go, \"You're a [ __ ] idiot.\" Oh, 100%. Yeah. But the... I think the key is like you have to say why you got it...\n\n\nWrong, and then express yourself.\nLike I get things wrong, but I'll tell you why I got it wrong.\nAnd then I, I won't lie, and I'll tell you what I know now.\nSo if I know now that something's different than what I thought, I definitely always say it.\nAnd I always say, I was wrong about this, and this is why.\nI like get it out.\nYou got to get it out because it's important.\nLike the the whole thing is we're trying to figure out what the [ __ ] is actually going on.\nAnd when you're looking at like really complex, like you get into something like the Kennedy assassination.\nYes, which is one of the big ones in this country, 'cause there's a lot of people like, \"Oh, let it go.\nLet it go.\"\nBut then there's a lot of other people go, \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nThis shows you how they did it in 1963.\"\nAnd they've evolved.\nAnd anything that's alive that's still a part of the systems are all still there.\nYeah, for sure.\nThey're just way better at doing that.\nAnd they've learned how to not use a magic bullet and, you know, not [ __ ] you know, the grassy null and not kill all the witnesses.\nYou know, they learned how to do stuff.\nThey got a lot better.\nWho is So, it's like, so Jack Ruby kills I'm going to get a lot of this wrong.\nLee Harvey Oswald.\nJack Kennedy kills.\nWe have a photo of it right out there, right the moment he's shooting.\nBut then when he's under arrest, there are like two journalists who come and interview him, and I think one of them kills him.\nJolly West.\nJolly West, the head of the MK Ultra program.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nJolly West visits him and he goes insane.\nHe had never had any history of mental illness.\nJolly West sees he sees Jews burning in hell, and he's he's going crazy.\nHe's hide because he was a Jewish man.\nSo he thought he they were coming for him.\nHe's hiding underneath a [ __ ] bench.\nHe was screaming.\nHe went completely they doeds him with acid, man.\nYeah.\nThis is the the MK Ultra people visited.\nI think a journalist who talked to him before he died got killed by a some sort of gay karate chop.\nA gay?\nIt was like a gay It was like a gay journalist and then he took a home in the ass.\nYou you chopped him in.\nI think he took a man home for a sexual encounter and then he was karate chopped to death.\nI think that's the official explanation.\nIt's a very rare thing to karate chop a man to death.\nThat's a weird choice.\nIt was cool to karate chop somebody.\nWhy did they know it was a karate chop unless they have a video?\nI think that's the medical examiner said karate chop.\nOkay.\nThat medical examiner doesn't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about.\nThey probably just stomped him.\nWell, do you think Well, who's the the Manson family?\nThe Manson.\nYes.\nHe was dosed with some sort of\nOh, 100%.\nAnd I'm I'm sorry if you've heard this before, ladies and gentlemen, but uh the book Chaos by Tom O'Neal is amazing.\nAmazing.\nHe's Greg Fitz Simmons' old uh neighbor.\nUh so Greg, who's at the mothership this weekend, who's awesome, one of my best friends, and I've been friends with I started doing comedy with him one week apart when we did open mic night.\nIs he a busting guys will?\nYes.\nKnown him forever.\nHe's awesome.\nSo he and hilarious comic too, but I think it's all sold out.\nBut he um was next door to this guy and um this guy was a journalist, super nice guy.\nThey became friends and he's saying, \"I'm writing this thing about Manson.\nIt was supposed to be for uh a magazine.\nIt was supposed to be like 25th anniversary of the Manson family killings.\"\nBut he starts finding all these inconsistencies and he keeps going further and further down the rabbit trap and he thinks the prosecutor's full of [ __ ] and there's some sort of a connection to the government.\nHe's like, \"What the [ __ ] is going on here?\"\nSo he doesn't meet the deadline.\nSo he keeps going and so then he gets a book deal and it's just like he's going on and on and on and on and on for 20 [ __ ] years.\nFor 20 years this guy studies nothing but the Manson case.\nHe's got stacks and boxes and he's been interviewing people.\nAnd then he puts together this book with help.\nHe had to get someone to help him organize it because he was so deep in the weeds.\nHe's got enough for another book.\nI mean a pure obsessive but a brilliant guy.\nAnd this book, Chaos, it outlines all of the MK Ultra involvement in the Manson family and all the different things that they were doing at the time with the CIA mind control experiments, how they were running brothel,\nwhich they did definitely seem to have.\n100%.\nYeah.\nAll 100% real.\nDo you know about this lady, Dorothy Killgallen, reporter cloaked in controversy.\nI'd say read this.\nOkay.\nDorothy Gilgalan is best known for her column The Voice of Broadway in the New York Evening Journal, which was published in over 140 papers and for her role as the game show panelist the 1950s television program What's My Line?\nShe was hailed by the Post as being the most powerful female voice in America.\nKill Gallon spent a vast majority of her career cloaked in controversy, most notably surrounding her investigative work into the John F. Kennedy assassination.\nAs a longtime skeptic of the Warren Commission, a study conducted by the United States government into who killed JFK as well as who killed Lee Harvey, well, we know who killed Lee Harvey Oswald.\nJFK's supposed assassin, Kilg Gallen, dove deep into the controversy.\nSome may even argue too deep.\nKilg Gallen was under suspicion that Oswald did not commit his crimes alone and published several articles reflecting this belief.\nJack Ruby, who allegedly killed Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24th, 1963, was only interviewed by one reporter throughout the trial, Dorothy Kilgallen.\nSince her interview with Ruby, many noted that Kilg Gallon uh carried a file with her at all times.\nIt remained under lock and key when not physically in her hands, according to those close to her.\nKill Gallen's file continued to grow throughout the investigation.\nIn a conversation with her lawyer Jim Garrison prior to that's the guy who prosecuted um that was the in the movie Kevin um Kevin Coer played him in the the the uh JFK movie.\nYeah.\nUh prior to a trip to New Orleans with Dorothy, later inexplicably canled, he remembers her saying, \"I'm going to break the real story and have the biggest scoop of the century.\"\nKill Gallant's first trip to New Orleans was planned two weeks prior to her death when her husband, Richard Kmar, found her with files missing by her hairdresser in a bedroom she never slept in, dressed in clothes she would never wear to bed, reading a book she had finished and disliked, wearing glasses she didn't need for reading.\nInitial autopsy report, a Brooklyn medical office, as opposed to the office in Manhattan, where she lived, found her cause of death to be a lethal combination of alcohol and barbituates.\nThe report later amended to note that the barbituate originally found schanol, a sleeping pill for which she had been prescribed, was in fact a combination of two twe uh tuinol and nembutall, which she did not have access to.\nAlthough her death was eventually ruled a suicide, Kilgen's husband noted that when she returned from a taping of What's My Line early that evening, she appeared chipper.\nWell, a lot of people do seem chipper before they go.\nI decided um yeah, a researcher by the name of Mark Shaw, who investigated Kilgen's death, found that she was under surveillance by the FBI through the Freedom of Information Act.\nFriends of Kilgallen recall her expressing fear for her life leading up to her death and she supposedly even purchased a gun, a rather uncharacteristic thing for her to Yeah, they whacked her.\nYeah, they whacked her.\nYeah, they've got to finish releasing.\nIn a recent release of the JFK files on October 26, 2017, a file entitle entitled Dorothy Kilgallen by Richard Nixon was released, but its contents remain sealed due to reasons of national security.\nThey whacked her.\nYeah, it does.\nWas there a gay karate chop or did I make that up?\nI didn't see that part.\nThey whacked her.\nThey whacked her.\nIt seems likely.\nYeah, she was digging into the investigation.\nLook, you know, when you talk to like I talked to Oliver Stone about it multiple times and Oliver Stone, despite his advanced age, is still brilliant and his recall is incredible.\nHis recall on the assassination, like he's obsessed with that assassination.\nSo, he can tell you like who was involved and who did this and Alan Dulles and this and that, the Warren Commission report, and then it goes back the the rabbit hole just goes so deep.\nIt goes all the way.\nIt goes all the way to Richard Nixon because it it goes all the way to Gerald Ford who was on the Warren Commission's report and when they kicked Spiro Agnu out, they got Spiro Agnu on, you know, corruption.\nYeah.\nThey kicked him out.\nThey put in Gerald Ford.\nThen they kicked Richard Nixon out.\nYeah.\nWith the Watergate thing, which I always thought was Richard Nixon got caught being a crook, but that's No, it was he was not a crook.\nIt was an intelligence agency plot.\nThe whole thing was Tucker Carlson lays it out.\nYeah, there's the Nixon reputation is starting to come back.\nWell, you know, people are starting to love Nixon again.\nThere's a lot of Maybe for the first time stuff that he did that's not good.\nUh Jim Cy wrote uh decided to write a book about the assassination of John F.\nKennedy.\nHowever, he died on the 21st of September 1964.\nOh, there go and see that a man broke into his Dallas apartment and killed him by a karate chop to the throat.\nThat could happen to anybody.\nThat's a real thing that happens all the time.\nThis This is the thing.\nLike, how do they know they didn't just strangle him to the throat?\nLike, if you have damage to your throat if you don't see the guy karate chopping him.\nWell, it does seem like a weird flourish for the secret police to put out there.\nBut that's like one of those things that you would say.\nCody just Oh.\nUh, it seemed like a man broke into his apartment.\nTom Howard.\nTom Howard died of a heart attack age 48, 1965.\nWho's Tom Howard?\nOh, attorney.\nOh, his attorney.\nOkay.\nThey both visited Jack Ruby in jail.\nOkay.\nAnd they both died.\nThey definitely give you a heart attack.\nThey definitely could give you a heart attack.\nThey also searched his apartment.\nThe karate chop comes.\nI really always held on to Karate Chop.\nThat's the one detail that really stayed with me through the How are you sure?\nYou can't tell.\nI've seen so many guys get beat up and you can never tell what hit them.\nIt could have been a very long bruise across the big forearm.\nShin shin to the neck.\nEasy.\nPeople weren't people didn't have that sort of kicking ability in the West at that time.\nSure, some people did.\nYeah, there was people that trained like an assassin.\nIf you were going to be an assassin, you would learn Muay Thai.\nThere was like legit Muay Thai.\nYou also have a knife.\nYeah.\nYou also have But if you wanted to make it look like it was like a That was a bachelor flat.\nIs that why I thought it was some sort of uh cause of death exfiation from a broken bone at the base of his neck.\nApparently the result of a cry shop.\nYou know, I'm suspicious.\nI think they probably thought of it as a karate chop because this is how people thought back then, but I would imagine that was like a baton on the neck where you choker got it down.\nThere was a time I know in Austin Powers karate chop is like a cool thing.\nEarly 60s people just found out about karate.\nThe other guy was accidentally shot by the police a few hours before.\nThat can happen.\nThat can happen.\nJesus Christ, man.\nWhen you read stories like this, like if you're not a conspiracy theorist, you're like, \"Yeah, it was the karate chop that made me think it was something had gone wrong.\"\nKarate chops the only thing that drew me in.\nI was happily signing up with the rest of the official narrative.\nDude, I've seen a lot of guys get karate chopped in the neck.\nThey're all fine.\nNone of them died.\nYeah.\nMy dad is like a big That's not what breaks your neck.\nMy dad really like he really believes the JFK assassination happened the way they said it did.\nAnd he went to he made a whole trip of it to Dallas and he went up to the building.\nHe was like, he could have done it.\nHe could have done it from here.\nWell, here's the thing.\nThat's so I I've never really dug into it.\nWell, here's the thing.\nHe could have shot JFK in the head from the book depository.\nYeah.\nAnybody says any different has never shot a rifle.\nIt wasn't that far.\nIt was I think it was 140 yards.\nIf you have a scope and you have an accurate rifle, 140 yards is not a long shot.\nAnd if you have practiced and you know how it's going to go down and you're prepared, you're going to know exactly where he's going to be.\nYou're going to have the crosshair on him.\nYou pull the trigger, you hit him in the head, and you might be able to get off a couple of shots.\nAnd some people have been able to recreate the three shots and they think that he got off three shots and they said, \"That's impossible.\"\nThey recreate it.\nYeah.\nPeople have done it.\nThey like closed down central Dallas.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\nThey they shot off three rounds from a Carano rifle in that same period of time.\nYeah.\nThey didn't do it there, but they did it.\nIt showed, look, you can shoot three times in the amount of time that it took him to drive.\nBut this is the problem with any conspiracy theory is that like Well, you got to look at all of it.\nThere are a bunch of things that don't Yeah, there are like a thousand conspiracy theories about JFK and some of them are nuts, but then some of them hold up.\nThere was my point though is that that\n\n\nIt is undeniable, but it's also undeniable.\nThere was a lot of people that reported that they heard gunshots from the grassy null.\nYeah.\nThere's also the whole magic bullet theory, which is total horseshit.\nThat's the most horseshit theory that's ever been promoted.\nThere was like an ice bullet that dissolved inside of\nNo.\nDo you know the magic bullet theory?\nOne bullet caused a whole ton of injuries inside.\nNo, this is what they had to do.\nOkay.\nThere was a guy that got shot in the underpass.\nYes.\nSo, um, there was an underpass and a ricochet hit the granite, the curbstone, and he got hit in the head.\nSo, he got [ __ ] up and he had to go to the hospital and then they found the impact and they found the bullet.\nSo, they knew that this accounted for one of the shots that it missed.\nSo, then they had to account for two different entry holes on Kennedy and entry hole in Connelly.\nSo, and Connelly was shot in the wrist.\nSo they in the thigh as well.\nSo it had you had to say that one bullet did all this damage in both people and then there was the head shot.\nYeah.\nBecause they had the third bullet.\nSo they had came up with one wacky theory and they found this bullet in pristine condition on the gurney in when they went to visit in the hospital.\nSo when they when they had JFK's gurney in the hospital, they magically found this pristine bullet.\nThis is like when the passports fall out of the plane on 9/11.\nYeah.\nAlmost as ridiculous.\nBut this one is so ridiculous because you have the physical evidence of the bullet, which is impossible.\nIt's impossible for a bullet to shatter bone, go through two different people, leave more residue, like more bullet fragments were in Conny's wrist than we're missing from the bullet.\nThat bullet that bullet supposedly went through two different people, shattered bone on both of them.\nAnd that's a special bullet.\nAs a person who's shot guns before, that's horseshit.\nThat's not what happens when a bullet hits bone.\nSo it's supposed to have gone through his back.\nThis is the officials out his tie hole.\nYeah.\nLike right where his tie knot is, goes into Conny's wrist, and then goes into his thigh, shatters his wrist, leaves fragments in his wrist, the wound left in the thigh, and then they find this magical, perfect bullet, pristine condition on the gurney in the hospital.\nI mean, it seems weird.\nWas it Conny's gurney that they found it on or or JFK's?\nI might might have got it wrong.\nIt might have been Conny's gurney that they found the bullet on.\nBut either way, listen to me.\nShut the [ __ ] up.\nNo, I look I usually stop at this point.\nShut up.\nCuz I don't want it to happen.\nAnybody who says that's what happened, shut the [ __ ] up.\nThen there's also the problem of the bullet hole in his neck.\nNow, they're trying to attribute that as an exit wound.\nBut the thing is in the there's two different autopsies.\nThe autopsy from uh Dallas and then there was the autopsy from Bethesda, Maryland.\nAnd the discrepancy was the one in Bethesda, Maryland, I believe, called it a tracheotomy scar or tracheotomy cut.\nOkay.\nSo like they opened him up to put a tra.\nThe only reason why they would do that is they don't want to attribute that to a bullet that hit him in the front of the neck.\nI think there was a bunch of different people that were trying to figure out how do we make it so that it was only this one guy and Lee Harvey Oswald might have pulled the trigger.\nHe might have been\nhe does kill the policeman later, right?\nI believe so.\nI believe they they most people believe he did that.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd well he he already knew that he was on the run at that point in time, right?\nAnd then when he gets arrested, he says, \"I'm a psy. I'm a psy.\"\nOkay, maybe maybe he was involved.\nMaybe he didn't pull the trigger.\nMaybe somebody else who was a real expert marksman.\nBecause if you if you he wasn't that good.\nLike people say he wasn't a good marksman.\nBut let me tell you something about\nBen, he was like Dan Grid to mark.\nYeah.\nBut here's the thing about shooting rifles.\nAll right.\nWhen you're talking about like 500 yards, you're talking about really long shots where you're required to be prone and lay perfectly still.\nYeah.\nYes, I would say you really want to be an elite marksman to do that.\nAnd there's a lot of technique involved in training and they're very meticulous about their preparation, their breath work, and it's like a very intense thing because you can't move at all.\nYou have to be like so precise.\nBut 140 yards is not far.\nIt's not that far.\nIt's like with the Trump thing, they said a child could have done it when if he had a scope.\nThat kid didn't have a scope.\nSee, the Trump thing was [ __ ] because that guy was using iron sights.\nSo iron sights are that's what it's like standard.\nThey don't.\nYou can adjust them slightly, but like towards your side, closer to the shooter, there are two posts and at the end there's one post and the the the the like the scoop from the upper post, it lines in a scope of some kind.\nHe did have a scope.\nYeah.\nOh, so why why did they say that he didn't forever?\nI don't know.\nI mean, well, like down here,\nbut there was a photograph of it.\nSo, this photo down in the corner with my cursor doesn't have a scope, right?\nThis is from the FBI.\nOkay, but here's the thing.\nI'm pretty sure there was a photograph of it laying on the roof and it didn't have a scope.\nAnd this is why, and this is not my theory.\nThis is all the people that I know that are in like the tactical world that have talked to me about this.\nThey were saying that he had iron sights.\nSee if you can find it.\nIf they show a photo of the actual rifle and then there's just nothing about this that's come out since then.\nSo, if he had a if he had a scope that's even crazier that he missed.\nUm because that's a chip shot.\nIt's not a hard shot.\nIt's you're 140 yards.\nYou have a an accurate rifle.\nSo, let's see.\nScoom bit on that.\nIt kind of does look like he has a scope.\nGo back to that again.\nA lot of these pictures from the just talking of it though are using a picture of a gun without a scope to confuse people to maybe interesting.\nOkay.\nSo, it's hard to tell, but go to the the top one again and make that larger like this one.\nNo, the one in the that's on the right hand side.\nI get it.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nThat looks a little bit like a scope to me.\nThere's something above the barrel at the the middle point of the gun.\nIt doesn't look flat.\nIt looks like there might be a scope.\nOkay.\nWhich is even crazier that he missed then because this guy is shooting from a very close distance, but he probably [ __ ] panicked.\nHe's a 20-year-old kid.\nAlso, he turns his head just at the right.\nIt's the miraculous head.\nYeah, but the thing is that's not an expert marksman.\nHe did train a lot though.\nThat was the other thing.\nLike there's a lot of people that trained uh in firearms with that kid.\nSo they knew that someone either told him to do that or he was preparing by himself to do that.\nWhy is nothing come out about it?\nBro,\nyou would think\ncuz I think that MK Ultra [ __ ] keeps going.\nI think that it's like that Aerrol Smith song, Train kept it rolling all night long.\nI think it just keeps going.\nI don't think they stopped.\nI think someone, whether it's our government or another government or some giant business interest, someone probably talked that kid into doing that.\nGave him the resources.\nHe had five different phones.\nHis entire someone into doing it.\nHis entire home was professionally scrubbed.\nYeah.\nThere was no silverware in his home when they searched his home.\nI mean, it's weird that there wasn't more.\nI know there was like a guy at the golf course and there was like a third guy maybe.\nMhm.\nBut the temperature in the country at that time was\nno one was like actively coming out and begging.\nThe Dems weren't coming out and saying someone's got to kill this guy.\nBut they were going this is a insane.\nBut it might not just be the Dems.\nThis is what you have to understand.\nIt's probably business interests if you're in another country.\nOkay.\nAnd this guy's actively campaigning saying that he's going to raise tariffs and he's going to c we're going to make China pay.\nWe're going to make Russia pay.\nEveryone's going to pay.\nIf you're in some, you know, military controlled country that's going to lose trillions of dollars because this guy's going to make everybody pay.\nYeah.\nYou might hire someone to do something.\nWell, this is why he goes, \"Vance immediately out.\nThis is the what I put together is the theory.\nSomeone else must have done it, but you pick someone who seems scarier than you, right?\nYou go, well, if you kill me, you get him.\"\nYou think Vance is scary?\nI think at the time he seemed like the furthest right protectionist candidate that Trump could have picked from on the VP list.\nI don't think he really is though.\nI don't know what he\nhe's pretty reasonable when you have a real conversation with him.\nHe's definitely conservative.\nHe's pretty reasonable, but he's also like a nononsense, no [ __ ] guy who is not he doesn't lack in compassion, but he was the like he was not the easiest electorally.\nThere were other people he could have gone with who would have been.\nHe's young.\nHe's very religious.\nYou know, there's a lot of aspects of that that make people uncomfortable.\nThe young one is pretty big.\nYou know, people don't want like some young guy being the [ __ ] president of the world.\nYou know,\nwhen was the last time it was like Teddy Roosevelt?\nUh Kenn Kennedy was what?\nHe was like late 40s,\nbut he'd also have been around.\nHe was a known commodity.\nHe senator for a long time.\nHe was handsome and he's pretty young.\nHe didn't look like an old leader.\nHe didn't look like Eisenhower, you know what I mean?\nYeah.\nHe didn't look like Ronald Reagan, but he was he been to the war and that added like when you go to the Have you been to the Fredericksburg Pacific War Museum?\nNo.\nIt's great.\nIt's a two-hour drive.\nIt's tremendous.\nYeah.\nBut like they have a they have a mural out back for all the presidents since that war and everyone's in World War II.\nLike that's the it's not that America's looking for an old guy.\nIt's like who it's everyone is somehow until like Clinton, everyone is a World War II vet.\nWell, you got back then everybody signed up for the war.\nYeah.\nLike\nbut generationally America didn't want to move on from the World War II guys.\nThat was like a comforting, right?\nBut it was also World War II was the last just war in their eyes.\nLike we had to defeat the Nazis.\nYeah.\nYou know, we had to stop the takeover of evil in the world.\nAnd then you got to the Vietnam War and it's like, wait, what's going on here?\nThis is not\nKorea seems more\nKorea.\nWell, there's a lot of people that would disagree with you, you know, but Korea is also, you know, there's North Korea is fighting South Korea.\nNorth Korea's communist.\nSouth Korea.\nIt doesn't have the same light.\nIt Korea doesn't occupy the same.\nNo.\nDoesn't have the same spot in people's heads.\nAnd then really, it's not one war that everyone's getting behind after that.\nNo.\nNo.\nThere's not one.\nAnd you know, mo most people are real down on a war right now for for good reasons.\nYou know, it's like, are we [ __ ] for real still doing this?\nYou know, and this was one of the things that that Trump campaigned on is no more wars.\nYeah.\nThat scares the [ __ ] out of people, you know, because then right away we're involved in this Iran thing.\nLike, okay.\nBut, you know, I'm so easily taken in like I was I was terrified.\nI was like, \"Oh, I don't want there to be a war.\nThis is terrible.\"\nAnd then as soon as the bombs are dropped and Trump comes out and goes, \"We're very strong.\"\nI'm like, \"Oh, yeah.\"\nLike I It's so easy to get whipped up into a fervor.\nThere's There's some truth to that, right?\nAnd there's some truth to maybe it wouldn't be the best thing in the world if they developed a nuclear program and had nuclear weapons and used them on Israel.\nBut then, you know, you say, well, were they really close to doing that?\nWell, then you find then you find out that Netanyahu has been saying they've been close to doing that for like 15 years and Tulsi saying they have no information on it.\nYeah.\nBut the thing is like what do we know?\nYou know, if they don't let inspectors in, what do we know?\nYeah.\nYou know, I would for see both sides to pull together over something.\nI found someone sent me the like that Reagan towards the end of his term just kept giving speeches about how he wanted there to be an alien invasion.\nYes.\nAnd he said, \"If only there was some alien force that we could all get together again against the aliens.\"\nYeah.\nBut it is that seems like America's ready for that.\nSome coming together.\nI can see that if you were in charge, you wanted to have civil unity.\nYou would want there to be something like a war.\nWell, to pull people back together.\nI think there's a lot of value in having no civil unity.\nI think there's a lot of value in keeping us at each other's throats.\nThis is what I always try to tell people.\nMost of us are in the middle.\nMost most of us, especially after you get to a certain age, you realize a lot of [ __ ] things that people do, it's cuz you know they're allowed to do it and it's stupid and it [ __ ] their life up and maybe you should get your [ __ ] together.\nAlso, there's a lot of poor people that need help.\nAnd the idea that you're going to cut that off from\n\n\nThem is kind of [ __ ] up and uncharitable and unamerican. Yeah. But also, there's people that take advantage of those programs and they stay them forever and it kind of [ __ ] up the whole community and like that's true, too. Okay. So, how do you set the standards and what do you do and how do you do? But most people socially are very much in the middle. Like most people want gay rights and civil rights and women's rights and trans rights. We want rights. We want everybody to be free. We want everybody rights to you. But right, that's how you get something. You chuck No, you just chuck the word rights on something. It's rights are important. Like people say abortion rights and then people say gun rights. Yeah. Like that's how you know if the media is in favor of that thing or not. When I was coming up, if they say rights, then they go this should be like abortion rights were confected in Roie Wade. They just it didn't exist beforehand. And they said there was a I mean maybe people can pass that people can legislatively have abortion on the books but that's not what happened. The Supreme Court just said we infer that there's a right to privacy somewhere in the Constitution. We're not going to be clear about where that is and so the judiciary can just make it happen. Well, that's how it got overturned, right? Yeah. Cuz what can be done by the judiciary can be overturned by the judiciary. But there's heaps of stuff in America that just like the Supreme Court decided it was going to happen. No one came in like gay marriage was just a Supreme Court thing. They just I think that's kind of also the will of the people. Like most people are like let him be married. Like what's the problem? Like how does that [ __ ] with your life? But they're like California votes votes it in and then votes it out again. Right. Well, here's what's hilarious. Up until 2013, Hillary Clinton was openly stating I I don't think Barack Obama I think he said he was against it for the first time. Yeah. I think it was 2013 where Hillary finally said she was in favor of gay marriage. But they used to always like if you ever seen those videos of Hillary being more MAGA than Trump about the border. I believe it. Oh my god. She would be queen MAGA. She would be she would have a a diamond encrusted make America great again hat. She would be the president if she was running today. And I'm not bullshitting. I am not I think there was I'm 100% not bullshitting. I think it's a Sam Talent bit where I don't know if he's still doing it, but he was going like if Camala had come out and said the word [ __ ] she would have won. That's all she had to do. Sam Talent's funny. But he Yeah, there was some there's I mean the Dems are always against the like the progressive wing takes over. The woke thing happens at some point. But like Biden was out saying super predators, bro. The Democrats were the ones who wanted to keep slavery. Some of them, the southern Democrats, but understand. Yeah. Yeah. That the the Republicans are the ones that were trying to free the slaves. It's like things just get weird and get reversed. So now the Democrats are anti-free speech if it's hate speech. Yeah. And disinformation and misinformation and malinformation. And this is all right. This is the Castro speech in a big way. This is Castro. So they ban it. The revolution takes over in Cuba. They ban a film. They haven't had to ban a film up to that point, but they ban the first film. And Castro comes and gives like a two-hour speech to the intellectuals explaining why they're going to start banning movies. What was the film? It was called PM. It was a It was just a film about like poor black people having a good time. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of uh political content in the movie. But he gives this like it's this long beautiful like two 3,000 words at the top going I'm listening to you and you're listening to me and isn't that great that we have a conversation and then just out of nowhere he goes uh the revolution's in control and your freedoms are not. You don't have a right to make whatever film you want. We're going to decide and people are clapping and going for but if you like if you take revolution and sub that out for progress or safety or anti-racism people would totally get behind that. Yes. And this is what everyone who's been sounding the horn, you know, including guys like Constantine Kissing from Trigonometry and Jordan Peterson and people that understand the history of Marxism. They're like, \"This is how it always comes. It comes in the guise of doing the greater good for the people and letting the state control things. This is what happened in North Korea. That's how they all lost their farms.\" Yeah. Yeah. They come in and then they it's centralized power and then everybody has to shut the [ __ ] up because that's how people operate. I think from a like if you have a materialist worldview of the universe that makes sense. I can see how you would you would get there. Like it's a weird thing to say God has given you a right to express yourself and to hang out with who you want. This is like a we this is this is why it has to be in the declar what is it's either in the declaration or the constitution. But like these are god-given rights and they're self-evident because you would if you were designing a utopia which is what every revolutionary wants to do. You're saying we're fixing society. We're fixing human nature right? There's nothing that would intrinsically make you say people have a right to say whatever they want. Like that has to come from somewhere. That's like a That's a weird It's beautiful. I love it. I try and live my It comes from being under the brutal heel of a dictator for the entire country. But then as soon as they have a revolution, they take that away. You know, you use the weapon of your master. The revolutionaries having been under Batista and oppressed and not allowed to say what they want, they come to power and they go, \"Yeah, we're going to be doing that now.\" That's what the guy in power gets to do. But to say the state is seing that this is like a beautiful strange Well, isn't there a difference outside world view? Yes, this is. But isn't there a difference between taking over an existing country like Cuba that had been around for a long time? Yeah. A communist regime taking over versus the establishment of a place like the United States, which is an exercise like an experiment really in self-government that never been achieved before. And it's not a coincidence that it's the newest country in terms of like superpowers and yet it's the one that's achieved the most in terms of cultural impact, artistic impact, intellectual impact. It's a hard argument that United States hasn't achieved more than anybody. I mean, the [ __ ] nuclear bomb was created here, you know, shut your mouth, right? Allegedly, we went to the moon. I don't think we did, but allegedly back on the moon. Yeah. I don't think I think we did. Um but you know also a lot of assassinations, a lot of like overturning governments and other countries. A lot a lot of [ __ ] Yeah, that's not good. But the point is like this is the most free place and the most [ __ ] gets done. [Music] I mean I don't disagree with that at all. And I think this is the progress that the human civilization goes through. It realizes that suppression ultimately is bad for everybody. It's bad for GDP, bad for like it's bad for patriotism. It's bad for everything. Yeah. It's bad for people's appreciation of each other. It's it's hard to govern when people are [ __ ] angry. And and then the breakoff civilizations always seek more freedom. Yeah. You know, I think we got to try one more time with Greenland. Give it a go. I think if Trump takes Greenland and global warming is real, that's the spot. Well, Canada might have to become a state and then there's a lot of good land up there. I have a friend who went up uh to Greenland and went um stag hunting or caribou hunting. They hunt caribou in Greenland. It was beautiful, man. The area they were at was [ __ ] gorgeous. It was incredible. There's like these these insane hills and these herd of caribou come through and there's just so many caribou. It's so beautiful. Yeah. It's so clean. They're just they're camping. They're sleeping on the ground. Chick-fil-A up there. No. [ __ ] it. Get a freeway and a Chick-fil-A. You ever have caribou? No. I can't compete with Chick-fil-A. You don't know what you're talking about. I know. I've never had caribou. All right. I want to go back. This thing of like Yeah. America's done a great deal. It's very free. But like the rate of change in the culture is also unparalleled. Like you look at the Egyptians and they're doing the same pictures for thousands of the feet all point in the same way and we don't mess with the artistic style or like the medieval era. There's like a there's a homogeneity through time and a culture that gets passed on. If you look at America over the last 70 years, it's wacky. Mhm. Like I know a couple nights ago I was I was watching like the number one song in America consecutively on YouTube. So like they play 20 seconds from that number one song and then the next number one song. And early on it's all like guys in suits going my baby. She's so beautiful. I love her. I'm going to take her to a dance and then by the end it's like you know I'm a fisty ass and kill someone with my rifle. Like it's there's a huge shift got like all the institutions are ostensibly the same. The way people vote, the way people go to school, the actual culture that's inhabiting all those things is like radically changing all the time. All the time. Yeah. And there's a bunch of different factors, right? So you have the 1950s factor, you know, which was like Elvis on television and Buddy Holly and all these people. Then the drugs come in. Then the drugs come in. And so they were probably doing drugs back then too, but just probably not the good ones. And then the 1960s psychedelics. So in the 1960s you get Hendrickx, you know, you get the Doors, you get Oh, when the Doors come through, when the Beatles and the Doors and the Stones come through, it's like here are the first cool people ever, first cool people ever. And so then that all dries up when they pass the laws in the 1970s through the Nixon administration to kill the civil rights movement and to kill the anti-war movement to make everything illegal. Then you get the cocaine era. So cocaine ruins music. The 1980s was like there's some great music in the '8s, but there's also is a great album. There's a lot of horseshit in the 80s, too. There's still still brilliant artists. There's always going to be brilliant artists, but there's a lack of that psychedelic progression that Hendrick definitely shifts into a weird Everything gets weird. Everything gets weird. Yeah. And but by the 80s, late ' 80s, they figured it out. They figured out how to appropriate the counterculture thing and put a corporate look on it. Well, it was cocaine. They they they killed they killed the psychedelics and it entered into an area of cocaine. Like you see movies get real weird. Like a lot of movies are like like real stupid. Like they don't make any sense. They're dumb as [ __ ] And then you go back to like 1963 and you see The Hustler and you say, \"Okay, why were they so good back then? Why why were so many of these movies so early, late 20s?\" Yeah. Early Frank Kapper just watches like a normal modern film. Yeah, there's some great movies, man. When you started comedy, what is this early 90s? 88. 88. So you there would have been a period like it seems like cocaine was big in American comedy circles for a time and then retreated. Yeah. But it it disappeared at a certain It doesn't disappear everywhere. There's some places that are still they love the coke. I don't run into active drug addicts very often. Well, people do cocaine. They don't last. The the weed comics last. The [ __ ] coke comics don't last. Heroin people keep going. Well, until they don't. Yeah, but the red hot chili peppers look great. They've been preserved. They're clean. I think they're clean for a long time. I think they did back in from time to time. You think so? I don't know. I I think after By the way, I think they But they were a heroin band for ages. Yeah. Iggy Pop. I don't know if he's still on heroin, but he's looking Oh, he's terrible. Poor Iggy. He looks so But he looked that way 30 years ago. He's like Alice Cooper. He looked like a weird guy. He looked but he looked old 30 years ago, but he had like he was lean. He moved around on stage with a shirt off, but now he looks like he could barely walk. Yeah. guys. Like something's wrong with his Did you see the AC/DC one? That was like last week. You got to see Iggy Pop first. How bad? I saw Iggy Pop like 10 years ago and he was great. He's great. No, dude. I I had to kick a woman in a mosh pit. I was He was dragging people. He was saying, \"Come on stage, everybody.\" And I One of my favorite green room songs is Passenger. Yeah. [ __ ] great song, man. After the show, I couldn't listen to Passenger before a show. I'd be too sad. Really? Yeah. All right. All right. I'm a passenger. Um, what's he look like now? Is he Is this 2023? Yeah, he still looks good in the face. No, no. Like he's still killing it. It's just he has a hard time getting around. It looks like there's something wrong with his See, like it does look like he's got spinobipid in there. I think he's got something wrong with his hip or something, which is super common, especially for\n\n\nPerformers who dance around on stage a lot. Go crazy.\nYeah.\nOh, yeah. See?\nOh, so he's having a hard time moving.\nStill killing it, but like, let me hear some of that. Check out after that.\nBring up the AC/DC at the moment. It's very\n[Applause]\nOkay. He's very old.\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nIt's just he's still got something.\nHe's got it. He's still Iggy Pop, but his body's struggling. And like I know a lot of guys like Ted Nent had to get both his knees replaced because he was jumping off amplifiers. Yeah.\nUm, Maynard from Tulle, he had to get his hip replaced. His hip was [ __ ] up.\nThat's why Neil Diamond had the right plan. Just stand there.\nStand there.\nJust sing your beautiful songs. You can do that forever.\nYeah, it's a good move.\nUh no, they all get\nIt's hard, man. You're bouncing around on a stage all the time, stomping the ground. Like Anthony Ketus, his knees all [ __ ] up, man. Ah, he like I I went to see them. Great.\nHe's great. He killed it. We went to see the Chili Peppers when they were in town and then afterwards he's got an ice his knee up real bad.\nYou know, he's still on stage though.\nYou don't notice it.\nEvery time someone says they don't like the Chili Peppers, I distrust them immediately.\nThey're great.\nSuck my Kiss is a [ __ ] great\nThat whole album is start to finish.\nI found a different video of them. AC/DC shirts. I think that one video we saw was just kind of weird thing. He looks all right. There was one. He looks okay in this one.\n2025. Yeah, there was a viral video going around where they looked a little slow and\nno, he's still got it. I take it back.\nBut this is I mean, if you were a classical composer, you just get to be old and wear your big powdered wig and keep writing till you're 80. As a rock star, a big part of it is that you physically threatening and that women want to have sex with you, right? Like this is this is\nHave you seen Have you seen Mick Jagger's girlfriend?\nUh, yes. She's a beautiful baby. She's so hot.\nShe's so hot. She's so hot. And she's like 30 or something like that. And he's thousand.\nI got to meet Aluccino's baby mama.\nBut but you got to see the pictures of Mick with the girl.\nLook at this.\nYeah. This is the one.\nWhat's that?\nThis is the one that went viral.\nBut he's just stomping on stage.\nIt's the way he's saying Oi. Wow.\nLet me hear it.\nAC/DC urged to retire after recent concert footage goes viral. [ __ ] we hear this.\nHe does seem tired. I don't think he should have to retire, but\nstill play a long set. He probably is doing all right.\nThat's our greatest export.\nThat's for sure. We've never done anything that great before since.\nListen, guys get old. It's hard to come up with the the full power always when you hit that age. But what was the point? Oh, MC Jagger and his new girlfriend.\nHe's Fly Honey.\nOh, she's so hot. And he's at least a million years old.\nHe\nHow old is he?\nYeah, I got to see him like 10 years ago and he seemed old then, but he was still grooving.\nOh, dude. I saw him in town as well. I saw him at uh the Circuit of the Americas. They did this gigantic outdoor concert. It was [ __ ] incredible. Look at her. Bam. Son, what's up now? Dude, she's so hot.\nAnd she's like, I can't believe I'm with MC Jagger. That's what talent does.\nHe seems happy as well. He seems\nI would imagine that would make you happy.\nI mean, yeah, but then she's talking about her young woman things and you just want to read the Financial Times in peace. And\nI don't know, man. Maybe maybe that's why he's so good still. Maybe he stays young.\nHe's still hip.\nThey [ __ ] killed it, man. They killed it at Kota Aluccino. I She was backstage and I\nAnother kid\nI got another one.\nYeah,\nanother one.\nI got dragged away when I met her cuz people thought I was going to ask weird stuff.\nSo, this is a new gal.\nYeah.\nOh, boy.\nHe's 85. Holy.\nHe still looks good.\nWhat do you want me to do?\nShe's got a great I mean\nWow, she's hot.\nIt does start to look like your Oh, they split. I think that's the one I meant.\nThat was the one that he split with, but he's got another one.\nWow.\nGood for him.\nHe loves breeding. He's still out there doing it.\nListen, don't give Elon [ __ ] Don't give him [ __ ]\nI just like it done the oldfashioned way. I like the Genghask Khan rooting his way across the step. I'm I fear.\nAlso, like Elon's in he's one of the only billionaires who allows himself to be seen and judged and thought about.\nBut if we had a list of the top hundred richest people in the world, we would know\neight of them. Like these are the hidden figures who are doing that. That's\nWell, the real richest people in the world are probably the oil bill,\nthe SS.\nYeah. Because they don't even have to tell you how much money they have.\nYeah. Once they're building an ice\nYeah.\nWhat a toboggoning room in the desert.\nBro, they they're building that that the line. Have you seen that? Like\nthat's going to be nice.\nMaybe it will be. They have so much money. They can make it nice.\nYeah. Look what they did to Dubai. You ever see those timelapse photos of Dubai?\nBut they didn't even put you can't even go to the toilet in that in the Burj Khalifa.\nWhat do you mean?\nThey didn't put like It's so big they couldn't get plumbing to work it. So they have like trucks come along and pick up the poo from downstairs every day and have to drive it out. Like it seems like a fake.\nOh, that's an error. Someone needs to be fired. Somebody's probably killed.\nSomeone has uh has been quietly chopped into pieces.\nOh, 100%. Right. They've got\nbecause how are you going to fix that?\nThe Burge Khif is like how many stories?\nIt's too big\nand it's all buckets of [ __ ] being carried out.\nI believe I could be getting that wrong, but someone told me that they have like semi-trailers that come by in the morning.\nAn old hoax.\nIs it a ho? I take it back. I got one wrong. I was right about the footbinding. I was right about\nWe should probably edit that out so they don't kill you.\nNo, it's Hey, I No, I love the kingdom of SA. I'm a big fan. I could be God on Compromat so easily. Send me a new car.\nI'll say great things about the regime.\nNo one has come to me. Not even someone selling dick pills or nothing. I want to get to that level.\nIt's coming.\nIt's uh I I don't see I\nCome on, bro. More more appearances like this and\nit'll all happen.\nI'd be doing gamble. I'll be doing DraftKings.\nYeah, there you go.\nI don't think I could I'm trying to figure out what companies I would have on my podcast and I wouldn't. But\ndo you gamble at all?\nYeah, but I don't like the companies. I like, you know,\nregular gambling.\nRegular. Oh, but yeah, money for this.\nIt's ruined footy in Australia.\nEverybody,\nI think we're the Now, I will I will write on this with Australia's the highest per capita gambling losses in the world.\nWow.\nAnd it's we beat Singapore. We shouldn't be beaten the Asian countries. Asians should have gambling down pat.\nIs that because you don't have freedom in any other place? So, you went crazy.\nI think so. I think everything is so safe that it's like I've got to lose everything on this.\nYou go crazy on that one thing. The gambling thing. Yeah.\nOh, no. cuz booze is expensive. And but then the way that they advertise on you, you always have to see the line.\nYou can't watch a game of football with someone cuz they go they don't just want their team to win anymore. They want like this guy to get 27 disposals and the second goal of the game. It's like just I want to watch footy. But gambling is very exciting.\nYeah, there's a thing like that in MMA, too. You know, it's a it's a big factor in MMA.\nI think like if your guy gets, you know, he wins but by submission, then you're upset because you didn't knock the other guy out and you lost money. There's like the Drake thing too because Drake spent he he bets like the rapid big money on the UFC and\ndid he bet on Charles Olivera or Ilia Toporia?\nThat was nutty.\nOh my god.\nI wish that Also, it was uh\nthat was the first one of those I've since I met you.\nHe bet 200 grand on Charles.\nYeah, see that's they call it the Drake Curse.\nYeah, there's a website that whoever he bets on goes down.\nYeah, Drake betting history\nreturned zero dollars. Um, who is he?\nHe's not cursed. When it comes to UFC overall, though, he's up a million bucks.\nOh, all time from his public UFC bets, from his public ones. Over 25 bets, he's wagered 13.45 million, returning 14.48.\nYeah, but everyone knows.\nHe's won 10 out of those 25 bets, losing 15 times.\nYou go public when you win.\nInteresting.\nIt's a guy who comes back to the office on Monday and goes, \"Look at that. He's only won 40% of the time. His average UFC bet size is 538K.\nThat's interesting though because he's only won 40% of the time. He just bets big when he's sure and so he's ahead.\nHis biggest single loss was uh Adosnagna to beat Alex Pereira in 22. The one that uh Pereira won the first one. Single bet victory was Jon Jones over serial gone.\nSuccessfully uh predicting Jon Jones to win by submission. Interesting.\nHold on. But this is a whole website dedicated to it. He could have set this up.\nNo. No. It's commonly known.\nHe's betting on cricket.\nYeah.\nWhy is he betting on cricket?\nHe likes to bet, dude. He's rich as [ __ ] He gets his jollies off like throwing large numbers at stuff.\nThree bets on cricket returning 2.65 mil.\nSo he's ahead.\nThree for three. So he knows what he's doing.\nThere you go.\nHe's making money.\nYeah, but you always bet on the Royals in the cricket.\nWell, if you're going to bet though, betting on sports where you actually know the game. Yes, that's a smart thing to bet on. Like I bet if I bet on fighting,\nI bet I'd be right 60% of the time.\nYou'd be There'd be a You'd have a deal where they'd say, \"Don't you dare.\"\nOh, no, you can't. The UFC won't let you. But that was only recent, man. That was recent because there was an accusation that one of the trainers had been posting on some website and um that they knew that this guy was injured.\nYeah. And the guy lost in the first round and there's a bunch of money that's not on him losing in the first round cuz he had a blown out knee.\nI think there was a footie player in Australia who was betting on himself to kick goals which was like not like you have to he was backing himself and it was like $15 or something. It was very small but he just\nhe got in trouble for that.\nHe got in trouble for that even though like\nhe's betting on himself. He's bet on himself to do well.\nI think if you bet on yourself to win, that should be legal.\nIt seems I bet on the Eurovvision Song Contest. That's my go-to.\nFighters have made like personal bets with each other. Like I'll bet you the entire first. Yeah, that's that's what makes it more exciting.\nYeah. But there's definitely room for if if if there's room for someone to throw it, that's an issue.\nThat is an issue. That's an issue with fights. Eurovision is a good bet.\nIf you found out that a fighter bet against himself, like, oh god. Or if the trainer bet against the fighter, which has happened before. That has happened before.\nIt was like anonymous back in the day, like in the old boxing days, like people could throw fights and you know that that [ __ ] happened all the time.\nUh was it on the waterfront? That's why.\nYep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Marlin Brando. Yeah.\nThat also um that that has 100% happened in MMA, especially in Japan. In Japan in the early days, there was a lot of fixed fights and you could kind of tell some of them. You watch them, you're like, \"Oh my god, it's fixed.\" But it was be like because a lot of the Japanese stars originally in Pride came from the world of pro wrestling.\nYes.\nWhere they had determined outcomes.\nAnd so some of these guys were stars and there's a few fights that they had as stars where it was a fixed fight.\nBut like that that Logan Paul uh Mike Tyson fight.\nYeah.\nHe could have knocked him out earlier and clearly was choosing not to. I mean he bows to him at the end.\nIt seemed to me like sparring.\nYeah. when I watched it, which you know, look, I paid for it. They got me. I thought it was going to be a real fight, but I'm not mad because I'm just happy that Mike Tyson made a ton of money and I'm happy for Jake Paul that he made it and and look, if he decided not to try to hurt Mike Tyson at 58 years old, sure, but there's some guy out there who had a million dollars on\nThat's the problem. That's why, look, maybe it was a real fight. Maybe that's just the level that they both fight at.\nHm.\nBut, you know, it seemed it seemed a little sus,\nyou know,\nit was I mean, we watched that in the green room, I think, and we couldn't get it couldn't get it going.\nYeah. But I think that, you know,\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it's okay. It doesn't bother me. It's a different, that's a different situation than someone like Terence Crawford fighting Canelo Alvarez. And I don't think that that fight's legit. If I saw that and I didn't think it was legit, I'd be furious. Like, you guys are in your prime. These are the best fighters on planet Earth. We finally gonna get to see you guys box and then you threw a fight. But that's not what's going on. You know, Mike Tyson Jake Paul was the most heavily wagered fight in years. Okay, that's a problem. That makes it a problem.\n\nUm, my opinion is I just want to say in case someone calls me into court, um, I'm a [ __ ] idiot and I don't know nothing. And don't take my advice. I love the Saudis. Don't take my opinion. I love the Israeli government. I love that nothing to do with them. That was Jake Paul promoting it. You know, it's just like but doesn't bother me. There's compromising the sport and that's like bad. It's just like if I bet on it watching it with people who have who are so in on it and then also the like man the sports betting apps they've like they introduced like chat apps in them in Australia. So it's like they're trying to take the place of social media companies where you go together and you meet your friends. Like betting should be exciting enough without having a weird, they're just trying to draw. They're just trying to make money, right? So they're trying to draw you in any way they can. Yeah.\n\nYeah. When I was uh first starting to work for the UFC, um I bet a bunch of times because uh and then I thought like I probably shouldn't do this. But I couldn't I was think I was justifying in my head. I was like I can't affect the outcome. Yeah. And it wasn't a there was no rule. It doesn't matter how you're calling it. It's not going to I'm not going to change. And also like I like the fights and I'm not going to bet that much anyway. But then my business partner on it and I, Aubrey, he would bet on things I would tell him to bet on. He was up like 80% at one time. Yeah.\n\nBecause in the o early days, like in the early like 2000sish when they were bringing in guys from like Japan and Russia, there was a lot of dudes that I knew about that the bookmakers didn't know about. Yeah. You know, like where like like when Anderson Silva come came over to America, I was like, \"Bet the house. Bet everything on Anderson.\" I mean, bet everything cuz Chris Leeben, who's a great fighter, is tailorade for that style. Anderson is one of the nastiest strikers that's ever competed in the sport. He's so good and so accurate and he just ran through Chris Chris Leeben in the first round. I was like called it cuz there's certain fights where you like this guy's special like Ilia Taporia, like if I is fighting a regular guy like bet the house on the Spaniard. Bet the house like that guy's special. There's like when Alex Pereira first came to the UFC I was telling everybody bet the house on the Brazilian. I'm like, if he touches you, you go into orbit. Yeah. Like he's just different. This is a different guy. And you just have to know about that before the bookies and then you can Yeah. But people knew about Pereira sort of, but they didn't have a lot of evidence of him being that good in MMA. They had one fight in the LFA. There was another fight before that where he lost by submission. I think maybe had one other win, but it was the kickboxing. So, I'm a big kickboxing fan. And in kickboxing, he was a two division world champion in glory, which is like the the elite kickboxing league. But the thing wasn't that he was winning. It was how he was winning. Yeah. He was flatlining people. But you have to have actually watched the fight to get that. You'd have to wa You have to also be able to critically analyze his movements. They're just different. He's just doing something. He moves different than people. And the the the way when he hits guys, it's like, \"Holy [ __ ] man. Yeah, they can all knock each other out. They're all elite fighters. I mean, the last I watched that Olivea fight and so I was we were with Nate Nate's team in uh in San Jose. Someone says this man's the man who knocked him out. He's like his punch is incredible. No one knows this like within the they were all saying like this is an easy an Oliver is going to lose because of this man's. And then when he hits him in the head, you go because he knocks him out on the first punch and then catches him on the second and hits him twice after that. But it's like If you just I don't know about fighting and then watching that I couldn't believe he was knocked out from it didn't look like it should have had that impact. Oh, it should for sure. Yeah. When you watch the punch being delivered in slow motion, it looks everything like a knockout punch. He throws his punches with so much conviction. There's so much torque and they're so perfect. Like his whole body weight is coming in. It's the the coordination of the mechanics of his movements. So like that's a big part of he also has very big fists but that's a big part especially for 145 and even in 155 like he's unders sized compared to like guys like Rofy who's like 6'2 there's like some elite guys that are big in that weight class but the way he delivers his punches it's like you just can't get hit by him man he's got so much commitment and so the the timing is so perfect when he went blam with that right hand that had everything on it no buns has eaten that shot. No one. No one. He's got the what Ferasa Hobby likes to call the touch of death. It's a perfect name for it cuz like he hits guys, they're just done, man. They're done. That seems the greatest threeight win streak in the history of the sport. He knocks out Alexander Vulcganowski, Max Holloway, and then Charles Olivera. It's the greatest threeight win streak in the history of the sport. And Vulcanowski is currently the champ. So he'll he is now he is now he came back but that's at 45 though. Okay. So he went up to 55. So Vulcganowski is the champ because he abandoned the belt at 45 because he wanted to pursue the belt at 55. He didn't want to make weight at Ilia. Didn't want to make 145 anymore. Except felt like it's too draining. Yeah. For his body and he'd be even better at 55. Turns out he was right. He's even better at 55. Like Charles Alivera is really good, man. Really good. For him to starch him like that with essentially one punch is extraordinary. But he called it, which is even crazier. He said, \"I'm going to knock him out with one punch. He's going to knock him out in the first round.\" And he also he had a celebration for his victory the night before the fight. So he went to a restaurant. He's standing on a bench. They're cheering. That is cool. It worked. I mean, listen, if you're that good and he's going to fight the the Scouseer, the Scouseer kept saying, \"Yeah, Scout kept going, I want him.\" And then Nate's team are going like, he thinks he wants him, he doesn't want him. It'll probably happen eventually because they hate each other and it'll be very marketable. I don't know if it's going to happen next. This is my first year following it. I'm I'm starting that. My brother watches it a lot. There's a lot of really good guys at 155 though. If you wanted to look if you wanted to do it according to like who deserves the shot, it would be in my mind it would be either Justin Gatey, who is a very compelling argument for uh deserving the shot. He was uh the interim champion. Beat the [ __ ] He essentially like changed the progression of Tony Ferguson's career. Like that one just by knocking him out. Just beat him down, man. It was a brutal, brutal fight. And then, you know, I mean, he's got so many victories. He just beat Faze again after getting knocked out by Holloway. He's one of the best of the best. And, you know, he's fought for the title before. He fought uh he fought um uh Kabib. Like he's [ __ ] really good, man. But what would stop him? And he's a big star and he also deserves it. The other guy would be Arman Sarukian. Arman Sarukian was supposed to fight Islam for the title, but got a back injury supposedly during because of the weight cut. He had a particularly brutal weight cut and his back locked up to the point where he couldn't even [ __ ] move. And so they had to call the fight. Yeah. And so then they brought in Hanato Moano and he fought for the title like last minute replacement. So Sukian is elite. He's as good as it gets and he could be a world champion. And so if if I wanted to do it according to not marketability but rather like who deserves it, it would be either Gage or Saruki. How often does that come into it as opposed to the marketability? I don't I don't do that, man. That's the thing. It's like I'm not involved. I I would not be the right guy for the business. Yeah, cuz like I would I would I'm kind of a purist. I feel like if you're the number one contender, you get the shot. Like that's how I feel. But I also don't know if I agree who the number one contender is all the time. I think like that should be up for debate. Like it's very subjective like who decides like what victories count for more or who would be more compelling to fight for the title, who deserves it. Like some guys have to fight a ton of guys and then other guys like Pereira, he got a shot at Adisagna like just a few fights in. Yeah. But this is what then kills this hurts boxing is when like you have a champ who just repeatedly takes on people that they can walk over to extend there's a little bit of that the victory but because the UFC is all it's one thing the UFC makes you fight the big fights and if you don't want to fight the big fights like Jon Jones didn't want to fight Tom Aspenol like then they can strip him well he didn't didn't strip him just retired but I think Jon just decided to retire legitimately I think he's you know he's partying a lot he had a long career career and he's the greatest of all time. Like at a certain point in time, you have to say enough. And at 37 as the heavyweight champion, retiring undefeated, that's probably a good move. You know, he's got one loss, but it's a [ __ ] Have you seen those late Muhammad Ali interviews where he's going back? He's going back again. And people are begging him. You don't have to do this. It's over. It's fine that it's over. You're the greatest. Any money, man? How did he not have any money? Cuz he got ripped off. He got ripped off, man. He got ripped off. And a lot of these like wild impulsive dudes, they spend all their money. Like Tyson spent hundreds of millions. Yeah. He bought Tigers and [ __ ] He was joking around about it. He had Lamborghinis and Tigers and mansions. He had a mansion in Ohio that he just abandoned. What? And like you could go like there was an online tour of this mansion and you can go and like online like someone broke into the mansion, took photos of it and everything. There's a guy who did that with Kanye's mansion in LA recently. There's an Aussie. He's written a book about John Saffron, who's one of our best. Really? Uh yeah, he wrote a book about He trespassed. He wrote a book about squatting in Kanye's mansion. He was like, you could just come in through the shrubs out the back. And I finished the book sitting in Kanye's house. He was always doing wild stuff. He was uh he was a filmmaker. He like ran naked through the streets of Jerusalem, I think. Jesus Christ. Uh what else did he got crucified in the Philippines? Crucified like on a cross. Yeah. Like at Easter they they ritualistic. They really drive nails through your hands, but they crucify people in the Philippines. Yeah, he did that. He did that. He went and got for the end for the season finale of one of his shows, he got crucified in the Philippines. Oh my god, what a [ __ ] nut. He's wild. He's a very exciting What's his name? John Saffron. Yeah, he is the man. He had Sounds like he'd be a good podcast guest. He stole a lot of Eurasian women's underpants to see if he liked the smell of them better. Oh, [ __ ] this guy. Why? Stealing chicks underwear. No. And he like he took other underpants that were not Eurasian to see if he was attracted to he he stole his Eurasian friends underpants. Jewish Australian comedian journalist. That's a lot. Yeah. Uh spent a week living in one of West's homes in Los Angeles. This what he as if Kanye didn't hate Jews enough. Well, this might I've never heard him speak on this. I've never heard him speak on John. Isn't it kind of funny though that a Jewish guy is the guy who squatted in his house? I think that's why he did it. I think he was like, \"Oh, that's hilarious.\" No, he's wild. He's hilarious. Yeah, he was that's crazy. Now that he's writing books, but his Yeah, his documentary series were great. He was in a show called Race Around the World, and everyone else would like take it very seriously. They had like six aspiring filmmakers. You know what the nuttiest spending of money was? Was um Evander Evander Holyfield, who was the heavyweight champion of the world. He made the biggest [ __ ] house. It was an insanely huge house. And then uh I think he sold it to Rick Ross, the rapper. But it's the the house is insane. I don\n\n\nI don't know how much it cost. I mean, I don't know how much it cost. I'm, I'm, I would, I don't even want to guess, but it's the craziest house I've ever seen in my life. It's like a house that you would say, \"If I'm the baddest [ __ ] on earth, I want the baddest [ __ ] house on earth.\"\n\nIs he a gypsy?\n\nHe's a Vander Holyfield.\n\nI don't know.\n\nYou don't know who Vander Holyfield is? Oh my god. One of the greatest heavyweights of all time. Have you seen the gypsy? He beat Mike Tyson.\n\nVander Holyfield beat Mike Tyson when he was Mike Tyson. very little about he knocked him out. He stopped him and then he went and bought a and then Mike Tyson bit his ear off.\n\nOh, he was the ear biting guy. The ear biting guy. That was the second fight. I didn't know about the ear bit. That was after Tyson beat him up in the first fight. In the second fight, he bit his ear.\n\nWas he losing the second fight before?\n\nTyson was losing. Okay, that's why I did.\n\nBut show, show Vander Holyfield's house. Look at this place, bro. 44,234 square ft and has 109 rooms. actually very tasty. Including 13 35 ft, uh, excuse me, 135 seat theater, a bowling alley, and a dining room that accommodates 100 people.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nSo large they named the highway on which it sits a Vander Holyfield highway.\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nThat's a, that's, I thought it would be bad for me.\n\nNo, it's not bad. No, it's gorgeous. It cost 200, estimated worth of 230 million in '94.\n\nLook at that. The wood paneling.\n\nIn '94 around that time, he had an estim, oh, excuse me. Around that time, he had an estimated worth of 230 million. Uh, it's, it's an amazing house. I mean, it's [ __ ] spectacular. And now Rick Ross the rapper lives there, which is like the perfect rapper house.\n\nYou got to spend it on.\n\nBut see if you can get photos of, oh, it's gorgeous. It's, and it's a giant piece of land, too. I think it's 100, yeah, 105 acres. Um, see if you can see an image of it from the, yeah, there, that, that one where you see, like, look at that. It does look like the Georgia sun.\n\nIf you're a Vander Holfield, that's the kind of house you want to live in when you're the baddest [ __ ] alive. Look at that place. So beautiful.\n\nI get hung up on Holyfield.\n\nYeah.\n\nI, the yachts. I like looking at the super yachts. I look like a Jeff Bezos super yacht.\n\nOh, they're nuts. But this house is [ __ ] incredible. You'd feel so lonely.\n\nRick Ross about buffaloos and [ __ ] to put on.\n\nYou have your friends live in there.\n\nYeah, but you got buffaloos. You see them every third day.\n\nOh, that's cool. He's got his own buffaloos. That's dope as [ __ ]. That's such a rapper move. Have your own buffaloos on your property.\n\nI love it. Rick Ross thanks his neighbors for helping him return his buffaloos.\n\nRick Buffalo just hanging out.\n\nThey wandered over helping him return his wander buffalo. He had to hire some cowboys to bring his [ __ ] animals back home.\n\nYeah. No one needs that.\n\nWhy not? Maybe. Maybe you do. Maybe if you become [ __ ] huge and you start doing arenas in America and you develop an insane amount of money and all a sudden you got giraffes at your house, and I got to say, very hard to say no to what the [ __ ]. I thought you weren't going to go full Rick Ross.\n\nNo, I mean, I, I would go, I feel very lucky that I got to open for Shane and he lives very humbly.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, but like Matt still drives his old car. No, I'll be getting a big fancy car.\n\nYou're going to go crazy.\n\nI would like a Rolls-Royce. Jane lives humbly, but he's also got a Mercedes S-Class. Tyson's house.\n\nHe, this is Mike Tyson's house. They got abandoned.\n\nGiant TV.\n\nOh, somebody. It looks like somebody broke.\n\nOh, yeah. They broke, I mean, it was abandoned for a long time, so they broke all the [ __ ].\n\nThat's crazy. So, people just would break into his house when he wasn't there. So, did he just leave it there or did he just...\n\nWell, I mean, he probably was trying to sell it and no one bought it. So, that makes it abandoned. You know, there, I think Michael Jordan's house, he sold at a loss because of everything he done to it. Some guy just actually bought it and was trying to make it an Airbnb.\n\nHe tried to take the shoe gate off. He'd like the gate was a pair of Jordans with him.\n\nThat house is only worth 1.1 million. That's how crazy.\n\nAfter it's out forever.\n\nThat's a steal.\n\nOh, after it's out for how much work you have to do to fix it back up, bro. If I lived in that town and I found out Mike Tyson's house is for sale, I'd be like, \"Let's go.\"\n\nThere's been a lot of...\n\nYou think so?\n\nIn Ohio.\n\nIn the abandoned mansion. Yeah, but I'll just use some sage. I'll clear that out of there. Someone did sage last night backstage.\n\nHe left in...\n\nThere was an odor backstage last night and I came off stage sage and I, yeah. God working scary said we burned sage. I didn't know there was a big sage.\n\nSomeone evil in the room that...\n\nI think someone might have just, uh, I won't, I won't name who it was, but someone might have left a terrible smell.\n\nOh.\n\nI think someone was, uh...\n\nThat definitely happens in that room. There's a lot of people eating weird food that gets delivered to that room.\n\nYeah. I mean, I, oh, man. Cam Patterson. I don't want to, I should have said just a guy. I shouldn't have added it as Cam Patterson. But when, no, when he headlined, he bought, like, he bought, like, enough fried chicken for 50 people and it was just me and his in whole. It was like one of the first times I was hanging out with all black people in America. I just quietly whizzing.\n\nGus's. Did they get it from Gus's?\n\nI, it was like, no, I don't know where it was from. It was huge and it was beautiful. And I thought, I didn't know we had to do that in headlining. Do we have to get food for everybody?\n\nNo, we don't have to. You could definitely order food if you ever want a headline there. We'll order you food.\n\nWell, I, man, I have had good meals in that green room.\n\nYeah, me too. We get, uh, Terry Blacks delivered right there.\n\nWe'd have not a damn chance, not a damn chance burgers.\n\nBrian Simpson ordered ramen and didn't want to eat the eggs. Everyone looked at me funny for eating it. He said, \"I don't want these.\" I said, \"I, I'll eat that. I'm hungry.\"\n\nWhy not, man?\n\nThere's also, it's kind of a food. There's a pizza place next door. There's Chick-fil-A way down the road. There's a really good taco truck up the street, too.\n\nThe, and the Diddy Dog is good. There's a lot of things in vans, but I am more suspicious of eating out of trucks and vans now than I used to be. I've had enough exp, what I like is the Mexicans doing the weird hot dogs with like what they've got huge onions and capsicum.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nI...\n\nhot, hot sauce guy.\n\nI love, I just like those men with, like, a thousand things on a little hot plate. There's less of them now there than there used to be, but who can say why? I hope they come back.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nIt's, uh, that was what I'd always like, there was always a contingent of the American, like, people chatting on cable news who would say that illegal immigration wasn't a huge thing and that people were inflating the numbers. And then when I got here and I, no one warned me, but I was like setting up a house and I went to a Home Depot in the morning and it was like, I was like 150 guys just out there. This, I mean, this is old hat and Americans don't talk about it anymore because you've just all known for decades that this is what happens out in front of a Home Depot.\n\nWell, especially LA. If you go to LA, it was, it was way higher numbers in LA. I think Texas actually has some pretty high numbers, too, though.\n\nThey just, they have to figure out a pathway to citizenship for these folks and amnesty for people that have been here and established.\n\nGetting in the front door is a [ __ ].\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd also a lot of those people are good people. Good people. Hard workers. What I liked is that the, the hombres out front of the Home Depot, a lot of them wearing, like, pro-American gear, like big American hats and bald eagle shirts and things. So, it's like, I'm going to be the most pro-American.\n\nYeah. Well, they just need a pathway. Let's make sure that they're not cartel members and criminals and murderers. That seems easy.\n\nYeah, it seems like it's doable. And it, it's also, they're valuable. Like these are people that come over here with ambition. That's what this country wants. They want a better life. There's so, like, I think if you pled Americans, like, huge numbers of people would support that.\n\nI agree.\n\nSo why doesn't anybody...\n\nIt's a good question.\n\nWhy can't anybody get it together?\n\nWell, the thing is, it was so, I think it's an overcorrection because it was so bad for the last four years where they had an open border and they were encouraging people to come in.\n\nThey were encouraging people. They were helping people. They were moving people to swing states. The problem is when you have...\n\nThey were admitting it. I watched the Fedman one where he was going, \"Yeah, I mean, it's what you got to do.\" Yeah, admit it.\n\nThis is crazy.\n\nIt's crazy because the thing is, it affects elections in more ways than one. Even if they can't vote, it affects the amount of congressional seats. Yeah. Dependent upon the population, regardless of whether that population is legal or illegal. So, if you have 20 million people living in a place, you get a certain amount of congressional, regardless of if they're registered. I mean, that's, that's where things get weird. That's the reality of politics in America. And they wanted to stop that. And the Democrats did not. The de, the Democrats wanted that to keep going. That was one of the things that Trump ran on.\n\nBut then also he gets in, he's like, \"Can we get the white South Africans out here immediately? Can we move a million white South Africans to...\"\n\nRight? 'Cause, like, what, you're bringing them in, but you're not bringing the persecuted Mexicans in, like, okay.\n\nIt seems like a pathway would be...\n\nBut it's also like...\n\nThe things I had to do to get...\n\nThe Africa thing is nuts, man. The South Africa thing, the killing, killing of the farmers, like, people want to deny that that exists. I have seen the rally, the kill the boar, kill the farmer. He's really, he's doing it. And then he gets on trial and he goes, he goes, \"I was saying kiss, I said kiss the bo,\" right? Yeah.\n\nWith his cold dead eyes. He's a spooky cat.\n\nYeah.\n\nI forget his name. He's, uh...\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. They got some things to sort out.\n\nIndeed. Well, listen. Sorry. I'm glad you're in America.\n\nThat's a Johnny note to go out on.\n\nJohnny me. Johnny Bone said, \"I just re-entered the testing pool that lasted about two weeks. Figured we keep everyone's options open.\"\n\nA lot of the fighters are tweeting right now. They're very excited about fighting on the White House lawn.\n\nOh, that's right.\n\nThey're going to fight on the White House.\n\nJuly 4th, 2026. White House lawn. I knew about it. I kept it under my hat. Okay. For months. Sorry, people.\n\nThey're going to fight in the Rose Garden.\n\nThey're going to fight on the White House lawn.\n\n20,000 people.\n\n25,000.\n\nConor's in.\n\nIt's the, yeah. He says he's going to be the president of Ireland by then next year.\n\nThrow it down.\n\nHe's chosen a weird time to run.\n\nYeah, but the world's weird. James McCann, love you to death, brother. Thank you for being here. Thank you, sir. Been awesome having you around for real. You're, you're a [ __ ] great guy. If I said anything crazy, I didn't mean it. You're very, very funny, too. And if anyone hasn't seen you do stand up, go see him. I, I can't recommend you enough. You're awesome.\n\nYou've changed my life. Can I say something touching at the end?\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right. I was, I mean, I was poor. I have no opportunities. I got passed at that club and it's revolutionized. I get to pay my rent on time. I get to do comedy often and people are nice about it. This is, it's been very, very strange and I couldn't have done it if you hadn't set that club up.\n\nI appreciate that very much and that's the whole reason why we set it up the way we set it up in the first place. We wanted to make it a place where that can happen. And like I said about, like, open micers that are good, they just never saw a path and couldn't figure it out. I think we can save some of those people in the future, you know. I think we could make, we can lessen the attrition rate and we can make better comics.\n\nYeah. And, and make a real supportive community, which is what we're really doing. And, you know, that was the whole goal of the place is to make the best club possible. And the best club possible has to have development. You have to have people coming up that are really good. It's like that's the key that a lot of these, like, improvs and stuff, they miss. They don't have, like, a, a night where you can just a bunch of people are doing 15 minutes. They don't develop a local community and so they only rely on the headliners to come in on the weekend and the rest of the shows you have various headliners do one night or two nights or something like that, which is fine occasionally. But the reality is you want a vibrant development community and if you don't have that, you're not going to get new talent.\n\n\nYou're only going to have import talent every weekend.\nThere's three cities in all of America where you can reliably do it.\nUsed to just be two. This has changed it.\nAnd uh, Shane brought me over here.\nI want to shout him out cuz he...\nI was in Ohio.\nI was having a good time, but I had no... there was nothing happened for me.\nAnd then the fact that there is a place that you can come and if you're going to work hard and do it well, that I mean that's insane.\nIt's awesome.\nAh, look, I don't want to go on about it.\nWe're happy to have you, brother.\nI'm very touched.\nGod bless you.\nUh, tell everybody your Instagrams they can follow you.\nJames Donald Forbes McCann.\nUh, the James Donald Forbes McCann Catamaran Plan.\nIt's a great podcast that everybody should check out.\nI think they got books of poems.\nThat's it.\nOkay.\nBeautiful.\nHey, thanks so much.\nThank you both.\nBye everybody.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n",
