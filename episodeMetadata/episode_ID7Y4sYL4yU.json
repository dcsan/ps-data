I fill the marketing and publishing role on the podcast. Today we have aircraft strategy investing. 10 years, 10 years of my Gossamer consulting. I hit my anniversary. Yeah.\n\nCongrats.\n\nI actually, I forgot about it. I started in August after my stint at Cabum and have been doing it ever since.\n\nAnd Gossamer comes from the tentacles of the spider, right?\n\nNo, Gossamer was my character in World of Warcraft.\n\nSo, what is it like? Blizzard gives you a sword at 10 years or a shield or some [ __ ] What do you get? What do you get at your company?\n\nI guess I get a plushy of customers.\n\nI think you can finally wear the vest now. The puffer.\n\nOh, that's true. I should get a puffer vest. So,\n\nwhat do you mean you should? Aim sent you one.\n\nYeah.\n\nAll right, let's keep going. Phil.\n\nPhil monetization zar.\n\nWhere does the zar come from?\n\nWell, you remember like it was like the Obama administration. Everyone was getting like this Zar title and like everyone was embracing it and I was like [ __ ] who doesn't want to be a Zar.\n\nThat sounds awesome. Like a there's always like a drugar in the United States for some reason.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nI remember Cryptozar. That was the uh the best side character we had on the show.\n\nKing of Spain. Come on.\n\nKing of Spain. I like that one. So uh the founder whisperer. Let's go. Let's start the podcast. Nobody is interested in us. Everybody's interested in the news.\n\nWe have a lot. So, first Crest is going to go full 60 minutes and be investigative reporter on the Crafton Subnotica 2 drama. I'm so excited for this one. It's like Real Housewives of the game industry going on. Roblox announces a new IP licensing platform. European mobile game makers are still able to raise money, especially Turkish ones. And a surprising French dev, too. Crest is going to lose his mind. Moon Active takes a direct shot at Scopely. Maybe AI really is taking all of our jobs. It just asked the folks at King London about this. And apparently I have no power over Mishka to uphold my supercell ban.\n\n[ __ ] You missed the most important news that came out today. I was just playing Rebel Moon Bloodline on Netflix. It's the quintessential Super Evil Mega Corp stuff through and through. Superdetailed, dark environments, realistic proportion in an isometric game, sci-fi that it's hard to understand. Very well done, beautiful BFX's, beautiful, you know, story line. I haven't played it too much, but I think I'll be playing this for the next week. Any um guesses on how many downloads this does. After all, it's one of the worst franchises Netflix has. So, uh what is the overunder on this couple? Wow, that's really low, Phil.\n\nIt's all just rounding errors. There's nothing for anyone to add except fulfilling a contract obligation. Like, everyone's just going through the motions at this point. Like, the fact that they're still using this engine is incredible. Like, they're just dragging this thing. Like, I've known a lot of developers who have basically lived off like someone subsidizing their engine and then just using that for every single IP they can throw at it for like mouth-to-mouth jobs to survive. It's incredible.\n\nLet's let's let's banter it up. We actually watched the Minecraft movie as a family for the first time in four years we've been able to watch. So our daughter is our youngest is four years so she can actually sit through it. Eldest is eight. She absolutely loved it. And the next day we had to go to the toy store to get the chicken jockey Lego set. And now she's like she's, you know, finishing it up. She didn't want to go to Taekwondo today to get the camp because she just wants to build this finish up the set. And next she wants to Dennis the wolf. And interestingly enough, like we do have Minecraft and she didn't even ask to play Minecraft. Like it didn't even pop to her head that this is an actual game. So I'm asking Jen, is this the trans media as its finest? Like have we has the family cat been transmediated?\n\nThis is as old school as it gets. This is my entire first part of my career.\n\nOh man, I want to do Can I do an impression?\n\nYeah, do it. Do it.\n\nNo, no. I I mean like look, let me just whip out my funnel. Like you got understand marketing is a funnel and at the top of the funnel is like brand awareness and then that converts. Like how does it go? Like there's a funnel. You're always coming to this funnel. No, you're awful. Okay. All right. All right. Here, let me do let me do my Here's my short version of franchise management.\n\n[ __ ] this trans media stuff. It's franchise management. Kid goes to see content. Kid bugs the [ __ ] out of parents for toys and consumer products. That is like the tale of as old as time to also repeat Disney. So, what's the same is like it movies and TV used to be the thing that you would go see and then go want the toy. And by the way, you big boys do the same thing when you see that like car ad and you're like, \"Oo, I really want to go get that Porsche.\"\n\nPerhaps somebody on the podcast might relate to that. The new school is that YouTube shorts, games, and Roblox are becoming the sources. So, welcome to my world of franchise moneymaking, which is what I used to do at Disney. So, we're actually in a resurgence of this. So, PG movies are on fire. So, Comscore data has found that PG-related films have collectively grossed 1.72 billion in North America the first six months of the year, which is about 42% of the box office revenue. That's up from 31% last year. And last year, full year, actually had Inside Out 2, Moana, Live Lion King. And so this year, what we're seeing is that like kids content and PG or family content is back. Superman lightened its tone. Did you see it? Actually, it was okay. I didn't love it. and I'm a DC fan. So, this year it's been Minecraft, How to Train Your Dragon, Lilo and Stitch. Fun fact, I actually worked on Lilo and Stitch.\n\nOh, kids love it. Well, I don't know what's going on with Lilo and Stitch, but it's like it's huge.\n\nYeah. Anyway,\n\nit's been huge since the beginning. I got to work with the director who is the voice of Stitch and he reprised his role in the new one. It is like the most adorable that this should be your next one. It is a boy character. Disney doesn't have a lot of boys characters. Ignore Marvel and Star Wars. And so Stitch became one of the leading and only boys character because he's kind of naughty. I didn't even go to my awareness funnel. Anyway, let's keep going. Shill Mishka quick show. So Gamescom, we got two events finally. Links to both of them. The links are in description 19th and the 20th. We got the whiskey water tasting. We got the Heroic big party. So I think Heroic Party has already 400 signups. So drop your name there. Going to get to 800. It's going to be a big party. Other show is I did an episode about Pakistan the gaming ecosystem growing. I had Sad Hamid from Game District. He came on the podcast. I actually met Sad in Abu Dhabi last year. Super nice guy and has a pretty interesting operation like 17 studios. I think 3 to 400 employees. Their biggest game did 125 million in downloads. They got 50 games at over 10 million downloads each. Most interestingly, no VC funding. So imagine what this guy can do with some growth capital actually. It's really interesting. Got a lot of requests on LinkedIn from Pakistanis to connect after the episode.\n\nSo and just just for information, I'm not accepting if I don't know you, I'm not accepting you. Anyways, that's that one. I suggest you listen to it because I think this is kind of like one of those up and coming areas just like Vietnam was a couple of years ago. I think Pakistan is next. I got message even from Google is like let's go champ like let's do Google stuff. So that's my and then we also released Jen your episode.\n\nYeah. So I interviewed Scopely CMO Ben Webbley at MAU back in May. We have a kind of an shorter version of that that we just posted. Goes into a lot of, you know, cool topics around creative testing. So check that out. It was really, really fun. He's a great guy. I've known him at my Zinga time, my EA time. And so\n\nMeta Time.\n\nOh, he worked at Meta. didn't. But yes, I mean, he's just like number one is just a great human. And so any chance to talk to him about what Scopely's up to was great. So check that out.\n\nAnd hopefully we can release the unedited version again. Scopely, please. The one is 10 minutes. The real conversation was 30. It's okay. He didn't say anything wrong. Let's go with the full one. Let's go unedited.\n\nYeah. I mean, you know, they they like to leave a little bit hanging for people to come in in real life.\n\nCover their six. You know,\n\nI will tease it starts with a really fun Monopoly fact, so just buckle in.\n\nOh,\n\nthe opening segment. I've I've listened to the podcast.\n\nOh, thank you. Oh, that's so nice.\n\nEric, you doing okay over there?\n\nI'm still upset with the Circon guy who put together some [ __ ] analysis on April. And the more I think about it, the more I'm just like, it's like seems so political what he was doing. It had nothing to do with reality. I feel like apparently we didn't push back hard enough against the Gen Z point and I will push back against Jen on the Gen Z point about disposable income. So if you remember last week there was Sconoid data saying Gen Z's spending on video games was down right and the source was prior year. So like listen I don't know I just want to say that's what the chart said exactly. So I think what's important here is to weight that evidence by the strength of the evidence the strength of that and so right now we have like basically you're comparing one month over one month which Eric pointed out right could be affected by one game we don't know the source of the data how it was collected right it was appeared in the Wall Street Journal so is it credit card panel data is it server data who knows how many players it was collected from who knows and then what we have is we have a Federal Reserve working paper which looks at the amount of income in the United States after taxes and transfers Gen Z have on a cohorted basis. So like by age 20 comparing Gen Z to Gen X, Boomers, Silent, all of the different generations, Gen Z is the best off in terms of median income after taxes and transfers adjusted for inflation. And I think that is important data that is more important than a random Circon survey.\n\nYeah, exactly. All right, moving on. I just profoundly disappointed in that analysis. All right, moving on. I'm I this is a long diet tribe. I apologize, but it is kind of a complicated situation given the fact that there's huge two sides of this thing. So, Crafton is delaying Subnotica 2 ahead of a $250 million payout that was promised to the developers based upon performance, right? So the story fundamentally is that Crafton is postponing Subnotica 2 to 2026 for a lot of reason but one is that the co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max Magcguire along with the CEO Ted Gil were recently removed and replaced by Steve Paputsis of Striking Distance Studios. So the delay basically came right before they were potentially going to be able to earn a $250 million earnout in 2025. And so the allegations is that the postpone is a strategic move to basically eliminate the ability for them to pay this out. But Crafton is publicly claiming that the game simply isn't ready and needs more polish. And then Unknown World's ousted leadership is obviously insisting the game was ready and the staff had expected substantial bonuses. I guess to start this thing off, we have to understand the background here. So Crafton acquired Unknown Worlds after the success of the original Subnotica in 2021 for 500 million. Since then, they've only had one release, which was Moonbreaker, which is an absolute disaster of epic proportions. Like, it didn't do anything, right? So, to be clear, similar to what they did with Zinga, they put an impairment charge, a loss of 190 million in 2023 related to this acquisition. So, clearly, this acquisition has not gone well for them to date by any measure that I can see, right? But the absolutely critical part of this is the release of the sequel to their huge hit of Subnotica. And by the way, Subnotica was an absolutely amazing game, a game before its time, built by a small team. It took the world by storm and it is a very, very fun and great game. All right, so here's Crafton's argument. Crafton is saying they're delaying the game for quality. The content was missing in the game. The leadership was not managing this process and they had other commitments and other things\n\n\nthat they were doing. And they\nare claiming that they were basing it on\nproject status, not the $250 million\nearnout for the executives. And Crafton\nis basically suggesting that they want\nto make sure that this game is ready and\nthat they get a long-term success, not\njust like a one-shot like revenue hit,\nrevenue bump in the year. Unknown Worlds\nis basically saying the game was ready\nand argues that it was ready for early\naccess. That they are accusing Crafton\nof basically delaying the game to avoid\nthis $250 million playout. There's a\nbreach of trust and they're they were\nunjustly dismissed by the company and\nnow they are filing an legal action\nagainst the company\nthat is sealed. Yes.\nWhat\nthe lawsuit is sealed, which was\ninteresting.\nOh really? Oh, because there's a lot of\ninformation thrown around about this\nthing. That's why it's so complicated\nbecause it's just\nYeah. I read up on it like before, like\nthe latest this morning, and that was\nlike, \"Oh, I'm like, oh, that's kind of\nfascinating that you all are complaining,\"\nand but the lawsuit is sealed anyway,\ncontinue on.\nSo, okay, so, so here's my take on this,\nright, fundamentally, right? And and this\nis tough because obviously we don't know\nall the information, but like there's two\nkey questions that doesn't seem to be\nasked by anybody. I don't know why, but\none question was asked. The second\nquestion was not asked. But the first\nquestion is, is the game ready for\nrelease? Right? Like that's actually a\nfundamental question. Is it ready for\nrelease? And by these leaked quote\nunquote documents that suggested what\nthey anticipated for the early access\nlaunch to what they are planning on\nreleasing for the early access launch,\nit is really relatively clear, if you\nbelieve these documents, that the title\nwas not ready. Right? The title was not\ncontent complete to release. And I\nplayed this game enough to know that\nwhat they were releasing was not enough\nto keep players engaged and to create a\nservice that would generate significant\namounts of revenue for them going\nforward. Right? It's just 50% of the\ngame was not ready for release based\nupon what they originally assumed that\nthey would do. So it, I don't know. They\nseem to be off-target. Right.\nYeah. These slides have been verified by\nCrafton that they are real from the\nmilestone meeting. Just that's the\nlatest,\nright?\nSo these are legit slides that we're\nlooking at.\nI know. But it's so gross that these\nwere leaked. Clearly they were leaked\nfor a reason, right? They were. Anyway,\nso but I think the more important thing\nhere that no one seems to be asking, and\nI did read it on a Slack channel thing,\nbut like given the performance of\nMoonbreaker, which would also be\nincluded in this calculation, like is\nthere any way they would have gotten to\nthe earnout bonus, right? Like if\nthey're going to get a $250 million\nearnout bonus, they have to make more\nmoney than $250 million, right? And\nMoonbreaker made nothing, right? So, can\nyou tell me for certainty that like in\nthe next, like in the back half of this\nmonth, like the last three months of\nthis year, that they would been able to\nrecoup the $250 million and above that\nin order to earn it?\nThat's not how earnout works. Like, they\nmight have had different triggers for\nthe earnout. It could be production\nrelated. It could be review related.\nIt's not necessarily how much they\ngenerate. Usually, it's earnout is some\nkind of a milestones that you achieve\nand then out of what you generate, you\nget a percentage. So above of 250 they\nwould have gotten percentage from sales\nI think. Like that's typically I've\nseen,\nright? But everyone keeps throwing this\n$250 million number out here like they\nwere going to get a [ __ ] check.\nLike it's guaranteed. Yeah.\nYeah. Well, that that's how it works.\nLike the way I understand and the way\nI've seen earnouts being structured. So\nthey already got the 500. So the\nfounders I think got 90% of 500 or\nsomething like that and then the rest\nwas left of 250 of the total earnout.\nAnd there were milestones like one must\nhave been the release of this game and\nthen usually there's no\nfirst of all that is dumb, right? Like\nthere was no way that anybody would ever\nstructure a deal in which it's just\nbased upon release.\nYeah.\nIt's based upon performance.\nNo.\nLike no, no\nI've never seen an earnout structure in\nmy life.\nAre you being sarcastic?\nYes.\nOh,\nI've never seen one, never signed one,\nnever worked at a at a big publisher, and\nthey would for sure not pay for reaching\ncertain milestones.\nBut look, if you're a financially\nmotivated company, a publicly traded\ncompany, you're not giving a $250\nmillion check for releasing a game.\nYou're getting it from performance on\nrevenue. Like that there's no way that\ndoesn't even make sense. Okay, so I'm\nnot going to comment more, but let's say\nI have seen different and I you're\ncoming from the right perspective of how\nstructures should be, but the way I'm\ntelling you is often times there are\nother metrics that are tied to the\nearnout and then on top of that there's\nusually a revenue share that comes from\nso that component is like these are\ncrazy contracts. We're talking about\n2021 contract. It is absolutely\nludicrous. But I would assume that the\nrelease of this game would have\ntriggered a big portion of the earnout.\nYeah, it just seems like half of their\npurchase price at 250 seems like a lot.\nAnd then the way that the 250 allocation\nworks, 90% went to the three founders\nand then the last 10% goes to the\ncompany to the employees. The argument\nis that the three founders said that\nthey were planning on distributing some\nof their earnout money to the team, but\ncontractually that's not listed in\nanything that we've read. So that's a\nlittle bit of the disagreement as well\nthat Crafton is saying that the\nfounders didn't intend to distribute\nthat. Whether that was going to happen\nor not and how that was going to happen,\nI think we don't know.\nJust saying Chris, it could be it could\nbe much crazier than you think. I see\nhere the likely scenario is that the\nteam was just not on track, right, to\nhit the earnout, right? And Moonbreaker\nlike literally was like a big part of\nthe calculus here and they just it was a\ndisaster. It was just an absolute bomb.\nI don't think it generated more than\nlike three or four million dollars,\nright? So again, if you're talking about\na $250 million earnout and they want to\nbe whole and cash flow positive on this\nthing, they have to hit significant\namounts of revenue on this game. And\nfrankly, Subnotica, despite its success,\ndid not do that much revenue. Like over\nits life, it certainly did, but\ncertainly not initially. So anyway, it\ndoesn't seem very likely that they were\non track to earn the earnout. So what I\nthink is that Crafton is delayed\nSubnotica so that they would be able to\nrecoup as much money as possible from\nthis acquisition that's gone sideways,\nright? And management said, \"No [ __ ]\nway. We want a shot at earnout.\" Or\nmaybe you're right, maybe part of the\nearnout at least. But realistically, I\nmean, this wasn't likely going to\nhappen. And again, based upon\nperformance to date, like it didn't make\nsense for Crafton to release something\nnow, but it makes much more sense to\nrelease it later when it was actually\nready for prime time and it could\ngenerate significance amounts of revenue\nand deliver on the promise of the game\nitself for that matter, right? And so\nlike the cynical part of me basically\nsays that basically Crafton's claimed\nthat management kind of checked out and\nwas working on other projects and wasn't\nreally focused on this game development\nand this is why it was delayed and why\nthey didn't have any of the content that\nthey promised, etc. that they weren't\nbeing leaders in the company. My my\ncynical side is basically saying, well,\nlook, if they didn't believe they were\ngoing to hit this earnout, then maybe\nthey did as creative people focus on\nother things, right? But the reality is\nI don't think they would have abandoned\ntheir child, right, of this game. I\nthink they would want to get this thing\ndone in effective way. So, I think\nthat's a little bit like cynical to\nthink that they would have have done\nthat and abandoned their baby type\nthing. On the flip side, like releasing\na game like Subnotica with the level of\ncontent that they were suggesting just\ndoesn't make sense like logically,\nright? Because the part of the\nengagement is the amount of you the\nbiomes and and all the content that they\nyou need to get through like the\nSubnautica fans of this game would get\nthrough this content in like less than\nlike 24 hours, you know? I was like that\ndoesn't work for a game like this. So, I\ndidn't know that they actually closed\nthe lawsuit, but um I I imagine we'll\nget more and more details as they go\nthrough discovery, but if they're trying\nto keep it on the hush hush, which I'm a\nlittle bit shocked given how much\ninformation was thrown out there.\nAnyway, that's all I got.\nYeah, really good breakdown. Thank you,\nEric. For my point, just three things\nlike I I think you're absolutely\ncorrect. I think, you know, even based\non the reports, it's quite typical for\nthe founders to check out. And I think\nthey were doing other projects. I think\nthey earned 500 million already and took\n90% of that to the founders. So each of\nthem was doing quite well. Uh probably\ntraveling between Vegas and Honolulu on\nthe regular.\nI don't know. I'm just just throwing out\nthere. But you know any of us could\nimagine how their life would change if\nyou go from grinding on this development\nstudio to having 70 million in your bank\naccount. There was interesting off-topic\ncomment on LinkedIn from a person who\nused to work at Garina Corpdev. I\ncouldn't find it. I tried to look at it,\nbut he basically commented that um yeah,\nI looked at this case and some sort of\nlike we passed because of the founders\nor something like that. I'm\nparaphrasing, but I remember seeing that\ncomment on maybe it was your LinkedIn\nwas full of this news, but I remember\nseeing that it was weirdly open comment\non it kind of like signing that there is\nan issue with the founders and that's\nwhy the Karina passed on it and I do\nbelieve that Crafton did pull the plug\nto avoid the earnouts and I think that\nthe earnouts were milestone based in\nthis case and that's why they pulled the\nplug. If they weren't, if it was about\ngenerating 250 mil, then I think there\nwouldn't be any kind of a rush of\npulling the plug because this game that\nis not ready clearly wouldn't make that\nmoney. And yes, there would be bad PR\njust like with the Minds Eye type of a\nthing, but that would have just, you\nknow, killed the studio. So, in this\ncase, if they knew that they would have\nto pay significant amount, then it they\nsaved $250 million by essentially\nescalating this this case into a\nlawsuit.\nI'm not going to let you go on that one.\nThat doesn't make any sense. Like,\noh, the milestone based earnouts.\nThese are smart people that know how to\nlike negotiate terms. They're not giving\naway money on a release. Like, that's\nreally that's just doesn't even make\nsense.\nI'm not going to comment on that. What\nwe could do is we could talk to the\nsmart folks at ARM who deal with with\nsales and earnouts a lot or any of the\nVCs who see earnout sheets and they can\ncomment if they have seen if you're a VC\nor an investment banker and you have\nseen earnouts where it's tied to release\nand production milestones, holla at us\nDM. We will not tell who it is. We will\njust say you're from reputable company\nor if we're wrong on this then also DM\nus. So, um,\nI'm not suggesting that there aren't\npayouts based upon\nmilestones. I'm not saying that. I'm\nsaying that a $250 million payout,\nholy is not based upon mileston.\nYeah. I mean, that seems extreme.\nSo, in this case, it could be something\nlike 50 mil is unlocked when they pass\npre-production. 50 mil is passed when\nthey pass production and then there\ncould be like 100 mil when they reach.\nBut there are elements that are tied to\nactually launching a game. In some\ncompanies that have live operations, it\ncould be passing the test launch phases.\nSo I've seen those with different\ncompanies.\nI think we agree.\nThey are significant. They're like 30%\nof the earnout when you pass the\nmilestone.\nAll right. So the one thing I wanted to\nmention is I have never seen a statement\nlike this from a big company on their\nwebsite going into this dirty laundry. I\nwas absolutely shocked. Listen, I kind\nof applaud it. I applaud the\ntransparency, but holy [ __ ] was it like,\nyou know, get your popcorn out moment.\nThe second thing I wanted to get Phil's\nperspective on really quick is early\naccess means a lot more now than it did\nin 2021. When you early access a game,\nit is almost like a launch. And so, do\nyou think, Phil, that had anything to do\nwith this? I think people just want more\nmoney for enzoy development crafting.\nJesus Christ. Yeah,\nthank you for answering my question.\nWhat a troll. What a troll.\nI actually I I actually did forget to\nmention that like I think they're\nfeeling a bit burned too, right? Inzo\nwas a disaster. Calisto Protocol was an\nabsolute train wreck.\nPUBG New State, how about that?\nPUBG is [ __ ] delivering by the way.\nWe haven't covered that. PUBG is doing a\nton of crazy awesome [ __ ] right now.\nPUBG or PC PUBG.\nThe PC PUBG.\nNo, that's a Jacob. I Philip, that has\nnothing to do with this. This is all\nabout\nDid you just like mix up your son's name\nwith Phil?\nYeah, I do that all the time. Um,\nwe should call Phil. We're having all\nthese deals that they signed since the\nsuccess of PUBG and just have not worked\nout, right? Particularly for the Western\ndevelopers. Like, they're having their\nNetIs moment where they're just\nbasically pulling back on all things,\nright? And so, you know, Kalisto\nProtocol was a train wreck of epic\nproportions in terms of money spent and\ndollars earned. And so, I think this is\nlike actually part of that as well. I'm\nsure management was just not happy with\nthese investments.\nAll right. So, I'm going to cover\nRoblox's new IP licensing platform. Get\nready for what looks like their new\nUpwork or Fiverr for the Roblox\nplatform. So, they announced this\nyesterday on July 15th. It's a new\nlicensing platform including license\nmanager and the licenses catalog. So\nwith this launch creators can build\nexperiences with popular IP. So if you\nknow anyone can kind of apply to work\nwith different IP rights holders\n\n\nGet a new self-serve.\nSo I thought this was interesting part of it.\nThere's self-serve IP management tools making it easy to provide licenses to their IP at scale for use at Roblox.\nSo the two big components here is one is if you're like an IP holder, you register, you can create a new IP.\nYou can customize the terms that govern it.\nYou can proactively scan experiences for IP usage.\nSo this will become important later on.\nOffer license uses directly to creators and automatically collect revenue.\nHopefully the revenue is not in Robux, which is a pain in the ass, but you can do that automatically.\nSo the other piece of it that it does is you can offer license use of IP to creators by identifying experiences that might qualify for the use, listing your IP that's available, and then creators can browse and apply for use of the IP.\nSo through the platform, the IP holder can actually approve or not approve people to use different things.\nSo here's what they're launching with, which as you know, someone who knows licenses, I was a little bit embarrassed for them.\nCan we get a drum roll for like the premiere licenses?\nTo kill it with, go slay, genen?\nWhat a rip.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, the four studios are Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kadanchu.\nLike, I actually don't even know how to say this.\nSo, Like a Dragon.\nHere are some of the IP they're launching with some of this.\nI'm like, what is this?\nLike a Dragon.\nDon't know this.\nNow You See Me.\nOh my god.\nThis is like the a card poker movie from 10 years ago.\nJesse.\nJesse Eisenberg or something.\nRemember there mystical elements.\nIt's like uh Oceans 11 with\nYeah.\nThere's there's weird [ __ ] at the end of that movie.\nOh, all right.\nOh, that's right.\nSpoiler alert.\nYeah.\nSquid Game, which by the way is done.\nStranger Things.\nThe Divergent series.\nOh my god.\nFlashback to something.\nBut only Twilight.\nOnly the movie right, only based that are based on a young adult book series.\nTwilight series, Go Team Bella from 20 years ago and the extremely kid-friendly Saw series.\nIf you don't know the Saw series, it is the big rated R gory, like the guy with the mask, like puts people in a room and makes them kill each other.\nSo like really appropriate for the Roblox kid audience.\nThey say longterm they're going to open it up.\nSo these are the test subjects for this.\nSo, just for a little context and comparison, it's extremely similar to what happens with Epic, Fortnite's UFN licensed IP platform.\nSo, they have Lego, Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Walking Dead.\nThey actually have Squid Game as well.\nUh, all of that's live now.\nAnd so, you can imagine with Disney, the Disney deal that they're going to have Disney IP coming later.\nSo, when you look at Fortnite.gg, you can see that some of these games using this IP have done well.\nThe ones that get made by the platform experts that know how to make on UEA make games for UFN, those are the ones that end up doing well.\nAnd so remember that typically in licensing there's about a 15% rev share that goes to the lensur.\nSo here's where I wanted to break this down.\nThis is not the holy grail that you know, this isn't the licensing model that you're looking for.\nYou know, in the words of the great Obi-Wan, these aren't the droids you're looking for.\nSo, the biggest win isn't actually going to be what you would expect.\nI would say it is going to be the ability for brands to police and take down people infringing on their IP and all of the knockoffs.\nSo, ask any anime game and they'll tell you knockoffs are out of control.\nSo, you know, One Piece as an example of, you know, just take a big IP.\nOne of the biggest games on Roblox is a ripoff of the One Piece IP, which was Blox Fruits.\nThey actually had to change their name from block piece to blocks fruits and they had to change some things in the game to uh comply.\nAnd so when you look at this, you know, sadly too, the IP games actually don't even perform that well.\nAnd so IP in a sense doesn't always matter to kids.\nWhat matters is making a great freaking game on the platform that kids want to play.\nSo they actually, you know, like the licensing may or actually not be the most important thing.\nSo on revenue, this also might not be the answer that you would expect.\nYou're like, Jen, there's so many more ways, you know, people can make games with an IP.\nSo remember that when you make money, if you're a developer, you only get 21% of gross to net because of all the platform fees, all the Roblox fees.\nSo imagine then you've got 21%.\nNow if you're a developer, you're going to pay 15% to a license.\nSo for lensur this is like collecting pennies from the bottom of you know a fountain, like the revenue is not even going to really matter that much.\nThe big win for you is going to be you know maybe one of these games actually takes off, but it's like playing the lottery on that.\nSo this is also really disruptive.\nIt's going to piss off a number of these agencies out there that specialize in IP and brand based games.\nYou know our friend Ethan made a Lego game for somebody that he worked for.\nSo those people are going to be super pissed off because, you know, those brand people aren't going to be needed as much if there's now a platform that you can go to.\nOn the flip side, this actually democratizes the ability for a teenager next door to go make an official Squid Game, Roblox game.\nHe's probably made a fake one, so now he can do an official one.\nThe one thing I can think of on the plus side is time to market will dramatically shrink, meaning more franchise opportunities, formerly called trans media.\nSo maybe now there can be some IP that gets out in time.\nWe always complain about like why didn't Fallout have more new products?\nWell, maybe this will allow it, assuming they can upload all the assets in time, which also like never really happens.\nSo in short, brands, you know, they'll probably need to be there, you know, but they're going to need to be there to play defense, not offense.\nSo that's my update for everyone.\nAnd if you care about licensing,\nhey, are you building a game, launching an app, or considering an acquisition?\nWell, in

think they're number one in Turkey.\nSo, Gorkham and crew at Latan are crushing it out there, which is good because I'm an adviser.\nSo, there we go.\nUm, full disclosure, we've left the show section.\nYeah.\nThis is big news.\nYeah.\nSo, good good for them.\nYeah.\nWell, staying on the uh on the Turkey topic.\nI mean, there was a news that mobile game developer Circle Games has secured over $7 million in seed funding led by BigCraft with backing from A16Z speedrun, E2VC, Play Ventures, API Ventures, and so forth.\nThese funds will go towards blah blah blah blah blah.\nAnd they're making a puzzle game.\nAnyway, so so just to cut this short, dude.\nAll I have to say is Bitcraft and A16Z is the tail wagon.\nThe Laton Ventures dog, dude, these guys are just following the lead of Laton Ventures and Mr. Gorkum, you know, eat our dust.\nYeah.\nWell, and they are crap.\nFirst of all, they're very differentized funds and they do work together.\nSo, let's let's be clear.\nThey're following a trend, you know, they're just like way behind the eightball, you know, like always.\nJust, you know, let let me open open this up before before you put your Laton t-shirt on.\nSo, pretty big raises in the market in the East Bowl market as of late.\nSo, Bigger Games just recently raised $25 million series A.\nI think Rain led that.\nGood job Games raised $23 million.\nI think it was Seed or Ser, it doesn't matter.\n$23 million and that company was quite established.\nGrand Games, which was that's Laton venture company, actually raised $30 million series A.\nSo they have been very big early stage raises in the market, much bigger than we've seen in other areas.\nI don't think we really see these big of a rounds in other markets at the moment, especially on mobile.\nAnd so why I think this is happening is is kind of four things.\nSo what Turks are really good at is that they focus on business and not what they like to play and would like to play.\nSo they don't make a MOA because they and they do love MOBAs.\nThey really focus on what's good business and good business is casual games at the moment.\nThe second thing is that I've noticed is that they have this relentless attention on details when it comes to both product and marketing.\nLike it's crazy how deep these guys go into making the puzzle levels and and really polishing the pixels and polishing the gameplay and polishing individual creative assets.\nLike it's you know down to a science or a craft however you want to put it.\nThe third thing that in my opinion separates this market from many other ones is how talented and super hardworking people are talented in the sense of the top talent from universities chooses gaming, which is very not typical in US, they would go to finance or or AI or whatnot, but in Turkey they actually do go to gaming and the second part with hardworking is like when I'm in Istanbul, like it's hard to have a dinner with people at 7 or 8:00 p.m. because everybody's at work and it's quite normal to be from 10:00 a.m. till like 11:00 p.m.\nThat's a pretty normal working day at a startup.\nSo, they do work really really hard.\nAnd then finally, the reason why A16Z, BitCraft, and everybody except Lighteed is investing into these one is that they have the traction.\nSo, Graham started with the exits.\nPeak kind of sealed the deal with that 1.2 1.6 $6 billion exit and then Dream converted essentially everybody who was on the fence.\nThey they could say, \"Well, mobile's kind of dead and we're not going to do it.\"\nAnd then what Dream took 5 years for a $5.5 billion essentially exit to private equity.\nSo those are the reasons why the Turkish market is so hot and why bigger funds are also trying to get in and getting in at pretty high valuation.\nBut I think there's a lot of limiting factors when it comes to this market as well.\nOne limitation is talent.\nThere's only 90 million something Turks and these companies only hire Turks, like some of these companies do have an office in London maybe, but that's only marketing.\nThe second part is because they're attracting through these exits these big VCs, they're getting a little bit overpriced, everybody wants a piece and then so you're able to raise like what Spike raised $55 million seed, like I think that's been the record, so that increases the valuation and um you know they're not overpriced yet, but that moment can\nAnd I think it's going to be very interesting what happens to these big VCs who are following, who are not leading, who are not on the ground level, what they're going to do when some of their bets go south, like when they have invested tens of millions at later rounds to some of these companies that are bound to fail, like it is normally in venture capital.\nSo that's going to be interesting.\nAnd will they move capital elsewhere or how long they will, you know, support this ecosystem and continue to raise the prices.\nSo dude, A16Z will just go chase the next like\nWell, A6 Well, let's be clear that A16Z check came through speedrun.\nSo they came in super early.\nThat's a speed check.\nThey weren't even involved in the second round.\nNo, I'm sure they did the uh Pro Rada, but they were actually really really early.\nSo it's Bitcraft that put in the uh the bigger check at a higher valuation.\nIt's A6Z that that got moved around on Light Speed's moved on like\nYeah.\nLight speed's doing.\nSo I think I think overall just talking about the future of Turkish market for what little I know about it.\nI think we're expecting kind of expansion to other platforms.\nI think PC makes a lot of sense.\nMaybe different type of games but no you're saying no PC.\nOkay.\nSo let me tell you no way.\nNo [ __ ] way they do AAA double A.\nNo not AAA.\nNot I'm not saying AAA I'm saying they have success on PC when it comes to Steam games.\nBit battle bit is out of Turkey.\nLayer of liars is out of Turkey.\nSo, they have some really good like kind of 1A 2A hits coming in already.\nI've heard from some of the founders who have moved from the crazy mobile gaming grind where they're saying, hey, we can do a cool game and get $15 million.\nAnd they've actually succeeded in getting that.\nAnd they're like, I'd rather make a fun game once, kind of put all my effort into it.\nLet dude, this is [ __ ] There's just no way that as a collective can move on to like AAA, double A,\nnot move on.\nAnd I think opening up new avenues and I believe that will happen more and more.\nI think they will expand to tools, tech and platforms.\nThey are\n\n\nSpending so much money on adtech. Why isn't there a Turkish adtech company? There are few, but I think it makes sense. And finally, global expansion, like these teams that are growing, and they're competing so hard for talent, and I think at some point they have to unlock studios in other locations, and it will be interesting to see how that works. Can we hear from the Turkish VC advisor on what he's seeing in the market?\n\nYeah, Mr. Crest, put your puffer vest on. Let me...\n\nWell, I mean, tell it like it is, man. Like, don't, don't make funny faces. Like, let's... Come on, man. This isn't Wario. Let's go. What you got?\n\nShow up. Show up to the club.\n\nThe Turkish group has a very specific expertise in which they are leveraging to the [ __ ] hilt. But the idea that they're going up end up higher and putting studios in different locations, that might be they want, might want to dream the dream, but I don't think that's a realistic expectation, right? Is that they can move upstream or something like that. They're crushing it where they are. That's been their focus and that's their expertise.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it's a bottle.\n\nThis is the same tide thing. It's like, you know, why has King made puzzle games for the last [ __ ] 30 years, right? Because that's all they [ __ ] know how to do, you know? Like they tried other things. It's not a function of not trying. I'm not suggesting go, go for it. But like, I mean, obviously, very cynical way of looking at things. Just no way that this is going to happen. So look, if you see some big data points that suggest that they're actually making some headway there, fine. But like a small, like Rinky Think game on Steam, that's...\n\nBattle Bed was pretty big. Like yeah, it was done by four people. They couldn't run it.\n\nOkay. So there's Stumble Guys, there's Turkish Stumble Guys. What does that say about Finland? You know, not, not much, right? But speaking of rinky dink games though, with data points and a country that is growing and diversifying, Airrest's favorite, uh, Mishko, would you like to talk about French developer Million Victories?\n\nSo, we have to just drop this here just because it's a French company.\n\nSo, French mobile game developer Million Victories has completed a funding round, raising almost 40 million, more than any of the Turks. Exactly.\n\nTo be used in expanding operations and global presence. This funding comes from Havlli Investments, and to be clear, Havlli is private equity.\n\nEquity. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And it says from Austin, Texas, which will partner with Million Victories to focus on recruiting talent and accelerating investment in production, marketing, and user acquisition. So, super operational role. It's not we're backing them. It's like, no, we're helping you to operate. They have a flagship title, a 4X strategy title called Million LS World of Conquest. I believe this is a title which has human animals, like, you know, like a, like a lion with with a human torso. I [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] the most.\n\nIf you have human, if you have a mandal is a rhino and then there's like a girl that is a fox. I'm not [ __ ] downloading or touching it with a long stick. But Phil, talk to me about the uh, the numbers.\n\nAll right. So, oh man, 40 million is crazy. So, they made a 4X game. We'll talk about the 4X game in a moment, cuz it's a fascinating 4X game. But that being said, you're looking at a game that's only done 20 million life to date, is slowing down in terms of monthly active users. It's just slowing down in terms of downloads. I think the thing that I would point to is it looks like downloads started falling off after they may have secured the deal. I'll leave it to like better judges than myself, but like if you look at downloads really around February, they start to peak. And I am curious based on the timing of the deal when this gets signed. So I don't have any inside information, but I'm like, damn, like, goo, who's the UA?\n\nPhil, based on like little I know, talking to private equity, maybe they do a proper due diligence because they are coming in as operational partners. This is not DC who is following it in.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That, that's cool. That all right, makes sense. Just something that was interesting. The thesis behind the game is fascinating because they were trying to take on 4X with no base building.\n\nHuh.\n\nIt was all combat. And so they have a very clear thesis. They're still using timers to generate troops, but the thing that really matters is XP, which is earned through combat. There's so many things that reloop you back to the combat loop. And so you get this huge bonus from beating players that are targeted on the map. So they can kind of influence things and just run live ops, but it's all about combat. And don't me wrong, they're like, they're still loot boxes. They're just more limited. I would say the Gotacha is much weaker. Peace shields are not, you know, to the same degree. But the thing that they'll also do on the monetization side, which I, which I absolutely love, is they'll have SKUs that are up to $900 for like full legendary items or all gold items.\n\nYou know, I wanted to just take a moment cuz Forex is so hot right now. What people don't understand about systems like this and especially in games like Game of War is that they would constantly talk about inflation and you would see complaints on player forums saying like, \"Oh my god, now I pay a dollar and I get like 10 million coins when I used to pay a dollar and I would get 5 million coins.\" And there's a very specific reason for this, which is that you have servers which have a certain number of players. And those shards or those servers start to die out in terms of active populations once you seed them with a certain amount of players just by natural retention. And so if you pump new players into the shard, they're going to be at a different power score and a different layer of progression. And not only that, your track is moving out, right? You are adding more things to the Elder game. And so like the reason you see these things particularly in Forex game is that there's planned inflation that essentially functions as like an XP boost to move people along the progression curve. And that I think this game, you know, at least executed against that, I would say to a really healthy degree, which is wonderful to see. But by and large, like when you just look at the Forex market, it's still just a very small drop in the bucket. There's almost nothing going on here. Yeah. So, I mean, I hats off to them.\n\nAre you 4x if you don't have base building?\n\nLike, what?\n\nExpand, explode.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can still do the X's.\n\nExplore, exterminate. Yeah.\n\nYeah. French don't have time to build no bases.\n\nLet me, my, my commentary is on this. This game is tiny, right? Like $40 million. I am hoping to God that Havlli, who is doing UA financing, by the way, that a big portion of this is UA financing and not direct investment because $40 million in investment on a game that's barely like making any money is ridiculous, right? I, I don't think my buddy would do that. So, I'm hoping that this is actually UA financing and not an equity investment. I think again this probably is partially UA financing, which is just more of like a debt vehicle on cohorts and stuff. So, we shall see if they can scale this game. But, if we track this like funding round,\n\nfunding round,\n\nI know, but it was I, I read the press release, it seems a little bit since they're the only ones right there. There's no one else in this round as far as as the pest, but that's that's typical with private equity. They do take the other full round.\n\nWell, can we look at the next investment to shed some light on this?\n\nLet's stay on the other Forex. Yeah.\n\nGlobal Worldwide closes funding round, bum bum bum. Let me just go through this oversubscribed funding round led by who else than big ventures. Bitcraft is throwing money. So, this was very confusing press release. It had some jokes that people probably did not get. It was talking about like how the founders were building agricultural products and whatnot and now they're into games. Anyway, it was really confusing. Global Worldwide has made a game called Kingdom Maker. It's a Forex game that was kind of like accessible. It had this interesting looking graphics. It was picked up after uh, what, test marketing phase or or beta phase by Scopely, and Scopely essentially published it to a larger audience and it tanked. Uh, it could not scale. Didn't have the IP. This was before Fleet Command, I believe.\n\nNo, it was after Fleet Command. That is incorrect.\n\nIt was after Fleet Command. Interesting. So they had, they had the success of Fleet Command. They were like, let's double down. Kingdom Maker looks really cool. Yeah. Well, well, well, I'm thinking that they had the learnings and so nothing to do with with Fleet Command then, but nevertheless, so they looked at this game. Apparently, they had good early numbers. They couldn't scale it. I think there were layoffs regarding this particular studio that was working on Kingdom Maker. What makes Kingdom Maker and Global Worldwide so interesting is it's because it's led by the CEO and founder, Will Harbin. And Will Harbin, for the old dogs, is the CEO of Kixeye. that was for a brief moment the king of Facebook games and they had this recruitment video. Just go to YouTube, Kixeye recruitment video, and it is [ __ ] on the industry. Like they made this, this, this toxic masculinity promo piece which by the way I loved. Uh, it was all about like they had Mark Pinkis as this little boy throw throwing money at a company called Jenka with two dogs shagging each other as a logo. It had EA shown as E A RP games with like this old scenile person. Then they made fun of product managers with like the Asian dude at Kabam by the way.\n\nYeah, Kabam. Yeah, that's true. Kabam is the quintessential PM company.\n\nThey called it Kerploop.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then it ends with with Will Harbin being himself at [ __ ] like there's a Spartan helmet in his in his office and essentially he leaves the office on a helicopter in this video. Then it's all about like just you know be cool, make cool games and work for Kixeye. And Kixeye was making some of the most awesome games on Facebook. And then the platform shifted. Games moved to mobile. Kixeye stayed on web. They actually doubled down on web and their own platform. They couldn't pivot in time. Uh, they made a mobile that was there. At some point they were like, you know what, I think what we need in our portfolio is not mobile is mobile. And they got absolutely ravaged by Supercell. So if you ever played Backyard Monsters and you play Clash of Clans, you can kind of see the evolution that is happening from one platform in one game to another. The end of Kixeye was not, you know, beautiful. They had a fire sale. They were acquired by Stillfront and naturally that two ended up with litigations with Stillfront about earnouts by the way, just like the Subnotica and they lost that. So I just checked it recently. That was the end of Kixeye. You know, good to add probably before like I'm not mocking Will in any way, like good to add that before actually his gaming career. He was in another kid-friendly industry known as Energy Drinks and and and sold the company to Monster. So, I think this is his fourth company. So, he's been quite successful as an entrepreneur. Anyhow, I think it's great and I congratulate them on the race. It's very difficult and he had a LinkedIn post about how difficult it is to raise in this era of AI and hype. I am very hopeful that they ship a good game and I'm certain that the journey will be very entertaining to follow whatever happens because Mr. Harbin is at the forefront of this venture. I can't let this go. This one too because Will, it wasn't that they missed the boat in terms of moving from canvas to mobile is that Will was like so arrogant in his assumptions that mobile was nothing and that you know PC and his own platform was the way to go despite all the evidence to the contrary. He kept that strategy going for years after mobile was like a [ __ ] rocket ship. you know, like he mismanaged the entire company based on the arrogance that he was right about this particular part of the business, which didn't even make sense. Like I was living it through it with all these people that were working at Kixeye and they were just like befuddled at the situation, you know, and so it's like, you know, buyer beware, dude. Like this guy is is is alone, you know? He's like he's a little bit nutty.\n\nI wouldn't go that far. I can say I've met Will and I met I think I met him in 2014. So this was right about the time where mobile was really crushing it. Like from my perspective, I think the the recruitment video, he wasn't playing a character that's as well. He's a very confident person. Let's put it that way.\n\nYeah, you could tell from the video which was iconic and amazing and you know, if you talk about building culture to, you know, everything you talked about last week, that certainly built a culture.\n\nYeah, he wore that suit. Like he looked exactly like that when I met him. Like he had the button up open in San Francisco. Nobody wears this in San Francisco. So I can just say...\n\nYeah. What's interesting is Scopely doesn't have many failures and sadly this was this uh, this was one of them.\n\nYeah. They, they really put their back against it.\n\nWell, well, I don't think we know that at all. What do you mean? I think there's...\n\nWell, if they launch it and goes to like, like...\n\nNo, I mean, look at, look at the scale of DAU here. We're looking at maybe 150,000 active users. This isn't like a, you know, what one Scopely GM referred to as a scorched earth launch to number one. This is something much more moderate that was moved on from at some point. And I don't think this entire graph by the way is under Scopely's tenure. I think they picked it up for as a publisher later into it. The thing I also want to point out similar to million victories is like they did some fascinating things to like the 4X core and so Will had spoke at the Play Adventures conference and one of the\n\n\nThings he points out.\nAbout *Kingdom Maker* is like, \"Where is the freaking sex in games?\" Like, you look at *Game of Thrones*, like half of that is about lineage, half of that is about creating dynasties. There is none of that, like player storytelling, in 4X. And what if we brought that, and they did that in *Kingdom Maker*? Hence, the maker part is like you making your kingdom, and so, like, you can make it, baby, right? Those are things you can do. You can create...\n\nThere is still a fascinating core here that I feel like has been underexplored, and I think makes sense in a 4X context. It was a fun game. Like, it was a standout game, and Kixeye was known to make really standout games in this category. Yeah. I don't know. It's, I think they have as good of a shot as anybody, but Chinese are kind of [ __ ] crushing this game, like 4x Chinese circuit. Yeah, the game of Forex. They're, you know, they own it. So, I don't know. Should we talk about other kings?\n\nYes. So, from Neil at mobilegamer.biz, anonymous sources within the mobile developer king have said that the staff have been laid off. So, if you might remember, as part of the Microsoft layoffs that happened, about 200 people were reportedly laid off from the King ecosystem. So, speaking to mobilegamer.biz, one staff member at the *Candy Crush Saga* maker said that many of the level designers had been let go after spending months creating tools that would build levels more quickly. So, in a sense, these teams were getting replaced by the AI tools that they helped train. Ouch. If that is true, Zinga had a similar thing where I remember people were training their counterparts in India, and then they got let go. Yeah. Then, and in some cases, it was even transparent, like, \"Go and train this team in India, and they will end up taking your job, and maybe you move on to the next project, or maybe you move on to the next company.\" Yeah, it's pretty, pretty brutal.\n\nI've read this among the people laid off who are also narrative designers, and that kind of stuck with me because I was like, \"Who are the plural narrative designers working on the *Candy Crush* franchise?\" I, I maybe I'm missing the uh, the narrative of the *Candy Crush*. There's an absolutely deep plot with the *Candy Crush*, for sure.\n\nYeah, my wife plays *Candy Crush* like crazy. I need to ask her, like, \"How's the story?\"\n\nThe other part in the article was interesting. 50 people were laid off from *Farm Heroes Saga*. Oh my. I was like, \"Oh, I totally forgot about that game.\" And so, not all of the 200 were directly on *Candy Crush*. Just kind of another FYI.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, *Monopoly Go* with KO.\n\nWhat the [ __ ]\n\nThis is, yeah. Yeah. I mean, *Moon Active* takes on *Monopoly Go* with Komas Co.\n\nSo, *Monopoly Go* with *Coin Master* board. All right. *Moon Active* is going after *Scopely* in a big way. They have launched, in a sense. It's like a take on a take on a take. So, you had *Coin Master*, then you had *Monopoly Go*, which kind of used those systems. Now *Moon Active* is doing a version of *Monopoly Go* with the original kind of version that they came up with. And *Coin Master* was a take on another game, the pirate something. Pirates... No, no, it was a pirate something. Uh oh. *Board Kings*. Yes.\n\nNo, no, no. Those are both. It was a pirate kings or something like that. It was another jelly button game that played. Anyways, everybody's stealing from everybody, just to be everyone. Uh, inspired by is what we'd like to say.\n\nI, what I love about all of this is that this is like industrial espionage in open, in the [ __ ] open, dude. This is like what's good for the goose is good for the gander, dude. You know, [ __ ] *Scopely* copies *Moon Active* completely, right? And [ __ ] layers on some [ __ ] amazing *IP*, right? Now Moon's copying them right the [ __ ] back, right in their wheelhouse with their [ __ ] *IP* as the headline, right, of the *Coin Master*, right? So, it's actually [ __ ] brilliant, dude. It's absolutely brilliant, right? So, I love it. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if this is going to be successful. We'll see. But having the *Coin Master* brand is huge here. But, dude, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. You know, you want to [ __ ] with them, they're going to [ __ ] with you. Okay. So, don't think about them, you know.\n\nHold up. You think the brand matters here? The *Coin Master* brand.\n\nI don't know if it does. The search is going to... I mean, they might cannibalize their existing game, but maybe they don't care. Maybe they're hoping OnePlus 3. My understanding is that the feeling is, and I, and I talk to these guys once in a while, is that in some ways, *Scopely*, you know, grew the addressable audience, like, probably moving people away from traditional casino games and putting them in these type of games, which is more compelling, you know, like, I don't know, there's like all kinds of ideas here. So, perhaps I think what I would think is that they're just going after straight after *Scopely* share, right? So, they want to maintain their share on their game and then just go after and start stripping share away from *Scopely*, right, to build their business overall. They're going for the jugular. They're not [ __ ] around, right? And so, *Monopoly Go* better, you know, get back on track with terms of features and stuff like that, because I think what'll likely happen, I haven't looked at the game too closely, is that they're just going to be a better version of the *Monopoly* game to some degree would be my guess. I don't know. We'll see.\n\nThe *IP* is a beachhead, right? I feel like we've spent so much time talking about this, though. It's the unique combination of *Monopoly*, which was already successful in gambling environments, like the McDonald's game or Vegas slots licensing. Like, that is a beachhead. Like, that is a *CPI* effect that, like, that is your *TAM*. That is Jen's fun fact you will see in the first five minutes of her YouTube video, which you can catch with Ben Webb. Link, link in the description.\n\nBut like, that, that was an important part of, like, this isn't like, this isn't *Empire Strike Back*. Are you kidding me? Like, this *Monopoly Go* genre. Like, this is small potatoes.\n\nAll right. So, I'm actually leading towards your point of view on this. So, I'm just kind of talking on both sides of my mouth right here. But like, at the end of the day, *Monopoly Go* is at a point in which they are doing insane levels of TV advertising, which we all know is [ __ ] [ __ ], right? And their revenue is completely deteriorating, right?\n\nNo. No. So, they, *Scopely*'s team pulled it out of the ass this quarter. Like, you can look at it. Downloads flattened, but revenue went up. I mean, don't get me wrong, the long run trend is still there, downward sloping. But you can clearly see Javier just like...\n\nOver, over them.\n\nAnd they have a web shop, and they have a web shop called... I don't care about the web shop. I don't understand why we don't care about the [ __ ] web shop. It's money.\n\nWhat actually, what *Moon Active* likely will do, because these guys are [ __ ] ruthless, right? Is they are going to *UA* the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of this thing, right? They are going to go after every single [ __ ] person that's playing *Monopoly Go* to get into their game, and they're going to spend whatever it takes to get there, dude. And so, like, yeah, it's an arms race.\n\nYeah, it's a [ __ ] arms race. And I think, I think the Israelis are going to win this one. I mean, I think they potentially could win this one. They... Israeli Saudi showdown now.\n\nWell, I don't mean to be political, but these guys are kind of ruthless about getting that what they need done. I have my faith in *Moon Active* to get this, get this done.\n\nCan't they both win?\n\nI mean, they're kind of growing together. I, I honestly don't think that's the goal. I don't think that's the goal for both to win, right? But they kind of grow the category together. Like it seemed like...\n\nI mean, puzzle... I mean, you think about the puzzle category and how many match three players there are now. I guess can they grow the pie for this kind of a new genre? This, like, I think they call it coin looter as a sub coin battler.\n\nOh, interesting.\n\nAnd by the way, love the art style. They would have done a different execution if they were trying to expand the market, right? Like, they wouldn't have done exactly what *Monopoly* is.\n\nThey should have done that, though. Like, this, this is what I don't understand, Eric, is like, you'll admit that *Monopoly Go* is at the edge of user acquisition, and so they're like turning to TV ads because *CPIs* are so high. And now you're telling me that the Israelis are going to show up with *Coin Master* board, and they're going to spend a bunch more against the same pool of users. Like, this market is filling up. This is not what we should be paying attention to. Like, to give you an example, like, this market is already getting clones. Like, just as an example, *Peggy Go Clash of Coin* is like [ __ ] that appears on this list.\n\nIt's been for a while that this game has been for a while. It's like a love and stake.\n\nAnd this has also already beenified.\n\nSo, the other thing that we haven't covered is something that has like a hyper casual loop to bring people in, which is *Carnival Tycoon*, which is basically an idler, which is dripped off from another idol game called *Idol Theme Park*, which builds in a slot machine. Like, there's a lot happening in the subg genre, but like, this is not a good strategy to get there. And you know, what are you going to do on the *CPI* side? That's interesting here. It's like, what's happening in Forex? Brand matters, but it's like, what's happening in Forex? How Forex started to take in *RPG* components, gotcha character, collector, these coin looters or coin battlers are now combining all of these different hyper casual things together.\n\nI do think that brand matters, and you know, back when I was on the Hasbro business at EA back in when Facebook started, that's when Zingga came out with a ripoff of Scrabble called *Words with Friends*, and there actually was room in a sense for both because of, like, a little bit of the innovation that they did there. The interesting thing here is going to be, you know, how close can they get and not infringe on the *Monopoly* trademark, which, by the way, is, it's only limited to a few different things. It's limited to, like, the four corners of the board, like the chance and community square things. So, I, I think they can still go after it, but brand matters.\n\nOkay. I think, I think we're focusing on the wrong things right now, right? We're talking about, like, these peripheral, like, design choices and casual games and all this other stuff. We're talking about a *UA* war, right? We're not talking about, like, product. We're not talking about features, right? We're, we're talking about the fact that this is like *UA* arbitrage at its finest, right? In terms of how companies are going after... So, like, when you talk about Puzzle, for instance, the only reason Puzzle continues to grow is because Dream Games is spending insane amounts of money with 24-month paybacks, right? Like, insane *CPIs*, right? And so, that's where the battle is being...\n\nYeah, but isn't this the entire mobile industry? Like, it...\n\nNo, I know. But, but you guys are bringing up these [ __ ] chachki games that aren't even making a dent in the industry. These are irrelevant, right? These are absolute mice nuts, right?\n\nWhat I'm saying is that these are the big boys with the biggest budgets that are private. They don't give a [ __ ] about profitability, really, and they're going for the jugular, right? And Dream Games has the same idea. Like, even though they're private, like, they were just basically spending with reckless abandon in order to gain as much share as possible, right? Like, it's a different world, right? Than when we were back in canvas days or the early days of mobile. This is like just a [ __ ] gunfight, you know, and, and, and these guys are ruthless, right? And so, and so is *Scopway*. *Scope* was absolutely ruthless with their game when they came out against you topping coin *Coin Master* and then completely just like burying them on the *UA* side. That's not what we're... because what we're, what we're arguing is not necessarily what the intent is. Like, maybe they'll have the big war chest, maybe they won't. But even if they do, I'm just arguing that it's very silly because we're already seeing *Monopoly Go* hit a wall. There's also the *IP* as a moat. So, you got to consider those two things, which I think make it a poor strategy. I mean, look at, it's only going to be x number of dollars in development cost, and they are going to have a rorowaz number, right? I have a hard time imagining, Eric, that they're going to continue to shove coal into a rorowaz number that's declining. That can continue infinitely. And the reason I'm bringing up these quote chachki games is because I'm trying to show you that in this *UA* game for coin battlers, we're starting to see the frozen city white out survival playbook emerge in *Carnival Tycoon*, which is what I'm trying to point out to you, is an idol game that turns into a game that has a *Monopoly Go*. Same thing with [ __ ] *Fish of Fortune*, which I, I want to talk about at some point, cuz it's such a fascinating game, but again, you're seeing other people go after this in a bigger strategy. No, they're not scaled right now, but these are the real attempts.\n\nThey're bringing like plushies to a gunfight, right? They don't have the means. They don't have a hundred or $200 million to throw a user acquisition. These like Chachki games can't even compete. They're not even in the discussion because they don't have the money to go after it, right? Plenty of match three games. There are plenty of match three games that compete at all levels. No.\n\nLike, just because King exists.\n\nNo, absolutely not.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Like, *Tactile Games*...\n\n\nLily's Garden, one example.\nDude, those guys spent all kinds of money like sure they spent money, but I'm saying they exist at all sizes.\nLook it.\nYeah.\nAgain, like again, that is a completely different market, right?\nWe're talking about the big boys going after each other right now.\nBut Lily's Garden survived in the wake of, let's say, the UA war between Royal Match and, you know, another big match three titan, which by the way, Candy Crush continues to like drive crazy downloads.\nSo, I'm just saying like you can survive in this market at different equilibriums.\nSo yes, there are the big boys and yes, there are people there's the whales and the and a little bit of like the minnows that can still exist and make money as a smaller company, but you said that, you know, people like Kavali are coming in and doing UA financing.\nThere's the opportunity for these games to get acquired by one of the bigger companies who then want to invest in a game that has great KPIs are you know rorowaz positive and maybe their goal isn't to do it on their own but is to wave their ham and say by me cuz I have a product that can be scaled is is that like a strategy worth it for some of the smaller ones?\nI mean I think to Phil's point which was astute which is this the new what's working in forex you know it's it's Voltron it's like all of these parts coming together make something bigger.\nIs that in a sense the strategy that we're now seeing in coin battlers showing up is what was successful in Forex.\nThe second part I would say is that yes, like we're seeing a more casual approach to these social casino style games that are attracting a broader audience but also extracting from the existing games like you know all the big fish casino and all those rest of the games are continued to deteriorate right so yes I mean I think in essence like these big guys are capturing not only expanding the market but capturing lots of share in the market at the same time so that's great but it's again a battle of the big, right?\nLike the companies that are gaining all the share are basically, you know, Scopely and Moon Active, right?\nYeah.\nAnd post IDFA, it's it when the market is not growing, when these big ones grow, they actually take it from the small ones.\nAnimals and coins, which was now bought by Blade Tikka, that was a one game.\nThey did what like I I forget, but that was acquired.\nThey are right here number two on this list in terms of downloads in the last year in the United States.\nOkay.\nThe part of the reason I was thinking about this is that Frank Jabbo was on a podcast recently and he it was really Christopher Driggs and so Frank is the most pragmatic person I've ever met.\nLike he's just brilliant.\nAnd what he said and it really resonates with me is that you don't care if it's a red ocean if you're a shark, right?\nAnd that's my whole point, right?\nThere's just a bunch of sharks going after this in a [ __ ] completely red ocean and they are destroying everybody, right?\nLike it's so hard to compete, you know?\nAnd that's why I love like this like battle of the huge, you know, that are going after this market with games that are almost identical to each other.\nAnd it again, it is industrial espionage right in our faces, you know, it's like it's brilliant, right?\nAnd so that's where the market is right now or that's the biggest part of the market.\nSure, people are maybe winning on on the smaller side here and there, but like can you compete with a 24 year payback?\nThat's not a rorowaz that you can actually bank on, you know?\nLike that's crazy.\nI want to just add two comments.\nI think the the art style is beautiful with the latest Moon Active game.\nThat's 100% the art style.\nYes, I I do have to say it is it is really beautiful compared to the previous one.\nIt's really cute.\nAnd then I want to give a kudos for not doing any press releases or celebrity campaigns at least yet.\nIt's in tech testing.\nIt's in the Philippines.\nI I'm not surprised that they do it and I will be equally as dismissive with Moon Active as I was with Scopely and Dream.\nSo, I bet they will not do press releases though.\nThat's one thing that they will not do.\nThey're going to do a brand campaign.\nPaul Lebron\nKardashian, let's go.\nCourtney Cox, Lisa Quudro, you still there?\nOh, we got a game for you, right?\nBut I got to go.\nBye everybody.\nYou did it.\nYou made it to the end of the episode.\nAs a fan of the show, it would help us out if
