This is the thing that really gets me about cookie banners, too. It's not just the EU. It's the entire world. You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet. If you go to goddamn Mars on one of Elon's rockets and you try to access a web page, you'll still see a cookie banner. No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense. It sometimes feels like we're barely better off. Like web pages aren't that different from what they were in the late 90s, early 2000s. They're still just forms. They still just write to databases. A lot of people, I think, are very uncomfortable with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys. They just make systems that create, read, update, or delete rows in a database. And they have to compensate for that existential dread by over complicating things. That's a huge part of the satisfaction of driving a race car is driving it at the edge of adhesion, as we call it, where you're essentially just a tiny movement away from spinning out. Doesn't take much. Then the car starts rotating. Once it starts rotating, you lose grip and you're going for the wall. That balance of danger and skill is what's so intoxicating.\n\nThe following is a conversation with David Heinemeier Hansson, also known as DHH. He is a legend in the programming and tech world. Brilliant and insightful, sometimes controversial and always fun to talk to. He's the creator of Ruby on Rails, which is an influential web development framework behind many websites used by millions of people, including Shopify, GitHub, and Airbnb. He is the co-owner and CTO of 37signals that created Basecamp and HEY. He is a New York Times best-selling author together with his co-author Jason Fried of four books: REWORK, REMOTE, Getting Real, and It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work. And on top of that, he's also a race car driver, including being a class winner at the legendary 24-hour Le Mans race. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

And now, dear friends, here's DHH.\n\nFor someone who became a legendary programmer, you officially got into programming late in life. And I guess that's because uh you tried to learn how to program a few times and you failed. So can you tell me the uh the full story, the saga of your failures to learn programming? Was Commodore 64 involved? Commodore 64 was the inspiration. I really wanted a Commodore 64. That was the first computer I ever sat down in front. And the way I sat down in front of it was I was 5 years old and there was this one kid on my street who had a Commodore 64. No one else had a computer, so we were all the kids just getting over there and we were all playing Y Kung Fu. I don't know if you've ever seen that game. It was one of the original fighting games. It's really a great game. And I was playing that for the first time at 5 years old. And we were like seven kids sitting up in this one kid's bedroom all taking our turn to play the game. And I just found that unbelievably interesting. And I begged and I begged and I begged my dad, could I get a computer? And he finally comes home. He's like, \"I got your computer.\" I was like, \"Yes, my own Commodore 64.\" And he pulls out this black, green, and blue keyboard. That's an Armstrong 464. I was like, \"Dad, what's this? The disappointment. This is not a Commodore 64.\" But it was a computer. So, I got my first computer at essentially 6 years old, that Armstrad 464. And of course, the first thing I wanted to do, I wanted to play video games. And I think the computer, which he, by the way, had traded for a TV and a stereo recorder or something like that, came with like two games. One was this Frogger game where you had to escape from underground. It was actually kind of dark, like this frog. You're trying to get it out from underground. And I was just I was pretty bad at it. And I only had those two games. And then I wanted more games. And one way to get more games when you're a kid who don't have a lot of money and can't just buy a bunch of games is to type them in yourself. Back in '84, '85 magazines would literally print source code at the back of their magazines and you could just sit and type it in. So I tried to do that and it would take like two hours to print this game into the Armistrad and of course I'd make some spelling mistake along the way and something wouldn't work and the whole thing I wasn't that good of English. I was born in Denmark. So I was really trying to get into it because I wanted all these games and didn't have the money to buy them and I tried quite hard for quite a while to get into it but it just never clicked. And then I discovered the magic of piracy. And after that I kind basically just took some time off from learning to program because well now suddenly I had access to all sorts of games. So that was the first attempt like around six, seven years old. And what's funny is I remember these fragments. I remember not understanding the purpose of a variable. If if there's a thing and you assign something, why would you assign another thing to it? So, for some reason, I understood constants. Like, constants made sense to me, but variables didn't. Then, maybe I'm 11 or 12. I've gotten into the AmIGGA at this point. The Amigga, by the way, still perhaps my favorite computer of all time. I mean, this is one of those things where you like people get older and they're like, \"Oh, the music from the 80s was amazing.\" To me, even as someone who loves computers, who loved new computers, the AmIGGA was this magical machine that was made by the same company that produced the Commodore 64. And I got the AmIGGA 500, I think in '87. Look at this sexy thing. That is a sexy machine right there. This is from an age, by the way, where computing wasn't global in the same sense. The different territories had different computers that were popular. The Amigga was really popular in Europe, but it wasn't very popular at all in the US, as far as I understand. It wasn't popular in Japan. The there were just different machines. The Apple 2 was a big thing in the US. I'd never even heard of Apple in the 80s in Copenhagen. But the Amigga 500 was the machine that brought me to want to try it again. And you know what's funny? The reason I wanted to try it again was I remembered the first time to learn. And then there was this programming language that was literally called easy Amos.\nMhm.\nLike the easy version of Amos. I'm like, if it's if it's easy Amos, how hard can it be? I got to be able to figure this out. And this time I tried harder. I got into conditionals. I got into loops. I got into all these things and I still I couldn't do it. And on the second attempt, I really got to the point like maybe this is just maybe I'm not smart enough. Maybe programming is just not maybe it's too much math. Like I like math in this sort of superficial way. I don't like it in the deep way that some of my perhaps slightly nerdier friends did who I had tremendous respect for. Like I'm not that person. I'm not the ma math geek who's going to figure it all out. So after that attempt with easy Amos and failing to even get I don't even think I completed one even very basic game. I thought the program is just not for me. I'm going to have to do something else. I still love computers. I still love video games. I actually at that time had already begun making friends with people who knew how to program who weren't even programming easy Amos. They were programming freaking Assembler. And I would sit down and just go I'm how do you the moves and the memories and the copies? How do you even do this? I don't even understand how you go from this to AmIGGA demos, for example. That was the big thing with the Amigga. had this wonderful demo scene in Europe. It's this really interesting period of time in the Amigga's history where you had all these programmers spread out mostly all over Europe who would compete on graphic competitions where you could probably bring one of these on YouTube on on this thing. They would make these little um almost like music videos combining some MIDI music, combining some cool graphics and they would do all of it in like 4K. 4 kilobytes that is not 4K is a revolution, 4 kilobytes of of memory. And I just thought that was such a cool scene. This was obviously pre- internet. It was even pre bulletin board systems to some extent. me was you swap your demo software with someone else by sending them a disc in the mail like the 3.5s and I just I was enamored with that whole scene. I was enamored with what they were able to create and I just wanted to be a part of it even though I kind of didn't have any skills to contribute and that's how I got into running BBS's. I didn't learn programming then and I wouldn't learn programming until much later until I was almost 20 years old. The bulletin board systems existed in this funny space where they were partly a service to the demo scenes allowing all these demo groups to distribute their amazing demos. And then it was also a place to trade piracy software, pirated software. And I ended up starting one of those when I was 14 years old in my tiny little bedroom in Copenhagen. I had my at that point Amigga 4000. I had three telephone lines coming into my tiny room.\nNice.\nWhich was funny because again, I'm 14 years old. By the time I was installing my third line, you had to get someone from the telephone company to come do it. I get this guy and he's just looking around like, \"What is this? Why the hell is a 14-year-old having three phone lines into their tiny little bedroom? What are what's going on here? Why are all these modems blinking red and um black and making funny sounds?\" Did your parents know? They did and they didn't. They knew I had the phone lines. They knew I had the computer. I don't think they really understood that I was trading pirated software that was both illegal and whatever else was going on. Oh, we should probably say that in Europe, maybe you can comment on this in especially in Eastern Europe, but Europe in general, piracy, I think, was more acceptable than it was in the United States. I don't know there maybe maybe it's just my upbringing. That conversation wasn't present. I never spoke to anyone growing up in Denmark who had any moral qualms whatsoever about piracy. It was just completely accepted that you're a kid. You want a lot of games. You don't have a lot of money. What do you do? You trade.\nYeah.\nSome people would occasionally buy a game. I mean, I once bought a uh Sega Master System and the I bought one game cuz that was what I could afford. I got Afterburner 2. I don't know if you've ever played that game. It's pretty bad implementation on the uh Sega Master System, but it was like 600 crowners and I was making money at that time uh doing newspaper delivery. I had to do that for a month to afford one game. I like video games way too much to wait a month just to get one game. So piracy was just the way you did it. And that was how I got into running this bulletin board system, being part of the demo scene, being part of the piracy scene to some extent. And then also at some point realizing, oh, you can actually also make money on this and this can fund buying more phone lines and buying more modems and buying more amiggas. Oh yeah, that was one of the demo parties. These were amazing things.\nWhat am I looking at?\nLook at all those CRT monitors.\nAll these CRT monitors. Again, when I was 14, I I don't understand fully why my parents allowed this, but I traveled from Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, to O, this tiny little town in Judan on the train with a bunch of dudes who were like late teens in their 20s. I'm 14 years old. I'm lugging my 14in CRT monitor with my computer in the back to go to the party. That was what it was called. That was the biggest demo scene party at that time. And it was exactly as you see in that picture. Thousands of people just lining up with their computers, programming demos all day long and trading these things back and forth.\nThat's kind of awesome. Not going to lie, it's a little ridiculous.\nIt's totally awesome. And I I I miss it in ways where the internet has connected people in some ways. But the connection you get from sitting right next to someone else Yeah. who has their own CRT monitor, who's lugged it halfway around the country to get there is truly special because it was also just this burst of creativity. You're constantly running around. You're constantly surrounded by people who are really good at what they could do. They're really good at programming computers. It's infectious. It was part of that pang I felt then going like, \"Oh man, why can't I figure this out? I mean, why can't I even figure out easy Amos?\" I it's kind of frustrating but on your third attempt you a little more successful. So third attempt is when I start getting it. This is when I start helping out let's say building things for the internet. So around 95 I think it is or 96 I discovered the internet actually in ninth grade that was my first experience. I went to some university in in Denmark and in ninth grade we had this excursion and they sat us down in front of a computer and the computer had Netscape Navigator the first version or maybe it was even the the precursor to that and they had a text editor and us kids just got like hey built something on the internet and it was just HTML and the first thing you do is like oh I can make the text text blink by just putting in this tag and saving it. That was that moment. That was actually when I reawakened the urge to want to learn to program because I got a positive experience. All the other experiences I had with programming was I'd spend hours typing something in, I'd click run and it wouldn't work. And I'd get an error message that made no sense to me as a kid, either at six or seven or at 12. And here I am sitting in front of a computer connected to the internet and I'm making text blink. I'm making it larger. I'm turning it into\n\n\nan H1 or an H2.\nAnd these guys out here, we just did it for like an hour and a half.\nAnd suddenly I go, \"Oh, I can make things for the internet that someone in Germany can be able to access and see, and I don't have to ask anyone for permission.\nThis is super cool.\nI got to do more of this.\"\nSo I got into the internet.\nI got into working with HTML, and I still had all these friends from these demo parties, and I started working with them on creating gaming websites.\nI'd write about the video games.\nI'd review him.\nThis was another good way of getting new video games was to walk down to some store and say like, \"Hey, I'm a I'm a journalist.\"\nI'm like this 15-year-old kid, and they're they're looking at me, \"You're a journalist?\"\n\"Yeah.\nCan I borrow some some games?\"\nCuz this was when games moved on to the PlayStation and these other things.\nYou couldn't just as easily pirate, at least not at first.\nSo, I went down there, did all that.\nAnd that started the journey of the internet for me.\nIt started working on these gaming websites, working with programmers, figuring out that I could do something.\nI could work on the HTML part.\nIt's not really programming, but it kind of smells like it.\nYou're talking to a computer, you're making it put text on the screen, and you're communicating with someone halfway around the world.\nSo, that became my pathway back into programming.\nAnd then slowly I picked up more and more of it.\nFirst website I did with someone, one of these programmers from the demo scene that was dynamic was ASP.NET.\nnet, and it wasn't even actually called .net, that was what we started on, and then we moved on to PHP, and PHP was when I finally got it, when it finally clicked, when conditionals and loops and variables and all of that stuff started to make sense enough to me that I thought I can do this.\nSo would it be fair to say that we wouldn't have DHH without PHP, and therefore you owe all your success to PHP?\n100% that's true, and it's even better than that because it's PHP to me didn't just give me a start in terms of making my own web applications, it actually gave me a bar.\nIn many ways, I think the pinnacle of developer web developer ergonomics is late '90s PHP.\nYou write this script, you FTP it to a server, and instantly it's deployed, instantly it's available.\nYou change anything in that file, and you reload, boom, it's right there.\nThere's no web servers, there's no setup, there's just an Apache that runs mod PHP.\nAnd it was essentially the easiest way to get a dynamic web page up and going.\nAnd this is one of the things I've been chasing that high for basically the rest of my career, that it was so easy to make things for the internet in the mid to late 90s.\nHow did we lose the sensibilities that allowed us to not just work this way, but get new people into the industry to give them their success experiences that I had, adding a freaking Blink tag to an HTML page, ftping a PHP page to an Apache web server without knowing really anything about anything, without knowing anything about frameworks, without knowing anything about setup, all of that stuff have really taken us to a place where it sometimes feels like we're barely better off.\nLike web pages aren't that different from what they were in the late 90s, early 2000s.\nThey're still just forms.\nThey still just write to databases.\nA lot of people, I think, are very uncomfortable with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys.\nThey just make systems that create, read, update, or delete rows in a database.\nAnd they have to compensate for that existential dread by over complicating things.\nNow, that's a bit of a character.\nThere's more to it, and there's things you can learn for more sophisticated ways of thinking about this, but there's still an ideal here, which was why I was so happy you had Peter Levels on because he still basically works like this.\nAnd I look at that and go like, \"Man, that's amazing.\"\nYeah, you're chasing that high.\nHe's been high all along using PHP, jQuery, and SQLite.\nI think it's amazing because he's proving that this isn't just a nostalgic dream.\nHe's actually doing it.\nHe's running all these businesses.\nNow, some of that is, as he would admit up front, is that he's just one guy.\nAnd you can do different things when you're just one guy.\nWhen you're working in a team, when I started working on the team, when I started working with Jason Fried on Basecamp, we at first didn't use version control together.\nI used version control for myself, and then I thought, \"You know what, designers, ah, they're probably not smart enough to figure out CVS.\"\nYeah.\nAnd therefore I just like, \"No, no, no.\nYou just FTP it up.\nYou just FTP it.\"\nI knew they knew how to do FTP.\nAnd then after the third time, I had overridden their changes, I was like, \"God damn it.\nI guess I got to teach Jason CBS to not do that again.\"\nBut I think there's still way more truth to the fact that we can work the way we did in the '90s, work the way Peter works today, even in the team context, and that we've been far too willing to hand over far too much of our developer ergonomics to the merchants of complexity.\nAnd you've been chasing that with Rails 8.\nSo h how do you bring all the cool features of a modern framework and make it no build, make it as as easy to create something and to ship it as it was in the '90s with just PHP?\nIt's very difficult for me to beat the Peter Level's approach uh of just just it's so easy to just ship some PHP, and it should be why should it be harder than that?\nOur computers today are almost infinitely faster than what they were in the 90s.\nSo, shouldn't we be able to work in even easier ways?\nWe should be looking back on the '90s and go like, \"Oh, that was way too complicated.\nNow we have more sophisticated technology that's way faster, and it allows us to work in these easier to use ways.\"\nBut that's not true.\nBut now you can see the line I draw in my work with Ruby and Rails and especially with Rails 8.\nNo build to me is reaching back to that '90s feeling and going now we can do some of those things without giving up on all the progress because I do think you can get too nostalgic.\nI do think you can start just fantasizing that everything was better in the '90s.\nIt wasn't.\nI mean I was there.\nThere was a lot of things that sucked.\nAnd if we can somehow find a way to combine the advantages and advances we've had over the past 20 years with that ease of developer ergonomics, we can win.\nNo build is a rejection of the part of web development I've hated the most in the past 10-15 years, which is the JavaScript scene.\nYeah.\nAnd I don't say that as someone who hates JavaScript.\nI mean I often joke that JavaScript is my second favorite programming language.\nIt's a very distant second.\nRuby is by far in a way number one.\nBut I actually like JavaScript.\nI don't think it's a bad language.\nIt gets a lot of flak.\nPeople add a string of two plus a one and it gives something nonsense, and I just go like, \"Yeah, but why are you why would you do that?\nJust don't do that.\"\nThe language is actually quite lovely, especially the modern version, ES6, that really introduced a proper class syntax to it.\nSo I could work with JavaScript in many of the same ways that I love working with Ruby made things so much better.\nBut in the early 2010s until quite recently, all of that advancement happened in pre-processing, happened in built pipelines.\nThe browsers couldn't speak a dialect of JavaScript that was pleasant to work with.\nSo everyone started to pre-compiling their JavaScript to be able to use more modern ways of programming with a browser that was seen as stuck with an ancient version of JavaScript that no one actually wanted to work with.\nAnd that made sense to me, but it was also deeply unpleasant.\nAnd I remember thinking during that time, the dark ages as I refer to them with JavaScript, that this cannot be the final destination.\nThere's no way that we have managed to turn the internet into such an unpleasant place to work where I would start working on a project in JavaScript using Webpack and all of these dependencies, and I would put it down for literally 5 minutes and the thing wouldn't compile anymore.\nThe amount of churn that the JavaScript community, especially with its frameworks and its tooling, went through in the decade from 2010 to 2020 was absurd.\nAnd you had to be trapped inside of that asylum to not realize what an utterly perverse situation we had landed ourselves in.\nWhy does everything break all the time?\nI mean, the joke wouldn't be just that the software would break.\nThat would annoy me personally.\nBut then I'd go on hacker news and I'd see some thread on the latest JavaScript release of some framework, and the thread would be like um someone would ask, \"Well, aren't we using the thing we just used three months ago?\"\nAnd people would be like, \"That thing is so outdated, that's so three months ago, you got to get with the new program, we're completely rewriting everything for the teen time, and anything you've learned in the framework you've been spending the last amount of time on, it's all useless.\nYou got to throw everything out and you got to start over.\nWhy aren't you doing it, stupid idiot?\"\nIs that a kind of mass hysteria that took over the developer community?\nYou think?\nLike where you have to keep creating new frameworks and new frameworks, and we are we past that dark age?\nI think we're getting out of it.\nAnd we're getting out of it because browsers have gotten so much better.\nThere was a stagnation in browser technology.\nSome of it was an overhang all the way back from IE5.\nSo I5 essentially put the whole internet development experience into a deep freeze because Microsoft won the browser wars in the mid 2000s, and then they basically disbanded their browser development team because they're like, \"All right, job done, we don't need any more innovation on the internet.\nCan we just go back to writing Windows forms or something now that we control everything?\"\nAnd it really wasn't until obviously Firefox kind of kindled a little bit of something, then Chrome got into the scene and Google got serious about moving the web forward that you had an kindling of maybe the browser could be better, maybe the browser wasn't frozen in time in 2005, maybe the browser could actually evolve like at the development platform that it is.\nBut then what happened was you had a lot of smart people who poured in to the web because the web turned out to be the greatest application development platform of all time.\nThis was where all the money was being made.\nThis were this was where all the billionaires were being minted.\nThis was where the Facebooks and whatever of the world came to be.\nSo you had all of this brain power applied to the problem of how to work with the web.\nAnd there were some very smart people with some I'm sure very good ideas who did not have uh programmer happiness as their motivation.\nNumber one, they had other priorities, and those priorities allowed them to discount and even rationalize the complexity they were injecting everywhere.\nSome of that complexity came from organizational structure.\nWhen you have a company like Facebook, for example, that does depend on the web and want to push it forward but have sliced the development role job into these tiny little niches.\n\"I'm a front-end glob pipeline configurator.\"\n\"Oh yeah, well, I'm a front-end whatever engineer.\"\nAnd suddenly the web developer was no longer one person.\nIt was 15 different roles.\nThat in itself injected a ton of complexity.\nBut I also want to give it the bold case here, which was that some of that complexity was necessary to get to where we are today.\nThat the complexity was a bridge.\nIt wasn't the destination, but we had to cross that bridge to get to where we are today.\nWhere browsers are frankly incredible.\nThe JavaScript you can write in a text file and then serve on a web server for a browser to ingest is amazing.\nIt's actually a really good experience.\nYou don't need any pre-processing.\nYou can just write text files, send them to a browser, and you have an incredible development.\nAnd we should also say that it can kind of be broken.\nAt least the HTML, but even the JavaScript could be a little bit broken, and it kind of still works.\nLike maybe it halfass works, but like the just the amount of mess of smelly code that a browser has to deal with is insane.\nThis is one of the hardest problems in computing today is to parse the entire internet because thankfully for us as web developers, but perhaps not so much for the browser developers, every web page that has ever been created minus the brief period with flash still runs today.\nThe web page I did in ninth grade would render on a modern browser today, 30 years later.\nThat is completely crazy when you think about the amount of evolution we've had with the web, how much better we've made it, how many more standards browsers have adopted.\nIt's essentially an Apollo project today to create a new browser, which is why it doesn't happen very often, which is why even companies like Microsoft had to throw in the towel and say we can't do it.\nNow, I actually don't think that's good for the web.\nThere is the danger of the monoculture if we just get a single browser engine that runs everything.\nAnd we are in danger of that.\nI love the fact that the Ladybird project, for example, is trying to make a new browser engine from scratch.\nI've supported that project.\nI would encourage people to look into that.\nIt's really a wonderful nice thing.\nIt's staffed by a bunch of people who worked on other browser projects in the past.\nTruly independent web browser.\nWe really need that.\nBut I can hold that thought in my head.\nAt the same time, I hold the thought in my head that Google's Chrome was pivotal to the web surviving as the premier web development platform.\nIf it had not been for Google and their entire business depending on a thriving open web, Apple, Microsoft, I think would have been just as fine to see the web go away, to disappear into being something that just served native web applica or native mobile applications and native desktop applications that they could completely control.\nSo I have all sorts of problems with Google, but it's not Chrome.\nChrome is a complete gift to web developers everywhere, to the web as a development platform, and they deserve an enormous amount of credit I think for that, even if it's entangled with their business model and half of Chrome is code that spies on you or informs targeted ads and a bunch of things I'm not a big fan of.\nI can divorce that from the fact we need champions in the corner of the web who have trillions of dollars of market cap value riding on the open web.\nWe're going to take\n\n\nTangents upon a tangent upon a tangent. So, let's go to Chrome. I think Chrome's positive impact on humanities is immeasurable for reasons that you just described. On the technology front, the features they present, the competition they created, it's spurred on this wonderful flourishing of web technologies. But anyway, I have to ask you about the recent stuff with the DOJ trying to split up Chrome and Google. Do you think this is a good idea? Do you think this does harm? Is a disaster?\n\nAnd I say that as someone who's been very sympathetic to the antitrust fight because I do think we have antitrust problems in technology. But the one place where we don't have them by and large is with browsers, is with the tools we use to access the open web. First of all, we have Firefox. Now, Firefox is not doing all that great and Firefox has been propped up by Google for many years to deter from exactly what's going on with the DOJ that they were the only game in town. Apple has Safari. I have a bunch of problems with Apple, too, but I love Safari. I love the fact that we have a premier browser running on a premier operating system that people can't turn the web into just a Chrome experience, but I also think that the open web needs this trillion dollar champion or at least benefits from it. Maybe doesn't need it, but it certainly benefits from it. And of all the things that are wrong with monopoly formation in technology, Chrome is the last thing. And this is why I get so frustrated sometimes about the anti- or the monopoly fight that there are real problems and we should be focusing on the premier problems first like the toll booths on our mobile phones. There are far bigger problem. It's not the open web. It's not the tools that we use to access the open web. If I don't want to use Chrome, if my customers of my businesses that run on the internet don't want to use Chrome, they don't have to. We're never forced to go through it. The open internet is still open. So, I think it's a real shame that the DOJ has chosen to pursue Google in this way. I do think there are other things you can nail Google for and their ad monopoly maybe or the shenanigans they've done in controlling both sides of the ad ledger that they both control the supply and the demand. There are problems. Chrome isn't it. And you end up making the web much worse. And this is the thing we always got to remember when we think about legislation, when we think about um monopoly fights is you may not like how things look today and you may want to do something about it, but you may also make it worse. The good intentions behind the GDPR in Europe currently has amounted to what? Cookie banners that everyone on the internet hates that helps no one do anything better, anything more efficient, that saves no privacy in any way, shape or form, has been a complete boondoggle that has only enriched lawyers and accountants and bureaucrats.\n\nYeah. You said that the cookie banner is a monument for why Europe is losing is is doing the worst of all the regions in tech. It's it's a monument to good intentions leading straight to hell. And the Europe is actually world class in good intentions leading straight to hell.\n\nSo hell is the cookie accept button. They have to accept all cookies. That's what hell looks like over and over. You don't actually ever get to the web page. Just on a human scale. Try to imagine how many hours every day are wasted clicking that away and how much harm we've done to the web as a platform that people enjoy because of them. The internet is ugly in part because of cookie banners. Cookie banners were supposed to save us from advertisement and advertisement can make the web ugly. There's plenty of examples of that. But cookie banners made the entire internet ugly in one fell swoop. And that's a complete tragedy. But what's even worse, and this is why I call it out as a monument to everything the EU gets wrong, is that we have known this for a decade. No one anywhere who's serious believes that cookie banners does anything good for anyone. Yet, we've been unable to get rid of it. There's this one piece of legislation that's now, I think, 10 or 12 years old. It's complete failure on every conceivable metric. Everyone hates it universally, yet we can't seem to do anything about it.\n\nThat's a bankruptcy declaration for any body of bureaucrats who pretend or pretend to make things better for not just citizens but people around the world. This is the thing that really gets me about cookie banners, too. It's not just the EU. It's the entire world. You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet. If you go to goddamn Mars on one of Elon's rockets and you try to access a web page, you'll still see a cookie banner. No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense.\n\nProbably the interface on on the rocket slower. You have basically 150 second ping time. So it'll take you 45 seconds just to get through the cookie banners from Mars.\n\nUm all right, let's walk back up the stack of this recursive tangents we've been taking. So Chrome, we should say at least in my opinion, is not winning unfairly. It's winning in the fair way by just being better.\n\nIt is. If I was going to steal man the other side just for a half second, people would say, well, maybe yes, most people do sort of begrudgingly agree that Chrome is a pretty good browser. But then they'll say the reason it got dominance was distribution. And the reason they got distribution was because Google also controls Android and therefore can make Chrome the default browser on all these phones. Now, I don't buy that. And the reason I don't buy that is because on Android, you're actually allowed to ship a different browser that has a browser engine that's not the same as Chrome. Unlike on iOS where if you want to ship a browser, Chrome, for example, ships for iOS, but it's not Chrome. It's Safari wrapped in a dress. And every single alternative browser on iOS have to use the Safari web engine. That's not competition. That's not what happened on Android. Again, I think there are some nuances to it. But if you zoom out and you look at all the problems we have with big tech, Chrome is not it. Chrome won on merits. I begrudgingly have switched to Chrome on that realization alone. As a web developer, I just prefer it. I like Firefox in many ways. I like the ethos of it, but Chrome is a better browser than Firefox. Full stop. And by the way, we've never mentioned Edge. Edge is also a good browser because it's also Chrome in address, but it never gets the love. I I don't think I've ever used Bing and I'm sure Bing is really nice.\n\nMaybe you have because you know what is Bing in address?\n\nWhat?\n\nDuck.Go, which is actually the search engine that I use. Duck.Go gets its search results from Bing. Or at least it used to. If they changed that, that would be news to me.\n\nWell, maybe everything is just a wrap or a dress. Everything is wearing a dress. Underneath there's some other turtles. It turtles all the dresses all the way down. Okay. What were we talking about? We got there from JavaScript and from you learning how to program. So eventually the big success story is when you built a bunch of stuff with PHP and you were like actually shipping things.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd that's when the the Ruby story came. So when your big love affair with programming began there. So can you take me there? What what is Ruby? Tell the story of Ruby. Explain Ruby to me. PHP was what converted me from just being able to fondle HTML and turn out some web pages to actually being able to produce web applications myself.\n\nSo I owe a tremendous gratitude to PHP in that regard. But I never thought of PHP as a calling. I never thought I'm a professional programmer who writes PHP. That's who I am and that's what I do. I thought of PHP as a tool I needed to smack the computer with until it produced web applications I wanted. It was very much a means to an end. I didn't fall in love with PHP.\n\nI'm very grateful that it taught me the basics of programming and I'm very grateful that it set the bar for the economics. But it really wasn't until Ruby that I started thinking of myself as a programmer. And the way that came about was that the first time I ever got hired as a professional programmer to write code was actually by Jason Fried, my business partner. Still, all the way back in 2001, I had been working on these gaming websites in PHP for essentially 18 months at that point. No one had been paying me to do code in that regard. And I connect with Jason Fried over an email sent from Copenhagen, Denmark to Chicago, Illinois to a person who didn't know who I was. I was just offering solicited advice. Jason had asked a question on the internet and I had sent him the answer and he was asking in PHP and I'd sent him the answer to that question and we started talking and then we started working which by the way is a miracle of what the internet can allow. How can a kid in Copenhagen who's never met this guy in Chicago connect just over email and start working together and by the way we're still working together now 24 years later that's incredible but we started working together and we started working together on some client projects Jason would do the design 37signals would do the design I would bring the programming PHP and after we worked on I think two or three client projects together in PHP we kept hitting the same problem that whenever you work with a client, you start that project off an email. Oh yeah, let's work together. Here's what we're building and you start trading more and more emails and before a few weeks have passed, you got to add someone to the project. They don't have the emails. They don't have the context. You send where's the latest file? Oh, I've uploaded on the FTP. It's like final final V6 2.0, right? That's the one to get. It's just a mess. A beautiful mess. In some ways a mess that still runs the vast majority of projects to this day. Email is the lowest common denominator. That's wonderful. But we had dropped the ball a couple times in serious ways with customers and we thought we can do better. We know how to make web applications. Can't we just make a system that's better than email for managing projects? It can't be that hard. We've been doing blogs. We've been doing to-do list. Let's put some of these things together and just make a system where everything that anyone involved in the project needs is on one page. And it has to be simple enough that I'm not going to run a seminar teaching you how to use the system. I'm just going to give you the login code. You're going to jump into it. So that's Basecamp. And when we started working on Basecamp, I for the first time in the experience I had with Jason had the freedom of technology choice. There was no client telling me, \"Yeah, PHP, that sounds good. We know PHP. Can you build it in PHP?\" I had free reigns.\n\nAnd at that time, I'd been reading IE magazine and a couple of other magazines back from the early 2000s where Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler had been writing about programming patterns and how to write better code. And these two guys in particular were both using Ruby to explain their concepts because Ruby looked like pseudo code. Whether you were programming in C or Java or PHP, all three constituencies could understand Ruby because it basically just reads English. So these guys were using Ruby to describe the concepts. And first of all, I would read these articles for just the concepts they were explaining. And I'd be like, what is this programming language? I mean, I I like the concept you're explaining, but I also want to see the programming language. Why haven't I heard of this? So, I started looking into Ruby. And I realized at that time, Ruby might not be known by anyone, but it's actually been around for a long time. Matz, the Japanese creator of Ruby, had started working on Ruby back in '93 before the internet was even a thing. And here I am in 2003, 10 years later, picking up what seems like this hidden gem that's just laying in obscurity in plain sight. But Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler, I think, successfully put me and a handful of other people on the trail of a programming language that hadn't been used much in the West, but could be. So I picked up Ruby and I thought this is this is very different. First of all, where are all the semicolons? I'd been programming in PHP in ASP. I'd even done some Pascal. I'd looked at some C. There are semicolons everywhere. And that was the first thing that struck me is where are the damn semicolons? And I started thinking actually why do we have semicolons in programming? They're there to tell the interpreter that there's a new line of instructions, but I don't need him as a human. How? Oh, someone is looking out for the human here, not for the machine. So, that really got me interested. And then I thought to myself, do you know what? I know PHP quite well. I'm not an amazing programmer. I haven't been working in programming for all that long, but maybe I can figure it out. I'm going to give myself two weeks. I'm going to write a proof of concept where I talk to a database. I pull some records. I format them a bit and I display them on an HTML page. Can I figure that out in a couple weeks? It took about one weekend and I was completely mesmerized. I was completely mind blown because Ruby was made for my brain like a perfect tailored glove. By someone I'd never met. Like, how is this even possible?\n\nWe should say maybe like paint a picture of the certain qualities that Ruby has. Maybe even compared to PHP. We should also say that there's a ridiculous thing that I'm used to that I forget about that there's dollar signs everywhere. PHP there's line noise. That's what I like to call line noise. Line noise. That's such a beautiful phrase. Yeah. So, there's all these things that look like programs. And with Ruby, I mean, there's some similarities in Python there. Uh, it just looks kind of like natural language. You can read it normally. Here's a while loop that does a five iterations. You can literally type the number five dot. Now, I'm calling a method on the number five. By the way, that's one of the beautiful aspects of Ruby that primitives like integers are also objects. And you can call five dot times start brackets. Now you're iterating over the code in that bracket five times. That's it.\n\nOkay, that's nice.\n\nThat's not just nice, that's exceptional. There is literally no other programming language that I know of that\n\n\nhas managed to boil away the line noise that almost every other programming language would inject into a five-time iteration over a block of code to that extent.\nThat's a really nice. Well, thank you for giving that example.\nThat's a beautiful example.\nWow, I don't think I know a programming language that does that.\nThat's really nice.\nRuby is full of that.\nAnd there's So, let me dive into a couple examples because I really think it helps paint the picture.\nAnd let me preface this by saying I actually I like the ethos of Python.\nI think the Ruby and the Python community share a lot of similarities.\nThey're both dynamic interpreted languages.\nThey're both focused on immediacy and productivity and ease of use in a bunch of ways, but then they're also very different in many other ways.\nAnd one of the one ways they're very different is aesthetically.\nPython to me, I hope I don't offend people too much.\nI've said this before, it's just it's ugly.\nAnd it's ugly at it in its base because it's full of superfluous instructions that are necessary for legacy reasons of when Guido made Python back in '87 that are still here in 2025 and my brain can't cope with that.\nLet me give you a basic example.\nWhen you make a class in Python, the initializer method, the starting method is defaf.\nOkay, fair enough.\nThat's actually the same as Ruby def definition of a method.\nThen it is underscore not one underscore two in it underscore underscore.\nYeah.\nParentheses start self, and then the first argument.\nYeah, the whole self thing.\nYeah.\nMhm.\nI look at that and go, I'm sorry.\nI'm out.\nI can't do it.\nIt's just it's everything about it offends my sensibilities to the core.\nHere you have the most important method that all new objects or classes have to implement and it is one of the most aesthetically offensive ways of typing initialize that I've ever seen anywhere.\nAnd you guys are okay with this?\nYeah, you're making me you you know where you're like talking about my marriage or something like this and and I'm now realizing I've been in a toxic relationship all along.\nYeah.\nI just get used to it.\nThat to me, by the way, was the magic of Ruby.\nIt opened my eyes to how beautiful programs could be.\nI didn't know I'd been working in ASP.\nI'd been working in PHP.\nI didn't even have the concept that aesthetics, beautiful code, was something we could optimize for, that something we could pursue.\nAnd even more than that, that we could pursue it above other objectives.\nThat Ruby is, as beautiful as it is, is not an accident and it's not easy.\nRuby itself is implemented in C.\nIt's very difficult to parse Ruby code because Ruby is written for humans and humans are messy creatures.\nThey like things in just the right way.\nI can't fully explain why the underscore_initers make me repulse, but it does.\nAnd when I look at the Ruby alternative, it's really instructive.\nSo it's defaf.\nsame part df space initialize parenthesis not even parenthesis if you don't need to call it within the arguments there's not even a parenthesis that in itself is actually also a major part if the human doesn't need the additional characters we're not just going to put them in because it'd be nicer to parse for the computer we're going to get rid of the semicolons we're going to get rid of the parenthesis we're going to get rid of the underscores we're going to get rid of all that ugliness all the line noise and boil it down to its pure essentials and at the same time we're not going to abbreviate.\nThis is a key difference in the aesthetics between Ruby and Python as well.\nIn it is shorter type.\nIt's only five characters.\nInitialize is a lot longer, but it looks a lot better.\nAnd you don't type it very often.\nSo, you should look at something pretty.\nIf you don't have to do it all the time, it's okay that it's long.\nThose kinds of aesthetic evaluations are rife all over the Ruby language.\nBut let me give you an even better example.\nThe if conditional, that's the bedrock of all programming languages.\nThey have the if conditional.\nIf you take most programming languages, they all have if.\nThat's basically the same in almost every language.\nSpace start parenthesis.\nWe all do that.\nAnd then you have um perhaps let's say you're calling a object called uh user dot is admin close parenthesis close parenthesis start brackets and here's what we're going to do if the user is an admin.\nRight?\nThat would be a normal programming language.\nRuby doesn't do it like that.\nRuby boils almost all of it away.\nWe start with the if.\nOkay, that's the same.\nNo parenthesis necessary because there's no ambiguity for the human to distinguish that the next part is just a single statement.\nSo you do if space user dot admin question mark.\nYeah.\nNo open brackets, no parentheses, no nothing.\nNext open line here's unconditional.\nThat question mark means nothing to the computer, but it means something to the human.\nRuby put in the predicate method style purely as a communication tool between humans.\nIt's actually more work for the interpreter to be able to see that this question mark is there.\nWhy is this question mark in here?\nBecause it just reads so nicely.\nif user admin question mark.\nThat's a very human phrase.\nBut it gets better.\nYou can turn this around.\nYou can have your statement you want to execute before the conditional.\nYou can do userupgrade.\nSay you're calling an upgrade method on a user space if space user.admin question mark.\nWe do the thing if the thing is true.\nInstead of saying if the thing is true, do the thing.\nBut it gets even better.\nThis is why I love this example with the conditional because you can keep diving into it.\nSo let's flip it around.\nUser.downgrade if exclamation point not user.admin.\nRight?\nThat'd be a typical way of writing it.\nRuby goes, that exclamation point is light noise.\nWhy do we have if and then an exclamation point?\nThat's ugly.\nWe could do user.downgrade unless useradmin question mark.\nThat to me is an encapsulation of the incredible beauty that Ruby affords the programmer through ambiguity that is only to serve the human reader and writer.\nAll of these statements we've just discussed, they're the same for the computer.\nIt'll compile down to the same C code.\nThey'll compile down to the same assembly code, it makes no difference whatsoever.\nIn fact, it just makes it harder to write an interpreter.\nBut for the human who gets to choose whether the statement comes before the conditional or the predicate method has, it's just incredible.\nIt reads like poetry at some point.\nIt's it's also incredible that you know, one language designer is creating that.\nyou know, Guido and Ross also, it's like one person gets to make these extremely difficult decision because it's you have to think about how does that all get parsed and you have to think about the thousands if it's a popular language, the millions of people that end up using this and what they feel with that question mark on the for the if statement, what what does that feel like for that's what Matt's thought about because he started his entire mission off a different premise than almost every programming language designer that I'd heard at least articulate their vision.\nThat his number one goal was programmer happiness.\nThat his number one goal was the affordances that would allow programmers to articulate code in ways that not just executed correctly, but were a joy to write and were a joy to read.\nAnd that vision is based on a fundamentally different view of humanity.\nThere's no greater contrast between David Heinemeier Hansson and James Gosling, the designer of Java.\nI once listened to James talk about the design of Java.\nWhy was it the way it was?\nWhy was it so rigid?\nAnd he was very blunt about it, which I, by the way, I really appreciate.\nAnd I think Gotham has done a tremendous job with Java.\nBut his view of humanity is rather dark.\nHis view of humanity was programmers at the average are stupid creatures.\nThey cannot be trusted with sophisticated programming languages because they're going to shoot their foot off or their hand off.\nAnd that would be kind of inconvenient to the regional development office of a mid-tier insurance company writing code that has to last for 20 years.\nNow, it's actually a very Thomas Saul view of constrained capacity in humans that I've come to appreciate much later in life.\nBut it's also a very depressing view of programmers that there are just certain programmers who are too dumb to appreciate code poetry.\nThey're too ignorant to learn how to write it.\nWell, we need to give them a sandbox where they just won't hurt themselves too much.\nMatt's went the complete opposite direction.\nHe believes in humanity.\nHe believes in the unlimited capacity of programmers to learn and become better.\nSo much so that he's willing to put the stranger at his own level.\nThis is the second part I truly appreciate about Ruby.\nRuby allows you to extend base classes.\nYou know how we just talked about five dot times is a way to iterate over um a statement five times.\nThat five is obviously a base class.\nIt's a number.\nDo you know what you can add your own methods to that?\nI did extensively in Ruby on Rails.\nWe have something called active support which is essentially my dialect of Ruby for programming web applications.\nAnd I'll give you one example.\nI've added a method called days to the number.\nSo if you do 5 days, you get five days in seconds because seconds is the way we set cash expiration times and other things like that.\nSo you can say cash expires in 5 days.\nYeah.\nAnd you're going to get whatever 5* 24 * 60 * 60 is or whatever the math is, right?\nvery humanly readable.\nIn a novel programming language, you would type out the seconds and then you would have a little comment above it saying this represent five days.\nIn Ruby, you get to write five days.\nBut even better than that, Matts didn't come up with it.\nMatts didn't need the five days.\nI needed that because I needed to expire caches.\nI was allowed by Matts to extend his story with my own chapters on equal footing such that a reader of Ruby could not tell the difference between the code Mattz wrote and the code that I wrote.\nHe trusted me as a complete stranger from Denmark who had never met to mess with his beautiful story.\nThat level of trust is essentially unheard of.\nI know there are other programming languages that allow things with macros and so forth, but none do it in a way like Ruby does it.\nNone does it with an articulated vision of humanity, a trust in humanity like Matts does.\nThat is the opposite end of the spectrum of Java.\nYeah.\nI mean, for my aesthetic sensibilities, just the way you describe five days, that's really pleasant to me.\nlike I could see myself sitting alone sleepdeprived and just writing that it's just is an easy thing you can write it in a long way with a comment you can you can write a multiple lines you could do and now with AI I'm sure it's going to generate it correctly but there's something really pleasant about the simplicity of that I'm not sure what that is but you're right there is a good feeling there and I'm sure we'll talk about happiness from all kinds of philosophical angles but you know that is what happiness is made of.\nThat little exactly good feeling there.\nIt's the good feeling that come out of a concept compressed to its pure essence.\nThere's nothing you can take away from that statement that's superfluous.\nBut see, I I also want to push back a little bit because it's not because I also program in Pearl a bunch just just to be cool.\nUm so like it's not all about compression.\nNo, you can compress it too far.\nPearl Gulf is a thing where you can turn programs into something that's unreadable for humans.\nNow, the great thing about Pearl was that it came out before Ruby.\nMattz was a great student of Wall, was a great student of Pearl, was a great student of Python and Small Talk and Lisp.\nHe took inspiration from all of these prior attempts at creating good programming languages and really edited down the very best bits into this.\nSo he was able to learn from his lessons.\nBut what I found incredible about Ruby is that here we are 2025.\nRuby has been worked on for over 30 years and essentially the first draft is 90% of what we're still using.\nThere was almost a sense of divine inspiration possible in wherever Matts was writing that initial version of Ruby that transcended time to such a degree that no one has still even begun to reach it.\nThis is the other thing I always find fascinating.\nI generally believe in the efficient market theory that if someone comes up with a better mousetrap or better idea, others will eventually copy them to such an extent that perhaps the original mousetrap is no longer even remembered.\nNo one has been able to copy that essence of Ruby.\nThey borrowed elements and that's totally fine, but Ruby still stands taller than everyone else on these metrics on this trust in humanity and programmers.\nAnd we should also say like you know uh maybe the perfect programming language that that metric and then there's the successful language and those are often different.\nThere there's something wonderful about the Brendan Ike story of creating JavaScript.\nYes.\nof of there's something truly beautiful uh about the way JavaScript took over the world.\nI've uh recently got to visit the Amazon jungle and just one of my favorite things to do is just to watch the ants take over anything everything and it's just like it's a nice distributed system.\nIt's a messy thing that doesn't seem to be order but it just works and the machinery of it worse is better.\nI mean that's actually the name of a pattern for in in software development and other ways of how do is the pattern of Linux.\nLinux was quantifiably worse than I think it was minix at the time.\nOther ways of it that were more cathedral less bizarre and is still one that there's something to it that the imperfections can help something go forward.\nIt's actually a trick I've studied to the degree that I now incorporate it in almost all open source that I do.\nI make sure that when I release the first version of any new thing I work on, it's a little broken.\nIt's a little busted in ways that invite people to come in and help me cuz there's no easier way to get the collaboration of other programmers than to put something out that they know how to fix and improve.\nYeah, that's awesome.\nBut Ruby is somehow or was at least a little bit different in that regard.\nNot in all regards.\nMatt's got the ethos of the language, the design of the language just right.\nBut the first versions of Ruby were terribly slow.\nIt's taken, I mean, hundreds of man years to get Ruby to be both this beautiful yet also highly efficient and really fast.\nAnd we should say that the thing that made you\n\n\nFall in love with this particular programming language is metaprogramming.\n\nYes.\nSo that takes all of these elements we've just talked about and turned them up to 11.\nI'll explain metaprogramming real soon.\nMetaprogramming is essentially a version of the five days.\nYou get to add keywords to the language.\nActive Record is the part of Rails that communicates with the database.\nThis is a system where every table in the database is represented by a class.\nSo if we take the user example again, you do class user, um, descends from Active Record base, and then the first line you can write is this: I want my users to have many posts or have many comments.\nLet's do that.\nWe're making some system where users can make comments.\nThe very next line is has underscore many space colon comments.\nNow you've set up a dependency between users and comments that will give you a whole host of access and factory methods for users to be able to own comments, to create comments, to update comments.\nIn that line alone, has many looks like a keyword.\nIt looks like it's part of the Ruby language.\nThat's metaprogramming.\nWhen Rails is able to add these elements to how you define a class and then that runs code that adds a bunch of methods to the user class, that's metaprogramming.\nAnd when metaprogramming is used in this way, we call it domain-specific languages.\nYou take a generic language like Ruby and you tailor it to a certain domain like describing relationships in a database at an object level.\nAnd this is one of those early examples where you can do, um, user has many comments belongs_2 space colon account.\nNow you've set up a uh, one-to-one relationship.\nBefore we had a one-to-many relationship.\nRails is rife with all these kinds of domain-specific languages where at sometimes it doesn't even look like Ruby.\nYou can't identify Ruby keywords.\nYou can just identify what looks like keywords in its own programming language.\nNow again, I know that Lisp and others also do this stuff.\nThey just do it with the maximum amount of line noise that can ever be crammed into a programming language.\nAnd Ruby does it at a level where you cannot tell my metaprogramming from Matt's keywords and with zero line noise.\n\nYeah, I should say that my first love was Lisp.\nSo there's a slow tear that you can't see.\nI've actually never written any real Lisp myself.\n\nWell, how can you judge it so harshly then?\nBecause I have two eyes and I can look at code and my aesthetic sensibilities forbid me to even go much further, which is a limitation.\nI know I should actually dive into Lisp because I found that I've learned a lot just diving into, maybe I'm insulting Lisp again here, but the past of programming languages with Smalltalk, for example, I think Smalltalk is an incredible experiment that also worked but isn't suitable for today's programming environments.\nI love that we're talking about Ruby so much and what beautiful code is, what a beautiful programming language is.\nSo one of the things that is, I think, implied, maybe you made explicit in your descriptions there, is that uh, Ruby is dynamic typing versus strict typing, and you have been not just saying that it's a nice thing, but that you will defend dynamic typing to the death, like that freedom is a powerful freedom to preserve.\nIt's the essence of what makes Ruby Ruby.\nThis is why I don't fully understand when people call for Ruby to static typing because to me is the bedrock of what this is.\nWhy would you want to turn one of the most beautiful languages into something far uglier?\nThis is one of my primary objections to static typing.\nIt's not just that it limits you in certain ways.\nIt makes metaprogramming harder.\nI write a bunch of metaprogramming.\nI've seen what it takes to do metaprogramming in Typescript.\nThat was actually one of the things that just really sent me on a tear of getting meta or getting Typescript out of some of the projects that I'm involved with.\nWe pulled TypeScript out of um, Turbo, one of the front-end frameworks that we have because I tried to write some metaprogramming in Typescript and I was just infuriated.\nI don't want that experience, but I also don't want it from an aesthetic point of view.\nI hate repetition.\nWe've just talked about how much I love that Ruby boils all of these expressions down to its essence.\nYou can't remove one dot.\nYou can't remove one character without losing something.\nThis moment you go for static typing that you declare, at least I know there are ways to do implied typing and so forth.\nBut let's just take the stereotypical case of the of a example.\nFor example, um, capital U user.\nI'm declaring the type of the variable lowercase user.\nI'm now naming my variable equals uppercase user or new uppercase user.\nI've repeated user three times.\nI don't have time for this.\nI don't have sensibilities for this.\nI don't want my Ruby polluted with this.\nNow, I understand all the arguments for why people like static typing.\nOne of the primary arguments is that it makes tooling easier.\nIt makes it easier to do autocomplete in editors, for example.\nIt makes it easier to find certain kinds of bugs because maybe you're calling methods that don't exist on an object and the editor can actually catch that bug before you even run it.\nI don't care.\nFirst of all, I don't write code with tools.\nI write them with text editors.\nI chisel them out of the screen with my bare hands.\nI don't autocomplete.\nAnd this is why I love Ruby so much.\nAnd this is why I continue to be in love with the text editor rather than the IDE.\nI don't want an IDE.\nI want my fingers to have to individually type out every element of it because it will force me to stay in the world where Ruby is beautiful.\nBecause as soon as it gets easy to type a lot of boilerplate, well, guess what?\nYou're gonna have a lot of boilerplate.\nEvery single language basically that has great tooling support has a much higher tolerance for boilerplate because the thinking is, well, you're not typing it anyway.\nYou're just autocompleting it.\nI don't want that at all.\nI want something where the fabric I'm working in is just a text file.\nThere's nothing else to it.\nSo, these things play together.\nThere's the aesthetic part, there's the tooling part, there's the metaprogramming part, there's the fact that Ruby's ethos of duck typing, I don't know if you've heard that term before, it's essentially not about can I call this method if an object is of a certain class.\nIt is can I call this method if the method responds.\nIt's very out of Smalltalk in that regard.\nYou don't actually check of whether that class has the method, which allows you to dynamically add methods at runtime and do all sorts of really interesting things that underpin all the beautiful metaprogramming that we do in Ruby.\nI don't want to lose any of that and I don't care for the benefits.\nOne of the benefits I've seen touted over and over again is that it's much easier to write correct software.\nYou're going to have fewer bugs.\nYou're going to have less null pointer exceptions and less all of this stuff.\nYeah, I don't have any of that.\nIt is just not something that occurs in my standard mode of operation.\nI'm not saying I don't have bugs.\nOf course I do.\nBut I catch those bugs with unit testing, with integration testing.\nThose are the kinds of precautions that'll catch logical bugs, things that compile but are wrong along with the uncompilable stuff.\nSo, I've never been drawn into this world.\nAnd part of it is because I work on a certain class of systems.\nI fully accept that.\nIf you're writing systems that have 5, 10, 50 million lines of code with hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of programmers, I fully accept that you need different methods.\nWhat I object to is the idea that what's right for a codebase of 10 million lines of code with a 100,000 programmers working on it is also the same thing I should be using in my bedroom to create Basecamp because I'm just a single individual.\nThat's complete nonsense.\nIn the real world, we would know that that makes no sense at all.\nThat you don't, I don't know, use your Pagani to go pick up groceries at Costco.\nIt's a bad vehicle for that.\nIt just doesn't have the space.\nYou don't want to muddy the beautiful seats.\nYou don't want to do any of those things.\nWe know that certain things that are very good in certain domains don't apply to all in programming languages.\nIt seems like we forget that.\nNow, to be fair, I also had a little bit perhaps of a reputation of forgetting that.\nWhen I first learned Ruby, I was so head over heels in love with this programming language that I almost found it unconceivable that anyone would choose any other programming language at all to write web applications.\nAnd I kind of engaged the evangelism of Ruby on Rails in that spirit as a crusade as I just need to teach you the gospel.\nI just need to show you this conditional code that we just talked about and you will convert at the point of a sharp argument.\nNow I learned that's not the way.\nAnd part of the reason it's not the way is that programmers think differently.\nOur brains are configured differently.\nMy brain is configured perfectly for Ruby, perfectly for a dynamically ducttyped language that I can chisel code out of a text editor with.\nAnd other people need the security of an IDE.\nThey want the security of classes that won't compile unless you call the methods on it.\nI have come to accept that, but most programmers don't.\nThey're still stuck in essentially, I like static typing, therefore static typing is the only way to create reliable, correct systems, which is just such a mind-blowing, to be blunt, idiotic thing to say in the face of evidence, mountains of evidence to the contrary.\nThis is one of the reasons I'm so in love with Shopify as the flagship application for Ruby and Rails.\nShopify exists at a scale that most programmers will never touch.\nOn Black Friday, I think Shopify did 1 million requests per second.\nThat's not 1 million requests of images.\nThat's of dynamic requests that are funneling through the pipeline of commerce.\nI mean, Shopify runs something like 30% of all e-commerce stores on the damn internet.\nA huge portion of all commerce in total runs through Shopify, and that runs on Ruby and Rails.\nSo Ruby and Rails is able to scale up to that level without using static typing in all of what it does.\nNow I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways because they are hitting some of the limits that you will hit with dynamic typing, and some of those limits you hit with dynamic typing are actually, by the way, just limits you hit when you write 5 million lines of code.\nI think the Shopify monolith is about 5 million lines of code.\nAt that scale, everything breaks because you're at the frontier of what humans are capable of doing with programming languages.\nThe difference in part is that Ruby is such a succinct language that those 5 million, if they had been written in, let's just say Go or Java, would have been 50 or 25.\nNow that might have alleviated some of the problems that you have when you work on huge systems with many programmers, but it certainly would also have compounded them, trying to understand 25 million lines of code.\nSo, the thing does scale.\nThat's a persistent myth that it doesn't scale.\nUh, Shopify and and others, but Shopify, I think, is a great example.\nUh, by the way, I love Shopify and I love Toby.\nYou got to have Toby on.\nYeah.\nThis morning for sure.\nHe's a brilliant, I, I got to hang out with him in the desert somewhere.\nI forget in Utah.\nHe's just a brilliant human.\nUm, and uh, and Shopify, Shopify.com/lux has been supporting this podcast for the longest time.\nI don't, I don't think actually Toby knows that they sponsor this podcast.\nI mean, it's a big company, right?\nIt's a huge company.\nI think uh, just under 10,000 employees, market cap of 120 billion, uh, GMV of a quarter of a trillion every quarter, and he's involved with the details still.\nHe is very much so.\nA funny story about Toby.\nToby was on the Rails core team back in the mid-2000s.\nToby himself wrote Active Merchant, which is one of the frameworks for creating shops.\nHe wrote the liquid templating language that Shopify still uses to this day.\nHe has a huge list of contributions to the Rails ecosystem and he's the CEO of the company.\nI think it's just it's very inspiring to me because it's such at the opposite end of what I like to do.\nI like to chisel code with my own hands most of the day.\nHe runs a company of almost 10,000 people that is literally like world commerce depends on it.\nA level of criticality I can't even begin to understand.\nAnd yet we can see eye to eye on so many of these fundamental questions in computer science and program development.\nThat is a dynamic range.\nMhm.\nTo be able to encompass Rails being a great tool for the one developer who's just starting out with an idea, who don't even fully know everything, who is right at the level where PHP would have been a good fit in those late 90s because yeah, I could probably upload something to an FTP server and so on.\nRails does have more complexity than that, but it also has so much longer runway.\nThe runway goes all the way to goddamn Shopify.\nThat is about the most convincing argument I can make for sort of dynamic range that we can do a lot of it.\nAnd even having said that, Shopify is the outlier.\nOf course, I don't think about Shopify as the primary target when I write Rails.\nI think of the single developer.\nActually, I do think about Shopify, but I don't think about Shopify now.\nI think of Shopify when Toby was writing Snowevil, which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards that he created.\nThere was the pre-Shopify Shopify he created all by himself.\nAnd that was possible because Ruby and Rails isn't just about beautiful code.\nIt's just as much about productivity.\nIt's just as much about the impact that an individual programmer is able to have that they can build a system where they can keep the whole thing in their head and be able to move it forward such that you can go from one developer sitting and working on something and that something is Shopify and it turns into what it is today.\nWhen we talk about programming languages and we compare them, we often compare them at a very late stage, like what is the better programming language for, let's say, Twitter in 2009 when it's already a huge success.\nTwitter was started on Ruby and Rails.\nThey then hit some scaling problems.\nIt was a big debacle at the time.\nThey end up then, I think, writing it in some other language, which by the way, I think is the best advertisement ever for\n\n\nRuby and Rails because nothing\nfucking happened for 10 years after they\nswitched over, right? Essentially zero\ninnovation. Some of that was because\nthey were doing a long conversion, and\nall of the early success in part came\nbecause they had the agility to quickly\nchange and adopt and so forth. That's\nwhat startups needs. That's what Shopify\nneeded. That's what Twitter needed.\nThat's what everyone needs, and that's\nthe number one priority for Ruby and\nRails to make sure that we don't lose\nthat because what happens so often when\ndevelopment tools and programming\nlanguages are driven by huge companies is\nthat they mirror their org chart. React\nand everything else needed to use that\nis in some ways a reflection of how Meta\nbuilds Facebook because of course it is,\nbecause of course it's a distraction of\nthat. I'm not saying React isn't a great\ntool and that can't be used by smaller\nteams. Of course, it can. But it's born\nin a very different context than\nsomething like Ruby and Rails.\n\nUh, let me say as a small aside because I\nthink we might return to Shopify and\ncelebrate it often. Just a sort of\npersonal note, uh, this particular\npodcast has way more sponsors and\nsponsors that want to be sponsors than I\ncould possibly ever have. And it's\nreally, really important for me to not\ngive a shit and to be able to celebrate\npeople like I celebrate people. I\ncelebrate companies and has I don't care\nthat they're sponsoring. I really don't\ncare. I just want to make that very\nexplicit 'cause we're going to continue\nsaying positive things about Shopify. I\ndon't care. Stop sponsoring. It doesn't\nreally matter to me. But yeah, I just\nwant to make that explicit. So, but to\nlinger on the scaling thing with the\nTwitter and the Shopify, uh, can you just\nexplain to me what Shopify is doing with\nuh, with the YJIT? What did they have to\ntry to do to scale this thing? Because\nthat's kind of an incredible story,\nright?\n\nYeah. So, one of the great contributions\nthat Shopify has made to the entire Ruby\necosystem, not just Rails, but in\nparticular Rails is YJIT. So, YJIT is\ntheir compiler for Ruby that just\nmakes everything a lot more efficient,\nand at Shopify scale, eking out even a 5\nto 10% improvement in Ruby's overhead and\nexecution time is a huge deal. Now,\nShopify didn't need YJIT. Shopify was\nalready running on the initial version\nof Ruby that was I think 10 times slower\nthan what we have today. If you look\nback upon the Ruby 1.8.6 that DHH\nprobably started on just as I started on,\nand that was enough to propel Shopify to\nthe scale that it has today. A lot of\nthe scaling conversation is lost in a\nfailure to distinguish two things.\nScale is kind of one package we talk\nabout when there are really multiple\npackages inside of it. One is runtime\nperformance latency. How fast can you\nexecute a single request? Can it happen\nfast enough that the user will not\nnotice? If your Rails request takes a\nsecond and a half to execute, the user\nis going to notice. Your app is going to\nfeel slow and sluggish. You have to get\nthat response time down below, let's\nsay, at least 300 milliseconds. I like\nto target 100 milliseconds as my\nlatency. That's kind of performance. How\nmuch performance of that kind of latency\ncan you squeeze out of a single CPU\ncore? That tells you something about\nwhat the price of a single request will\nbe. But then whether you can deal with 1\nmillion requests a second like Shopify\nis doing right now. If you have one box\nthat can do a thousand requests a\nsecond, you just need X boxes to get up\nto a million. And what you'll actually\nfind is that when it comes to\nprogramming languages, they're all the\nsame in this way. They all scale largely\nbeautifully horizontally. You just add\nmore boxes. The hard parts of scaling a\nShopify is typically not the programming\nlanguage. It's the database. And that's\nactually one of the\num, challenges that Shopify has now is\nhow do you deal with MySQL at the scale\nthat they're operating at? When do you\nneed to move to other databases to get\nworldwide performance? All of these\nthings. The questions about scaling Ruby\nare economic questions. If we're\nspending so and so much on application\nservers, if we can get just 5% more\nperformance out of Ruby, well, we could\nsave 5% of those servers, and that could\nfilter down into the budget. Now, that\nanalysis concludes into basically one\nthing. Ruby is a luxury language.\nIt's a luxury, the highest luxury in my\nopinion. It is the Koko Chanel of\nprogramming languages. Something that\nnot everyone can afford. And I mean this\nin the best possible way. There are some\napplications on the internet where each\nrequest has so little value you can't\nafford to use a luxurious language like\nRuby to program in it. You simply have\nto slum it with a C or a Go or some\nother low-level language or Rust. Talk\nabout line noise there for a hot second.\nThe thrift store of languages.\n\nExactly. Where you need kind of just you\nneed a very low level to do it. You\ncan't afford to use a luxury language to\nyou to to build it with. That's not true\nof Shopify. It wasn't true of Basecamp.\nEven back in 2004, it's not been true of\n99% of all web applications ever created\nbecause the main cost component of 99%\nof web applications is not CPU cores,\nit's wet cores, it's human cores, it's\nhuman capacity to understand and involve\nsystems. It's their personal\nproductivity. I did a calculation once\nwhen someone had for the 400th time said\nthat, oh, if you switch from Ruby to some\nfaster language you could save a bunch\nof money, and I calculated it out that at\nthe time, and I think the last time I did\nthis calculation was almost a decade ago,\nwe were spending about 15% of our\noperating budget on Ruby application\nservers. So for me to improve my cost\nprofile of the business, um, by seven\npercentage points, I'd have to pick\nsomething twice as fast. That's quite\nhard. Versus if Ruby and Ruby and Rails\nwas even 10% more productive than\nsomething else, I would move the needle\nfar more because making individual\nprogrammers more productive actually\nmatters a lot more. This is why people\nare so excited about AI. This is why\nthey're freaking out over the fact that\na single programmer in Silicon Valley\nwho makes $300,000 a year can now do the\nwork of three or five at least in\ntheory. I haven't actually seen that\nfully in practice, but let's just assume\nthe theory is correct. If not now, then\nin 6 months, that's a huge deal. That\nmatters so much more than whether you\ncan squeeze a few more cycles out of the\nCPU when it comes to these kinds of\nbusiness applications. If you're making\nUnreal Engine rendering stuff like Tim\nSweeney you had on,\n\nyeah, he needs to really sweat all those\ndetails. The Nanite engine can't run on\nRuby. It It's never going to. It was not\nmeant for that. Fine. These kinds of\nbusiness applications absolutely can.\nAnd everything that people are excited\nabout AI for right now, that extra\ncapacity to just do more, that was why\nwe were excited about Ruby back in the\nearly 2000s. It was be because I saw\nthat if we could even squeeze out a 10%\nimprovement of the human programmer,\nwe'd be able to do so much more for so\nmuch less.\n\nProbably argue about this, but I really\nlike working together with AI,\ncollaborating with AI, and I would argue\nthat the kind of code you want AI to\ngenerate is human readable, human\ninterpretable.\n\nYes. If it's generating Perl golf code,\nit's just it's not a collaboration. So,\nit has to be speaking the human. It's\nnot just you're writing the prompts in\nEnglish. You also want to read the\nresponses in the human interpretable\nlanguage like Ruby, right? So it's\nthat's actually is beneficial for AI too\n'cause you've kind of said that for you,\nthe sculptor, the sort of the elitist\nCoco Chanel sculptor, you want to on your\nfancy keyboard to type every single\nletter yourself with your own fingers,\nbut it's also uh, that uh, the benefit of\nRuby also applies in when some of that\nis written by AI and you're actually\ndoing with your own fingers the editing\npart.\n\nYes.\n\nBecause you can interact with it because\nit's human interpretable. The paradigm I\nreally love with this was something Elon\nactually said on one of your shows when\nyou guys were talking about Neurolink.\nThat Neurolink allows the bandwidth\nbetween you and the machine to increase.\nThat language either spoken or written\nis very low bandwidth. If you are to\ncalculate just how many bits we can\nexchange as we're sitting here, it's\nvery slow.\nRuby\nhas a much higher bandwidth of\ncommunication,\nreveals, conveys so much more concept\nper character than most other\nprogramming languages do. So when you\nare collaborating with AI, you want\nreally high bandwidth. You want it to be\nable to produce programs with you,\nwhether you're letting it write the code\nor not, that both of you can actually\nunderstand really quickly and that you\ncan compress a grand comp or a grand\nconcept, a grand system into far fewer\nparts that both of you can understand.\n\nNow, I actually love collaborating with\nAI, too. I love chiseling my code, and\nthe way I use AI is in a separate\nwindow. I don't let it drive my code.\nI've tried that. I've tried the cursors\nand the wind serves, and I don't enjoy\nthat way of writing. And one of the\nreasons I don't enjoy that way of\nwriting is I can literally feel\ncompetence draining out of my fingers\nlike that level of immediacy with the\nmaterial disappears. And the where I\nfelt this the most was I did this um\nremix of Ubuntu called amacube when I\nswitched to Linux\nand it's all written in bash. I'd never\nwritten any serious amount of code in\nbash before. So I was using AI to\ncollaborate to write a bunch of bash\nwith me because I needed all this. I\nknew what I wanted. I could express it\nin Ruby, but I thought it was an\ninteresting challenge to filter through\nBash because what I was doing was\nsetting up a Linux machine. That's\nbasically what Bash was designed for.\nIt's a great constraint. But what I\nfound myself doing was asking AI for the\nsame way of expressing a conditional,\nfor example, in Bash over and over\nagain. That by not typing it, I wasn't\nlearning it. I was using it. I was\ngetting the expression I wanted, but I\nwasn't learning it. And I got a little\nscared. I got a little scared like, is\nthis the end of learning? Am I no longer\nlearning if I'm not typing? And the way\nI for me recast that was I don't want to\ngive up on the AI. It is such a better\nexperience as a programmer to look up\nAPIs, to get a second opinion on\nsomething, to do a draft, but I have to\ndo the typing myself because you learn\nwith your fingers. If you're learning\nhow to play the guitar, you can watch as\nmany YouTube videos as you want. You're\nnot going to learn the guitar. You have\nto put your fingers on the strings to\nactually learn the motions. And I think\nthere is a parallel here to programming\nwhere programming has to be learned in\npart by the actual typing. I'm just\nreally this is this is fascinating.\nListen, part of my brain agrees with you\n100%, part doesn't.\n\nI think AI should be in the loop of\nlearning. Now current systems don't do\nthat, but I think it's very possible for\ncursor to say\nto basically force you to type certain\nthings. So like if you set the mode of\nlearning, I just I don't want to be this\nuh sort of give up on AI. I really I\nthink I think vibe coding is a skill. So\nuh for an experienced programmer it's\ntoo easy to dismiss vibe coding as a\nthing.\n\nI agree. I wouldn't dismiss it.\nBut I think you need to start building\nthat skill and start to figure out how\ndo you prevent the competency from\nslipping away from your fingers and\nbrain. Like how do you develop that\nskill in parallel to the other to the\nother skill? I don't know. I just it's I\nthink it's a fascinating puzzle though.\nI know too many really strong\nprogrammers that just kind of avoid AI\nbecause it's currently a little too\ndumb.\n\nYes, it's a little too slow is actually\nmy main problem. It's a little too dumb\nin some ways, but it's a little too slow\nin other ways. When I use uh Claude's\ncode,\nthe terminal version of uh Claude, which\nis actually my preferred way of using\nit, I just I get too impatient. It feels\nlike I'm going back to a time where code\nhad to compile and I had to go do\nsomething else or boil some tea while\nthe code is compiling. Well, I've been\nworking in Ruby for 20 years. I don't\nhave compile weight in me anymore. So\nthere's that aspect of it. But I think\nthe more crucial aspect for me is I\nreally care about the competence. And\nI've seen what happens to even great\nprogrammers the moment they put away the\nkeyboard. Because even before AI, this\nwould happen as soon as people would get\npromoted. Most great programmers who\nwork in large businesses stop writing\ncode on a daily basis because they\nsimply have too many meetings to attend\nto. They have too many other things to\ndo, and invariably they lose touch with\nprogramming. That doesn't mean they\nforget everything. But if you don't have\nyour fingers in the sauce, the source,\nyou are going to lose touch with it.\nThere's just no other way. I don't want\nthat because I enjoy it too much. This\nis not just about outcomes. This is\nwhat's crucial to understand.\nProgramming for programmers who like to\ncode is not just about the programs they\nget out of it. That may be the economic\nvalue. It's not the only human value.\nThe human value is just smudge in the\nexpression.\nWhen someone who sits down on a guitar\nand plays Stairways to Heaven, there's a\nperfect recording of that that will last\nin eternity. You can just put it on\nSpotify. You don't actually need to do\nit. The joy is to command the guitar\nyourself. The joy of a programmer of me\nas a programmer is to type the code\nmyself. If I elevate, if I promote\nmyself out of programming, I turned\nmyself into a project manager, a project\nmanager of uh murder of AI crows, as I\nwrote the other day. I could have become\na project manager my whole career. I\ncould have become a project manager 20\nyears ago if I didn't care to write code\nmyself. And I just wanted outcomes.\nThat's how I got started in programming.\nI just wanted outcomes. Then I fell in\nlove with programming, and now I'd rather\nretire than give it up. Now that doesn't\nmean you can't have your cake and eat it\ntoo. I've done some vibe coding where I\ndidn't care that I wasn't playing\nmyself. I just wanted to see something.\nThere was an idea in my head. I wanted\nto see something. That's fine. I also\nuse AI all day long. In fact, I'm\nalready at the point where if you took\nit away from me, I'd be like, \"Oh my\ngod, how do we even look things up on\nthe internet anymore?\" Is is Stack\nOverflow still around? Are forums still\na thing? Like,\n\n\nHow do I even find answers to some of these questions I have all day long?\nI don't want to give up AI.\nIn fact, I'd say the way I like to use AI, I'm getting smarter every day because of AI.\nBecause I'm using AI to have it explain things to me, even stupid questions.\nI would be a little embarrassed to even enter into Google.\nAI is perfectly willing to give me the ELI5 explanation of some Unix command I should have known already, but I don't.\nI'm sorry.\nCan you just explain it to me?\nAnd now I know the thing.\nSo, at the end of the day of me working with AI all day long, I'm a little bit smarter, like 5%.\nSorry, not 5%, half a percent maybe.\nThat compounds over time.\nBut what I've also seen when I worked on the OMAKU project and I tried to let AI drive for me, I felt I was maybe half a percent dumber at the end of the day.\n\nOkay, you said a lot of interesting things.\nFirst of all, let's just start with the very fact that uh asking dumb questions.\nIf you go to Stack Overflow and ask a dumb question or read somebody else's dumb question and the answer to it, there's a lot of judgment there.\nYes, AI sometimes to an excessive degree has no judgment.\nIt usually says, \"Oh, that's a great question to a fault.\"\nYeah.\nOh, that's wonderful.\nYeah.\nI, I mean, it's it's such a it's so conducive to learning.\nIt's such a wonderful tool for learning and I would I too would miss it.\nAnd it's a great basically search engine into all kinds of nuances of a particular programming language, especially if you don't know it that well or like APIs you can load in documentation.\nIt's just so great for learning.\nI for me personally it I mean on the happiness scale it makes me more excited to program.\nI don't know what that is exactly.\nPart of that is the I'm really sorry Stack Overflow is an incredible website but there is a negativity there.\nYes, there's a judgment there.\nThere's it's just exciting to be like a with a hype man next to me just like saying yeah that's a great idea and I'll say no that's wrong.\nI'll I'll correct the AI and the and the AI will say, \"You're absolutely right.\nHow did I not think about that?\"\nHe'll rewrite the code.\nI'm like, \"Holy shit, I'm having it's like a buddy that's like really being positive and is very smart and is challenging me to think and even if I never use the code it generates, I'm already a better programmer.\"\nBut actually, the deeper thing is for some reason I'm having more fun.\nThat's a really really important thing.\nI like to think of it as a pair programmer for exactly that reason.\nPair programming came vogue in like the 2000s where you'd have two programmers in front of one machine and you'd push the keyboard between you.\nOne program would be driving, they'd be typing in.\nThe other programmer would essentially sit and watch the code, suggest improvements, look something up.\nThat was a really interesting dynamic.\nNow, unfortunately, I'm an introvert, so I can do that for about five minutes before I want to jump off a bridge.\nSo, it doesn't work for me as a full-time occupation, but AI allows me to have all the best of that experience all the time.\nNow, I think what's really interesting what you said about it makes it more fun.\nI hadn't actually thought about that, but what it's made more fun to me is to be a beginner again.\nIt's made me it made it more fun to learn Bash successfully for the first time.\nNow, I had to do the detour where I let it write all the code for me and I realized I wasn't learning nearly as much as I hoped I would.\nAnd that I started doing once I typed it out myself.\nBut it gave me the confidence that you know what if I need to do some iOS programming myself.\nI haven't done that in probably 6 years was the last time I dabbled in it.\nI never really built anything for real.\nI feel highly confident now that I could sit down with AI and I could have something in the app store by the end of the week.\nI would not have that confidence unless I had a pair programming body like AI.\nI don't actually use it very much for Ruby code.\nI'm occasionally impressed whenever I try it.\nThey're like, \"Oh, it got this one thing right.\nThat is truly remarkable and it's actually pretty good.\"\nAnd then I'll ask you two more questions and I go like, \"Oh, yeah.\nOkay.\nIf you were my junior programmer, I'd start tapping my fingers and going like, you got to you got to shape up.\"\nNow, the great thing, of course, is we can just wait five minutes.\nUm, the entropic CEO seems to think that 90% of all code by the end of the year is going to be written by AI.\nI'm more than a little bit skeptical about that.\nBut I'm open-minded about the prospect that programming potentially will turn into a horse when done manually, something we do recreationally.\nIt's no longer a mode of transportation to get around LA.\nYou're not going to saddle up and go to the grocery store and pick up stuff from Whole Foods in your saddle bags.\nThat's just not a thing anymore.\nThat could be the future for programming, for manual programming.\nEntirely possible.\nI also don't care like even though we have great renditions of all the best songs as I said there are millions of people who love to play the guitar it may no longer have as much economic value as it once did I think that I'm quite convinced is true that we perhaps have seen the peak now I understand the paradox when the price of something goes down actually the you overall usage goes up and total spend on that activity goes up that could also happen maybe but what we're seeing right now is that a lot of the big shops, a lot of the big companies are not hiring like they were 5 years ago.\nThey're not anticipating they're going to need tons more programmers.\nControversially, Toby actually put out a memo inside of Shopify asking everyone who's considering hiring someone to ask the question, could this be done by AI?\nNow, he's further ahead on this question than I am.\nI look at some of the coding trenches and I go like, I'd love to use AI more and I see how it's making us more productive, but it's not yet at the level where I just go like, \"Oh, we have this project.\nLet me just give it to the AI agent and it's going to go off and do it.\"\nBut let's just let's just be honest.\nYou're like a Clint Eastwood type character, cowboy on a horse, seeing uh seeing cars going around and you're like, well, that's part of it.\nAnd I think that's it is important to have that humility that what you are good at may no longer be what society values.\nThis has happened a million times in history that you could have been exceptionally good at saddlem for example.\nThat's something that a lot of people used to care about because everyone rode a horse and then suddenly riding a horse became this niche hobby that there's some people care about it but not nearly as many.\nThat's okay.\nNow the other thing of this is I've been had the good fortune to have been a programmer for nearly 30 years.\nThat was a great run.\nI try to look at life in this way that I've already been blessed with decades of economically viable, highly valuable ways of translating what I like best in the working world to write Ruby code that that was so valuable that I could make millions and millions of dollars doing it.\nAnd if that's over tomorrow, I shouldn't look at that with regret.\nI should look at it with gratitude.\nBut you're also a highly experienced, brilliant, and opinionated human being.\nSo, it's really interesting to get your opinion on the future of the horse because it, you know, there's a lot of young people listening to this who love programming or who are excited by the possibility of building stuff with software uh with a Ruby with Ruby with Ruby on Rails that kind of language this and now the possibility.\nIs it a career?\nIs it a career?\nAnd how if indeed a single person can build more and more and more with the help of AI like how do they learn that skill?\nIs this a good skill to learn?\nI mean that to me is the real mystery here because I think it's still absolutely true that you have to learn how to program from scratch currently.\nYes.\nBut how do you balance those two skills?\nBecause I too as I'm thinking now there is a scary slipping away of skill that happens in a matter of like really minutes on a particular piece of code.\nIt just it's it's it's scary.\nNot the way driving, you know, when you have a car drive for you, it doesn't quite slip away that fast.\nSo that really scares me.\nSo when when somebody comes up to me and asks me like, \"How do I learn to program?\"\nI don't know what the advice is because I think it's not enough to just use cursor or copilot to generate code.\nIt's absolutely not enough.\nNot if you want to learn.\nNone of you want to become better at it.\nIf you just become a tap monkey, maybe you're productive in a second, but then you have to realize, well, can anyone just tap if that's all we're doing is just sitting around all day long tapping?\nYes.\nYes.\nYes.\nYes.\nYes.\nThat's not a marketable skill.\nNow, I always preface this both to myself and when I speak to others about it is rule number one, nobody fucking knows anything.\nNo one can predict even 6 months ahead.\nRight now, we're probably at peak AI future hype because we see all the promise because so much of it is real and so many people have experienced it themselves.\nThis mind-boggling thing that the silicon is thinking in some way that feels eerily reminiscent of humans.\nI'd actually say the big thing for me wasn't even chat GBT.\nIt wasn't even Claude.\nIt was DeepSeek.\nRunning Deepseek locally and seeing the think box where it converses with itself about how to formulate the response.\nI almost wanted to think is this a gimmick?\nIs it doing this as a performance for my benefit?\nBut that's not actually how it thinks.\nIf this is how it actually thinks, okay, I'm a little scared.\nYeah, this is incredibly human how it thinks in this way.\nBut where does that go?\nSo in 95, one of my favorite movies, one of my favorite be movies came out.\nThe Lawn Mower Man.\nGreat movie.\nIncredible movie about virtual reality being an Avatar and living in VR.\nLike the story was a mess, but the aesthetics, the world that built up was incredible.\nAnd I thought, we're 5 years away.\nI'm going to be living in VR now.\nI'm just going to be floating around.\nI'm going to be an avatar.\nThis is where most humans can spend most of their day.\nThat didn't happen.\nWe're 30 years later.\nVR is still not here.\nIt's here for gaming.\nIt's here for some specialized applications.\nMy oldest loves playing Gorilla Tag.\nI don't know if you've tried that.\nThat's basically the hottest VR game.\nWonderful.\nThat's great.\nIt's really hard to predict the future because we just don't know.\nAnd then when you factor in AI and you have even the smartest people go like I don't think we fully understand how this works.\nBut then on the flip side you have Moore's law that seems to have worked for many many many years in uh decreasing the size of transistor for example.\nSo like you know uh flash didn't take over the internet but Moors law worked.\nSo we don't know which one AI is what it is and this is what I find so fascinating too.\nI forget who did this presentation but someone in the web community did this great presentation on the history of the airplane.\nSo you go from the Wright brothers flying in what was 1903 or something like that and 40 years later you have jet flight just an unbelievable amount of progress in four decades.\nThen in 56 I think it was the halt design for the Boeing 747 essentially precursor was designed and basically nothing has happened since.\nJust minor tweaks and improvements on the flying experience since the 50s somehow if you were to predict where flying was going to go and you were sitting in 42 and you'd seen you remember the Wright brothers flying in '03 and you were seeing that jet engines coming.\nYou're like, \"We're going to fly the to the stars in another two decades.\nWe're going to invent super mega hypersonic flights that's going to traverse the earth in in two hours.\"\nAnd then that didn't happen.\nIt tapped out.\nThis is what's so hard of predicting about predicting the future.\nWe can be so excited in the moment because we're drawing a line through early dots on a chart and it looks like those early dots are just going up and to the right and sometimes they just flatten out.\nThis is also one of those things where we have so much critical infrastructure.\nFor example, that still runs on cobalt that about five humans around the world really understand truly deeply that there's a it's possible for society to lose a competence it still needs because it's chasing the future.\nCopalt is still with us.\nThis is one of the things I think about with with programming.\nRuby on Rails is at such a level now that in 50 years from now, it's exceedingly likely that there's still a ton of Ruby and Rail systems running around.\nNow, very hard to predict what that exact world is going to be like, but yesterday's weather tells us that if there's still cobalt code from the 70s operating social security today, and we haven't figured out a clean way to convert that, let alone understand it.\nUm, we should certainly be humble about predicting the future.\nI don't think any of the programmers who wrote that cobalt code back in the 70s had any damn idea that in 2025 checks were still being cut off the business logic that they had encoded back then.\nBut that just brings me to the conclusion on the question for what should a young programmer do?\nYou're not going to be able to predict the future.\nNo one's going to be able to predict the future.\nIf you like programming, you should learn programming.\nNow, is that going to be a career forever?\nI don't know.\nBut what's going to be a career forever?\nWho knows?\nLike a second ago, we thought that it was the blue collar labor that was going to be abstracted first.\nIt was the robots that were going to take over.\nThen Gen AI comes out and then all the artists suddenly look like, \"Holy shit, is this going to do all animation now?\nIt's going to do all music now.\"\nThey get real scared.\nAnd now I see the latest Tesla robot going like, \"Oh, maybe we're back now to blue collar being in trouble because if it can dance like that, it can probably fix a toilet.\"\n\n\nSo no one knows anything, and you have to then position yourself for the future in such a way that it doesn't matter that you pick a profession or path where if it turns out that you have to retool and reskill, you're not going to regret the path you took. That's a general life principle for me. How I look at all endeavors I involve myself in is I want to be content with all outcomes. When we start working on a new product at 37signals, I set up my mental model for its success. And I go, \"Do you know what? If no one wants this, I will have had another opportunity to write beautiful Ruby code, to explore a green field domain, to learn something new, to build a system I want, even if no one else wants it. What a blessing. What a privilege.\" If a bunch of people want it, that's great. We can pay some salaries. We can keep the business running, and if it's a blowway success, wonderful, I get to impact a bunch of people.\n\nI think one of the big open questions to me is, uh, how far you can get with vibe coding, whether an approach for a young developer to invest most of their time into vibe coding or into writing code from scratch.\n\nSo vibe coding meaning, so I'm I'm leaning into the meme a little bit, but the vibe coding meaning you generate code, you have the this idea of a thing you want to create, you generate the code, and then you fix it with both natural language through the prompts and manually. You learn enough to manually fix it. So that's the learning process, how you fix code that's generated, or you write code from scratch and have the LLM's kind of uh tab tab tab tab add extra code, like which part do you lean on? I think to be safe, you should find the the beauty and the the artistry and the skill in both. Right from scratch, like there should be some percent of your time just writing from scratch and some percent by coding. There should be more of the time writing from scratch.\n\nIf you are interested in learning how to program, unfortunately, you're not going to get fit by watching fitness videos. You're not going to learn how to play the guitar by watching YouTube guitar videos. You have to actually play yourself. You have to do the sit-ups. Programming understanding learning almost anything requires you to do. Humans are not built to absorb information in a way that transforms into skills by just watching others from afar. Now, ironically, it seems AI is actually quite good at that. But humans are not. If you want to learn how to become a competent programmer, you have to program. It's really not that difficult to understand. Now, I understand the temptation, and the temptation is there because vibe coding can produce things, perhaps in this moment, especially in a new domain you're not familiar with, with tools you don't know perfectly well, that's better than what you could do or that you would take much longer to get at, but you're not going to learn anything. You're going to learn in this superficial way that feels like learning but is completely empty calories. And secondly, if you can just vibe code it, you're not a programmer. Then anyone could do it, which may be wonderful. That's essentially what happened with the Access database. That's what happened with Excel. It took the capacity of accountants to become software developers because the tools became so accessible to them that they could build a model for how the business was going to do next week. That required a programmer prior to Excel. Now, it didn't because they could do it themselves. Vive coding enables non-programmers to explore their ideas in a way that I find absolutely wonderful, but it doesn't make you a programmer.\n\nI agree with you, but I want to allow for room for both of us be wrong. For example, there could be vibe coding could actually be a skill that if you train it, and by vibe coding, let's include the the step of correction, the iterative correction. It's possible if you get really good at that that you're outperforming the people that write from scratch, that you can come up with truly innovative things, especially at this moment in history while the LLMs are a little bit too dumb to create super novel things and a complete product, but they're starting to creep close to that. So, if you're investing time now into becoming a really good vibe coder, maybe this is the right thing to do, uh, as if it's indeed a skill. We kind of meme about vibe coding just like sitting back and in the it's in the name. But if you treat it seriously, a competitive vibe coder and get good at riding the wave of AI and get good at the skill of editing code versus writing code from scratch, it's possible that you can actually get farther in the long term. Maybe editing is a fundamentally different task than writing from scratch if you take that seriously as a skill that you develop. I see. I don't, to me that's an open question. I just think I'm I personally, and now you're on another level, but just me, just just personally, I'm not as good at editing the code that I didn't write. That's a different, no one is of this generation. But but maybe that's a skill. Maybe if you get on the same page as the AI because there's a consistency to the AI. It's like, um, it really is a pair programmer with a consistent style and structure and so on. Plus with your own prompting, you can control the kind of code you write. I mean, it could legitimately be a skill. Like that's the dream of the prompt engineer.\n\nI think it's complete pipe dream. I don't think editors exist that aren't good at writing. I've written a number of books. I've had a number of professional editors. Not all of them wrote their own great books, but all of them were great writers in some regard. You cannot give someone pointers if you don't know how to do it. It's very difficult for an editor to be able to spot what's wrong with a problem if they couldn't make the solution themselves. Editing in my opinion is the reward. The capacity to be a good editor is the reward you get from being a good doer. You have to be a doer first. Now that's not the same as saying that vibe coding prompt engineering won't be able to produce fully formed amazing systems even shortly. I think that's entirely possible. But then there's no skill left, which maybe is the greatest payoff at all. Wasn't that the whole promise of AI anyway? That it was just all natural language, that even my clumsy way of formulating a question could result in a beautiful succinct answer. That actually to me is a much more appealing vision that there's going to be these special prompt engineering wizards who know how to tickle the AI just right to produce what they want. The beauty of AI is to think that someone who doesn't know the first thing about how AI actually works is able to formulate their idea and their aspirations for what they want, and the AI could somehow take that messy clump of ideas and produce something that someone wants. That's actually what programming has always been. There's very often been people who didn't know how to program, who wanted programs, who then hired programmers who gave them messy descriptions of what they wanted, and then when the programmers delivered that back said, \"Oh, no, actually that's not what I meant. I want something else.\" AI may be able to provide that cycle. If that happens to the fullest extent of it, yeah, there's not going to be as many programmers around, right? But hopefully, presumably someone still, at least for the foreseeable future, have to understand whether what the AI is producing actually works or not.\n\nAs a interesting case study, maybe a thought experiment, if I wanted to vibe code, uh, Basecamp or or HEY and some of the some of the products you you've built, like what would be the bottlenecks? What where would I fail along the way? What I've seen when I've been trying to do this, trying to use vibe coding to build something real is you actually fail really early, uh, the vibe coding is able to build a veneer at the current present moment of something that looks like it works, but it's flawed in all sorts of ways. There are the obvious ways, the meme ways that it's leaking all your API keys, it's storing your password in plain text. I think that's ultimately solvable. Like, it's going to figure that out, or at least it's going to get better at that. But its capacity to get lost in its own labyrinth is very great right now. You let it code something and then you want to change something and it becomes a game of whack-a-mole real quick. Peter levels who've been doing this wonderful flight simulator was talking to that where at a certain scale the thing just keeps biting its own tail. You want to fix something and it breaks five other things, which I think is actually uniquely human because that's how most bad programmers are at a certain level of complexity with the domain. They can't fix one thing without breaking three other things. So in that way, I'm actually in some ways almost a positive signal for that the AI is going to figure this out because it's on an extremely human trajectory right now. The kind of mistakes it's making are the kind of mistakes that junior programmers make all the time.\n\nYeah. Uh, can we zoom out and look at the vision, the manifesto, the doctrine of Rails? What are some of the things that make a programming language, a framework great, especially for web development?\n\nSo, we talked about happiness.\nYes.\nThe underlying objective of Ruby. Uh, what else?\n\nSo, you're looking at the nine points I wrote out in I think 2012. And first, before we dive into them, I want to say the reason I wrote it down is that if you want a community to endure, you have to record its values and you have to record its practices. If you don't, eventually you're going to get enough new people come in who have their own ideas of where this thing should go. And if we don't have a a guiding light helping us to make decisions, we're going to start flailing. We're going to start actually falling apart. I think this is one of the key reasons that institutions of all kinds start falling apart. We forget why Chesterton's fence is there. We just go like, \"Why is that fence there? Let's yank it out.\" Oh, it was to keep the wolves out. Now we're all dead. Oops. So, I wanted to write these things down. And if we just take them quick one by one, you talked about optimizing for programmer happiness. I put that at number one in homage of Matts. And that's a lot about accepting that there is occasionally a trade-off between writing beautiful code and other things we want out of systems. There can be a runtime trade-off. There can be a performance trade-off, but we're going to do it nonetheless. We're also going to allow ambiguity in a way that many programmers by default are uncomfortable with. I give the example actually here of in the interactive Ruby shell where you can play with the language or even interact with your domain model. You can quit it in two ways, at least that I found. You can write exit, boom, you're out of the program. You can write quit, boom, you're out of the program. They do it the same thing. We just wrote both exit or the people who built that wrote both exit and quit because they knew humans were likely to pick one or the other. Python is the perfect contrast to this. In the Python interactive protocol, if you write exit, it won't exit. It'll give you a fucking lesson. It'll basically tell you to read the fucking manual. It says use exit parentheses or control D i.e. end of file to exit. I'm like, \"One is very human and another is very engineer.\" And I mean that both of them in the best possible way. Python is pedantic. Python's the value from the start stated is that there should be preferably one and only one way to do a certain thing. Ruby goes the complete opposite. No, we want the full expression that fits different human brains such that it seems like the language is guessing just what they want.\n\nAnd part of that is also you describe the principle of least surprise, which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language because you have to kind of it's a subjective thing what is, which is why you can't do it in one way, which is why I use the example of both exit and quit. The principle of least surprise for some people would be like, \"Oh, exit. That's how I get out of the prompt. For other people, it would be quit.\" Why don't we just do both?\n\nOkay. So, what's the convention over configuration? That's a big one.\nThat's a big one. That's a huge one. And it was born out of a frustration I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks where when you were setting up a web application framework for Java back in the day, it was not uncommon to literally write hundreds if not thousands of lines of XML configuration files. Oh, I need this. I want um the database to use the foreign keys as post ID. No, no, no. I want it as post capital I D. Oh, no, no, no. you have to do a capital P ID. There are all these ways where you can configure how foreign relation keys should work in a database and none of them matter. We just need to pick one and then that's fine. And if we pick one and we can depend on it, it becomes a convention. And if it's a convention, we don't have to configure it. And if we don't have to configure it, you can get started with you actually care about much quicker. So convention over configuration is essentially to take that idea that the system should come preassembled. I'm not just handing you a box of fucking Legos and asking you to build the Millennium Falcon. I'm giving you a finished toy. You can ed you can change it. It's still built out of Legos. You can still take some pieces off and put in some other pieces, but I'm giving you the final product. And this cuts against the grain of what most programmers love. They love a box of Legos. They love to put everything together from scratch. They love to make all these detailed little decisions that just don't matter at all. And I want to elevate that up such that, hey, I'm not trying to take the decisions away from you. I just want you to focus on decisions that actually matter that you truly care about. No one cares about whether it's postc ID or post ID or pit. Yeah. Great defaults. Yeah. Just a wonderful thing. You have all these aspirations. They're going to do some kind of custom most beautiful Legos castle that nobody's ever built from these pieces. But in reality to be productive in most situations you just need to build the basic thing and and then on top of that is where your creativity comes.\n\nAbsolutely. And I think this is one of those part of the doctrine that a lot of programmers who get to use Ruby and Rails begrudgingly will acknowledge is a nice thing even if they don't really like it. Like it's hard to beat the sort of\n\n\nAttraction to building with Legos from scratch out of programmers. That's just what we like. This is why we're programmers in the first place because we like to put these little pieces together. But we can direct that instinct towards a more productive end of the stack.\n\nOkay. What are some of the other ones? The menu is amacasa. It actually comes out of the same principle that great defaults really matter. If you look at everything that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem right now, for example, it is that no one is in charge of the menu. There are a billion different dishes and you can configure just your tailored specific configuration of it, but no one done the work to make sure it all fits together. So you have all these unique problems in the JavaScript ecosystem. For example, there's probably 25 major ways of just doing the controller layer and then as many of how to talk to the database. So you get this permutation of n * n * n of no one is using the same thing and if they are using the same thing they're only using the same thing for about 5 minutes. So we have no retained wisdom. We build up no durable skills. Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying do you know what Rails is not just a web framework. It is a complete attempt at solving the web problem. is complete attempt at solving everything you need to build a great web application. And every piece of that puzzle should ideally be in the box, preconfigured, pre-assembled. If you want to change some of those pieces later, that's wonderful. But on day one, you'll get a full menu designed by a chef who really cared about every piece of the ingredient, and you're going to enjoy it.\n\nAnd that's again one of those things where many programmers think like I know better and they do in some hyper local sense of it. Every programmer knows better. This is what Ruby is built on that every programmer knows better in their specific situation. Maybe they can do something dangerous. Maybe they think they know better and then they blow their foot off and then they truly will know better because they've blown their foot off once and won't do it again. But the the menu is that. So you in general see the value in the in the monolith.\n\nYes. The integrated system integrated.\n\nSomeone thought of the whole problem. This is one of the reasons why I've been on a crusade against microservices since the term was coined. Microservices was born out of essentially a good idea. What do you do at Netflix scale when you have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of code? No one can keep that entire system in their head at one time. You have to break it down. Microservices can be a reasonable way to do that when you're at Netflix scale. When you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers working on a codebase of half a million lines of code, you're an idiot. You just don't need to turn method invocations into network calls. It is the first rule of distributed programming. Do not distribute your programming. It is makes everything harder. all the failure conditions you have to consider as a programmer just becomes infinitely harder when there's a network cable involved. So I hate the idea of premature decomposition and microservices is exactly that. The monolith says let's try to focus on building a whole system that a single human can actually understand and push that paradigm as far as possible by compressing all the concepts such that more of it will fit into memory of a single operating human and then we can have a system where I can actually understand all of Basecamp. I can actually understand all of HEY. Both of those systems are just over 100,000 lines of code. I've seen people do this at maybe twice, maybe three times that scale and then it starts breaking down once you get north of certainly half a million in lines of code. No individual human can do it. And that's when you get into maybe some degree of microservices can make sense.\n\nBasecamp and HEY are both 100,000 lines of code.\n\nOh, that's small.\n\nIt is considering the fact that Basecamp I think has something like 420 screens, different ways and configurations.\n\nUh do you include the front end in that?\n\nNo, that's the Ruby code. Well, it's front end in the sense that some of that Ruby code is beneficial to the to the front, but it's not JavaScript, for example. Now the other thing we might talk about later is we write very little JavaScript actually for all of our applications. HEY, which is a Gmail competitor. Gmail ships I think 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript. If you compress it I think it's about 6 megabytes. 28 megabytes. Think about how many lines of code that is. When HEY launched we shipped 40 kilobytes.\n\nIt's trying to solve the same problem. You can solve the email client problem with either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript or with 40 kilobytes if you do things differently.\n\nBut that comes to the same problem essentially. This is why I have fiercely fought splitting front end and back end apart. that in my opinion this was one of the great crimes against web development that we are still atoning for that we separated and divided what was and should be a unified problem-solving mechanism. When you are working both on front end and back end you understand the whole system and you're not going to get into these camps that decompose and eventually you end up with shit like GraphQL.\n\nOkay.\n\nUh let's fly through the rest of the doctrine. No one paradigm.\n\nNo one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby is a fiercely object-oriented programming language at its core, but it's also a functional programming language. This five times I told you about you can essentially do these uh anonymous function calls and you can chain them together very much in the spirit of how true functional programming languages work. Ruby has even moved closer towards the functional programming end of the scale by making strings immutable.\n\nUm there are ideas from all different disciplines of and all different paradigms of software development that can fit together.\n\nSmall talk for example was only object-oriented and that was just it. Ruby tries to be mainly object-oriented but borrow a little bit of functional programming a little bit of imperative programming be able to do all of that. Rails tries to do the same thing. We're not just going to pick one paradigm and run it through everything. Object orientation is at the center of it, but it's okay to invite all these other disciplines in. It's okay to be inspired. It's okay to remix it. I actually think one of the main benefits of Rails is that it's a remix. I didn't invent all these ideas. I didn't come up with active record. I didn't come up with the MVC way of dividing an application. I took all the great ideas that I had learned and picked up from every different um camp and I put it together. Not because there was going to be just one single overarching theory of everything, but I was going to have a cohesive unit that incorporated the best from everywhere.\n\nIs that idea a bit at tension with the beauty of the monolith system? I think the monolith can be thought of as quite roomy, quite as a big tent. That the monolith needs actually to borrow a little bit of functional programming for the kinds of problems that that excels that discipline excels at solving or that paradigm excels at solving if you also want object orientation as its core. I actually think when I've looked at functional programming languages, there's a lot to love. And then I see some of the crazy contortions they have to go through when part of the problem they're solving calls for mutating something. And you go like, \"Holy shit, this is a great paradigm for 90% of the problem.\" And then you're twisting yourself completely out of shape when you try to solve the last 10.\n\nOo, exalt beautiful code is the next one.\n\nWe've talked about that at length. Then here's a great example that really summarizes the domain specific language quality of Ruby and Rails that you can make code actually pleasant to write and read which is really funny to me because as we talked about when I started learning programming it wasn't even a consideration. I didn't even know that that could be part of the premise that that could be part of the solution that writing code could feel as good as writing a poem. Class project application record belongs to account has many participants class name person validates presence of name.\n\nSee you could read it out. You didn't even change anything.\n\nIt's a haiku or something, right? Isn't that beautiful?\n\nYeah, it's nice. It's really it's really it's really nice. There's a there's an intuitive nature to it. Okay. So, I have specific questions there. I mean, active record, just to take that tangent, that has to be your favorite feature.\n\nIt's the crown jewel of Rails. It really is. It is the defining characteristic of how to work with Ruby and Rails.\n\nAnd it's born in an interesting level of controversy because it actually uses a pattern that had been described by Martin Fowler in the patterns of enterprise application architecture. one of the greatest books for anyone working on business systems and if you had not read it you must pick it up immediately. Patterns of enterprise application architecture I think it was published in 2001. It is one of the very few programming books that I have read many times over. It's incredible. In it Martin describes a bunch of different patterns of how to build business systems essentially. And active record is a little bit of a footnote in there. The pattern is literally called active record. You can look it up in it's called active erot. I wasn't even creative enough to come up with a name of my own, but it allows the creation the marriage of database and object orientation in a way that a lot of programmers find a little um off-putting. They don't actually want to pollute the beautiful object-oriented nature of that kind of programming with SQL. There was a rant by Uncle Bob the other day about how SQL is the worst thing ever. Blah blah. Okay, fine. Whatever. I don't care. This is practical. We are making CRUD applications. You're taking things out of an HTML form and you're sticking them into a damn database. It's not more complicated than that. The more abstractions you put in between those two ends of the spectrum, the more you're just fooling yourself. This is what we're doing. We're talking to SQL databases. By the way, quick aside, SQL was one of those things that have endured the onslaught of NoSQL databases, structured list data for a better part of a decade and still reign supreme. SQL was a good thing to invest your time in learning. Every programmer working with the web should know SQL to a fair degree. Even if they're working with an ORM, an object relational mapper as active record, you still need to understand SQL. What active record does is not so much try to abstract the SQL away behind a different kind of paradigm as just making it less cumbersome to write. Making it more amenable to build domain models on top of other domain models in a way since you don't have to write every damn SQL statement by hand. We just say that active record is an OM which is a layer that makes it intuitive and human interpretable to communicate with a database. Even simpler than that, it turns tables into classes and rows into objects. I actually think SQL is very easy to understand. Most of it, you can write some SQL golf, too. That's very hard to understand. But SQL at its base and much of the criticism against SQL was it was written for human consumption. It's actually quite rebose, especially if you're doing things like inserts over and over again. It's quite ribbos. Insert into table parenthesis, enumerate every column. You want to insert values, parentheses, every value that fits with that column. It gets tedious to write SQL by hand, but it's actually very humanly readable. Active record just takes that tediousness away. It makes it possible to combine things in a way that a humanly describable language just doesn't. It composes things into methods and you can combine these methods and you can build structures around them. So, I don't dislike SQL. I dislike a lot of things in programming. try to get rid of them. SQL wasn't really one of them. It was just a sense of I don't want to write the same thing over and over again. It was a can we be a little more succinct? Can we match it just slightly better to the object orientation without trying to hide away the fact that we're persisting these objects into a database? That's where I think a lot of OM went wrong. They tried to live in the pure world of objects, never to consider that those objects had to be consistent into a SQL database. And then they came up with convoluted way of translating back and forth. Active record says, do you know what? Just accept it. This record, this object is not going to get saved into some NoSQL database. It's not going to be it's going to be saved into a SQL database. So just structure the whole thing around that. It's going to have attributes. Those attributes are going to respond to columns in the database. It's not more complicated than that. Stop making it. So\n\nyeah, but I I should say so I personally love SQL because I'm an algorithms person and so I love optimization. I love to know how the databases actually work so I can match the SQL queries and the design of the tables such that there is you know optimal squeeze the optimal performance out of the table okay based on the actual way that that table is used. So I mean I I think that pushes to the point that like there is value in learning and understanding SQL.\n\nI I wonder because I I started looking at active record and it looks really awesome. Does that make you lazy? Not you, but uh a person that rolls in and starts using Rails, you can probably get away with never really learning SQL, right?\n\nAs long as you want to stay at the entry level of competence. And this is actually my overarching mission with Rails is to lower the barrier of entry so far down that someone can start seeing stuff on the browser without basically understanding anything. They can run Rails new blog, run a couple of generators, they have a whole system, they don't understand anything, but it's an invitation to learn more. Where I get fired up, and this ties back to the AI discussion, is when that's turned into this meme that programmers no longer have to be competent. They can just I mean, the AI is going to figure it out. The generators is going to figure it out. I don't need to know SQL. Active record is going to abstract it away from me. No, no, no, dude. Hold up. The path here is competence. I'm trying to teach you things. I understand I can't teach you everything in five minutes. No one who's ever become good at anything worthwhile could be taught everything in five minutes. If you want to be a fully well-rounded web application developer, that takes years, but you can actually become somewhat productive in a few days. You can have fun\n\n\nIn a few days for sure. You can have fun in a few minutes and a few hours. And over time, I can teach you a little more. Active Record says, \"Yeah, yeah, all right. Start here and then, like, uh, next week we'll do a class on SQL.\" Uh, and actually, you have this beautiful expression that I love, that a great programming language like Ruby has a soft ramp; the ramp goes to infinity.\n\nThat's exactly right.\n\nSo, yeah, it's super accessible, super easy to get started, and it never stops. Yeah, it never... there's always more to learn. This is one of the reasons I'm still having fun programming, that I'm still learning new things. I can still incorporate new things. The web is deep enough as a domain; you're never going to learn all of it.\n\nProvide sharp knives. This is a good one because another way of saying this, the opposite way of saying this, the Java way of saying is, \"Do not provide foot guns,\" right? I don't want to give you sharp knives. You're a child. You can't handle a sharp knife. Here's a dull butter knife. Cut your damn steak, right? That's a very frustrating experience. You want a sharp knife, even though you might be able to cut yourself. I trust humans in the same way that Matt trusts humans. Maybe you cut off a finger. All right, you're not going to do that again. Thankfully, it was a virtual finger. It's going to grow back out. Your competence is going to grow. It's more fun to work with sharp tools, and that actually contributes to the ramp that goes to infinity, to the learning value integrated systems.\n\nWe kind of hit on that one. This is Rails is trying to solve the whole problem of the web, not just one little component. It's not leaving you a bunch of pieces you have to put together yourself. Progress over stability. You know what? If there's one that's dated, it's probably that one. At this stage, Rails has been incredibly stable over many, many generations. The last major release, Rails 8, was basically a no-upgrade for anyone running Rails 7. Rails 7 was almost a no-upgrade for anyone running Rails 6. I used to think it required more churn to get progress, to stay on the leading edge of new stuff. And I wrote this before I experienced the indignity of the 2010s in the JavaScript community, where it seemed like stability was not just unvalued, it was actually despised. That churn in and of itself was a value; we should be pursuing that if you were still working with the same framework three months later, you were an idiot. And I saw that, and I actually recoiled, and if I was going to write the doctrine today, I'd write that differently. I wouldn't say progress over stability. Well, maybe that it'd be a function of the age of the programming language also, maybe, or a deeper understanding of the problem. I think part of what's so fascinating about technology is that we have this perception that everything constantly moves so fast. No, it doesn't. Everything moves at a glacial pace. There is occasionally a paradigm shift, like what's happening with AI right now, like what happened with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, like what happened with the internet in '95. That's basically the total sum of my career. Three things changed. Everything else in between was incremental, small improvements. You can recognize a Rails application written in 2003. I know because the Basecamp I wrote back then is still operating, making millions of dollars in ARR, surveys customers on the initial version that was launched back then, and it looks like the Rails code, if I squint a little, that I would write today. So most things don't change, even in computing, and that's actually a good thing. We saw with the JavaScript ecosystem what happens when everyone gets just mad about constant churn. Things don't change that often.\n\nBy the way, on that small tangent, you just sort of visibly, verbally changed your mind with the you of 15 years ago.\n\nYes.\n\nThat's interesting. Have you noticed yourself changing your mind quite a bit over the years?\n\nI would say, \"Oh, yes,\" and then also, \"Oh, no,\" in the sense that there are absolutely fundamental things, both about human nature, about institutions, about programming, about business, that I've changed my mind on. And then I've also had experiences that are almost even more interesting, where I thought I had changed my mind, and I tried it a new way, realized why I had the original opinion in the first place, and then gone back to it. So it happens both ways. The an example of the later part, for example, was, um, managers at 37signals. For the longest time, I would rail against engineering managers as an unnecessary burden on a small or even medium-sized company. And at one point, I actually started doubting myself a little bit. I started thinking, like, \"You know what, maybe all programmers do need a one-on-one therapy session every week with their engineering manager to be a whole individual.\" So, we tried that for a couple years, where we hired some very good engineering managers who did engineering management the way you're supposed to do it, the way it's done all over the place. And after that, I thought, like, \"No, no, I was right. This was correct. We should not have had managers.\" Um, not every programmer needs a therapy session with an engineering manager every week. We don't need these endlessly scheduled huddles. We don't need all these meetings. We just need to leave people the hell alone to work on problems that they enjoy for long stretches of uninterrupted time. That is where happiness is found. That's where productivity is found. And if you can get away with it, you absolutely should. Engineering management is a necessary evil when that breaks down. What's the case for managers then?\n\nThe case for managers is that if you do have a lot of people, there's a bunch of work that kind of just crops up. The one-on-one is one example that programmers need someone to check in with. There's another idealized version that someone needs to guide the career of juniors, for example, to give them redirecting feedback and all this other stuff. And it's not that in the abstract I don't agree with some of those things, but in practice, I've found that they often create more problems that they solve. And a good example here is, can you get feedback from someone who's not better at your job than you are? You can get some feedback. You can get feedback on how you show up at work. Are you being courteous to others? Are you being a good communicator? Okay. Yes. But you can't get feedback on your work. And that's more important. It's more important that you work under and with someone who's better at your job than you are if you wish to progress in your career. And every single programmer I've ever worked with was far more interested in progressing in their career on that metric, getting better at their craft, than they were in picking up pointers that a middle manager could teach them. That's not saying that there isn't value in it. It's not saying there isn't value in being a better person or a better communicator. Of course, there is all those things. But if I have to choose one or the other, I value competence higher, right? That's again, I cavil this a million times because I know what people sometimes hear. They hear the genius asshole is just fine, and that's great, and you should excuse all sorts of malicious behavior. Someone just really good at what they do. I'm not saying that at all. What I am saying is that the history of competence is a history of learning from people who are better than you. And that relationship should take precedence over all else. And that relationship gets put aside a bit when engineering managers are introduced. Now, the funny thing is, this conversation ties back to the earlier things we were talking about. Most engineering managers are actually former programmers. They at least know programming to some extent. But what I've seen time and again is that they lose their touch, their feel with it very, very quickly and turn into pointy-haired bosses very, very quickly who are really good at checking for updates, just seeing where we are on, uh, project A here, if you need anything, or are we ready to deliver to? Okay, yes, and also, no, just shut up, leave me the hell alone, let me program, and then I'll come up for air. I'll talk with other programmers who I can spar with, that we can learn something with, I can turn the problems over with, and we can move forward. If you look back on the history of the computer industry, all the great innovation that's happened, it's all been done by tiny teams with no engineering managers, just full of highly skilled individuals. You've had, uh, John Carmack on here. I used to look up to its software so much, not just because I loved Quake, not just because I loved what they were doing, but because he shared a bit about how the company worked. There were no managers, or maybe they had one business guy doing some business stuff, but that was just to get paid. Everything else was basically just designers and programmers, and there were about eight of them, and they created a goddamn Quake, too. So, why do you need all these people again? Why do you need all these managers again? Um, I think again, at a certain scale, it does break down. It's hard to just have 100,000 programmers running around wild without any product mommies or daddies telling them what to do. I understand that. And then even as I say that, I also don't understand it because if you look at something like Gmail, for example, there was like a side project done by Busher U at Google at the time. So much of the enduring long-term value of even all these huge companies were created by people who didn't have a goddamn manager. And that's not an accident. That's a direct cause and effect. So, I've turned in some way even more militant over the years against this notion of management, at least for myself and knowing who I am and how I want to work, because the other part of this is I don't want to be a manager. And maybe this is just me projecting the fact that I'm an introvert who doesn't like to talk to people in one-on-one calls every week. But it also encapsulates how I was able to progress my career. I did not really go to the next level with Ruby or otherwise until I had a door I could close and no one could bother me for six hours straight. So in companies, probably one of the reasons is it's very easy to hire managers, and, uh, managers also delegate responsibility from you. So if you just have a bunch of programmers running around, you're kind of respons... like, you, it's, it's work. It's intellectual work to have to deal with the first principles of every problem that's going on. So managers, like, you can, like, relax. Oh, be taken care of. Uh, but they then hire their own managers, and it just multiplies and multiplies and multiplies. I would love it if some of the great companies we have, uh, in the United States, if there was like an extra side branch that we could always run, maybe physicists can come up with how to split the simulation to where just all the managers are removed, also just with it, just, just in that branch, just the PR and the comm's people also, and even the lawyers, just engineers, and let's just see, and then we merge it back.\n\nI've essentially run that branch at 37signals for 20 years, and I've experimented with forking back on the other side. I've experimented with having a full-time lawyer on staff. I've experimented with having engineering managers. And I can tell you life is much better at 50, 60 people when none of those individuals or none of those roles... It's never about the individuals. It's about the roles. None of those roles are in your organization full-time. Occasionally, you need a manager. Occasionally, you need a lawyer. I can play the role of manager occasionally, fine, and then I can set it back down to zero. It's almost like the, like a cloud service. I want a manager service I can call on for seven hours this week, and then I want to take it down to zero for the next three months.\n\nYeah, I read... I don't know if this is still the case, that Basecamp is an LLC and doesn't have a CFO, like a full-time accountant. Is that...\n\nWhat's funny is these days, we do have a head of finance. We did not for the first 19 years of life, I think. Um, we got away with basically just having an accountant do our books in the same way you do a small ice cream shop, except we would over the times have done hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The scale seemed quirky, and at some point, you can also fall in love with your own quirkiness to a degree that isn't actually healthy. And I've certainly done that over time. And we should have had someone mount or count the beans a little more diligently, a little earlier, which was part of a blessing of just being wildly profitable and selling software that can have infinite margins. Basically, that you kind of can get away with a bunch of stuff that you perhaps shouldn't. What partially taught me this lesson was when we realized we had not been collecting sales tax in different US states where we had nexus. And it took us about two years and $5 million in settlements and cleanups to get out of that mess. And after that, I went like, \"Okay, fine. We can hire a finance person.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd we now have a wonderful finance person, Ron, who actually ended up replacing something else we used to have. We used to have a full-time data analytics person who would do all sorts of insight mining for why are people signing up for this thing. We ran that for 10 years and realized, you know what, if I can have either a data analytics person or an accountant, I'm picking the accountant. I love this so much on so many levels. Can we just linger on that advice that you've given, that small teams are better?\n\nI think that's really less... less is... is more. What did you say before? Worse is better.\n\nOkay. I'm sorry.\n\nWorse is better on adoption with technology a lot of times. Yeah. And I think actually comes out of the same thing. It comes out of the fact that many of the great breakthroughs are created by not even just tiny teams, but individuals. Individuals writing something, and an individual writing something on some parameter, what they do is worse. Of course, it's worse when one person has to make something that a huge company have hundreds, if not thousands, of developers that they can have work on that problem. But in so many other parameters, that worseness is the value. That less is the value. In Getting Real, which we wrote back in 2006, we talk about this notion of less software. When we first got started with Basecamp back in 2004, people would ask us all the time, \"Aren't you petrified of Microsoft? They have so many more resources. They have so many more programmers. What if they take a liking to your little niche here, and they show up, and they just throw a thousand\n\n\nProgrammers at the problem?\n\nAnd my answer, perhaps partly because I was like 24, was first of all, no, no care in the world. But the real answer was they're not going to produce the same thing. You cannot produce the kind of software that Basecamp is with a team of a thousand people. You will build the kind of software that a thousand people build, and that's not the same thing at all. So much of the main breakthrough in both end-user systems but also in open-source systems, in fundamental systems, they're done by individuals or very small teams. Even all these classical histories of Apple has always been like, well, it was a big organization, but then you had the team that was actually working on the breakthrough. It was four people, it was eight people, it was never 200.\n\nAnd large teams seem to slow things down. Yes. It's so fascinating thing, and part of it is the manager thing, because humans don't scale. Communication between humans certainly doesn't scale. You basically get the network cost effect. Every time you add a new node, it goes up exponentially.\n\nThis is perhaps the key thing of why I get to be so fond of having no managers at Basecamp because our default team size is two. One programmer, one designer, one feature. When you're operating at that level of scale, you don't need sophistication. You don't need advanced methodologies. You don't need multiple layers of management because you can just do. The magic of small teams is that they just do. They don't have to argue because we don't have to set direction. We don't have to worry about the roadmap. We can just sit down and make something and then see if it's good. When you can get away with just making things, you don't have to plan. And if you can get out of planning, you can follow the truth that emerges from the code, from the product, from the thing you're working on in the moment. You know far more about what the great next step is when you're one step behind rather than if you try 18 months in advance to map out all the steps. How do we get from here to very far away? You know what? That's difficult to imagine in advance because humans are very poor at that. Maybe AI one day will be much better than it than us. But humans can take one foot or put one foot in front of each other. That's not that hard. And that allows you to get away with all that sophistication. So the process just becomes much simpler. You need far fewer people. It compounds. You need much less process. You need to waste less time in meetings. You can just spend these long, glorious days and weeks of uninterrupted time solving real problems you care about and that are valuable. And you're gonna find that that's what the market actually wants. No one is buying something because there's a huge company behind it. Most of the time they're buying something because it's good. And the way you get something good is you don't sit around and have a meeting about it. You try stuff. You build stuff.\n\nIt really is kind of incredible what one person, honestly, one person can do in 100 hours of deep work, of focused work, even less.\n\nSo, I'll tell you this. I tracked exactly the number of hours I spend on the first version of Basecamp. And I was doing this because at the time I was working on a contract basis for Jason. He was paying me, I was going to say $15 an hour. That's what I got paid when we first got started. I think he had bumped my pay to a glorious 25. But I was billing him. And I know that the invoice for the first version of Basecamp was 400 hours. That's what it took for one sole individual in 2004 to create an entire system that has then gone on to gross hundreds of millions of dollars and continues to do extremely well. One person, just me setting up everything. Part of that story is Ruby, part of that story is Ruby on Rails, but a lot of it is also just me plus Jason plus Ryan plus Matt. That was the entire company at the time. And we could create something of sheer sustaining value with such a tiny team because we were a tiny team. Not the spite of small is not a stepping stone. This is the other thing that people get into their head. This is one of the big topics of a rework that it gave entrepreneurs the permission to embrace being a small team. Not as a waypoint, not as like I'm trying to become a thousand people. No, I actually like being a small team. Small teams are more fun. If you ask almost anyone, I'm sure Toby would say this too, even at his scale, the sheer enjoyment of building something is in the enjoyment of building it with a tiny team. Now, you can have impact at a different scale when you have a huge company. I fully recognize that and I see the appeal of it. But in the actual building of things, it's always small teams. Always.\n\nHow do you protect a small team? Basecamp has successfully stayed small. Has been the dragon you had to fight off that like basically you make a lot of money. There's a temptation to grow. So how do you not grow?\n\nDon't take venture capital. Okay, that's step one. Point number one.\n\nFirst of all, everybody takes venture capital. So you already you already went. I mean that's been the the answer for the longest time because the problem isn't just venture capital. It's other people's money. Once you take other people's money, completely understandably, they want a return and they would prefer to have the largest return possible because it's not them sitting in the code. It's not them getting the daily satisfaction out of building something, chiseling beautiful code poems out of the editor, right? They don't get that satisfaction. They get the satisfaction maybe of seeing something nice put into the world. That's fair. But they certainly also get a satisfaction of a higher return. And there is this sense certainly in venture capital stated in venture capital that the whole point of you taking the money is to get to a billion dollars or more. Now the path to that usually does go through running established playbooks and then when it comes to software the enterprise sales playbook is that playbook. If you're doing B2B software, SAS, you will try to find product market fit and the second you have it, you will abandon your small and medium-sized accounts to chase the big whales with a huge sales force. And by then, you're a thousand people, and life sucks.\n\nMhm. Uh that said, you you uh I mean, people are just curious about this. I've gotten a chance uh to get to know Jeff Bezos. He invested in Basecamp non-controlling. He bought secondaries. So this was the funny thing is that when investing have these two dual meanings. Normally when people think about investing they think you're putting in growth growth capital because you want the business to hire more people to do more R&D so they can grow bigger. Basis didn't do that actually. He bought a ownership stake directly from Jason and I and 100% of the pro proceeds of that purchase went into my and Jason's bank account, personal bank accounts. Not a single cent went into the account of the company because we didn't need the money to grow. What we needed or what we certainly enjoyed was to some extent maybe the vote of confidence, but more so the security of taking a little bit off the table is that we dare turn down the big bucks from venture capitals. It was essentially a vaccine against wanting to take a larger check from people who then wanted to take the company to something enormous that we didn't want to go with it. So Jeff gave Jason and I just enough money that we were comfortable turning all those people down in a way where if it had turned belly up like 6 months later we wouldn't have been kicking ourselves and calling we had something here that was worth millions and now we have nothing and I have to worry about rent and groceries again.\n\nI it is a vote of confidence. I wonder from uh I'd love to hear Jeff's side of the story of like why cuz he he he doesn't need like the money.\n\nSo, it's really I think it probably is just believing in people and wanting to have cool stuff be created in the world and make money off of it, but not like 100% the motivation for Jeff wasn't a return because he actually has a team, he's private office that runs these investments who did the calculus on the investment pitch we gave him, which was so ridiculous that Jason and I were laughing our asses off when we were writing down our metrics. I was like, \"No one's going to pay this. No one is going to give us this multiple of this amount of revenue.\" And that's fine. I mean, we took the call essentially out of kind of an awe that Jeff Bezos even wanted to look at us and like, do you know what? We don't want venture capital. We don't need other people's money, but like, let's just give him a bullshit number that no sane person would actually say yes to. And then, I mean, we can we can each go our own way. And his investment team said, like, Jeff, no way. This makes no economic sense at all. They're asking for way too much money with way too little revenue. And Jeff just went like, \"I don't care. I want to invest in these guy.\" Because to him at the time, it was chump change, right? Like Jason and I each got a few million dollars. I mean, whatever the currency swing between the yen and the dollar that day, probably moved 10x that for his net worth than our investment did. Jeff seemed genuinely interested in being around interesting people, interesting companies, helping someone go the distance. And I actually look back on that relationship with some degree of regret because I took that vote of confidence for granted in ways that I'm a little bit ashamed of over the years. I've been more critical about some of the things that Amazon had done that I feel now is sort of justified. So that's just sort of part of that processing um of it. But on the economic sense, he gave us that confidence. He gave us the economic confidence, but then he also gave us the confidence of a CEO running perhaps at the time the most important internet business in the US, showing up to our calls, which we would have with him like once a year and basically just going like, \"Yeah, you guys are doing awesome stuff. You should just keep doing awesome stuff. I read your book. It's awesome. You launched this thing. It's awesome. You should just do more of that. I don't actually know how to run your business. You guys know.\"\n\nSo the book goes out because I'm I'm just so from a fan perspective am curious about how Jeff Bezos was able to see because to me you and Jason are like special humans in the space of tech and the fact that Jeff was able to see that right. How hard is it to see that?\n\nHe certainly saw it very early and I think this is something that Jeff does better than almost anyone else. He spots that opportunity so far in advance of anyone else even open their eyes to it or certainly he's willing to bet on it far early and far harder than anyone else is and he's just right time and again. I mean we were not the only investment that he made and certainly Amazon had a extremely long-term vision so far longer than I have ever had the gumption to keep like I think of myself as a long-term thinker I'm playing a child's game compared to the game that Jeff is playing. Like when I looked at Amazon's economics around the dot boom and bust, they looked ridiculous. Like they were losing so much money. They were so hated by the market. They were no one believed that it was going to turn into what it is. But Jeff did in a way that that level of conviction I really aspire to. And I think that's one of the main things I've taken away from that relationship is that you can just believe in yourself to that degree against those odds. That's ridiculous. He did that at so many times our level that it's pathetic if I'm doubting myself.\n\nYeah, I think Amazon is one of those companies. I mean, it's come under a bunch of criticism over the years. Uh this is something about humans that don't appreciate so much that we take for granted the positive that a thing brings real quick and then we just start criticizing the thing. It's with the Wi-Fi and the airplanes. That's exactly it. But I think I think Amazon there could be a case made that Amazon is one of the greatest companies in the last hundred years. For sure. I think it's an easy case to make. What I also think is that the price you pay to be one of the greatest companies in the last hundred years is a lot of detractors, a lot of push back, a lot of criticism that this is actually order restored in the universe. One of my favorite teachers in all the time I've been on the internet is Kathy Sierra. I don't know if you know her work, but she was actually for only a few short years before the cruel internet ran her off, but she wrote a blog called creating passionate users. And she carved into my brain this notion of balance in the universe. If you're creating something of value that a lot of people love, you must create an equal and opposite force of haters. You cannot have people who love what you do without also having people who hate what you do. The only escape from that is mediocrity. If you are so boring and so uninteresting that no one gives a damn whether you exist or not, yeah, you don't get the haters, but you also don't get the impact of people who really enjoy your work. And I think Amazon is that just at the massive scale, right? They've brought so much value and change to technology, to commerce that they must simply have a black hole size of haters, otherwise the universe is simply going to tip over. Uh let me ask you about small teams. So you mentioned Jason a bunch of times. Jason Fried, you have been partners for a long long time. Perhaps it's fair to say he's more on the sort of the design business side. You're like the tech the engineering wizard. Uh how have you guys over all these years creating so many amazing products not murder each other? It's it's a great story of like partnership. What's what can you say about collaboration? What can you say that about Jason that that that you love that you've learned from? Uh why does this work?\n\nSo first I'll say we have tried to murder each other several times over the years but far less I think in the last decade. In the early days, our product discussions were so fierce that when we were having them in the office and there were other employees around, some of them were legitimately worried that the company was about to fall apart because the volume coming out of the room would be so high and sound so acrimonious that they were legitimately worried the whole thing was going to fall apart. But you know what's funny is that it never felt like that in the moment. It always felt like just a peak vigorous search for something better. And that we were able to stomach that level of adversity on the merits of\n\n\nAn idea because it was about the idea. It wasn't about the person. And it never really got personal. Not even never really. It didn't get personal. It wasn't like, \"Jason, you're an asshole.\" It was like, \"Jason, you're an idiot, and you're an idiot because you're looking at this problem the wrong way, and let me tell you the right way to do it.\"\n\nAs a small tangent, let me say that some people have said, we'll probably return to this, that uh you're sometimes uh uh can have flights of uh temper on the internet and so on. I I never take it that way because it is the same kind of ilk. Maybe I haven't seen the right kind of uh uh traces of temper, but usually it's about the idea and it's just excited, passionate, human.\n\nThat's ex exactly what I like to think of it as. It doesn't always come across as that. And I can see why spectators in particular sometimes would see something that looks like I'm going after the man rather than the ball. And I I do think I've tried to get better at that. But in my relationship with Jason, I think it's worked so well because we have our own distinct areas of competence where we fully trust each other. Jason trusts me to make the correct technical decisions. I trust him to make the correct design and product direction decisions and then we can overlap and share on the business, on marketing, on writing, on other aspects of it. So that's one thing is that if you're starting a business with someone where you do exactly the same as they do and you're constantly contesting who is the more competent person, I think that's far more difficult and far more volatile. So if you're starting a business and you're both programmers and you both work on the same kind of programming, ah good luck. I think that's hard. I tried to pick an easier path working with a designer where I knew that at least half of the time I could just delegate to his experience and competence and say like you know what I may have an opinion I have an opinion all the time on design but I don't have to win the argument because I trust you. Now occasionally we would have overlaps on business or direction where we'd both feel like we had a strong stake in the game and we both had a claim to competence in that area. But then for whatever reason, we also both had a long-term vision where I would go, \"Do you know what? I think we're wrong here.\" But as I learned from Jeff Bezos, by the way, I'm going to disagree and commit. That was one of those early lessons he gave us that was absolutely crucial and perhaps even instrumental in ensuring that Jason and I have been working together for a quarter of a century. Disagree and commit is one of the all-time Jeff Bezos greats.\n\nI'm just surprised that Yokoono hasn't come along. You know what I mean? Like there there's there's so many yokos in this world. It might have happened if not in part because we don't sit on each other's lap all the time. Most of our careers we haven't even lived in the same city. Like I lived in Chicago for a couple of years while we were getting going after I'd moved to the US in 2005. But then I moved to Malibu and then I lived in Spain and then I lived in Copenhagen and Jason Ry from the foundation of our relationship learned how to work together in a remarkably efficient way where we didn't have to actually talk that much on any given week. I'd be surprised if Jason and I spent more than 2 hours of direct exchange and communication.\n\nYeah. Sometimes it's the the basic human frictions that just up against another person, that person damn well better be your spouse if it's too much for too long.\n\nYeah. But even there co co has really test the relationship. It's fascinating to watch.\n\nIt has and I do think that having some separation which is kind of counterintuitive because I think a lot of people think the more collaboration you can have the better. The more ideas they can bounce back and forth the better. And both Jason and I for whatever reason came to the conclusion early on in careers absolutely not. That's complete baloney. This is why we were huge proponents of remote work. This is why I enjoy working in my home office where I can close the door and not see another human for like 6 hours at the time. I don't want to bounce ideas off you all the time. I want to bounce ideas off you occasionally and then I want to go off and implement those ideas. There's way too much bouncing going on and not enough scoring, not enough dunking. And I think this is one of the great traps of executive rule. Once a founder elevates themselves all the way up to an executive where what they're doing is just telling other people what to do. That's the realm they live in 24/7. They just live in the idea realm. \"Oh, I can just tell more people more things what to do and we can just see it happen.\" If you actually have to be part of implementing that, you slow your horse. You think like, \"You know what, I had a good idea last week. I I'm going to save the rest of my good ideas until next month.\" And there is a temptation for the managers and for the exe for the people in the executive layer to do to do do something which that something usually means a meeting.\n\nYes.\n\nRight. And so that's why you say their job is telling other people what to do.\n\nYeah. And the meeting So this is one of the big things you're against is meetings are toxic.\n\nYeah. And this really I think ties into this with Jason Ry. If I had to count out the total number of meetings we've had in 24 years of collaborations where we in person sat in front of each other and discussed a topic, I probably it'd be less than whatever 3 months at a fan company. We just haven't done that that much and we haven't worn it out. One of this funny metaphors that Trump came up with at one point was a human has like a limited number of steps in their life, right? Like that's the longevity argument here. You can do you can do so much activity and then you run out. There's some kernel in that idea that can be applied to a relationship. There's some amount of exchange we can have. There's some amount of time we can spend together where you can wear it out. Jason and I were diligent about not wearing each other out. And I think that is absolutely key to the longevity of the relationship combined with that level of trust. And then just combining with the level that we really like the work itself. We don't just like the brainstorming, the the says where we just come up with good ideas. No, we like to do the ideas and we like to be part of that process directly ourselves. I like to program. He likes to do design. We could go off and do our little things for long stretches of time. Occasionally, come together and go like, \"Hey, let's launch a great product.\" This might sound like I'm asking you to do therapy.\n\nBut I find myself to sometimes want or long for a meeting because I'm lonely. Like cuz it remote work, just sitting by yourself, I don't know. It can get really lonely for long stretches of time.\n\nLet me give you a tip.\n\nUhhuh.\n\nGet a wife.\n\nGod damn it.\n\nGet get a couple kids.\n\nAll right.\n\nLike family really is the great antidote to loneliness. And I mean that as sincerely as I can possibly say it. I certainly had exactly that feeling you described earlier in my career when I was working remotely and I was just like me living in an apartment. A total stereotype where for the longest time when I first moved to Chicago, all I had on the floor was a mattress and then I bought this big TV and I didn't even mount it and then I had a stack of DVDs and I was basically I was working a lot of time and then I would just go home and I'd do that and it wasn't great. It really wasn't like I do think that humans need humans and if you can't get them at work and I actually sort of kind of don't want them at work at least I don't want them for 40 hours a week that's not what I prefer. You need something else. You need other relationships in your life and there is no greater depth of relationship if you can find someone that you actually just want to spend a lot of time with. That's key to it. And I think it's key for both Jason and I that we've had families for quite a long time. And it grounds you too in a way where the sprint of a startup can get traded in for the marathon of an enduring company and you get settled in a way. We talked briefly about sometimes I get fired up. I mean, a lot of times, maybe even most of the times, I get fired up about topics, but I don't get fired up in the same way now as I used to when I was 24. I'm still extremely passionate about ideas and trying to find the right things. But having a family, meeting my wife, building a life around that has just mellowed everything out in a completely cliche way. But it I think it's actually key. I think if we could get more even younger people not to wait until they were in their late goddamn 30s or early 40s to hitch up with someone, we'd be better off and we'd have more stable business relationships as well because folks would get that nurturing human relation somewhere else. Now, when I say all of that, I also accept that there are plenty of great businesses that's been built over the years that have not been built remote, that have been built by a gang of hooligans sitting in an office for immense hours of time. I mean, both John Carmarmac and Tim Sweeney talked about that in the '9s with their careers that that was just basically work, sleep, hang out with the guys at the office, right? Totally fair. That never appealed to me. Both Jason and I saw eye to eye on the idea that 40 hours a week dedicated to work was enough. That if we were going to go to distance for not just the 5 to seven years it takes to build a VC case up to an exit but for potentially 10 years, 20 years or further. We needed to become whole humans because the only that whole humanness was going to go to distance which included building up friendships outside of work, having hobbies, finding a mate and having a family. And that entire existence, those legs of the stool, that work is not the only thing in life is completely related to the fact that we've been around for 25 years. There's way too much, especially in America, of false trade-offs. \"Oh, you want to build a successful business? Well, you can either have uh money, enjoyment, family, or health. Pick one.\"\n\nWhat? Why do we have to give up all of this? Now again, I'm not saying that there aren't moments payers in life where you can sprint, but I am saying if that sprint turns into a decade, you're going to pay for it. And you're going to pay for it in ways I've seen time and again seemed like a very bad trade that even if it works, and by the way, most of the time it does not. Most of the time startups go bust. Most of the time people spend five, seven years or something that does not pan out and they don't get the payout and then they just sit with regret of like what the fuck happened to my 20s.\n\nEarly on, Jason and I basically made the pact that working together was not going to lead to that kind of regret that we were going to allow ourselves and each other to build a whole life outside of work. And the fact that that worked is something I feel is almost like forbidden knowledge. Certainly in technology circles in the US, it's something that we've tried to champion for 20 years and we still get slacked for. Just two days ago, I had another Twitter beef with someone saying like, \"Oh, well, okay, maybe it worked, but you didn't turn into Atlassian, so you're a failure. You base camp isn't Jira, so why are you even bothering?\" And it's such a fascinating winner takes all mentality that unless you dominate everyone else in all the ways, you've lost when so much of life is far more open to multiple winners. Where we can end up with a business that have made hundreds of millions of dollars over the years and we've kept much of that to do whatever we want. And that that's enough. That's good. That's great. that's actually something worth aspiring to. Certainly, it should be a path for someone to consider choosing rather than the VC unicorn and bust mentality that dominates everything.\n\nYeah. I'd love to ask you about this exchange so you can explain to me the whole saga. But so just to link on that a little bit is I think there's a notion that success for a tech founder is like work for a few years all out and then uh exit sort of sell your company for I don't know hundreds of millions of dollars that's success when it seems in reality when you look at who the people like you like really smart creative humans who they actually are and what happiness entails. It actually entails working your whole life a little bit. Just like cuz you actually love the programming, you love the building, you love the designer, and you don't want to exit. And that's something you've talked about really uh really eloquently about. So like you actually want to create a life where you're always doing the building and doing it in a way that's not completely taken over your life.\n\nMojito Island is a mirage. It always was. There is no retirement for ambitious people. There is no just sitting back on the beach and sipping a mojito for what? For two weeks before you go damn crazy and want to get back into the action. That's exactly what happens to most people who have the capacity to build those kinds of exits. I've never seen I shouldn't say never. I've almost never seen anyone be able to pull that off. Yet so many think that that's why they're doing it. That's why they're sacrificing everything. Because once I get to the finish line, I'm golden. I've won. I can retire. I can sit back. I can just relax. And you find out that that kind of relaxation is actually hell.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's hell for creative people to squander their god-given creative juices and capacities.\n\nAnd I was really lucky to read the book Flow by Mihi Chicken Mihayi early on.\n\nNice. the pronunciations.\n\nYou know what? I had to practice that with AI over the last few days because I knew I was gonna cite him and I butchered his name several times. So, AI taught me how to pronounce that um at least somewhat correctly. But his main work over his career was essentially the concept of flow that came out of a search for understanding happiness. Why are some people happy? When are they happy? And what he learned was quite illuminating. He learned that people aren't happy when they\n\n\nThey're not happy when they're free of all obligations and responsibilities. No, they're happy in these moments where they're reaching and stretching their capacities just beyond what they can currently do. In those moments of flow, they can forget time and space. They can sit in front of the keyboard, program a hard problem, think 20 minutes have passed, and suddenly it's been three hours. They look back upon those moments with the greatest amount of joy. And that is what peak happiness is. If you take away the pursuit of those kinds of problems, if you eliminate all the problems from your plate, you're going to get depressed. You're are not going to have a good time. Now, there are people who can do that, but they're not the same kind of people who built these kinds of companies. So, you have to accept the kind of individual you are. If you are on this path, don't bullshit yourself. Don't bullshit yourself into thinking, I'm just going to sacrifice everything, my health, my family, my hobbies, my friends, but in 10 years I'm going to make it all up because in 10 years I can do it. It never works out like that. It doesn't even It doesn't work out on both ends of it. It does not work out if you're successful and you sell your company because you'll get bored out of your mind after two weeks on retirement. It doesn't work out if the company is a failure and you regret the last 10 years spent for nothing. It doesn't work out if it all works and you stay in the business because it never gets any easier. So, you're going to fail on all metrics if you just go there's only work and nothing else. And I didn't want that. I wanted the happiness of flow. I understood that insight was true, but I wanted to do it in a way where I could sustain the journey for 40 or 50 years. And uh there's another other interesting caveat that I've heard you say is that if you do exit, you sell your company and you want to stay in, you want to do another company, that's going to usually not be as fulfilling.\n\nYes.\n\nCuz really your first baby like you can't do it again or most people can't do it again. A because their second idea is not going to be as good as the first one. It is so rare to capture lightning in the bottle like we have for example with Basecamp. I know this from experience because I've been trying to build a lot of other businesses since and some of them have been moderate successes, even good successes. None of them have been Basecamp. It's really difficult to do that twice. But founders are arrogant pricks, including myself. And we like to think that, do you know what? We succeeded in large part because we're just awesome. We're just so much better than everyone else. And in some ways, that's true some of the time. But you can also be really good at something that matters for a hot moment that that door is open, the door closes. Now you're still good at the thing, but it doesn't matter. No one cares.\n\nThere's that part of it. And then there's the part of it that going back to experience things for the first time only happens the first time. You can't do it again. I don't know if I have it in me to go through the bullshit of the early days again. And I say bullshit in the sense of the most endearing sense. It's all great to do it. I know too much. This is one of the reasons why whenever I'm asked the questions, if you could tell your younger self um something that would really What would you say to your younger self? I would fucking not say a thing. I would not rob my younger self of all the life experiences that I've been blessed with due to the ignorance of how the world works. Building up the wisdom about how the world works is a joy. And you got to build it one brick at a time. If you just handed all the results, it's like, \"Oh, should we watch your movie?\" Here's how it ends. I don't want to f watch the movie now. You You spoiled it. I don't want you to spoil my business experience. I don't want to spoil any of my ignorance. The greatest blessing half the time when you're starting something new is a you don't know how hard it's going to be. B, you don't know what you don't know. Like the adventure is the payoff. The responsibility is the payoff. This is something Jordan Peterson has really taught me to articulate this notion that responsibility is actually key to meaning. Um, man's search for meaning. Victor Frankle talks about this as well that we can endure any hardship if there is a reason why. Now he talked about it in truly lifealtering concentration camp ways but you can also apply it at a smaller scale with less criticality of even just your daily life that all that hardship in building the original business that is responsibility you take upon yourself the appeal the reason you take that on you is in part because you don't know fully what it entails if you had known up front if id known up front how hard it would be how much frustration there'd be along the way if you told me that in a narrative before I got started, I would have been like, \"Ah, maybe I should just go get a job.\"\n\nYou said so many smart things there just to pick one. It It's funny that sometimes the advice givers, the wisdom givers are have gone through all the bullshit. And so there is a degree to which you want to make the mistake. So I think I think I would still give the advice of you want to have a stretch of your life where you work too hard including at a thing that fails. I don't think you can learn the lessons why that's a bad idea in any other way except by doing it. There is a degree but of course you don't I think you should stretch. Should you have to stretch for a decade? I'm not so sure.\n\nYeah. The decade thing is 20s is a special time. It's a lot to trade. You don't get your 20s back. You don't get your 30s back, you don't get your 40s back. You really I would have regretted personally if I hadn't done the other things I did in my 20s. If I hadn't had the fun I had, if I hadn't have the friends I had, if I hadn't built up the hobbies that I did, if I hadn't started driving race cars at an early enough age to actually get really good at it. If I had just gone all in on business because I would have got the same out in the end. This is something Derek Civers really taught me is he has this great essay about how when he went for a bike ride, he could go really hard all out and he could do the ride I think in whatever 19 minutes or he could enjoy the ride, go 5% slower, do the ride in 21 minutes and realize there's only two minutes apart. Either I go all in all the time, there's nothing else. I'm completely exhausted at the out end or I travel the same distance and I arrive maybe 2 minutes later but I got to enjoy the scenery, listen to the birds, smell the flowers. That journey is also valuable. Now I say that while accepting and celebrating that if you want to be the best at one thing in the world, no, you have to sacrifice everything. You have to be obsessed with just that thing. There is no instant of someone who's the best in the world at something who's not completely obsessed at. I didn't need the best at anything. This was a a blessing of a rare blessing of humility I had early on is like, you know what, I am not that smart. I'm not that good. I'm not that talented. I can do interesting things by combining different aspects and elements that I know, but I'm not going to be the best at anything. And that released me from this singular obsession which is going like I'm gonna be the best programmer in the world. I know I'm not. I fucking failed at it twice before I even got how conditionals worked. I'm not smart enough to be the best at anything. I'm not dedicated enough to do that. That's a bit of a blessing. And I think as a society we have to straddle both celebrating peak excellence which we do all the time and celebrating the peak intensity of mission it takes to become that and then also going like you know what we don't all need to be Michael Jordan. There's only going to be one of those.\n\nWell we should say that there's certain pursuits where a singular obsession is required. Basketball is one of them. by the way, probably racing. If you want to be the best at F1 in the world, if you want to be Senna, you got to be a maniac.\n\nBut I would argue that there's most disciplines like programming allows if you want to be quote unquote the best, whatever that means. I think that's judged at the end of your life. And usually if you look at that path, it's going to be a nonlinear one. It you're not going to look like the life of an Olympic athlete who singular focus. You're going to there's going to be some acid there in the 20s or there's going to be a det several detours which the true greats there's going to be detours and sometimes they're not going to be Steve Jobs asset type of situation. They'll be just different companies you worked for, different careers or different uh sort of efforts you allocated your life to. But it's going to be nonlinear. It's not it's not going to be a singular focus.\n\nThe way I think about this sometimes is I want a good bargain on learning. I can become in the top 5% of whatever I defined as good at something much much easier. Perhaps it's 20 times easier, 100 times easier to get into the top 5% than it is to get into the top 0.1%. That's almost impossibly hard to get into that. But if I'm content just being in the top 5%, I can be in the top 5% on like five things at once. I can get really good at writing. I can get decent at driving a race car. I can become pretty good at programming. I can run a company. I can have a family. I can do a lot of things at the same time. That gives me sort of that variety that almost um idealized K Marx has this idea. Oh, I'm going to fish in the morning and uh hammer in the evening and paint on the weekends, right? That there's a sense for me at least where his diagnosis of alienation was true. That just that tunnel vision, there's just this one thing I'm just going to focus on that gives me a sense of alienation I can't stomach. When I'm really deep on programming and sometimes I go deep for for weeks, maybe even in a few cases months, I have to come up for air and I have to go do something else. like, \"All right, that was programming for this year. I've done my part. I'm going to go off riding or annoy people on the internet or drive some race cars or do something else and then I can do the programming thing with full intensity again next year.\"\n\nSpeaking of of annoying people on the internet, you got to explain to me this drama. Okay, so what is this guy that said, \"Imagine losing to Jira, but boasting that you have a couple million dollars per year.\" So, this had to do with this almost now a meme decision to leave the cloud. DHH left the cloud. I think that's literally a meme, but it's also a fascinating decision. Can you talk to the full saga of DHH leaves the cloud?\n\nYes.\n\nLeaving AWS um saving money. And I guess the case this person is making no is that we wasted our time optimizing a business that could have been 100 times bigger if we' just gone for the moon and and for the moon includes venture capital other things includes not caring about cost but also because AGI's around the corner you should have been investing into AI right is this just part of sort of tangent I think it's a bit of a muddy argument but if we just take it at its peak ideal which I actually think is a reasonable point is that you can get myopically focused on counting pennies when you should be focused on getting pounds, right? That I've optimized our spend on infrastructure by getting out of the cloud and that took some time and I could have taken that time and spent it on making more features that would have attracted more customers or spend even more time with AI or done other thing. Opportunity cost is real. I'm not denying that. I'm pushing back on the idea that for a company of our size, saving $2 million a year on our infrastructure bill, which is about somewhere between half to 2/3, goes directly to the bottom line, which means it's returned to Jason and I as owners and our employees part of our uh profit sharing plan. It's totally worth doing. This idea that costs don't matter is a very Silicon Valley way of thinking that I again understand at the scale of something maybe but I also actually think it's it's aesthetically unpleasing. I find an inefficient business as I find an inefficient program full of line noise to just be a splinter in my brain. I hate looking at an expense report and just seeing disproportionate waste. And when I was looking at our spend at 37 Signals a while back a few years back, I saw bills that did not pass my smell test. I remembered how much we used to spend on infrastructure before the cloud and I saw numbers I could not recognize in proportion to what we needed. The fact that computers have gotten so much faster over time. Shouldn't things be getting cheaper? Why are we spending more and more money servicing more customers? Yes, but with much faster computers. Moore's law should be lowering the cost. And the opposite is happening. Why is that happening? And that started a journey of unwinding why the cloud isn't as great as the deal as people like to think that.\n\nYeah. Can we look at the specifics just to for people who don't know the story and then generalize to what it means about the the the role of the cloud in in a tech business. So the specifics is you were using AWSS3 for we were using AWS for everything. Hey.com launched as an entirely cloud app. It was completely on AWS for compute for databases for all of it. We're using all the systems as they're best prescribed that we should. Our total cloud bill for Basecam. Our total spend with AWS was I think 3.2 million or 3.4 million at its peak. That's kind of a lot of money. 3.4 million. I mean, we have a ton of users and customers. But still, that just struck me as unreasonable. And the reason why I was so unreasonable was because I had the pitch for the cloud ringing in my ears. Hey, this is going to be faster. This is going to be easier. This is going to be cheaper. Why are you trying to produce your own power\n\n\nLike, do you have your own power plant?\nWhy would you do that?\nLeave the computers to the hyperscalers.\nThey're much better at it anyway.\nI actually thought that was a compelling pitch.\nI bought in on that pitch for several years and thought, do you know what?\nI'm done ever owning a server again.\nWe're just going to render our capacity and Amazon is going to be able to offer us services much cheaper than we could buy them themselves because they're going to have these economies of scale.\nAnd I was thinking Jeff's word ringing, uh, my competitor's margin is my opportunity.\nThat was something he used to drive Amazon.com with, that if he could just make 2% when the other guy was trying to make 4%, he would end up with all the money, and on volume, he would still win.\nSo I thought that was the operating ethos for AWS.\nIt turns out that's not true at all.\nAWS, by the way, operates at almost 40% margin.\nSo just in that, there's a clue that, uh, competitors are not able to do the competitive thing we like about, uh, capitalism, which is to lower costs and so forth.\nSo the cloud pitch, in my optics, are fun, is fundamentally false.\nIt did not get easier.\nFirst of all, I don't know if you've used AWS recently.\nIt is hella complicated.\nIf you think Linux is hard, you've never tried to set up AM rules or access parameters or whatever for AWS.\nYeah, AWS was always difficult.\nIt was always clunk.\nWell, I think it's gotten even more difficult.\nBut yes, now some of that is, it's difficult because it's very capable, and you have a bunch of capacity on tap.\nAnd there are reasons.\nI don't think they're good enough to justify how complicated the whole jing and majing has become.\nBut what's certainly true is that it's no longer easier, is not easier to use AWS than it is to run your own machines, which we learned when we pulled out of the cloud and didn't hire a single extra person.\nEven though we operate all our own hardware, the team stayed exactly the same.\nSo, you have this three-way pitch, right?\nIt's going to be easier.\nIt's going to be cheaper.\nCertainly wasn't cheaper.\nWe've just proved that by cutting our spend on infrastructure by half to 2/3.\nAnd it's going to be faster.\nThe last bit was true, but way too many people overestimated the value of that speed.\nIf you need a thousand computers online in the next 15 minutes, nothing beats the cloud.\nHow would you even procure that?\nIf we just need another 20 servers, it's going to take a week or two to get boxes shipped on pallets delivered to a data center and unwrapped and racked and all that stuff, right?\nBut how often do we need to do that?\nAnd how often do we need to do that if buying those servers is way, way cheaper such that we get vastly more compute for the same amount of money?\nCould we just buy more servers and not even care about the fact that we're not hyper optimized on the compute utility that we don't have to use things like, uh, automatic scaling to figure things out because we have to reduce cost?\nYes, we can.\nSo we went through this journey over a realization in early 2023 when I had finally had enough with our bills.\nI wanted to get rid of them.\nI wanted to spend less money.\nI wanted to keep more of the money ourselves.\nAnd in just over 6 months, we moved seven major applications out of the cloud in terms of compute, caching, databases, the works onto our own servers.\nA glorious, beautiful new fleet bought from the king of servers, Michael Dell, who really, by the way, is another icon of my.\nI saw he just celebrated 41 years in business.\n41 years this man has been selling awesome servers that we've been using for our entire existence.\nBut anyway, these pallets arrive in, uh, a couple of weeks, and we rack them up and get everything going, and we were, we were out at least with the computer part.\nWe then had a long, uh, multi-year commitment to S3 because the only way to get decent pricing in the cloud, by the way, is not to buy on a day-to-day basis, not to rent on a database basis, but to bind yourself up to multi-year contracts.\nWith compute, it's often a year that was in our case.\nAnd with storage was four years.\nWe signed a 4-year contract to store our petabytes of customer files in the cloud to be able to get something just halfway decent, affordable.\nSo, all of these projects came together to the sense that we're now saving literally millions of dollars, projected about 10 million over 5 years.\nIt's always hard.\nHow do you do the accounting exactly?\nAnd to this, that and the other thing, but it's millions of dollars.\nBut it's not just that.\nIt's also the fact that getting out of the cloud meant returning to more of an original idea of the internet that the internet was not designed such that three computers should run everything.\nIt was a distributed network such that the individual nodes could disappear and the whole thing would still carry on.\nDARPA designed this such that the Russians could take out Washington and they could still fight back from New York.\nThat the entire communication infrastructure wouldn't disappear because there was no hub and spoke.\nIt was a network.\nI always found that an immensely beautiful vision that you could have this glorious internet and no single node was in control of everything.\nAnd we've returned to much more of a single node controlling everything idea with these hyperscalers.\nWhen US East one, the main and original region for AWS goes offline, which has happened more than a few times over the years, seemingly a third of the internet is offline.\nLike that in itself is just an insult to DARPA's design.\nI, it doesn't detract from the fact that what AWS built was marvelous.\nI think the cloud has moved so many things so far forward, especially around virtualization, automation, setup.\nIt's all those giant leaps forward for system administration that's allowing us now to be able to run things on prem in a way that smells and feels much like the cloud just at half the cost or less and with the autonomy and the satisfaction of owning hardware.\nI don't know what the last time you looked at like an actual server and took it apart and looked inside of these things are gorgeous.\nI mean, I posted a couple of pictures of our racks out in the data center, and people always go crazy for them because we've gotten so abstracted from what the underlying metal looks like in this cloud age that most people have no idea.\nThey have no idea how powerful a modern CPU is.\nThey have no idea how much RAM you can fit into a oneU rack.\nProgress in computing has been really exciting, especially I'd say in the last four to five years after TSMC with Apple's help really pushed the envelope.\nI mean, we kind of sat still there for a while while Intel was spinning their wheels going nowhere, and then TSMC with Apple propelling them really moved things forward, and now servers are exciting again.\nLike you're getting jumps year-over-year in the 15, 20% rather than the single digit we were stuck with for a while.\nAnd that all means that owning your own hardware is a more feasible proposition than it's ever been.\nThat you need fewer machines to run ever more.\nAnd that more people should do it because as much as I love Jeff and Amazon, like he doesn't need another whatever 40% margin on all the tech stuff that I buy to run our business.\nAnd this is just something I've been focused on both because of the ideology around honoring DARPA's original design, the practicality of running our own hardware, seeing how fast we can push things with the latest machines, and then saving the money.\nAnd that has all been so enjoyable to do, but also so counterintuitive for a lot of people because it seemed, I think for a lot of people in the industry that like we'd all decided that we were done buying computers, that that was something we would just delegate to AWS and Azure and Google Cloud, that we didn't have to own these things anymore.\nSo, I think there's a little bit of whiplash for some people that, \"Oh, I thought we agreed.\nWe were done with that.\"\nAnd then along come us and say, \"Yeah, do you know what?\nMaybe you should have a computer.\"\nIs there some pain points to running your own servers?\nOh, plenty.\nThere's pain points to operating computers of all kind.\nHave you tried just like, uh, using a personal computer these days?\nHalf the time when my kids or my wife, uh, have a problem, I go like, \"Have you tried turning it just off and on?\"\nAgain, computers are inherently painful to humans.\nOwning your own computer though kind of makes some of that pain worth it.\nThere's a responsibility that comes with actually owning the hardware that to me at least make the burden of operating that hardware seem slightly more enjoyable.\nNow there are things you have to learn certainly at our scale too.\nI mean, we're not just buying a single computer and plugging into an Ethernet.\nWe have to have racks and racks of them, and you got to set it up with network cabling, and there is some specialized expertise in that.\nBut it's not like that expertise is like building nuclear rockets.\nIt's not like it's not widely distributed.\nLiterally, the entire internet was built on people knowing how to plug in a computer to the internet, right?\nOh, Ethernet cable goes here, power cable goes here.\nLet's boot up Linux.\nThat's how everyone put anything online until 10, 12 years ago when the cloud sort of took over.\nSo, the expertise is there and can be rediscovered.\nYou too can learn how to operate a Linux computer.\nYeah.\nAnd it's, you know, when you get a bunch of them, there's a bunch of flashing LEDs, and it's just so exciting.\nBeautiful, calming, amazing.\nComputers are really fun.\nThis is actually something I've gotten into even deeper after we moved out of the cloud.\nNow, my next kind of tingle is that if you could move out of the cloud, can you also move out of the data center?\nPersonal servers have gotten really scarily quick and efficient.\nAnd personal internet connections rival what we connected data centers with just a decade or two ago.\nSo there's a whole community around this concept of home lapping, which is essentially installing server hardware in your own apartment, connecting it to the internet and exposing that directly to the internet.\nThat harks back to those glorious days of the '90s when people building for the internet would host the actual website on their actual computer in the closet.\nAnd I'm pretty fired up about that.\nI'm doing a bunch of experiments.\nI've ordered a bunch of home servers for my own apartment.\nI marvel at the fact that I can get a 5 gigabit fiber connection now.\nI think, do you know what, 5 GB, that could have taken Basecamp to multiple millions of MR in the way that back then I ran the whole business on a single box with 2004 technology and two probably 100 megabit cable, like the capacity we have access to both in terms of compute and connectivity is something that people haven't readjusted to, and this happens sometimes in technology where progress ever sneaks up on you.\nThis happened with SSDs.\nI love that.\nBy the way, we designed so much of our technology and storage approach and database design around spinning metal discs that had certain seek rate properties.\nAnd then we went to NVME and SSDs.\nAnd it took quite a while for people to realize that the systems had to be built fundamentally different now, that the difference between memory and disk was now far smaller when you weren't spinning these metal plates around with a little head that had to read off them.\nYou were essentially just dealing with another type of memory.\nI think we're a little bit in that same phase when it comes to the capacity of new businesses to be launched literally out of your damn bedroom.\nSo, you can get pretty far with a large user base with home labbing.\nAbsolutely.\nThat's exciting.\nThat's like the old school.\nThat's really exciting.\nIt's bringing back the startup in the garage in the literal physical sense of the word.\nNow, some of that is, do we need to?\nYou can get relatively cheap cloud capacity if you don't need very much.\nHell yes, we need to.\nI mean, the feeling of doing that by yourself, of seeing LED lights, uh, in your own home.\nI mean, there's nothing like that.\nThere's just an aesthetic to it that I am completely in love with and I want to try to push on.\nNow, is that going to be the same thing as getting out of the cloud?\nI'm not sure.\nOur exit out of the cloud was not the exit out of the data center.\nWe basically just bought hardware, shipped it to a professionally managed data center that we didn't even actually touch.\nThis is the other misconception people have about moving out of the cloud that we have a bunch of people who are constantly driving to a data center somewhere to rack new boxes and change dead RAM.\nThat's not how things happen in the modern world at all.\nWe have a company called Summit, previously deaf, that is what we call white gloves.\nThey just, they work in the data center.\nWhen we need something like, hey, hey, deaf, can you, uh, go down and, uh, swap the debt SSD in box number six, they do it.\nAnd what we see is akin to what someone working with the cloud would see.\nYou see IP addresses coming online.\nYou see drives coming online.\nIt's not that different, but it is a whole heck of a lot cheaper when you are operating at our scale.\nAnd of course it is.\nOf course, it's cheaper to own things if you need those things for years rather than it is to rent it.\nIn no other domain would we confuse those two things that it's cheaper to own for the long duration than it is to rent.\nThere is some gray area like I've gotten a chance to interact with the XAI team a bunch.\nI'll probably going back out there in Memphis to do a big podcast associated with the Grock release.\nAnd those folks in order to achieve the speed of building up the, the cluster and to solve some of the novel aspects that have to do with the GPU with the, with the training, they have to be a little bit more hands-on.\nIt's a less white glove.\nOh, and I love that.\nRight.\nThey're dealing with a frontier problem and they're dealing with it not by rending a bunch of GPUs at a huge markup from their main competitor.\nThey're going like, \"No, screw that.\nWe're going to put 100,000 GPUs in our own tents, right, and build it in absolute record time.\"\nSo, I think if anything, this is testament to the idea that owning hardware can give you an advantage both at the small scale, at the medium scale, and at the pioneer levels of computing.\nBy the way, you know, speaking of teams, that those are XAI, Tesla are, um, large companies, but all those folks, I don't know what it is about.\nYou said Jeff is really good at finding good people, at seeing, seeing strength in people.\n\n\nLike Elon is also extremely, I don't know what that is. Actually, I, I've never actually seen, maybe you could speak to that. He's good at finding greatness. I don't think he's finding as much as he's attracting.\nHe's attracting the talent because of the audaciousness of his goals and his mission, the clarity by which he states it. He doesn't have to go scour the earth to find the best people. The best people come to him because he is talking about Elon here. One of the singular most invigorating figures in both the same order of the universe here. Haters and lovers, right? Like he's having such an impact at such a scale that of course he's got to have literally millions of people think he's the worst person in the world. And he's also going to have millions of people thinking he's the greatest gift to humanity depending on the day. I'm somewhere in between, but I'm more on the greatest gift to humanity end of the scale than I'm on the others end of the scale. And I think that really inspires people in a way that we've almost forgotten that that level of audacity is so rare that when we see it, we don't fully know how to analyze it. We think of Elon as finding great talent. And I'm sure he's also good at that. But I also think that this beacon of the mission, we're going to fucking Mars.\nWe're going to transform transportation into using electricity. We're going to cover the earth in internet is so grand that there are days where I wake up and go like, \"What the fuck am I doing with these to-do lists?\"\nLike, Jesus, should I go sign up for something like that?\nThat sounds invigorating in a sense I can only imagine like a Viking back in 1050 going like, \"Should we go to Normandy? You may die along the way, but oh boy does that sound like a journey and an adventure.\"\nThere's a few components there. One definitely this bigger than life mission and really believing it. You know, every other sentence is about Mars. Like really believing it. It doesn't really matter what like anybody else, the criticism, anything, there's a very singular focused big mission. But I think it also has to do a bunch of the other components like being able to hire well once the people once the beacon attracts. And I've just seen people that don't necessarily on paper have a resume with a track record. I've, I've seen really who now turned out to be like legendary people. He basically like tosses them the ball of leadership. Yes. Sees something in them and says like you go and gives them the ownership and they run with it and that that happens at every scale that there's a real meritocracy and like there's something, uh, there's, there's just like you could see the flourishing of human intellect in these meetings in these group getting together where they're like the energy is palpable. It's, it's, it's like exciting for me to just be around that cuz I don't, I there's not many companies I've seen that in because when a company becomes successful and larger, it somehow suffocates that energy that I, I guess you see in startups at the early stages, but like it's cool to see it at a large company that's actually able to achieve scale. You know,\nI think part of the secret there is that Elon actually knows things. And when you know things, you can evaluate the quality of work products. And when you can evaluate the quality of work products, you can very quickly tell who's full of shit and who will actually take you to Mars. And you can fire the people who's full of shit and you can bet on the people who get us to Mars.\nThat capacity to directly evaluate the competency of individuals is actually a little bit rare. It's not widely distributed amongst managers, hiring managers. It's not something you can easily delegate to people who are not very skilled at the work itself. And Elon obviously knows a lot about a lot and he can smell who knows stuff for real. And is this at our tiny scale. Something I've tried to do in the same order where when we hire programmers, for example, it's going to be interesting now with AI as a new challenge. But up until this point, the main pivot point for getting hired was not your resume, was not the schooling you've had, was not your grades, was not your pedigree. It was how well you did on two things. A, your cover letter, because I can only work with people remotely if they're good writers. So if you can't pen a proper capital letter and can't bother to put in the effort to write it specifically for us, you're out. Two, you have to be able to program really well to the degree that I can look at your code and go like, \"Yeah, I want to work with that person.\" Not only I want to work with that person, I want to work on that person's code when I have to see it again in five years to fix some damn bug. So we're going to give you a programming test that simulates the way we work for real and we're going to see how you do. And I've been surprised time and again where I thought for sure this candidate is a shoein. They sound just right. The CV is just right. And then you see the code getting turned in. I'm like, no way. No way are we hiring this person. And the other way has been true as well. I've like I don't know about this guy or this this woman.\nI don't know. And then they turn in their coach stuff and they're like, holy shit, can that person be on my team tomorrow? Preferably the capacity to evaluate work product is a superpower when it comes to hiring.\nThere's a step that I've seen Elon do really well which is be able to show up and say this can be done simpler.\nYes.\nAnd but he knows what he's talking about and then the the engineer because Elon knows enough the engineer who first reaction you can kind of tell like it's almost like rolling your eyes if your parent tells you something.\nYes. This, this is not, no, we've, I've been working on this for a month, you don't know, but then when you have that conversation a little more, you realize no, it can be done simpler, find the way. So there's a good, when two engineers are talking, one might not have perfect information, but if, if, if the senior engineer has like good instinct that's like been battle earned, then you can say simplify and it, it, it actually will result in simplification and I think this is the hallmark of the true greats that they not only have the insight into what's required to do the work, but they also have the transcendent vision to go beyond what the engineer would do, the programmer would do. I think if we're looking at these rarities, obviously the myth of Steve Jobs was also this, even though perhaps he was less technical than Elon is in many ways. He had the same capacity to show up to a product team and really challenge them to look harder for the simplification or for making things greater in a way that would garner disbelief from the people who are supposed to do it. Like this guy is full of shit. Like this is crazy. We can never and then two months later it is.\nSo there is something of this where you need, you need the vision. You need it anchored by the reality of knowing enough about what's possible, knowing enough about physics, knowing enough about software that you're not just building bullshit. There are plenty of people who can tell a group of engineers, \"No, just do it faster.\"\nLike, that's not a skill. It's got to be anchored in something real. But it's also got to be anchored in, it's a tired word, but a passion for the outcome to a degree where you get personally insulted if a bad job is done. This is what I've been writing about lately with Apple. They've lost that asshole who would show up and tell engineers that what they did was not good enough in ways that would actually perhaps make them feel a little small in the moment, but would spark that zest to really fix it. And now they have a logistics person who's very good at sourcing components and lining up production Gant charts, but you're not getting that magic. Now, what's interesting with that whole scenario was I actually thought how well Tim Cook ran things and has run things at Apple for so long that maybe we were wrong. Maybe we were wrong about the criticality of Steve Jobs to the whole mission. Maybe you could get away with not having it. I think the bill was just going to come later and now it has.\nApple is failing in all these ways that someone who would blow up Steve's ghost and really exalt him would say like see this is what's happening now. So the other thing here too, of course, is it's impossible to divorce like your perception of what's a critical component of the system and the messy reality of a million different moving parts in the reality of life and you should be skeptical about your own analysis and your own thesis at all time. Since you mentioned Apple, have to ask. Uh, somebody in the internet, uh, submitted the question.\nUh, does DHH still hate Apple? I believe the question is, um, so there was a time when Basecamp went to war with Apple over the 30%. What's, can you tell the saga of that battle?\nYes. But first, I'll tell you how I fell in love with Apple, which was all the way back in also early 2000s when Microsoft was dominating the industry in a way we now see Apple and Google dominate mobile phones. Microsoft was just everything when it came to personal computers. And I really did not like the Microsoft of the '90s. The Microsoft of the '90s was the cut off the air supply to Netscape kind of characters. was the Bill Gates sitting defiant in an interview with the DOJ asking about what the definition of what is and just overall unpleasant. I think you can have respect for what was achieved, but I certainly didn't like it. And as we've talked about, I came begrudgingly to the PC after Commodore fell apart and I couldn't continue to use the AmIGGA. So, I already had a bit of a bone to pick with PCs just over the fact that I love my Amigga so much. But then in the early 2000s, Apple emerged as a credible alternative because they bet the new generation of Macs on Unix underpinnings and that allowed me to escape from Microsoft and suddenly I became one of the biggest boosters of Apple. I was in my graduating class at the Copenhagen Business School. I started with the first white iBook, first person using Mac. And by the time we were done and graduating, I had basically converted half the class to using Apple computers because I would evangelize them so hard and demonstrate them and do all the things that a super fan would do. And I continued that work over many years.\nJason or I actually in, I think 2004, 2005 did an ad for Apple that they posted on the developer site where we were all about like Apple is so integral to everything that we do and we look up to them and we are inspired by them and that love relationship actually continued for a very long time. I basically just became a Mac person for 20 years. I didn't even care about looking at PCs. It seemed irrelevant to me whatever Microsoft was doing which felt like such a relief because in the 90s I felt like I couldn't escape Microsoft and suddenly I had found my escape and now I was with Apple and it was glorious and they shared so many of my sensibilities and my aesthetics and they kept pushing the envelope and there was so much to be proud of, so much to look up to and then that sort of started to change with the iPhone, which is weird because the iPhone is what made modern Apple.\nIt's what I lined up in 2007 together with Jason for 5 hours to stand in the line to buy a first generation product where Apple staff would clap at you when you walked out of the store. I don't know if you remember that. It was, it was a whole ceremony and it was part of that myth and mystique and awe of Apple. So, I just, I wasn't in the market for other computers. I wasn't in the market for other computer ideas. I thought perhaps I'd be with the Mac until the end of days. But as Apple discovered the gold mine it is to operate a toll booth where you don't have to innovate, where you don't actually even have to make anything, where you can just take 30% of other people's business. There was a rot that crept in to the foundation of Apple and that started all the way back from the initial launch of the app store. But I don't think we saw at the time, I didn't see at the time, just how critical the mobile phone would become to computing in general. I thought when the iPhone came out that like, oh, it's like a mobile phone. I've had a mobile phone since the early '90s. Well, it wasn't a mobile phone. It was a mobile computer. And even more than that, it was the most important computer or it would become the most important computer for most people around the world, which meant that if you like to make software and wanted to sell it to people, you had to go through that computer. And if going through that computer meant going through Apple's toll booth and not just having to ask them permission, which in and of itself was just an indignity when you're used to the internet where you don't have to ask anyone permission about anything. You buy a domain and you launch a business and if customers show up, boom, you're success. And if they don't, well, you're a failure. Now, suddenly, before you could even launch, you'd have to ask Apple for permission. That always sat wrong with me. But it wasn't until we launched Hey in 2001 that I saw the full extent of the rot that has snug into Apple's apple.\nFor people who don't know, and we'll talk about it, Hey is this amazing email sort of attempt to solve the email problem.\nYes. I like to pitch it as what Gmail would have been with 20 years of lessons applied in a way where they could actually ship. Gmail was incredible when it launched in 2004. And it still is a great product, but it's also trapped in its initial success. You can't redesign Gmail today. It just has way too many users. So, if you want fresh thinking on email, I wanted fresh thinking on email. I needed to build my own email system and not just my own email client. That's what a lot of people have done over the years. They build a client for Gmail, but you're severely constrained if you don't control the email server as well. If you really want to move the ball forward with email, you have to control both the server and the client. And that was the audacious mission we set out to do with Hey. And that was what's funny. I thought our main obstacle here would be Gmail. It's the 800 pound gorilla in the email space. something like 70% of all email in the US is sent through Gmail.\nI think their world rates are probably in that neighborhood as well. They're just absolutely huge and trying to attack an enormous established competitor like that who's so actually still loved by plenty of people and is free seems like a suicide mission. And it was\n\n\nOnly a mission we signed up for because we had grown ambitious enough after making Basecamp for 20 years that we thought we could tackle that problem. So I thought, hey, this is dumb. I would not advise anyone to go head-to-head with Gmail. That seems like a suicide mission. We're going to try anyway because you know what? If we fail, it's going to be fine. We're just going to build a better email experience for me and Jason and the people at the company and our cat, and that'll be okay because we can afford to do so. But when we got ready to launch after spending two years building this product, millions of dollars in investment to it, we obviously needed mobile apps. You're not going to be a serious contender with email if you're not on a mobile phone, and you need to be there with a native client. So, we had built a great native client for both iOS and for Android. And as we were getting ready to launch, we submitted both of them to the app stores, got both of them approved on, I think Friday afternoon for the iOS app. And we then went live on Monday and we were so excited. Hey world, we've been working on this new thing. I'd love for you to check it out. And of course, as with anything, when you launch a new product, there are some bugs. So, we quickly found a few in the iOS client and submitted a new build to Apple. Hey, here's our bug fixes. Can you please update? And that's when all the help broke loose.\n\nNot only were they not going to approve our update, they said, \"Oh, wait a minute. We gave you permission to be in the app store, but I'm sorry. That was a mistake. We see that uh you're not using our in-app payment system, which means that we don't get 30% of your business. You will have to rectify that or you can't be in the app store.\" At first, I thought like, well, it got approved already. We're running on the same model we've run Basecamp on in the app store for a decade. If you're not signing up through the app and we're signing up our own customers on our own website and they're just going to the app store to download their companion app, we're going to be fine. That was the truth, right? That was why I never got so fired up about the app store even as Apple started tightening the screws was like my business was okay. Now suddenly my business wasn't okay. Apple was willing to destroy HEY if we did not agree to give them 30% of all the signups that came through the iOS app. And it wasn't just about the 30%. It was also about splitting and not longer having a direct relationship with our customers. When you sell an app in the app store, you're not selling an app to a customer. You're selling an app to inventory at Apple and then Apple sells an app to that customer. That customer has a purchasing relationship with Apple. So if you want to give discounts or refunds or whatever, it's complete hell. If you want to easily support multiplatform, that's complete hell. If someone signs up for HEY on their iPhone and they want to switch to Android, but that billing relationship, it's tied to Apple, it's complete hell. For a million reasons, I did not want to hand my business over to Apple. I did not want to hand 30% of our revenue over to Apple. So, we decided to do something that seemingly Apple had never heard before. We said, \"No, we're not going to add the in-app payment. I don't care if you're threatening us. This is not fair. This is not reasonable. Please approve.\" And of course, they didn't. And it escalated. And after a couple of days, we realized, you know what? This isn't a mistake. This isn't going away. We're going to be dead if they go through with this. If we're not going to yield and give them the 30%, they're going to kick us off unless we make such a racket, such noise that they will regret it. And that's exactly what then happened. We were blessed by the fact that we launched HEY one week before the WWDC, their worldwide developer conference where Apple loves to get up on stage and harp on how much they do for developers, how much they love them, and why you should build for their new devices and so on and so forth. And then we also just happen to have a platform on the internet which is very uh convenient when you need to go to war with a $3 trillion company. So I started kicking and screaming and essentially turning it up to 11 in terms of the fight and going public with our denial to be in the app store. And that turned into a prolonged two-battle with Apple that essentially ended in the best possible outcome we could have gotten as David fighting Goliath, which was a bit of a truce. We wouldn't hand 30% over to Apple. They wouldn't kick us out of the app store, but we had to build some bullshit dummy account such that the app did something when you downloaded it. That was a rule that Phil Schiller seemingly made up on the fly when pressed for the fifth time by the media about why we couldn't be in the app store when a million other companion apps could. But we just happened to be able to create so much pain and noise for Apple that it was easier for them to just let us be than to keep on fighting. What do you think about uh Tim Sweeny's victory with Epic over Apple? I think it is incredible and the entire developer ecosystem, not just on iOS, but on Android as well, owe Epic, Tim Sweeney, and Mark Rain an enormous debt of gratitude for taking on the only battle that has ever inflicted a serious wound on Apple in this entire sorted campaign of monopoly enforcement, and that is Epic's fight versus them.\n\nTim recently revealed that it has cost well over $100 million in legal fees to carry on this battle against Apple. We for a hot moment considered suing Apple when they were threatening to kick us out. We shopped the case around with a few law firms and perhaps of course they would tell us you have a good case. I mean they're trying to sell a product here. But they would also tell us it's going to cost a minimum of $10 million and it's going to take 5 to seven years through all the appeals. Now we now learned the actual price tag was 10 times higher, right? Epic spent over hundred million. It would have destroyed us to take on Apple in the legal realm. Only a company like Epic could do it. And only a company run by founders like Tim, like Mark, could risk the business in the way that they did, the audacity they had to provoke the fight in the first place, which I thought was just incredible, and to stick with it for the long term. No board would have signed off on this lawsuit to a professional CEO. No freaking way. So, the fact that they've been able to beat Apple in also the most hilarious way possible, I think is just incredible cuz remember their first victory in the case was actually not much of a victory. There were about 11 counts in the trial. Apple basically won 10 of them and the judge awarded Epic this one little win that Apple couldn't tell them not to link out to the internet to be able to do the payment processing. So they won this one little thing and Apple instead of just taking the 10 out of 11 wins and going fine, you can have your little links but all these other rules stay in place decided to essentially commit criminal contempt of court as they've now been referred to for prosecution um and angered the judge to such a degree that the rule of law in the US now is that you can launch an app in the app store and you don't have to use in-app payment, but you can have a direct billing relationship with a customer if you just link out to the open internet when you take the credit card and then hop back into the app. And we owe all of that to Tim and Mark. We owe all of that to Epic. We're going to launch new apps any minute now. I hope um actually next week that take advantage of this that revamp the HEY app such that people who download the HEY app off the Apple app store can sign up in the app and can then use uh the web to put in their credit card. So we don't have to pay 30%. So we have a direct billing relationship and such that they can take that subscription to Android to PCs whatever without any hassle and we have Tim and Mark to thank for it. Yeah, Tim, I mean the like you said founders but also specific kind of founders because I think maybe you can educate me on this but uh Tim is somebody who maintains to this day sort of the unreasonableness of principles.\n\nYes, that's what I love. I I think sometimes maybe even with founders you can get worn down. It's a large company. There's a lot of smart quote unquote people around you, lawyers and just whisper in your ear over time and you're like well just be reasonable being, you know, this is a different thing and to to be the sort of maintain I mean Steve Jobs did this maintain I'm still the asshole.\n\nYes.\n\nWho says no this whole company I'll sink this whole fucking company over this. That's the exact language basically I used in our original campaign. I will burn this business down before I hand over 30% of it to Apple. And that sort of indignation, that actual rage is something I try to be a little careful about tapping into because it is a little bit of a volatile compound because I mean I have a bunch of employees, we have a bunch of uh customers. It would be pretty sad if the journey of 37signals after 25 years would come to an end because Apple would burn us down or I would burn the business down over this fight with Apple. But I think you also need that level of conviction to be able to even drive the day-to-day decisions. One of the other Apple examples, I know I'm racking on Apple a little bit here, and I don't actually hate them. I really don't. I am tremendously disappointed at the squandered relationship that did not need to be sold away for so little. Now I understand that the app store toll booth is actually pretty big business. It's multiple billions but Apple is a trillion dollar company and I think in the lens of history this is going to come off as a tremendous mistake and I think it's already coming off as a tremendous mistake. The flop that was the Vision Pro was partly because Apple had pissed off every other developer. No one was eager to come build the kind of experiences for their new hardware that would perhaps have made it a success. So when you're on top and you have all the cards, you can delude yourself into thinking that you can dictate all terms at all times and there are no long-term consequences. Apple is learning finally the fact that there are long-term consequences and that developers actually are important to Apple's business and the relationship is not entirely one-sided. We don't owe our existence to Apple and Apple alone. We've built our own customer bases. Apple has been beneficial to the industry. I'm glad the iPhone exists. Uh da da. It's not that it doesn't go both ways, but Apple wants it only one way. And I think that is a mistake. And it's a mistake that was avoidable. And a that's disappointing. Certainly disappointing for me. I've literally spent 20 years evangelizing this shit, right? I've spent so much money buying Apple hardware. Um, excusing a bunch of things they've done over the years and then for what? For the fact that you wanted 30% of something that I created in the most unreasonable way possible. Couldn't we have found a better way to do this? I think they're going to get forced to to do a better way. But did you also have to go through the indignity of having a criminal contempt charge against you, getting referred to prosecution? It just seems so beneath Apple. But it also seems so in line with what happens to huge companies who are run by quote unquote professional managers rather than founders and unreasonable people. Well, we should probably also say that the thing you love about Apple, the great spirit of Apple, I think still persists. And there's a case to be made that this 30% thing is a slice, a particular slice of a company, not a defining aspect of the company. And that it Apple is still on top in the in the hardware that it makes in a lot of things that it makes. Uh and you know this is uh there could be just a hiccup in a long story of a great company that does a lot of awesome stuff for humanity. So like Apple's a truly special company. We met we mentioned Amazon. There is no company like Apple. I agree. This is why the disappointment is all greater because we had such high aspirations and expectations to Apple that they were the shining city on the hill and they were guiding the industry in a million positive ways. I think as we talked about earlier, hardware is exciting again in large part because Apple bought PA Semi and pursued a against all odds mission to get ARM up to the level it is today. And we have these incredible M chips now because of it. And the design sensibilities that Apple bring to the table are unparalleled. No one has taste certainly at the hardware level like Apple does. Even at the software level, I'd say there's a lot of taste left in Apple, but there's also some real sour taste now. So, they have to wash that off first, I think, before they find their way back. But Apple's been in a in a mirage before. I mean, uh, Wasnak and Steve Jobs started this thing in the garage, has great success with the Apple 2. He hands the company over to a sugar drink salesman who tanks the company into the 90s. He doesn't learn the lesson. Spends the next 20 years building up this amazing company. Then hands the company over again to a logistics person who presumably had more redeeming qualities than uh the first guy who put in charge but still ends up leading the company astray. Now this is the norm. The norm is that great companies don't last forever. In the long arc of history, almost no company lasts forever. There are very few companies around that was here 100 years ago, even fewer 200 years ago, and virtually nothing that are a thousand years old outside of a handful of Japanese swords makers or something like that, right? So, you can get deluded into thinking that something is forever when you're in the moment and they seem so large. Apple could absolutely stumble and I think they have more reason to stumble now than ever. They're behind on AI, terribly behind. Their software quality is faltering in a bunch of ways. The competition is catching up on the hardware game in part because TSMC is not an Apple subsidiary, but a foundry that services AMD and Nvidia and others who are now able to use the same kind of advanced processes. This is something I learned after not looking at PC hardware for the longest time that holy smokes, AMD actually makes CPUs that are just as fast, if not faster\n\n\nThey're not quite as efficient yet because ARM has some fundamental efficiencies over x86, but they're still pretty good.\nSo, Apple should have reason to worry.\nApple's shareholders should have reason to be concerned not just about all these stumbles but also by the fact that Apple is run by old people.\nApple's board has an average age of, I think, 75.\nTheir entire executive team is above 60.\nNow that sounds horribly agist, and in some ways it a little bit is, in the same way I'm agist against myself.\nLike, I'm 45 now, and I sort of kind of have to force myself to really get into AI because it is such a paradigm shift, and a lot of people when they reach a certain age are just happy to stay with what they know.\nThey don't want to go back to being a beginner.\nThey don't want to go back to having to relearn everything.\nAnd I think like this is a little hard for me at 45.\nHow the hell do you do that at 75?\nI have to come back to, you mentioned it earlier.\nYou're a parent.\nCan you speak to the impact that becoming a father has had on your life?\nI think what's funny about fatherhood is that, for me, I wasn't even sure it's something I wanted.\nIt took meeting the right woman and letting her convince me that this was the right idea before we even got started.\nI didn't have starting my own family on the list of priorities in my late 20s or even early 30s.\nIt was really the impetus of meeting my wife, Jamie, and her telling me this is what I want.\nI want to have a family.\nI want to get married.\nI want to have kids.\nI want to have three.\nAnd me going for a second like, whoa, whoa, whoa.\nAnd then, all right, let's do it.\nAnd I think that's the kind of happy accident where some parts of my life have been very driven, where I knew exactly what I wanted and how to push forward to it and what the payoff was going to be, but when it comes to having a family, that always felt like a very fuzzy, abstract idea that, sure, someday, maybe.\nAnd then it became very concrete because I met a woman who knew what she wanted.\nAnd looking back on it now, it almost seems crazy, like there's this fork in the road of reality where if that hadn't happened and I had been sitting here now, not being a father, not having a family, the level of regret, knowing what I know now about the joys of having that family, would have been existential, would have been, I don't know if they would have been devastating.\nI think men have a little bit of a longer window to pursue these things than women do.\nThere are just certain biological facts.\nBut ending up with the family I have now, ending up with my three boys, have been just a transformative experience in the sense that here's something that turned out to be the most important thing.\nAnd it was an open secret.\nNot even an open secret.\nIt was an open truth through all of history.\nYou listen to anyone who's ever had children, they will all say, \"My children are the most important to me.\"\nYet somehow that wisdom couldn't sink in until you were in the situation yourself.\nI find those truths fascinating when you can't actually relay them with words.\nI can tell you, \"Hey, Lex, what are you doing?\nGet a wife.\nMake some kids.\nGet a move on it.\"\nAnd these are just words.\nThey're not communicating the gravity of what it actually feels to go through the experience.\nAnd you can't really learn it without going through it.\nNow, of course, you can be influenced and whatever, we can all help contribute and little sparks and little seeds can grow in your mind about it, but it still has to happen.\nAnd now that I am in this situation and just the sheer joy on a daily basis where you think your level of life satisfaction is on a scale of 1 to 10.\nYeah.\nAnd then the satisfaction of seeing your children understand something, accomplish something, learn something, do something, just be, just goes like, \"Oh my god, this scale doesn't go from 1 to 10.\nIt goes from 1 to 100.\"\nAnd I've been playing down here in the 1 to 10 range all this time, and there's a one to 100.\nThat has been humbling in a way that is impactful in and of itself.\nThis whole idea that I thought I had a fair understanding of like the boundaries of life in my early 30s.\nLike what is this about?\nI mean, I've been on this earth long enough now here to know something.\nAnd you don't know.\nI did not know.\nI did not know that the scale was much, uh, much broader.\nAnd I've often talked about the joys of having kids and just seeing your own DNA, which is remarkable to me because literally that's been the pursuit of humans since the dawn of time.\nI am here today because whatever 30,000 years ago, some Neanderthal had the same realization that I should procreate and I should continue my bloodline and that that all amounts to me sitting here now.\nBut it didn't become a practical reality to me before meeting the right woman.\nAnd I think that that's sometimes not part of the conversation enough, that there's something broken at the moment about how people pair up in the Western world.\nYeah.\nAnd it's at the source of why we're not having enough children because there's not enough couples.\nThere's not enough marriage.\nThere's not a lot of these, there's not enough of all these traditional values that even 50, 60, 70 years ago was just taken for granted.\nWe're in this grand experiment of what happens if we just remove a bunch of institutions?\nWhat happens if we no longer value marriage as a something to aspire to?\nWhat happened if parenthood is now seen in some camps as almost something like weird or against your own self-expression?\nIt's a grand experiment that I'm kind of curious how it turns out.\nI'd prefer to watch it as a movie, like The Children of Men, of like that was a good show.\nI kind of wish that wasn't reality, but we're seeing that reality play out while I'm sitting here in a very traditional two-parent loving household with three children and going, um, this is now at the top.\nI've done a lot of things in my life.\nI've built software.\nI've built companies.\nI've raced cars.\nI've done all sorts of things.\nAnd I would trade all of it in a heartbeat for my kids.\nThat's just a really fascinating human experience that the depth of that bond is something you can't appreciate before you have it.\nBut I also think there is a role to play to talk it up because we're being bombarded constantly with reasons why not to.\nOh, it's it's too expensive.\nUm, well, you could get divorced and then you might lose half.\nThere's all these voices constantly articulating the case against marriage, the case against having children that those of us who've chosen to do the traditional thing to get married and to have children have an obligation to kind of talk it up a little bit, which would have seemed ridiculous again 50 years ago that you'd have to talk up something so fundamental at that.\nBut I have become kind of obligated in that sense to do just that.\nTo talk it up, to say, do you know what?\nYou can look at everything that I've done.\nAnd if you like some of those parts, realize that to me in this situation, the kids, the family, the wife is more important than all of it.\nAnd it sounds like a cliche because you've heard it a thousand times before.\nAnd by becoming a cliche, maybe you start believing it's not true, that it's just something people say, but it is reality.\nI know almost no parents that I have personal relationships with that don't consider their children to be the most important thing in their life.\nSo there's a lot of interesting things you said.\nOne, it does seem to be, I know a lot of, uh, parents, perhaps more interestingly, I know a lot of super successful people who are parents who, uh, really love their kids and who, uh, say that the kids even help them to be more successful.\nNow, the interesting thing, speaking to what you're saying, is it does seem for us humans, it's easier to articulate the negatives because they're sort of concrete, pragmatic, you know, it costs more, it takes up time, you know, they can be, you crying all over the place, they're, you know, tiny narcissists running around or whatever, which is all true, by the way, yeah, pooping everywhere, that kind of stuff, uh, but to articulate the thing you were speaking to of, there's, there's this little creature that you love more than anything you've ever loved in your life, it's hard to convert that into words.\nYou have to really experience it.\nAnd but I've, I believe it, and I want to experience it that.\nBut I, I believe it because just from a scientific method, I have seen a lot of people who are not, honestly, not very capable of love, fall completely in love with their kids.\nYes.\nLike, you know, very sort of, um, let's, let's just call it what it is, engineers that are very like, beep boop, b up.\nYes.\nThey just fall in love, and it's like, all right, people who just like you said, they don't really want, they don't really care or don't really think about having kids, that kind of stuff, once they do it, changes everything.\nSo, you know, but it's hard to convert into words.\nOne of the reasons I think it's also difficult is, I mean, I like kids, not that I actively dislike them, but when I was around other people's kids, I didn't have a emotional reaction.\nSome women have, right?\nThey see a baby and they go, I never, never had any emotion of that.\nI mean, I could appreciate, I'm glad for you that you have children.\nIt did not provoke anything in me.\nThe emotions that are provoked in me when I look at my own children, this, this doesn't exist in the same universe.\nSo you don't have something, you don't have a complete parallel, or at least a lot of men, or at least me, I didn't have sort of a framework to put it into, what would it be like to have my own child, and then you experience it, you just, it's like the, and it happens so quickly, too.\nThis is what I found fascinating, it happens before that little human is even able to return any words to you, that the love you develop to an infant happens quite quickly, not necessarily immediately.\nI don't know, different people have different experiences, but it took me a little bit, but then once it hit, it just hit like kick of a horse.\nAnd I love that it's also just such a universal experience that you can be the most successful person in the world, you can be the poorest person in the world, you can be somewhere in the middle, and we share this experience that being a parent for most of them turns out to be the most important thing in their life.\nBut you know, it is really nice to do that kind of experience with the right partner.\nBut I think because I'm such an empath, the cost of having the wrong partner is high for me.\nBut then I also like realized, man, I have a friend of mine who's divorced happily, and he still loves the shit out of his kids, and it's still, it's a mess, but there's still all of that love is still there, and it's, you know, you just have to make it work.\nIt's just that I don't know that kind of like divorce would destroy me.\nYou should listen to, uh, The School of Life.\nHe has this great bit on YouTube, you will marry the wrong person.\nIf you accept upfront that you will marry the wrong person, that every potential person you can marry is going to be the wrong person on some dimension.\nThey're going to annoy you.\nThey're going to be not what you hoped in certain dimensions.\nThe romantic ideal that everything is just perfect all the time is not very conducive to the reality of hitching up and get making babies.\nBecause I think as you just accounted, even when it turns to shit, I find that most of the people I personally know where things have fallen apart and have turned to shit, never in a million years would they go like, I regret it.\nI would rather my children did not exist because a relationship turned sour.\nI mean, I think you should try very hard.\nAnd I think this is also one of those things where we didn't fully understand those fences and when we pulled them up and celebrated how easy it is to get divorced, for example, that that wasn't going to have some negative consequences.\nI'm not saying you shouldn't have divorces.\nI'm not saying return to times past.\nI am saying though that civilization over thousands of years developed certain technologies for ensuring the continuation of its own institutions and its own life that perhaps we didn't fully appreciate.\nI mean, again, this is something Jordan Peterson and others are far more articulate to speak about, and that I've learned a lot to just analyze my own situation.\nWhy is it that this incredible burden it is to be responsible for someone else's life that you brought into this world is also the most rewarding part of existence?\nThat's just curious.\nBefore I heard Peterson articulate the value of taking on the greatest burden you know how to carry, I always thought about burdens as a negative things.\nWhy would I want the burden of a child?\nI might screw it up.\nMight be a bad parent.\nThey might have bad, all right.\nAll the reasons why you shouldn't, and so few voices articulating why you should.\nYeah.\nBut there, I should also add on top of that thing you mentioned, currently, perhaps in the West, the matchmaking process is broken, is broken, and technology made it worse.\nIt's fascinating, this whole thing that that hasn't been solved.\nSo hiring great teams, that's probably been solved the best out of matchmaking.\nFinding great people to hire, right?\nUh, second, finding great friends.\nThat's like, that's also hasn't been solved and it's breaking down.\nIt's breaking down.\nAnd third is matchmaking for like relationships.\nThat's like the worst.\nAnd in fact, technology made it even worse.\nYes.\nIt's fascinating.\nIt is.\nIt's a great example again of how all the greatest intentions still led us straight to hell.\nI really enjoyed Louise Perry's analysis of the sexual revolution not being an unqualified good, which was something I hadn't thought about at all before she articulated it, that of course, uh, women should be able to have freedom until termination and abortions and all of these things.\nAnd Louise Perry is not arguing against that either, of course, but there are second-order effects that we don't appreciate at the time and we may not have readymade solutions for.\nThat's just interesting.\nYou make life better in a million different ways and somehow we end up more miserable.\nWhy is that?\nWhy is it that humans find meaning in hardship?\nAnd I think some of that is that it's a difficult question to answer through science.\nAnd again, Peterson articulates well this idea that you have to find some of it through art, some of it through authors, some of it through different, I was just about to say modes of knowing before I stopped myself because that sounds like woo bullshit.\n\n\nBut there are different ways to acquire those deep lessons that sort of, uh, paper is not going to tell you. I mean, this is really the point, uh, also applies to religion, for example. If you remove from society the software of religion, yes, you better have a good replacement. And we've had a bunch of bad replacements, especially over the last few decades. Religion is one of those things I've struggled with a lot because I'm not religious, but I sort of wish I was. I can now fully appreciate the enormous value having an operating system like that brings, not just at the individual level, but rather at a societal level. And it's not clear at all what the answer is. I think we've tried a lot of dead ends when it came to replacements, and people have been filling that void in a million different ways that seem worse than all the religions, despite their faults in a myriad of ways, have been able to deliver.\nYeah. Religion is like the cobalt code. It's just, yes. It's the institutions where we don't fully understand the rules and why they're there and what's going to happen if we remove them. Some of them seems obvious to me are just bullshit of the time. Oh, you shouldn't eat whatever shellfish because in that region of the world there was something something something. Okay, fine. But there's a bunch of other things that are pivotal to keeping society functioning for the long term, and we don't fully understand which is which. What's the bullshit and what's the loadbearing pillars of society?\nCan you speak to the hit on productivity that kids have? Did they increase your productivity, decrease it, or is that even the wrong question to ask?\nI think it's one of the reasons why ambitious people are often afraid of having children because they think, \"I have so much more to do, and I barely have enough time now. How would I possibly be able to accomplish the things I want to accomplish if I add another human into the mix?\" Now, a, we've always worked 40 hours a week, not 80 or 100 or 120. I think that's very beneficial. B, kids don't exist in this vacuum of just them alone being entered into your life. Hopefully, there's a partner. And in my life, I'm married to a wonderful woman who decided to stop working her corporate job when we got together and have been able to carry a huge part of that responsibility. I was just about to say burden. And I think that's exactly how it often gets presented, especially from a feminist perspective, that caring for your own children is some sort of unpaid labor that has to be compensated for in some specific way beyond the compensation of what? Bringing life into this world, raising wonderful humans. There's something screwy about that analysis that I actually think the modern trad movement is a reply against. Whether they have all the answers, I'm certainly not sure of either. But there's something that's just not right in the analysis that children are a burden and that if a woman chooses to stay at home with the kids that that's some sort of failure mode of feminist ambition. I think that's actually a complete dead end. Now depends on different people, different circumstances. I can just speak to my life being married to a wonderful woman who have decided to be home with the kids at least at their early age and taken on a lot of those responsibilities. Now, it doesn't mean there isn't plenty of ways that I have to be part of that and have to chip in, but it's allowed me to continue to work the 40 hours a week that I've always worked, but it's made the 40 hours more strict. I have a schedule where I wake up whatever 6:30 and we have to get out of the door a little before 8. I usually have to play at least one or two rounds of Fortnite with my youngest, sometimes middle child, then take the kids to school, get in, start work at, I don't know, uh, 8:30, 9, then work until 5, 5:30, sometimes 6:00, but then it's dinner and I have to be there for that and then I have to read to the kids and by the time that's done, I don't want to go back to work. So my work time really is 9 to 5, 9 to 6, depending of whatever is going on. Sometimes there's emergencies and you have to tend to them, but it's made it more structured and I found some some some benefit in that. I found some productivity in that that I can't goof around quite as much that the day will end at around 5:36. That's just if I didn't accomplish what I wanted to do today. If I get to that time, it's done. I'm over. I have to try again tomorrow. Whereas before having a family and before having kids, I could just like not do it and just make it up in the evening.\nSo, in that way, it's made me more structured, but it hasn't really changed my volume of work all that much. I still work about the same amount of hours. And that's, by the way, enough. This is one of the key points we make in It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work, the latest book we wrote, is that there's enough time. 40 hours a week is actually a ton if you don't piss it away. Most people do piss it away. They piss it away in meetings. They piss it away on just stuff that doesn't matter when even 3 hours, 4 hours of concentrated, uninterrupted time every day would move the goals they truly care about way down the field.\nI think kids do make you more productive in that way for people who need it, especially people like me. Uh, they create their urgency, like you have to, if you have to be done by five.\nI, it's a maybe counterintuitive notion, but for people like me who like to work, you can really fill the day, yes, with fluff, yes, of work, and, um, if you have to be done by five, you're going to have to do the deep work and get it done, like really focused, singular work, yes, and then you're just going to cut off.\nIt keeps you honest. It keeps you honest because you can, you can squander one day, you can squander two days, but if I squander a whole week, I feel terrible. Now, that's just some drive I have in me where I feel content and full of meaning if I actually do stuff that matters. If I can look back upon the week and go like, that was that was a nice week. Really, we moved forward. Maybe we didn't get done, but we moved forward. Everything got better. Um, and I think kids really help just time box things in that way. And a lot of people need that because I find just so much of the celebration of overwork to be so tiresome. Oh, I work 60 hours or 80 hours, 100 hours a week. And just like, first of all, no, you don't. No, you don't. Like those 80 hours are full of all sorts of fluff that you label work, but that I would laugh at. And that most people laugh at, that you would laugh at if you actually did the analysis of where's that time going. Most of the important stuff that have to be done is done in these uninterrupted chunks of 2 hours here or four hours there or 5 hours there. The hard part is making sure you get them in the whole piece. Um, so don't give me, don't give me that. There's time enough. And also, what's so important that it ranks above continuing your lineage? I think there's just some ancient honor in the fact that again, this DNA that's sitting on this chair traveled 30,000 years to get here and you're going to squander all that away just so you can send a few more emails. There is something that's also hard to convert into words of just the kind of fun you can have just playing with your kids. I don't know what that on the surface it's like. I could have that kind of fun just playing video games by myself. But no, it's like there's something magical about it, right?\nI have a thousand hours logged in Fortnite since 19, I think, all of it with my kids. I'd never be playing Fortnite. Well, I don't know if I never would be. I wouldn't be playing a thousand hours of Fortnite if it wasn't for my kids. The enjoyment for me is to do something with them that I also happen to enjoy. I really love Fortnite. It's a phenomenal game. I don't have to force myself to play that with them. I often ask like, \"Hey, uh, do you want to play Fortnite?\"\nBut still, it's an activity that I get to share with them. It's a passion that I get to share with them. I've started, uh, doing go-karting with my oldest. I've been driving race cars for a long time and now they're getting into go-karting. And just being at the go-kart track, seeing them go around, seeing them get faster, seeing them learn that skill, you just go look at like what else would I be doing with my life at my age, 45, I'm standing here truly enjoying life I brought into this world. What else is it was so important at this stage that I would otherwise be spending my time on?\nAll right. Like you mentioned, you like to race cars and you do it at a world class competitive level, which is incredible. So, uh, how'd you get into it? What attracts you to racing? What do you love about it?\nThe funny thing about getting into racing is I did not get my driver's license until I was 25. I grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark, where the tax on cars is basically over 200%. So you pay for three cars and you get one. And I didn't even have the money for one car, let alone three. So I could not afford a car growing up. We did not have a car growing up. But Copenhagen is a nice city to be able to get around on a bike or with a bus or as I did for a long period of time on roller blades.\nBut when I was 25, I realized I wanted to spend more time in the US. I wasn't sure yet that I was going to move there. That turned out later to be true, but I knew that if I wanted to spend time in the US, I needed to have a driver's license. I was not going to get around very well if I didn't know how to drive a car. So, I got a driver's license at 25. Then ended up moving to the US later that year. And I'd always been into video games, racing video games. Metropolitan Street Racer on the Dreamcast was one of those games that really sucked me into it was the precursor to Project Gotham, which was the precursor to essentially Forza Horizon, I think.\nOh, okay.\nI think that's what how the lineage goes. Just a great game. I actually just fired it up on an emulator, um, a few weeks ago and still sort of kind of holds up because it has enough real car dynamics that it smells a little bit like driving a real car. It's not just like an arcade racer like Sega Rally or something like that. But I'd always been into that. Then I got my driver's license at 25 and moved to the US. And then two years later, a friend that I'd met in Chicago took me to the Chicago Autobahn Country Club, which is this great track about 45 minutes from Chicago. And I sat in a race car and I drove a race car for the first time. And I had the same kind of pseudo religious experience I did as when I started working on Ruby where I did maybe 20 laps in this basically a Mazda race car from I think like the '90s or something, like a pretty cheap race car, but a real race car. Single seater manual gearbox, but exposed slick wheels, all the stuff. And after having had that experience, first of all, it was just the most amazing thing ever. Like the physical sensation of driving a race car is really unique. And I think if if you're in a car fast, you have a maybe a 2% taste of it. The exposure to the elements that you get in a single seat race car, especially one like that where your head is actually out in the elements. You can see the individual wheels and you sensation of speed is just so much higher is at a completely different level.\nSo, can you actually speak to that? So, even at that, even in that Mazda, so you can feel what can you feel like the track reverberating? You feel the grip? You not only can you see the bumps because you're literally looking straight at the wheel, you can feel all the bumps because you're running a slick tire. It's a really stiff setup. It's nothing like taking a fast street car out on a racetrack and try to driving a little bit around.\nSo, can you feel like the slipping? That's a, that's a huge part of the satisfaction of driving a race car is driving it at the edge of adhesion, as we call it, where the car is actually sliding a little bit. Couple of percent slip angle is the fastest way to drive a race car. You don't want to slide too much. That looks great. Lots of smoke, but it's not fast. How you want to drive it is just at the limit of adhesion, where you're rotating the car as much as your tires can manage and then slightly more than that and playing at it, keeping it just at that level because when you're at the level of or at the limit of adhesion, you're essentially just a tiny movement away from spinning out. I mean, it doesn't take much. Then the car starts rotating. Once it starts rotating, you lose grip and you're going for the wall. That balance of danger and skill is what's so intoxicating. And it's so much better than racing video games, too, because the criticality is taking up two notches. I often think about people really like gambling where I think like, aren't you just playing poker? Like, and like, no, the point is not poker. Poker may be part of it, but the point is that I could lose my house, right? Like that's the addiction that some people get to gambling, that there's something real on the line. When you're in a race car, there's something very real on the line. If you get it wrong, at the very least, you're going to spin out and probably hit a wall and it's going to be expensive. At the very worst, you're not getting out alive. And even if modern race cars have gotten way safer than they used to be, there is that element of danger that's real. That there are people who still get seriously hurt or even killed in a race car. It's mercifully rare compared to what it used to be when those maniacs in the 60s would do Formula 1 and whatever, 13% of the grid wouldn't make it to the end of the year because they just die in a fiery flaming fireball. But there's still some of it there. And I think that sense that there's something on the line really contributes to it. But it's more than that. There's al just a physical sensation. There's activation of all your forces. There's the flow.\n\n\nAnd I think that really cements why I got addicted because I always I love that flow I got out of programming.\nBut getting flow out of programming is a very inconsistent process.\nI can't just sit down in front of a keyboard and go like, \"All right, let's get the flow going.\"\nIt doesn't happen like that.\nThe problem has to be just right.\nIt has to meet my skills in just the right moment.\nIt's a bit of a lottery.\nIn a race car is not a lottery at all.\nYou sit down in that car, you turn the ignition, you go out on track, and I get flow virtually guaranteed because you need or I need at least 100% of my brain processing power to be able to go at the speed I go without crashing.\nSo there's no time to think about dinner tonight or the meeting next week or product launch.\nIt just it's completely zen in actually the literal sense of the word.\nI think of someone who's really good at meditation.\nThat's probably kind of state they get into where it's just clear you're in the now.\nThere's nothing but you and the next corner.\nThat's a really addictive experience.\nSo after I've had that, I couldn't get enough.\nI just I kept going to the track.\nEvery opportunity I got every single weekend for about four years, I would go to the track.\nAnd by the end of that time, I finally worked up enough skill and enough success with the company that I could afford to go quote unquote real racing.\nSo, I started doing that.\nI started driving these Porsches.\nAnd then as soon as I got into that, as soon as I got into quote unquote real competition, I was like, I wonder how far you can take this.\nAnd it didn't take that long before I decided, you know what?\nI can take this all the way.\nMy great hero in racing is Tom Christensen.\nFellow DHH, the Mr. Lama, as they call him, the greatest endurance race in the world, the 24 hours of Le Mans, has been won more times than any other by Tom Christensen.\nHe won the race nine times.\nSo Tom just really turned me on to Le Mans.\nI've been watching Le Mans since I think the 80s.\nI have my earliest memories of watching that on TV.\nThe race has been going since I think uh 20s, but in the 80s I got kind of into it.\nAnd then in the late 90s, early 2000s when Tom started winning, I like pretty much every other Dane started watching the race almost religiously.\nSo I thought, you know what?\nI want to get to Le Mans.\nAnd this is the magic thing about racing that if I get into basketball, like I can't set a realistic expectation that I'm going to play in the NBA, that I'm going to go to the finals, or I get into tennis and I'm going to play at Wimbledon.\nThat just doesn't happen.\nBut racing is special in this way because it requires a fair amount of money to keep these cars running.\nIt's really expensive.\nIt's like having a small startup.\nYou need to fly a bunch of people around the world and buy expensive equipment so forth.\nSo you need a bunch of capital and I had some through the success of the company.\nSo I could do it which meant that I could get to Le Mans.\nSo I set that as my goal.\nI want to get to Le Mans and I started racing in real competition 2009 and three years later in 2012 I was at the grid of Le Mans for the first time.\nWe should say so Le Mans 24-hour race endurance.\nI mean this is insane.\nThere are three drivers mind you.\nSo it's not like one guy just driving for 20 hours 24 hours straight.\nStill, it's a pretty tough race both physically and mentally, especially mentally when you've been up for 24 plus hours.\nYou're not quite as sharp as uh when you first wake up.\nAnd this is funny about Le Mans, too.\nIt starts at around 4:00 in the afternoon.\nSo, you've already been up for half a day by the time the race starts.\nAnd then there's 24 hours to go before you're done.\nAnd you'll be in the car for anywhere from usually an hour and a half to a maximum of 4 hours.\nThe regulations say four out of six is the max you can do.\nI've spent perhaps two and a half hours in a single stint at Le Mans.\nIt's pretty taxing.\nYou're going 200 miles an hour into some of these turns.\nAnd there's another 60 cars on track.\nWhenever I'm in my normal category, which is the LMP2 category, I have GT cars, which are more like a Ferrari and a Porsche that I have to overtake.\nAnd then I have these hypercars, which is the top class that are overtaking me.\nSo you got a lot going on and you got to stay sharp for two and a half hours straight to do that.\nThat is just a guaranteed way to get incredible flow for long stretches of time.\nThat's why you get addicted to it.\nThat was why I got\nYou got to talk me through this video.\nThis video of you in these LM2s.\nThis is such a cool This is so cool.\nAnd this was probably my favorite battle of my career.\nSure.\nAnd Hanar Hansen has beat past and fights.\nYeah.\nSo, this is me driving against Nico Miller at the Shanghai International Circuit.\nYou're on the outside here.\nI'm on the outside in the blue and white.\nAnd we go a whole track around with basically a piece of paper between us.\nSee down this back straight.\nI get so close to him because I want to force him over on the other side of the track such that he can't just box me in.\nAnd we've been fighting already at this point for basically 40 minutes straight.\nI've been man managing to keep this professional driver behind me for 40 minutes and he finally passes me but we just keep the battle on for the whole time and it really just shows both these kinds of cars the Le Mans prototypes we don't actually ever touch we get within about an inch and um and keep going around Shanghai circuit to\nhow did you get so good like what I mean that's a fascinating story right that you were able to get so good\nI'm pretty good for the kind of driver I am, which is called the gentleman driver, which means I'm not a professional driver.\nAnd like many good gentleman drivers, when we're at our really best, we can be quite competitive with even professional drivers who've been doing this their whole life.\nThe difference between us and the professionals is the professionals can do it every time or more or less every time.\nSo I can't be this good all the time.\nWhen everything is just right, I can be competitive with professional drivers, but that's not how you win championships.\nThat's not how you get paid by factories to drive.\nYou got to be good every time you go out.\nSo, that's a huge difference.\nBut some of it was also just I really put my mind to it.\nBy the time I realized race cars is what I want to do as my serious hobby, I put in thousands of hours.\nHave you crashed?\nWhat's the worst crash?\nI've had a lot of crashes, but thankfully, knock on wood, I haven't had any crashes where I've gotten really seriously hurt.\nHave you like wrecked the car?\nOh, yes.\nOh, yes.\nI've wrecked many a car.\nSo, what what's that feel like?\nJust you wreck a car.\nLike, how do you get It feels like total shit if you're in a real race and other people depend on you.\nIt's not even so much the car.\nAlthough, it's also sometimes that these cars are expensive to repair and that sucks and it feels so wasteful in a way when you crash some of these cars, but the sense that you're letting a team down.\nEndurance racing is a team sport.\nNot only do you have your mechanics, you usually have co-drivers.\nSo when I crash, I just feel like, damn it, I could have avoided this.\nYeah, but also you could have died.\nDo you know what's funny?\nI never think about that.\nI don't think you can because I think the moment you start thinking about being able to die, you can't do it.\nYou can't go fast.\nWell, I'm sure, not not to go all Carl Carl Young and Freud here, but I'm sure that's always present in the back of your mind somewhere.\nYou're not just bringing it to the surface.\nIt is in the sense that it's part of the appeal.\nIt's part of the sense that there's something on the line that this isn't just virtual.\nI can't just hit reset, restart, reboot.\nIf I crash this car, we're going to be out or we're going to be disadvantaged or it's going to get destroyed or I might get hurt.\nI've gotten lightly hurt a few times.\nI actually had the year we won the 24 hours of Le Mans in our class.\nI'd been training in this Formula 3.5 car.\nIt's a really fast car.\nIt's a really nice exercise to do, but it's also it doesn't have power steering.\nSo, some of these race cars, especially the open seaters, they don't have power steering, which means that the steering wheel is basically directly connected to the front wheels.\nSo, if you crash one of those cars and the front wheels suddenly turn, you're really going to hurt your hands if you don't get your hands off the wheel.\nI hadn't raced enough of those cars to know that I had to get or to have to instinct to have developed the instinct that I had to get my hands off the wheel.\nSo, I didn't and I really hurt my hand and this was just I think a month before the 24 hours of Le Mans.\nSo, I thought, \"Oh man, I'm gonna have to miss it this year.\"\nI had like a not a cast, it was just seriously sprained.\nAnd then somehow miraculously like a week before the event I was like ah yeah actually it's okay now.\nSo got to do it and that would have been grave regret if I would have seen my team go to on to win the race and I would had to sit on the sidelines but I really have been quite fortunate in the sense that most of my crashes have just been expensive or sporting inconvenient.\nThey've never been something where I got seriously hurt but I've seen plenty of people who have.\nIn fact, my co-driver this year and for several years, Petro Fidipali drove a race car at Spa.\nSpa is one of the great race tracks of all time.\nAnd it has this iconic corner called Arouge, which is probably the most famous corner in all of motorsports.\nIt has a great compression before you climb uphill.\nIt's extremely fast, very difficult corner.\nAnd just as he does the compression, his car basically sets out and he loses his power steering and he drives straight into the wall and breaks both his legs and basically face the prospect that maybe his career was over.\nI've had other teammates and people I know have serious injuries that's really hurt them.\nAnd yet, what's funny is you say, you'd think that would sink in.\nThe year before we won in 2014, that same car had a Danish driver in it at Le Mans at the race I was driving who died.\nHe lost control of the car when there was a bit of rain on the track and the track went unfortunately designed in such a poor way that there was a very big tree right behind the railing and he hit that tree at full speed, pulled 90 gs and was dead on the spot which was just such an extremely awful experience to go through.\nI finished second that year, which should have been cause for a bunch of celebration, but it was just tainted by the fact that not only did a driver die, a fellow Dane died, a guy I knew died.\nThat was that was pretty tough.\nSo that uh throw that into the pile of the the things that have to be considered is the weather conditions that you mentioned of the track, the whether it's dry or wet.\nIt's a huge part of it.\nEven just last year at Le Mans, it was raining and I was out and I hadn't made a serious mistake at the 24 hours of Le Mans since I did the first race in 2012 where I put it in the sand trap with like 4 hours to go and we lost a couple of laps getting pulled out, but it didn't actually change anything for our result because that was just how the field was spread out.\nI'd made minor mistakes over the years, but nothing that really set us out.\nAnd at the race last year when it was raining, I first clobbered a Ford Mustang when I made an over ambitious pass on a damp part of the track and couldn't stop in time.\nAnd then felt absolutely awful as I sat in the gravel pit for two laps and knew that our race was over.\nA race where we were highly competitive.\nYou're not blessed with a competitive car, a competitive team and competitive setup every year.\nI know how rare that is.\nSo to know that we had had a chance that year and I sort of squandered it.\nFelt really bad, but that got compounded.\nI got back on track, barely made it another stint and then put it in the gravel trap again when it started raining on the entrance into Porsche.\nSo this is part of why racing is so addicting, too, because the highs are very, very high.\nWhen you win a race like the 24 hours mod, it feels just incredible.\nThere's so much emotion, but if you fuck it up, the lows are very, very low.\nWhat are the things you're paying attention to when you're driving?\nWhat's what what is the what are the parameters?\nWhat are you loading in?\nAre you feeling the grip?\nAre you basically increasing the speed and seeing what like a constant feedback system effect it has on the grip?\nYou're trying to manage that.\nTrying to find that optimal slip angle.\nAre you looking around using your eyes?\nAre you smelling things?\nAre you listening?\nHe's feeling the wind.\nAre you Are you Oh, you looking at the field, too?\nLike, how how did you not hit that guy at all?\nYou get close within inches, right?\nSo, you have to pay attention to that, too.\nIt's really interesting about that specific battle where we're literally a few inches apart.\nI can't fully explain it, but humans can develop an incredible sense of space where I can't see the edge of the back of my car, but I can know exactly where it is.\nI can have a mental model in my head that gives me the exact dimensions of this car such that I can run within a few inches of a competitor car or within a few inches of the wall and not hit either when things go well.\nThe car is about 2 m wide and it's quite long, 5 m, and you can't see everything.\nThe mirrors are actually kind of shit.\nThere's no rear view mirror in these cars.\nYou can't see out the back.\nYou can only see through your two side mirrors.\nBut you form this intuitive mental model when you get good enough at this.\nBut what I actually pay attention to most is I run a program.\nWhat I try to do when I go to a racetrack is I try to load up the best program I know how for every single corner.\nWhat's my break point?\nWhat's my acceleration point?\n\n\nWhat's my brake trailing curve? And I try to pick up that program in part just by finding it myself and how fast I can go. But even more so than that, by copying my professional competitors or not competitors, co-drivers. So, I usually always race with a pro, and modern race cars produce an absolute enormous amount of data, and you can analyze all that data after each outing. You can see an exact trace of how much you pushed the brake pedal, how much you did in terms of steering inputs, how when you got on the gas. You can see every millisecond you're losing is evident in those charts. So what I try to do is I try to look at the chart, and then I try to load that in, and like that's what I got to do. Oh, in this corner 17, I actually I have to be 10 bar lighter on the brake. So I try to load that program in, and then I try to repeat it. Now then there are all the things that change. Your tires change quite a lot. These tires are made to only last 40 minutes in many cases. Sometimes at least tracks, they'll last as little as 40 minutes before they really fall off. So you got to manage that, that the grip is constantly changing. So your program have to suddenly fit those changing circumstances. And then in endurance racing, you're constantly interacting with other cars because you're passing slower classes or you're getting passed by a faster class. So that's part of the equation. And then you're trying to dance the car around the limit of adhesion. So you got all those factors playing at the same time. But above all else for me is to try to become a robot. Like how can I repeat this set of steps exactly as I'm supposed to for 2 and a half hours straight without making 100 milliseconds worth of mistakes?\nYeah. Low latency algorithm.\nThat's really a huge part of it actually. Your latency is enormously important in terms of being able to catch when the car starts slipping. You get this sensation in your body that the G-forces are a little off, the slip angle is a little off, and then you have to counter steer. And obviously the best race car drivers just feel like an intuition. I have some intuition. I don't have all of it. So I do occasionally spin my car, but that's the challenge. From everything you've studied and understand, what does it take to achieve mastery in racing? Like what does it take to become the best race car driver in the world?\nObsession is part of it. When I read and hear about Senna and the other greats, they were just singularly focused. Max Verstappen is the current champion of the world, and he is the same kind. Max has been fascinating to watch. I mean, he's a phenomenal race car driver, but he also literally does nothing else. When he's not at the racetrack, he's driving sim racing. Like he's literally in video games doing more racing when he's not doing all the racing he's already doing.\nIs there a specific skill they have that like stands out to you as supernatural through all that obsession? Like what uh is it a bunch of factors or are they actually able to, you like you said, develop a sense? Is it is it that they're able to get to the very edge of the slip?\nThey're able to develop very fine-tuned sensibilities for when the car is sliding. They can feel just these tiny moments or movements in the chassis that transports up usually through their ass. That's why you call it like a a butt meter that goes up, and you feel like the car is loose or you feel like you're just about to lock up. You can really hone that tuning. Then the other thing is you have to have really good reaction time. And when you look at great Formula 1 drivers, they can generally have a reaction time of just under 200 milliseconds, which is awesome. And even 10 milliseconds difference makes a huge difference. You'll see it when the Formula 1 grid, for example, they do a standing start, and you see the five red lights come on. And when the last light goes out, they're supposed to release the clutch and get going. And they can time this so you can see exactly who has the reaction time. And even being off by 20 milliseconds can make the difference of whether you're in front or behind at the first corner.\nHow much of winning is also just this the strategy of jostling for position?\nThere's some of that, and some of it is also just nerve. Who wants it more?\nThat's exactly when that sense of danger comes in. There's a great quote from Fernando Alonso when he was driving at Suzuka against Schumacher. I think they're coming up to this incredibly fast corner. It's very dangerous. And Alonzo basically accounts, \"I was going to make the pass because I knew he had a wife and kids at home.\"\nThat's so gangster.\nJust absolutely rude. Right.\nWow.\n\"That I knew he valued life more than I did.\" So there's a bit of poker sometimes in that. Who's going to yield? There's a bit of chicken race in that regard. And sometimes it doesn't work. No one yields, and you both crash. But very often one person will blink first.\nCan the pass be both on the inside and the outside or is...\nYou can pass wherever you want as long as you have just a slight part of the car on the racetrack, and then you just improvise and take risks. What a what a sport. What and then Senna, of course, is like a legendary risk taker.\nYes.\nAnd even before him, by the time I mean, he died in the 90s, but by the time we got to the 90s, racing was already a lot safer than it was when Niki Lauda raced in the 60s.\nThat level of danger is no longer there. There's still just a remnant of it. And it is still dangerous, but nothing like that. And it's a little hard to compare through the ages like who's the greatest driver of all time. I think there's a fair argument that Senna is, but we don't have the data. We don't know who he was up against. Like, how would he fair if we pitted him against Max Verstappen today? I do think sometimes that you can have a bit of a nostalgia for the all-time greats, but the world moves forward, and new records are being set all the time. And the professionalism keeps improving, sometimes to the detriment of the sport. I think there's a lot of professional drivers who are not only just very good at driving, but are very good at being corporate spokespeople. And it used to be quite different. There used to be more characters in racing that had a bit more personality that they were allowed to shine because there weren't a billion sponsorships on the line that they were afraid to lose.\nRidiculous question. What's the greatest car ever made? Or maybe uh what's the funnest one to drive?\nThe greatest car for me of all time is the Pagani Zonda.\nOkay, I'm looking this up. Pagani sand.\nSo, the Pagani Zonda was made by this wonderful Argentinian called Horacio Pagani. My god, that's a beautiful car.\nWow.\nIt's a gorgeous car. You can look up mine. It's the Pagani Zonda HH. Yep. So, that's um a car I had made in 2010 after we visited the factory in Modena and by sheer accident ended up with this car. But it became my favorite car in the world basically when I watched an episode of Top Gear, I think in 2005, where one of the presenters was driving the Pagani F around, and I just thought that's the most beautiful car in the world. It is the most incredibly sounding car in the world.\nIf I one day have the option, this is what I want. And then I had the option in 2010. I've had the car ever since. I'm never ever going to sell it. It's truly a masterpiece that stood the test of time. There's some great cars from history that are recognized as being great in their time. This car is still great.\nHave you taken on the racetrack?\nI have. It's terrible at that, but I I don't want to say it's terrible at that. That's not what it's designed for. It's designed for the road, and that's why it's great. There are a lot of fast cars that are straddling their race car for the road. You don't actually want a race car for the world. A race car for the world is a pain in the ass. It's way too stiff. It's way too loud. It's way too uncomfortable. You can't actually take it on a road trip.\nSo, this actually feels good driving.\nTotally.\nAnd you of course always go to speed limit.\nAlways. This is why I love having this car in Spain, cuz they're uh a little more relaxed. Not entirely relaxed, but more relaxed than they are in a lot of places. In Denmark, I kid you not, if you are on the highway and you go more than twice the speed limit, they confiscate your car and keep it.\nYou're not getting it back. They don't even care if it's your car or not. Like, if if you were borrowing my car and you went twice the speed limit, it's gone.\nSo, they don't do that in Spain. I mean, they in most places, except for the German Autobahn, they get pissy. If you go twice the speed limit for all sorts of fair reasons. I'm not advocating that you should be going much more than that. But there are certain special roads where you can open things up and no one's in harm's way. And that's an incredible sensation. And I do think that some of those speed limits actually are kind of silly. And I'm not just saying that in the in a vacuum. In Germany, they have the glorious Autobahn. And on the Autobahn, there is no speed limit in a bunch of segments. And they're so committed to their speed limitless Autobahn, which is, by the way, very weird of Germans. They usually love rules. They usually very precise about. And then they have this glorious thing called the Autobahn. There was a great case a couple of years ago where a guy took out a Bugatti Veyron Chiron, went 400 km an hour on the Autobahn, and he filmed it and put it on YouTube, and a case was brought against him because even though they don't have a speed limit, they do have rules that you can't drive recklessly, and he won the case. He wasn't driving recklessly. He was just going very, very fast. I've done the Autobahn a couple of times. Uh my wife and I went on a road trip in Europe in 2009, and I got the Lamborghini Gallardo. We were driving up to 200 miles an hour, and it I'd driven 200 miles an hour or close to it on a racetrack before. That feels like one thing. Driving on a public road 200 mph feels really, really fast.\nScary.\nActually a little scary. Yes. Because you constantly think like on a racetrack, you know the road, you know the surface. You can walk the track most of the time. You can know if there's a dip. On a public road, you can't know if there's suddenly a pothole. Presumably, there's not going to be a pothole on the German Autobahn, but it does feel a little scary, but also exhilarating. Speed is just intrinsically really fun. I don't know anyone I've taken out in a fast car. Well, actually, I do know a few people. Most people that take out in a fast car, they grin. Just it's a human reaction to grin when you go really fast.\nDo you know what the fastest you've ever gone?\nI was probably at Le Mans. I think when the LMP2s were at their maximum power and had 600 horsepower and really sticky tires, we were going 340 km an hour, which is just over 200 mph. A bit over 200 mph. That's that does feel fast. And it's really interesting with speed is that the difference between going let's say 150 and 160 doesn't feel that much. Actually those 10 uh mph, but the difference between going 190 and 200 feels crazy faster, which as a percentage change is actually less than going from 150 to 160. But there's some sense of exponentiality once you get up to those limits, um where it's just on a complete different level.\nYeah, cuz to me like 110, 120 feels fast. 200, that's that's crazy. It really is crazy.\nI got to ask you about the the details of your programming setup, the IDE, all that kind of stuff. Let's paint the picture of the perfect uh programming setup. Do you have a a programming setup that you enjoy? Are you very flexible? Like how many monitors, what kind of keyboard, what kind of chair, what kind of desk? It's funny because if you'd asked me, let's see, a year and a half ago, I would have given you the same answer as I would given anyone for basically 20 years.\nI want a Mac. I like the Magic Keyboard. I like the single monitor. Apple makes an awesome 6K 32-in XDR screen that I've still haven't found anyone who beaten that I still use. Even though I switched away from Apple computers, I still use their monitor because it's just fantastic. But I've always been a single screen kind of guy. I do like a big screen, but I don't want multiple screens. I've never found that that really works with my perception. I want to be able to just focus on a single thing. I don't want all of it all over the place. And I've always used multiple virtual desktops and being able to switch back and forth between those things. But the setup I have today is Linux. That I switched to a little over a year ago after I finally got fed up with Apple enough that I couldn't do that anymore. And then I use this low-profile mechanical keyboard called the LowFree Flow 84, which is just the most glorious sounding keyboard I've ever heard. I know there are a lot of connoisseurs of mechanical keyboards that'll probably contest me on this. This is too thcky or too clicky or too clacky or whatever. But for me, the LowFree Flow 84 is just a delight that I did not even know existed, which is so funny because I mean, I've been programming for a long time. Mechanical keyboards have been a thing for a long time. And the keyboard when you look at it like this, it just kind of it looks plain. It doesn't look extravagant, but the tactile sensation you get out of pushing those keys, the the talky sound that you hear when the keys hit the board, it's just sublime. And I'm kicking myself that I was in this Mac bubble for so long that I wasn't even in the market to find this. I didn't I knew mechanical keyboards existed, but I to be blunt, I thought it was a bit of a nerd thing that only real nerds that were much more nerdy than me would ever care about.\nAnd then I got out of the Apple bubble and suddenly I had to find everything again.\n\n\nI had to find a new mouse. I had to find a new keyboard. I had to find everything. And I thought like, all right, let me give mechanical keyboards a try. And I gave quite a few of them a try. The Keyron is one of the big brands in that. I didn't like that at all. I tried a bunch of other keyboards and then I finally found this keyboard and I just went like angels are singing. Where have you been my whole life? We spend as programmers so much of our time interacting with those keys. It really kind of matters in a way I didn't fully appreciate. I used to defend the Apple Magic Keyboard. Like it's it's great. It's actually a great keyboard. And I think for what it is, this ultra low profile, ultra low travel is actually a really nice keyboard. But once you've tried a longer travel mechanical keyboard, there's no going back.\nUh you do have to remember in in many ways both on the software side and the hardware side that you do spend a lot of hours behind the computer. It's worth investing in.\nAnd also worth exploring until you find the thing where the angel starts singing or whatever.\nThat's exactly right. And I I'm I actually do regret that a little bit. Especially with this damn keyboard. I I could have been listening to these beautiful thoughty keys for years and years, but uh sometimes you have to get really pissed off before you open your eyes and see that something else exists.\nI feel the same way about Linux. So, I've been using Linux on the server since late '90s probably. We ran servers on Linux back then. I never seriously considered it as a desktop option. I never ran Linux before directly myself. I always thought, you know what, I just I want to focus on programming. I don't have time for all these configuration files and all this setup bullshit and and whatnot. And Apple is close enough. It's built on Unix underpinnings. Why do why do I need to bother with Linux? And again, it was one of those things I needed to try new things and try something else to realize that there is other things other than Apple. And again, it's not because I hate Apple. I think they still make good computers. I think a lot of the software is still also pretty okay, but I have come to realize that as a web developer, Linux is just better.\nYeah, Linux is just better. It's closer to what I deploy on. The tooling is actually phenomenal. And if you spend a bit of time setting it up, you can record a reproducible environment that I've now done with this cube concept or project that I've done that I can set up a new Linux machine in less than 30 minutes and it's perfect. It's not pretty good. It's not like I still need to spend two hours on. It's perfect because you can encode all aspects of the development environment into this.\nAnd I didn't know I I didn't even know to be fair that Linux could look as good as it can. If you look at a stock Ubuntu or Fedora or Boot I mean not that it's ugly but I'd pick the Mac in day of the week. You look at a you look at I mean I'm biased here of course because I built it with my own sensibilities but I look at that and go like this is better. This is beautiful. And then you look at some of those true Linux rising setups where people go nuts with everything and you go, \"Oh yeah, I remember when computers used to be fun in this way, when there was this individuality and this setup and it wasn't just all bland the sameness.\"\nAnd I think that's a flip side sometimes of something like Apple where they have really strong opinions and they have really good opinions. They have very good taste and it looks very nice and it also looks totally the same. And Linux has far more variety and far more texture and flavor. Sometimes also annoyances and bugs and whatever. But I run Linux now. It's Ubuntu based with the Yamakoup stuff on top. The low free keyboard. I use a uh Logitech uh what's it called? The MS3 mouse which I love how it feels in my hand. I don't love how it looks. I actually was a magic mouse stand for the longest time. I thought it was genius that Apple integrated the trackpad into a mouse and I I used that and I always thought it was ridiculous that people would slag it just because you had to charge it by flipping it over cuz the battery would last for 3 months and then you charge it for half an hour. I thought like that's a perfect compatibility with my sensibilities. I don't mind giving up a little inconvenience if something is beautiful and that magic mouse is beautiful but it wasn't going to work on Linux. So I found something else. the the MS3 is is is nice, but I sometimes do wish like uh the magic mouse is pretty good.\nYeah, Linux is really great for customizing everything for for tiling, for macros, for all of that. I also do the same in Windows with auto hotkey or just customize the whole thing to your to your preferences.\nIf you're a developer, you should learn how to control your environment with the keyboard.\nIt's just it's faster. It's more fluid. I think one of those silly things I've come to truly appreciate about my alma setup is that I can in whatever time it takes to refresh the screen, probably 5 milliseconds, switch from one virtual desktop to another.\nEven on Windows, can't get it that smooth.\nYou can get close, can't get it that smooth. on Mac OS. For whatever reason, Apple insists on having this infuriating animation when you switch between virtual desktops, which makes it you don't want to. You don't want to run full screen apps because it's too cumbersome to switch between the virtual desktops. The kind of immediacy that you can get from a wonderful Linux setup in that regard is just next level.\nYeah. And it seems like a subtle thing but you know difference in milliseconds and latency between switching the virtual desktops for example. I don't know it changes it changes how you use the computer. It really does.\nSimilar thing with VR right there. If there's some kind of latency or like it just completely takes you out of it. And it's funny, I actually had to watch I think it was the priming between those virtual desktops. And I'd always been using virtual desktops, but I didn't like switching too much because just of that latency, and it's like, oh, you can do that on Linux? Oh, that's pretty cool.\nYeah.\nSo, I run that and then my editor of choice now is Neovim.\nOh, good. All right. Well, we're out of time. No. All right. You did for many, many years you used what is it? Textmate.\nYes, Textmate. That was actually that was the main blocker of moving away from Apple.\nEverything else I thought, do you know what? I can swing it.\nBut textmate was and is a wonderful editor. One I helped birth into this world. The programmer Alan Uggo is a good friend of mine all the way back from those the party days when we were lugging our computers around and he was a big uh Mac guy and in in 2005 he was writing this editor um and I helped him with the project management of kind of keeping him on track, keeping him focused on getting something released because I really wanted it for myself and I thought this was the last editor. I thought I was never going to switch. Forgive me for not knowing, but how featureful is this editor? Is this It's quite featureful, but it's it's it's um a guey driven editor in some regards. It was really early on with u ways of recording macros and having sort of sophisticated syntax highlighting and it did a bunch of first and it was just a really pleasant editing experience. I think these days a lot of people would just use VS Code. VS codes exist in the same universe as Textmate in some ways and actually I think is compatible with the original Textmate bundles, the original Textmate format. So it really trailed a path there, but it also just didn't evolve.\nNow a lot of people saw a huge problem with that. They were like, \"Oh, it needs to have more features. It needs to have all these things.\" I was like, \"I'm happy with this text editor that hasn't changed at all.\" basically when Allan stopped working on it for a decade or more. I don't need anything else because as our original discussion went, I don't want an IDE. I don't want the editor to write code for me. I want a text editor. I want to interact with characters directly.\nAnd Neovim allows me to do that in some ways that are even better than Text. And I love Textmate. But BI, as you know, once you learn the commands, and it sounds I sometimes feel like BI fans overplay how difficult it is to learn because it makes them perhaps seem kind of more awesome that they were able to do it.\nIt's not that difficult and it doesn't take that long in my opinion to learn just enough combo moves to get that high of holy shit, I could not do this in any other edit.\nHow long did it take you? And by the way, I don't know. I'm still I haven't yet. Well, I know intellectually, but just like with kids, I haven't You haven't I haven't uh gone in all the way in. I haven't used them.\nYou You have a You have a treat in in mind? Well, I switched in about I had three day when I switched here about a year ago. I had three days of cursing where I thought it was absolutely terrible and it was never going to happen. And I had three days of annoyance and already the next week I was like, \"This is sweet. I'm not going anywhere.\"\nOh, wow. But I also had a bit of a head start about 20 years ago in the early 2000s. I tried Vim for like a summer and it didn't stick. I didn't for whatever reason love it at the time. But Neovim is really good. The key to Neovim is to realize that you don't have to build the whole damn editor yourself. So a lot of Neovim stands are like here's how to write the confict from scratch over 17 episodes. It's going to take you three weeks. I I don't care that much. I love a great editor. I love to tailor it a little bit, but not that much. So, you have to pair Neovim with this thing called Lazy Vim.\nLazyVim.org is a distribution for Neovim that takes all the drudgery out of getting an amazing editor experience right out of the box.\nRidiculous question. We talked about a bunch of programming languages. Uh, you told us how much you love JavaScript. It's your second favorite programming language. Um, would Typescript be the third? Then Typescript wouldn't even be in this universe.\nI hate TypeScript as much as I like JavaScript.\nSo, what you hate? Oh, man. I'm not smart enough to understand the math of that. Okay. Before I ask about other programming languages, what's if you can encapsulate your hatred of Typescript into something that could be human interpretable, what would be the reasoning? that JavaScript smells a lot like Ruby when it comes to some aspects of its meta programming and TypeScript just complicates that to an infuriating degree when you're trying to write that kind of code and even when you're trying to write the normal kind of code none of the benefits that acrew to people who like it like autocomp completion is something I care about I don't care about autocomp completion because I'm not using an IDE now I understand that that is part of what separates it and why I don't see the benefits. I only see the costs. I see the extra typing. I see the type gymnastics that you sometimes have to do and where a bunch of people give up and just do any instead, right? Like that they don't actually use the type system because it's just too frustrating to use. So, I've ever only felt the frustration of Typescript and the obfuscation of Typescript in the code that gave me no payoff. Again, I understand that there is a payoff. I don't want the payoff. So for my situation, I'm not willing to make the trade and I'm not willing to take a language that underneath is as dynamic of a language as Rubious and then turn it into this pretend statically type language. I find that just intellectually insulting.\nDo you think it will and do you think it should die Typescript?\nI don't want to take something away from people who enjoy it. So if you like Typescript, all the most part of you, if you're using TypeScript because you think that's what a professional programmer is supposed to do, here's my permission. You don't have to use TypeScript. There's something deeply enjoy enjoyable about a brilliant programmer such as yourself, a DHH talking shit. It's just it's like one of my favorite things in life. Uh what are the top three programming languages everyone should learn? If you're talking to a beginner,\nI would 100% start with Ruby. It is magic for beginners in terms of just understanding the core concepts of conditionals and loops and whatever because it makes it so easy. Even if you're just making a shell program that's outputting to the terminal, getting hello world running in Ruby is basically puts ps space start quote hello world end quote. You're done, right? There's no fluff. There's nothing to rabbit into. There are other languages that does that especially in the pearl or python would be rather similar but go would not java would not. There's a lot of other languages that have a lot more ceremony and boilerplate. Ruby has none of it. So it's a wonderful starting language.\nThere's a book called learn to program by pine that uses Ruby essentially to just teach basic programming principles that I've seen heavily recommended. So that's a great language.\nHow quickly would you go to Rails? It depends on what you want to do. If you want to build web applications, go to Rails right away. Learn Ruby along with Rails because I think what really helps power through learning programming is to build programs that you want. Right? If you're just learning it in the abstract, it's difficult to motivate yourself to actually do it well. Some people learn languages just for the fun of them. Most people do not. Most people learn it because they have a mission. They want to build a program. They want to become a programmer. So, you got to use it for something real. And I actually find that it's easier to learn programming that way too because it drives your learning process. You can't just learn the whole thing up front. You can't just sit down and read the language specification then go like oo like neo now I know kung fu now I know Ruby. It doesn't download that way. You actually have to type it out in anger on a real program.\nYeah. Yeah. For sure.\n\n\nSo I would start there. But then number two, I probably would be JavaScript because JavaScript just is the language you need to know if you want to work with the web. And the web is the greatest application platform of all time. If you're making business software, collaboration software, all this kind of stuff. If you're making video games, you should probably go off learn C++ or C or something else like that. But if you're in the realm of web applications, you got to learn JavaScript. Regardless of what else you learn, you got to learn JavaScript. So if you're learning Ruby, what does Ruby not have in terms of programming concepts that you would need other languages for? I don't know if there's any concepts missing, but it doesn't have the speed or the low-level access of memory manipulation that you would need to build a 3D gaming engine, for example. No one's going to build that in Ruby. You can build quite low-level stuff when it comes to web technologies in Ruby, but at some point you're going to hit the limit and you should use something else. I'm not someone who prescribed just Ruby for everything. Just once you reach the level of abstraction that's involved with web applications, Ruby is superb. But if you're writing, for example, a HTTP proxy, Go is great for that. We've written quite a few HTTP proxies lately at the company for various reasons, including our cloud exit and so forth. And Kevin, one of the programs I'm working with, he writes all of that in Go. Go. Just have the primitives and it has the pace and the speed to do that really well. I highly recommend it. If you're writing an HTTP general proxy, do it in Go. Great language for that. Don't write your business logic in Go. I know people do, but I don't see the point in that.\n\nSo, what would you say the three? So go Ruby plus Rails JavaScript.\n\nYeah, if you're willing or interested in working with the web, I'd probably pick those three: Go, Ruby, and JavaScript. Go, Ruby, and JavaScript. Okay. Functional languages.\n\nSomeone's talking about Okamel.\n\nThere's always they are always going to show up. They're always I it must be some kind of OAML industrial complex or something like this. But they always say mention O camel. I love that there are people who love functional languages to that degree. Those people are not me. I don't care at all. Like I care about functional principles when they help me in these isolated cases where that's just better than everything else. But at heart, I'm an object-oriented guy. That's just how I think about programs. That's how I like to think about programs. That's how I carve up a big problem space into a domain language.\n\nObjects are my gem.\n\nYeah. Yeah, me too. So I I programmed a list a bunch for like AI applications for uh basic so chess engines that kind of stuff and I did try just to force myself to program just a very basic game of life simulation and it's it's not it's it's much you know lisp is just parenthesis everywhere. It's actually not readable at all.\n\nThat's my bad with uh okamel is very very intuitive, very readable. this I really should pick up a language like that at some point. I've been programming long enough that it's a little embarrassing that I haven't actually done anything real in anger in a fully functional programming language.\n\nYeah, but like I I have to figure out I'm sure there's an answer to this. What can I do that would be useful for me like that I actually want to build? That's my problem.\n\nThat a functional language is better suited for.\n\nThat's right.\n\nBecause I really want to experience the language properly.\n\nThat's right.\n\nYeah. Cuz I'm still Yeah. I'm very ob at this point I'm very object-oriented.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd that's my problem too. I just I don't care as much about these low-level problems in computer science. I care about the high level. I care about writing software. I care about the abstraction layer that really floats well with web applications and business logic. And I just I've come to accept that about myself. Even though as we talked about when I was a kid, I really wanted to become a games programmer. And then I saw what it took to write a collision detection engine and I go like, \"Yeah, that's not me at all. I'm never going to be into vector matrix manipulation or any of that stuff. It's way too much math. And I'm more of a writing person than I am of a math person.\" I mean, just in the way you were speaking today, you have like a poetic literary approach to programming.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's actually exactly right. So I did actually a keynote at Railscom 10 years ago where I called myself a software writer. I mean I'm not the first person to say that software writer has been in the vernacular for a long time. But the modern identity that most programmers adopt when they're trying to be serious is software engineer. And I reject that label. I'm not an engineer. Occasionally I dabble in some engineering but the vast majority of time I'm a software writer. I write software for human consumption and for my own delight. I can get away with that because I'm working in a high level language like Ruby, working on collaboration software and to-do lists and all the other stuff. Again, if I was trying to apply my talent to writing 3D game engines, no, that's not the right mindset. That's not the right identity. But I find that the software engineering identity flattens thing a little bit. I'd like to think that we have software writers and software mathematicians for example and then those are actually richer ways of describing the abstraction level that you're working at than engineer.\n\nYeah. And I think if AI becomes more and more successful, I think we'll need software writer skill more and more because it feels like that's the realm of which cuz it's not writer.\n\nYou're going to have to do the software. You're going to have to be a computer person. But there had there's a more I don't know uh I don't want to romanticize it, but it's more poetic. It's more literary. It's more feels like writing a a good blog post than um\n\nI actually wish that AI had a bit higher standards for writing. I find the fact that it accepts my slobby incomplete sentences a little offensive. I wish there was like a strict mode for AI where it would snap my fingers if I was just feeding it keywords and like speak proper, do pronunciation, do punctuation.\n\nUh because I love that. I love crafting a just right sentence that hasn't been boiled down that it has no meat on it. It has no character in it. It's succinct. It's not overly flowery. It's just right. That writing phase to me is just addictive. And I find that when programming is the best, it's almost equivalent exactly to that. You also have to solve a problem. You're not just communicating a solution. and you have to actually figure out what are you trying to say but even writing has that half the time when I start writing a blog post I don't know exactly which arguments I'm going to use they develop as part of the writing process and that's how writing software happens too you know roughly the kind of problem you're trying to solve you know ex don't know exactly how you're going to solve it and as you start typing the solution emerges and actually as far as I understand you and Jason working on a new book it's in the early days of that kind of topic. I I think he said it's some he tweeted that it's going to be titled something like we don't know what we're doing upfront or something like that. That kind of topic and you figure out along the way.\n\nThat's a big part of it. trying to give more people the permission to trust your own instincts and their own gut and realizing that developing that supercomputer in your stomach is actually the work of a career and that you should not discard those feelings in preference to over comp or not even complicated to analytics to intellectualism. Very often when we look at the big decisions we've had to make, they've come from the gut where you cannot fully articulate like why do I think this is the right thing? Well, because I've been in this business for 20 years and I've seen a bunch of things. I've talked to a bunch of people and that is percolating into this being the right answer.\n\nA lot of people are very skeptical about that in business or unable to trust it because it feels like they can't rationalize. Why are we doing something? Well, because I feel like it. Damn it. That's a great privilege of being a bootstrapped independent founder who don't owe their business to someone else and doesn't have to produce a return because I feel like a lot of the bullshit really creeps in when you're trying to rationalize to other people why you do the things you do and why you take the decisions that you do. If you don't have anyone to answer to, you're free to follow your gut. And that's hell of enjoyable way to work. And it's also in very often uh the correct way to work. Your gut knows a lot. Like you can't articulate it, but it's spot-on more times than not. Yeah. Having to make a plan can be a paralyzing thing.\n\nI've often I mean I suppose there's different kinds of brains. And first of all, I can't wait to read that book if it materializes.\n\nUh they I often feel like in the more in the more interesting things I do in my life, I really don't know what I'm doing up up front. And I think there's a lot of people around me that care for me that really want me to know what I'm doing. They're like, \"What's the plan? What's the why are you doing this crazy thing?\" And I if if I had to wait until I have a plan, I'm not going to do it. People are they have different brains on this kind of stuff. Some people really are planners and it maybe energizes them. But I think most creative pursuits, most really interesting, most novel pursuits are like you kind of have to just take the leap and then just figure out as you go.\n\nMy favorite essay in rework is the last one and it's entitled inspiration is perishable. And I think that captures a lot of it that if you take the time to do a detailed plan, you may very well have lost the inspiration by the time you're done. If you follow the inspiration in that moment and trust your gut, trust your own competence that you will figure it out, you're going to get so much more back. You're going to go on the adventure you otherwise wouldn't have. Whether that's just a business decisions or a life decision, you have to seize that inspiration.\n\nThere's a great set of children's books written by this Japanese author about chasing an idea and trying to get a hold of it. And it's beautifully illustrated as an idea, something that's floating around as something you have to catch and latch onto that I really feel captures this notion that inspiration is perishable. It'll disappear. If you just put it back on the shelf and say like, well, I got to be diligent about this. I got to line up a plan. you may run out and then there's no there's no steam to keep going.\n\nI have to ask you about open source. What does it take uh to run a successful open source project? You've uh spoken about that it's a misconception that uh open source is democratic. It's actually meritocratic.\n\nI thought that's a beautiful way to put it. So there's often is a kind of a benevolent dictator at top often. So, can you just speak to that having run successful open source projects yourself and and being a benevolent dictator yourself, which is going to be a bit of a biased uh piece of evidence here, but I you should definitely have dictators and they should control everything, especially when the dictator is me now.\n\nWell, I think I learned very early on that a quick way to burn out in open source is to treat it as a business, as though your users are customers, as though they have claims of legitimacy on your time and your attention and your direction.\n\nBecause I faced this almost immediately with Ruby and Rails as soon as it was released. There were a million peoples who had all sorts of opinions about where I ought to take it. and not just opinions, but actually demands. Unless you implement an Oracle database adapter, this is always going to be a toy.\n\nIt was actually more or less that exact demand that prompted me to have a slide at one of the early Rails conferences that just said, \"Fuck you.\"\n\nYeah, I saw that.\n\nI'm not going to do what you tell me to. I'm here as a bringer of gift. I am sharing code that I wrote on my own time on my own valition and you don't have to say thank you. I mean be nice if you did. You can take the code and do whatever you want with it. You can contribute back if you want but you can't tell me what to do or where to go or how to act. I'm not a vendor. This is a fundamental misconception that users of open source occasionally step into because they're used to buying software from companies who really care about their business. I care about people using my software. I think it's great, but we don't have a transactional relationship. I don't get something back when you tell me what to do except grief and I don't want it. So you can keep it.\n\nSo my open-source philosophy from the start has been I got to do this primarily for me. I love when other people find use in my open source. It's not my primary motivation. I'm not primarily doing it for other people. I'm primarily doing it for me and my own objectives because um as Adam Smith said, it's not for the benevolence of the butcher that we expect our daily meat. It's for his self-interest. And I actually find that to be a beautiful thought that our comments increase in value when we all pursue our self-interest certainly in the realm of open source. This is also why I reject this notion that open source is in some sort of crisis that there's a funding crisis that we have to spend more. No, we don't. Open source has never been doing better. Open source has never controlled more domains in software than it has right now. There is no crisis. There's a misconception from some people making open source and from a lot of people using open source that open source is primarily like commercial software something you buy and something where you can then make demands as a customer and that the customer is always right. Customer is not always right. Not even in business but certainly not in open source. In open source the customer as it is is a receiver of gifts. We are having a gift exchange. I show up and give you my code. If you like it, you can use it. And if you have some code that fits in with where I'm going with this, I would love to get those\n\n\nGifts. Back, and we can keep trading like that. I give you more gifts, you give me some of your gifts. Together, we pull all the gifts such that someone showing up brand new just gets a mountain of gifts. This is the magic thing of open source. It increases the total sum value of what's in the comments when we all pursue our own self-interest. So, I'm building things for Rails that I need. And you know what? You want me to do that. You do not want me to build things that I don't need on behalf of other people because I'll do a crap job. I build much better software when I can evaluate the quality of that software by my own use. I have to. I need this feature. I'm going to build a good version of that feature, and I'm going to build just enough, just for me. So, I'm not going to bloat it. I'm not trying to attract a customer here. I'm not trying to see some angle. I'm just building what I need. And if you go into open source with that mentality, that you're building for you, and everything else is a bonus, I think you have all the ingredients to go the distance. I think the people who burn out in open source is when they go in thinking, \"I'm making all these gifts. I don't really need them myself, but I'm like hoping someone else does, and maybe they'll also give me some money.\" That's a losing proposition. It never basically works. If you want money for your software, you should just sell it. We have a perfectly fine model of commercial software that people can make that kind, and then they can sell it. But I find a lot of confusion, let's just call it that politely, in open source contributors who want to have their cake and eat it too. They like the mode of working with open source. They maybe even like the status that comes from open source, but they also would like to earn a living from making that open source. And therefore, they occasionally end up with the kind of grievances that someone who feels underappreciated at work will develop when others aren't doing enough to recognize their great gifts, and then they might walk away. I wish I had one of the... I wish I had more insight into their mind state of the individual people that are running these projects, like if they're feeling sad or they need more money or they're burned... Like it's just such a dark box. It can be. I mean, of course, there's some communication, but I just... I just sadly see too often they just kind of walk away, right? And I think that's actually also part of the beauty of open source. You are not obligated to do this code forever. You're obligated to do this for as long as you want to do it. That's basically your own obligation. But there is a... I know. Okay, you might criticize this and push back. You did write a blog post on forever until the end of the internet with Tadalist. There is a beautiful aspect, and you found a good balance there. But I don't know, you're bringing so much joy to people with this thing you created. It's not an obligation, but there's a real beauty to taking care of this thing you've created and not forgetting. I think we... What I think what the open-source creator is not seeing enough... I mean, there's like... How... How many lives you're making better. There's certain pieces of software that I just quietly use a lot. Yes. And like they bring my life joy, and I wish I could communicate that. Well, there's ways to donate, but it's inefficient. It's usually hard to donate. It is. There's some ways for some people that made it easier. GitHub donations is one way of doing it. I donate to a few people even though I don't love the paradigm. I also accept that we can have multiple paradigms. I accept that I can do open source for one set of motivations, and other people can do open source for other motivations. We don't all have to do it the same way. But I do want to counter the misconception that open source is somehow in a crisis unless we all start paying for open source. That model already exists. It's commercial software. It works very well, and plenty of great companies have been built off the back of it, and the expectations are very clear. I pay you this amount, and I get this software. Open source, once you start mixing money into it, gets real muddy, real fast. And a lot of it is just from those misaligned expectations that if you feel like you're starving artists as an open-source developer, and you are owed X amount of money because your software is popular, you're delusional, and you need to knock that off. Just get back on track where you realize that you're putting gifts into the world. And if you get something back in terms of monetary compensation, okay, that's a bonus. But if you need that money back in terms of monetary compensation, you should just charge for software or go work for a software company that will employ you to do open source. There's tons of that. That is probably actually the primary mode that open-source software is being developed in the world today. Commercial companies making open source that they need themselves and then contributing it back. So I'm glad you brought sort of like... drew some hard lines here. It's a good moment to bring up, uh, what I think is the maybe one of the greatest open-source projects ever, WordPress. And, uh, you spoke up in October 24, uh, about some of the stuff that's been going on with WordPress's founder, Matt Mullig, in a blog post, \"Open Source Royalty and Mad Kings.\" It's a really good blog post on sort of just the idea of benevolent dictators for life, this model for open-source projects. And then the basic implication was that Matt, as the BDFL of WordPress, has lost his way a bit with his battle with WP Engine. Uh, so I should also say that I really love WordPress. It brings me joy. I think it's a really... It's a beacon of what open source could be. As he has made the internet better. It allowed a lot of people to create wonderful websites. And I also think, now you might disagree with this, but from everything I've seen, WP Engine just gives me bad vibes. I... I think they're not a good... the good guy in this. I don't like it. I understand the frustration. I understand all of it, but I don't think that excuses the behavior. There is a bit of... see this kind of counter to a little bit what you said, which is when you have a open-source project of that size, there is a bit of a like when you're the king that for of a project of a kingdom that large, there's a bit of responsibility. Anyway, could you speak to your, uh, maybe to your empathy of Matt and, uh, to your criticism and but and maybe, uh, paint a path of how he and WordPress can be winning again? First, I echo what you said about what a wonderful thing it is that WordPress exists. There are not many projects in the open-source world or in the world at large that has had as big of an impact on the internet as WordPress has. He deserves a ton of accolades for that work. So that was my engagement, essentially my premise. Do you know what? I had tremendous respect for what Matt has built with WordPress, what that entire ecosystem has built around itself. It's a true marvel, but there's some principles that are larger than my personal sympathies to the characters involved. I agree. The Silver Lake private equity company that's involved with WP Engine is not my natural ally. I'm not the natural ally of private equity doing some game with VP Engine. That's not my interest in the case. My interest is essentially a set of principles. And the principles are if you release something as open source, people are free to use it as they see fit, and they are free to donate code or resources or money back to the community as they see fit. You may disagree about whether they've done enough, whether they should do more, but you can't show up after you've given the gift of free software to the world and then say, \"Now that you've used that gift, you actually owe me a huge slide of your business because you got too successful using the thing I gave you for free.\" You don't get to take a gift back. That's why we have open-source licenses. They stipulate exactly what the obligations are on both sides of the equation. The users of open source don't get to demand what the makers of open source do and how they act. And the makers of open source don't get to suddenly show up with a ransom note to the users and say, \"Actually, you owe me for all sorts of use.\" I'm 100% allergic to that kind of interaction. And I think Matt, unfortunately, for whatever reason, got so wrapped up in what he was owed that he failed to realize what he was destroying. WordPress and automatic already makes a ton of money. This is part of the wonder of WordPress. This is a project that generates hundreds of millions of dollars, and Matt didn't feel like he was getting enough of that. That's not a good argument, bro. You can't just violate the spirit and the letter of these open-source licenses and just start showing up with demand letters, even to characters that are not particularly sympathetic. This goes to the root of my interpretation of open source in general. The GPL is a particular license that actually demands code from people who use it under certain circumstances. I've never liked the GPL. I don't want your shitty code if you don't want to give it to me. What am I going to do with that? Some code dump that you've... I... I'm not on board with that part of Stallman's vision at all. I love the MIT license. To me, that is the perfect license, 'cause it is mercifully short. I think it's two paragraphs, three paragraphs, really short. And it basically says, \"Here's some software. It comes with no warranty. You can't sue me. You can't demand anything. But you can do whatever the hell you want with it. Have a nice life.\" That's a perfect open-source interaction in my opinion. And that license needs to be upheld. These licenses in general, even the GPL, even if I don't like it, we have to abide by them because if we just set aside those licenses when we in a moment's notice feel like something's slightly unfair, we've lost everything. We've lost the entire framework that allowed open source to prosper and allowed open source to become such an integral part of commerce, too. I mean, back when open source was initially finding its feet, it was at war with commercial software. Stallman is at war with commercial software and always has been. Bill Gates was in return at war with open source for the longest time. The open-source licenses and the clarity that they provide allowed us to end that war. Today, commercial software and open-source software can peacefully coexist. I make commercial software. I sell Basecamp. I sell HEY, and then I also make a bunch of open-source software that I give away for free as gifts. That can't happen if we start violating these contracts. No commercial company is going to go, \"Let me base my next project off this piece of open source.\" If I'm also running the liability that some mad maker is going to show up seven years in and demand I give them $50 million. That's not an environment conducive to commerce, collaboration, or anything else. And it's just basically wrong. I think there's one analysis that's all about kind of the practical outcomes of this, which I think are bad. There's also some an argument that's simply about ethics. This is not right. You can't just show up afterwards and demand something. This is not too dissimilar in my opinion to the whole Apple thing we talked about earlier. Apple just showing up and feeling like they're entitled to 30% of everyone's business. No, that's that's not right. That's not fair. So, I think Matt, unfortunately, kind of stared himself blind on the indignity he thought was being perpetrated against him because there was all this money being made by VP Engine making a good product and not giving quite enough back in Matt's opinion. Tough, tough cookie. I... I think they're... maybe I'm reading too much into it, but there might be some personal stuff, too, which they weren't not only not giving enough, but probably implicitly promising that they will give and then taking advantage of him in that way in his mind. Just like interpersonal interaction, and then and then you get like interpersonally frustrated. You forget like the bigger picture ethics of it. It's like when a guy keeps saying, you know, promising he'll do something. Sure. And then you and then you realize you wake up one day like a year or two later. Wait a minute. I was being lied to this whole time. And then that... I don't even know if it's about money. I... I'd get mad, too. It's totally fine to get mad when people disappoint you. That's not justification for upending decades of open- source licenses and the essential de facto case law we've established around it. This is why I chose to even weigh in on this, 'cause I like WordPress. I don't use WordPress. I'm not a part of that community. I don't actually have a dog in this fight. I'm biased if anything towards Matt just as a fellow BDFL. I would like to see him do well with this, but I also think there's some principles at stake here that ring much louder. I don't want Rails to suddenly be tainted by the fact that it's open source and whether companies can rely on it and build businesses on it because, \"Wait, maybe one day I'm going to turn Matt, and I'm going to turn Matt King, and I'm going to show up with a demand ransom letter.\" No, screw that. We... We have way more to protect here. There's way more at stake than your personal beef with someone or your perceived grievance over what you're owed. What would you recommend? What do you think you should do, can do to walk it back to to to heal? Decide. This is the curious thing. He could decide to give this up. That's very, very difficult for driven, ambitious people to do, to accept that they're wrong and to give up and lay down their sword. So, I had a hope earlier on in this that that was possible. I haven't seen any evidence that Matt is interested in that. And I find that deeply regretful, but that's her... his prerogative. I continue to speak out when he's violating the spirit and ethics of open source. But I wish he would just accept that this was a really bad idea. He just... he made a bad bet, and I thought... I think he thought he'd just get away with it, that they just pay up and that he could put pressure. I mean, I know that temptation when you sit as the head of a very important project. You know that that comes with a great degree of power, and you really need a great degree of discipline to rein that in and not exercise that power at every step where you feel aggrieved. I've felt aggrieved a million times over in the 20-plus years of Ruby on Rails. I've really tried very hard not to let those\n\n\nSometimes petty, sometimes substantial grievances over time seep into the foundation of the ecosystem and risk ruining everything.\n\nAs the king of the Rails kingdom, has the power gotten to your head over the years?\n\nI'm sure it has.\nI mean, who wouldn't?\nDo you pace around in your chamber?\nI do occasionally, and I do marvel at both what's been built, what's been possible.\nOver a million applications have been made with Ruby on Rails by one estimate that I've seen.\nBusinesses like Shopify and GitHub and a million others have been built on top of something that I started.\nThat's very gratifying, but you really have to be careful not to smell your own exhaust too much.\nAnd you have to be just as careful not to listen too much to the haters and not to listen too much to the super fans either, that you assess the value and the sort of principles of what you're working towards on its own merits, on your own scoreboard.\nI try to block that out and then just go, \"Well, I'm working on Rails because I love to write Ruby.\nI love to use Ruby to make web applications.\nThat's my north star.\nAnd I'll continue to do that.\nAnd I'll continue to share all of the open source gifts that I uncover along the ways.\"\nAnd and that's it.\nThat's enough, too.\nI don't have to get all of it out of it.\nThis is sometimes just as with the guy who thought I'd given up on being Jira or something instead of doing Basecamp.\nThere are people over the years who've asked, \"Why didn't you charge for Rails?\"\nLike, \"Don't you know how much money I've been made off Rails?\nIf we just look at something like Shopify, it's worth billions of dollars.\nI'm not a billionaire.\"\nAnd so freaking what?\nI got more than enough.\nI got plenty of my share.\nI will say though, I'm also introspective enough to realize that if it hadn't panned out as well as it did for me on my own business, maybe I would have been more tempted.\nMaybe if you see other people build huge successful companies off the back of your work and you really don't have a pot to piss in, you might be tempted to get a little upset about that.\nI've seen that in the Rails world as well, where there are people who contributed substantial bodies of work and then got really miffed when they didn't feel like they got enough back.\nI was fortunate enough that the business that Jason and I built with Ruby on Rails was as successful as it was, and I made the money I needed to make that I didn't need to chase the rest of it.\nBut we should also just make explicit that many people in your position chase, uh, chase the money.\nIt's not that difficult to chase.\nBasically, you turned away money.\nYou made a lot of decisions that just turn away money.\nMaybe I also think of this example with Matt.\nHe probably thought there was easy money for the taking.\nAnd it wasn't so easy, was it?\nIt looked like low-hanging dollar bills, and they turned out to be some really sour grapes.\nIt turned out he turned, he probably destroyed vast sums of money by undermining the whole WordPress trust and the ecosystem and putting question marks in the heads of folks who would choose to use WordPress or something else going forward.\nSo, I often think when people think like, \"Oh, you left money on the table.\"\nFirst of all, so what?\nI don't have to have all the money, but second of all, maybe the money wasn't on the table at all.\nAnd maybe the cost, even if you got the money, maybe the cost in other ways, like we've talked about, yes, would outweigh all the money that you could have possibly gotten.\nMeaning like, I think you said that the thing that makes you happy is flow and tranquility.\nThose two things beautifully, really beautifully put.\nAnd it, you know, gaining money might assign to your responsibility of running a larger thing that takes away the flow that you gain from being, from, from fundamentally, for you, what flow means is programming, and then tranquility is like, I think you also have a beautiful post of like, \"Nirvana is an empty schedule.\"\nWhen I look at a upcoming week and I see that I have no scheduled meetings at all, which is quite common, or maybe I just have one thing for one hour on one day, I think to myself, \"Do you know what?\nThis could very easily have been very different.\nWe could have been running a company of hundreds of people or thousands of people, and my entire calendar would have been packed solid with little Tetris blocks of other people's demands on my attention and time, and I would have been miserable as fuck.\"\nYep.\nAnd I look at that and go like that.\nWhat more can I ask for?\nWhich is a really nice state of being.\nI'd actually say I didn't have this always.\nI did have early on in my career some sense of like, \"I need a little more, a little more security.\"\nAnd I remember this really interesting study where a bunch of researchers asked people who had made certain amounts of money, \"How much money would it take for you to feel secure?\"\nThey'd ask people who had a million dollars net worth, \"How much money do you need?\"\n\"Probably need two million.\n2 million.\nThen it'd be good.\"\nThen they ask people with a net worth of five million, \"How much do you need?\"\n\"Ah, 10.\nI need 10.\"\nAsk people with 10 million, \"What do you need?\"\n\"20.\"\nEvery single time people would need double of what they did.\nI did that for a couple of doublings until I realized, \"You know what?\nThis is silly.\nI am already where I wished I would be and a million times over.\"\nSo what less is there to pursue?\nNow that doesn't mean that if more money is coming my way, I'm going to say no to it.\nOf course not.\nBut it does mean that I'm free to set other things higher.\nAnd I also do think you realize, as Jim Carrey would say, \"I wish everyone would get all the money that they wished for and they'd realize it wasn't the answer.\"\nThat money solves a whole host of problems and anxieties, and then it creates a bunch of new ones.\nAnd then it also doesn't touch a huge swath of the human experience at all.\nThe world is full of miserable, anxious, hurt rich people.\nIt's also full of miserable, anxious, poor people.\nAnd I'd rather be a miserable, anxious, rich person than a poor person.\nBut it isn't this magic wand that make everything go away.\nAnd that's again one of those insights, just like having children that you cannot communicate in words.\nI've never been able to persuade a person who's not wealthy that wealth wasn't going to solve all their problems.\nOne quote you've returned to often that I enjoy a lot is the Coco Chanel quote of \"the best things in in life are free and uh the second best things are very, very expensive.\"\nAnd I guess the task is to uh focus on uh surrounding yourself with the best things in life, like family and all of this, and not caring about the other stuff.\nI would even say you can care about the other stuff.\nJust know the order of priority.\nYeah.\nIf you are blessed with a partner that you love, some children that you adore, you've already won the greatest prize that most humans are able to achieve.\nMost humans in this world, if they are of marital age and they have children, if you ask them what's the most important thing, they would all say that.\nThey would all say that, no matter whether they're rich or poor.\nIt's easy to lose sight of that when you're chasing the second best things because, do you know what?\nThey're also very nice.\nMhm.\nI, I really like that Pagani Sonda.\nIt was a very expensive car, and I would had no chance of acquiring it if I hadn't become rather successful in business.\nSo, I don't want to dismiss it either.\nIt's great fun to have money.\nIt's just not as fun for quite as long or as deep as you think it is.\nAnd these other things, having an occupation and a pursuit that you enjoy, being able to carry burdens with a stiff up lip and with again a sense of meaning is incredible, to have family, to have friends, to have hobbies, to have all these things that are actually available to most people around the world.\nThat's winning.\nAnd it doesn't mean you have to discount your ambitions.\nIt doesn't mean you can't reach for more.\nBut it does mean it's pretty dumb if you don't realize that it's not going to complete you in some hocus pocus woo sense to make more.\nIt really isn't.\nWhat gives you hope about the future of this whole thing we have going on here, human civilization?\nI find it easier to be optimistic, optimistic than pessimistic because I don't know either way.\nSo if I get to choose, why not just choose to believe it's going to pan out?\nYeah.\nLike we suffer more in our imagination than we do in reality.\nThat's one of the quotes out of stoicism.\nAnd I also think we have a tendency, a lot of humans have a tendency to be pessimistic in advance for things they don't know how it's going to pan out.\nClimate change, for example, is making a lot of people very anxious and very pessimistic about the future.\nYou know, nothing.\n40 years ago, we thought the problem was that the planet was going to be too cool.\nI happen to believe that it's probably correct that the planet is getting too hot and that CO2 has something to do with it.\nWhether we have the right measures to fix it in time, if that's even possible or not, is completely up in the air.\nAnd we don't know.\nIf you convince yourself with such certainty that the world is going to turn to shit, it is right up here in your head today.\nClimate change might wipe out this entire species in 200 years.\nIt's not next year.\nIt's not 10 years from now.\nYour life might become more unpleasant, and there might be more negative effects and so on.\nYes.\nOkay.\nBut then deal with that hardship when it arrives.\nDon't take that in advance.\nHow are you helping earth by just walking around being depressed?\nI think our whole conversation today is also an indication there.\nIt's just two humans talking.\nThere's billions of us, and there is something about us that wants to solve problems and build cool stuff.\nYes.\nAnd so we're going to build our way out of whatever shit we get ourselves into.\nThis is what humans do.\nWe create problems for ourselves and and come up figure out how to build rocket ships to uh to get out of those problems.\nAnd sometimes the rocket ships create other problems, like nuclear warheads.\nAnd then we'll, I'm sure, I hope, figure out ways how to avoid those problems.\nAnd then there'll be nanobots.\nAnd then the aliens will come, and it'll be a massive war between the nanobots and the aliens, and and that will bring also all of us humans together.\nThe funny thing, just to pick on one of the points you mentioned, the atom bomb, for example, when that was first invented, a lot of people thought we have essentially ended life on earth, right?\nOr maybe we prevented World War II from happening in the past 80 years because assured mutual annihilation kept the superpowers from attacking each other at least head on and kept their fighting to proxy wars.\nYou know what?\nProxy wars are not great, but they're probably better than World War II with nuclear weapons.\nSo, it's quite difficult in the moment to tell what's actually benefit and what's not.\nAnd I think we should be a bit more humble.\nI've certainly become more humble over time of thinking I know which way it's going to turn.\nI think the pandemic was a huge moment for a lot of people where there was so much certainty about whether this intervention worked or that intervention didn't work, and most people were wrong.\nCertainly a lot of very smart people, very qualified people got that just utterly and catastrophyingly wrong.\nSo just a little intellectual humility.\nI think back upon that and go like, \"You know what?\nI'm not a PhD in viology.\nUm, and I don't claim that like I somehow saw how it all was going to play out, but the people who were really experts and that, they got a bunch of it wrong.\"\nNobody knows anything.\nI keep reminding myself of that every day.\nNo one knows anything.\nWe can't predict the economy a month out.\nWe can't predict world affairs a month.\nThe world is just too complicated.\nYeah.\nI, when I watched the Netflix documentary Chimp Empire and how, you know, there's a hierarchy of chimps, all of that looks eerily similar to us humans.\nWe're recent descendants.\nSo, these experts, some of the chimps are got a PhD, others don't.\nUh, others are really muscular, others are like beta male kind.\nThey're sucking up to the alpha.\nThere's a lot of interesting dynamics going on that really maps cleanly to the geopolitics of the day.\nThey don't have nuclear weapons, but the nature of their behavior is similar to ours.\nSo, I think I think we barely know what's going on.\nBut I do think there's like a basic uh will to cooperate.\nThere's a basic compassion that underlies are just the human spirit that's there.\nAnd maybe that is just me being optimistic, but if if that is indeed there, I think we're going to be okay.\nThe capacity is certainly there.\nWhether we choose that capacity or not, who knows and in what situation.\nI think accepting that we all have the capacity for both ways, for both incredible generosity and kindness and also cruelty.\nI think uh Young with his whole theory of the shadow was really spot on that we all have that capacity in us and accepting that it's our job to attempt to cultivate the better parts of our human nature is weighed against our propensity to sometime be the worst of ourselves.\nI'm excited to find out what's going to happen.\nIt's so awesome to be human.\nI don't want to die.\nI kind of want to be alive for a while to see all the cool shit we do.\nAnd uh one of the cool things I want to see is all the software you create and all the things you tweet, all the trouble you get yourself into on Twitter.\nUm David, yeah, I'm a huge fan.\nLike I said, thank you for everything you've done for the world, for the millions of developers you've inspired, and uh one of whom is me.\nAnd thank you for this awesome conversation, brother.\nThanks so much for having me.\nThanks for listening to this conversation with DHH.\nTo support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel.\nAnd now, let me leave you with some words from Rework by DHH and Jason Fried.\nWhat you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.\nThank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n",

    "cleanText": "If we want to avoid wars, we have to have serious deterrence because our enemies need to understand we will use selective, focused, overwhelming military power when we are facing threats like an Iranian nuclear weapon. I'm not seeing the peace through strength. I'm saying permanent militarism and permanent war through strength. Do you ever hold our adversaries responsible or do you just don't think we have any adversaries? The easiest kind of nuke to make out of uranium is a simple gun type nuke. Are you saying that Mossad fabricated it? That's what you're claiming. Here's the offer. Take it or leave it. Zero enrichment. Full dismantlement. The Iranians told the IAEA, \"You can inspect any five out of 10 facilities here. Cart Blanch, go ahead.\" And they did and found nothing. Experts in Iran's nuclear program, including David Albbright, who actually saw the archive, went in there, wrote a whole book on it, and there's a lot of detail about how Iran had an active nuclear weapons program called the Mad to build five nuclear weapons. I have to refute virtually everything he just said, which is completely false. I mean, really everything. There was not one thing I said that was true. Just one thing. I mean, Iran is a nation over there somewhere. You got that part right. 22 years of working on Iran, and I got that right. But do you know the population of 92 million? Okay, give me a pound, dude. There we go. Agreement.\n\nThe following is a debate between Scott Horton and Mark Dubowitz on the topic of Iran and Israel. Scott Horton is author and editorial director of anti-war.com, host of the Scott Horton Show, and for the past three decades, a staunch critic of U.S. foreign policy and military interventionism. Mark Dubowitz is a chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, host of the Iran Breakdown podcast, and he has been a leading expert on Iran and its nuclear program for over 20 years. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel. If you do, I promise to work extremely hard to always bring you nuanced, long- form conversations with a very wide range of interesting people from all walks of life. And now, dear friends, here's Scott Horton and Mark Dubowitz.\n\nGentlemen. All right. It's great to have you here. Uh let's try to have a nuanced discussion slash debate and uh maybe even steel man opposing perspectives as much as possible. All right. As it stands now, there's a barely stable ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Let's uh maybe rewind a little bit. Uh can we first lay out the context for this Iran-Israel War and try to describe the key events that happened over the past two weeks? Maybe even the uh a bit of the deep roots of the conflict.\n\nSure. Like first of all, thanks so much for having me on. Great to be on with Scott. I know he and I don't agree on a lot, but I certainly admire the passion and and the dedication to stopping wars. So that's something we want to talk about. So let's talk about how we got to this war. So, President Trump comes into office and immediately lays out that his Iran strategy is maximum pressure on the regime and he will not allow Iran have a nuclear weapon and he and he makes that clear consistently. I think made it very clear during his first term made a clear throughout his career and thus beguns this process with the Iranians which has kind of multiple tracks but the one that Trump sees most interested in at the time is the diplomatic track and he makes it very clear from the beginning in a sort of Oval Office remark. He says the Iranians can either blow up their nuclear program under U.S. supervision or someone's going to blow it up for them. And even though, you know, at the time we think Netanyahu is really trying to push the president into a military campaign, well, I'm sure we'll talk about that throughout the podcast, the president authorizes his lead negotiator and close friend Steve Witkoff to begin outreach to the Iranians and and thus begun the Oman round. And it's Oman round because it's taking place in Oman with mediation efforts by the Omanis. There are five rounds of negotiations with the Iranians. And through the course of those negotiations, the U.S. finally puts on the table an offer for Iran. We'll talk about the details of that. The Iranians reject that offer and we're now into the sixth round which is supposed to take place on a Sunday. Uh on the Thursday before the Sunday, the Israelis strike and they go after in a rather devastating campaign over a matter of now 12 days. They go over and go after Iran's nuclear program, the key nuclear sites. Um, going after weapon scientists who are responsible for building Iran's nuclear weapons program, and also go after top IRGC, Islamic Revolutionary Guard commanders as well as top military commanders. And yet, there's still this one site that is the most fortified site. It's called Fordo. It's an enrichment facility. It's buried under a mountain, goes about 80 m deep. It's encased in concrete. It has advanced centrifuges and highly enriched uranium. The Israelis can do damage to it, but it's clear it's going to take the United States and our military power in order to severely degrade this facility. And Trump orders the United States Air Force to fly B2 bombers and drop 12 massive Ordinance penetrators, which are these 30,000 pound bombs on Fordo in order to, as he said, obliterate it more realistically, to severely degrade it. So that happens. Um, and then he offers the Iranians, as he's been offering all the way through, you have an option. You can go back to Oman. I told you Oman and you decided to force me to go to Fordo but now we can go back for negotiations and he forces a ceasefire on the Iranians gets the Israelis to agree and that's where we are today like we're at a as you say a tentative ceasefire that just came into effect and we'll see now if the Iranians decide to take President Trump on his repeated offers join him in Aman for another round of negotiations.\n\nScott, is there some stuff you want to add to that?\n\nSure. Well, he started with uh January, right? Trump's second term here and the maximum pressure campaign. Essentially, as should be clear to everyone now, all these negotiations were just a pretext for war. Trump and his entire cabinet must have known that the Ayatollah is not going to give up all enrichment. That is their latent nuclear deterrent. Their posture has been heavily implied. Don't attack us and we won't make a nuke. While America's position was if you make a nuke, if you start to, we'll attack you. So, it was the perfect standoff. But what happened was, and you might remember a few weeks ago, there was some talk about, well, maybe we could find a way to compromise on some enrichment. Maybe they could do a consortium with the Saudis. Maybe there's some way that we And then, nope, the pressure came down. No enrichment. Zero enrichment. But that's a red line. Everyone knows that there's and even now uh it's probably less likely than ever that they're going to give up enrichment. Sure, they bombed Fordo, but they didn't destroy every last centrifuge in that place. And the Iranians are already announcing that they're already begun construction on another facility under a taller mountain buried even deeper. And you know, they figured out how to enrich uranium hexaflloride gas, you know, what 20 years ago now. And uh they will always be able to. And this is the slippery slope that we're on with these wars is in fact um I saw our friend here on TV the other day as he almost pretty much just implied there saying well now Trump has to go in. You know we were told it's just Israel doing it. Don't worry. But then no Trump has to hit Fordo or else now they'll break out toward a nuclear weapon. So, in for a penny, in for a pound, in for a ton, and now once we bomb Fordo again and Natans again and the new facility again, then it'll be decided that no, as Benjamin Netanyahu said the other day, you know what would really solve this problem? If we just kill the Ayatollah, then everything will be fine. Then we'll have a regime change. And then what? Then we'll have a civil war with bin Laden again in the catbird seat just like George Bush put them in Iraq and Barack Obama put them in Libya and in Syria and we'll have Azeris and Belooki suicide bombers and Shiite uh you know revolutionaries and whoever all vying for power in the new absolute chaos stand. If you listen to the administration and Mr. to do was they're essentially just implying that like, oh yeah, mission accomplished. We did it. Their nuclear program is destroyed. Now we don't have to worry about that anymore. But that's not true. Now it there's every reason to believe and we don't know for sure. There's every reason to believe that at least is much more likely now that the Ayatollah will change his mind about God changing his mind and we'll say that actually maybe we do need a nuclear deterrent. That's really what it's been for this whole time is a bluff. We have bullets in one pocket, revolver in another. Let's not you and me fight and escalate this thing. It's the same position, by the way, as Japan and Germany and Brazil. Two of the three of those are under America's nuclear umbrella, I admit. But still, where they've proven they've mastered the fuel cycle and they can make nuclear weapons. But hey, since nobody's directly threatening them now, why escalate things and go ahead and make atom bombs? That has been their position the whole time because after all, they could not break out and make a nuke without everyone in the world knowing about it. And that's why, Lex, and I'm sure you can vouch for me on this, if you've been watching TV over the past few weeks, you'll hear Marco Rubio and all the government officials and all the Warhawks say, \"Oh yeah, 60%, 60%. What do you think they need with that 60%.\" Implying that, oh yeah, see, they're racing toward a bomb. But you see how they always just imply that. They won't come right out and say that cuz it's a ridiculous lie. They've been they could have enriched up to 90 plus% uranium 235 this whole time. The reason they were enriching up to 60% was in reaction to Israeli sabotage. First of all, assassinating their nuclear scientists and then their sabotage at Natans. They started enriching up to 60% just like they did in the Obama years to have a bargaining chip to negotiate away. Under the JCPOA, they shipped out every bit of their enriched uranium to France to be turned into fuel rods and then shipped back into the country to be used in their reactors. And so, they're just trying to get us back in that deal. It is an illusion. It is. And I don't know exactly what's in this man's mind, but it's just not true that they're making nuclear weapons. And it has been a lie of Benjamin Netanyahu and his lood party regime and for that matter the Kadima regime of Ahudmer before him that this is a threat that has to be preempted when in fact it never was anything more than a latent nuclear deterrent.\n\nMaybe a good question to ask here is what is the goal for the United States in Iran in relation to the nuclear uh Iran's nuclear program? What is the red line here? Does Iran have this uh need for a latent nuclear deterrent and what what is the thing that's acceptable to the United States and to the rest of the world? What should be acceptable?\n\nYeah, L. So, there was a lot to unpack there. So let's sort of just back up a little bit. Let's talk about first of all the regime itself. Islamic Republic of Iran came into power in 1979. Um it has been declared a leading state sponsor of terrorism by multiple administrations dating back to the Clinton administration um by Obama, by Biden, by Trump and it is a regime that has killed and maimed thousands of Americans, not not to mention obviously uh hundreds of thousands of Middle Easterners. Um it is a regime that has lied about its nuclear program. It never actually disclosed its nuclear sites. All these sites were discovered by um Iranian opposition groups, by western intelligence agencies. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the UN agency responsible for preventing proliferation, has come out again and again over many, many years in reports, very detailed reports describing Iran's nuclear weapons program. Um, there have been multiple attempts at diplomacy with with Iran. I'm sure we're going to talk about it. Scott mentioned the JCPOA, so we should certainly talk about the JCPOA, which was the 2015 deal that Barack Obama reached with Iran. Um, but multiple attempts to to actually get the Iranians to negotiate away their nuclear weapons program. I mean, it's worth mentioning that if Iran wanted to have civilian nuclear energy, there are 23 countries in the world that have it, but they don't have enrichment and they don't have reprocessing. uh we we sign these deals called the gold standard with the South Koreans, with the Amiradis, with others and we say if you want civilian energy, you can have power plants, you can buy your fuel rods from abroad, but there's no reason to have enrichment or plutonium reprocessing because those are the key capabilities you need to develop nuclear weapons. Now the five countries that have those capabilities and don't have nuclear weapons are Argentina, Brazil, Holland, Germany, and Japan. And I think it's the view of many administrations over many years, including many European leaders, that that the Islamic Republic of Iran is very different from those aforementioned countries, because that it is been dedicated to terrorism. It's been killing Americans and other Westerners and other Middle Easterners, and it is a dangerous regime. You don't want to have that dangerous regime retaining the key capabilities and needs to develop nuclear weapons. But I but I want to kind of get back more to the present mentioned this was around negotiations out of Oman. Scott saying that President Trump had said here's the offer. Take her to leave it. Zero enrichment full dismantlement. Well, in fact, that wasn't the offer that was presented to the Iranians at Oman. The offer was a one-page offer and it said you can temporarily enrich above ground. You've got to render your below ground facilities quote nonoperational and then at some time in the future three four years as Scott said there'll be a consortium that'll be built not on Iranian territory. It'll be a partnership with the Saudis and the Amiradis. It'll be under IAEA supervision and that enrichment facility will create fuel rods for your nuclear reactors. So that was the offer presented to Iran and that offer would\n\n\ncome with significant sanctions relief.\nBillions of dollars that would go to the regime.\nObviously, the economy there has been suffering.\nThe regime has not had the resources that it's had in the past to fund its, what I call, its axis of misery, its proxy terror armies around the world.\nAnd it was a good offer.\nAnd I was shocked that Kame rejected it.\nUm, he did reject it.\nAnd I think he rejected it because I think he believed that he could continue to do to President Trump what he had done to President Obama, which is just continue to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze the Americans at the table in order to ensure that he could keep all these nuclear facilities, all these nuclear capabilities so that at a time of his choosing, when President Trump is gone, he can develop nuclear weapons.\nNow, it is a bit interesting to say that Iran has no intention to develop nuclear weapons.\nAnd let's examine the nuclear program and ask, does this sound like a regime that's not interested in building nuclear weapons?\nSo, they built deeply buried underground enrichment facilities that they hid from the international community and they didn't disclose.\nThey had an active nuclear warhead program called Ahmad, which ended in 2003 formally when the U.S. invaded Iraq.\nAnd we know that because not only has that been detailed by the IAEA, but actually Mossad in a daring operation in Thran took out a nuclear archive and brought it back to the West.\nAnd then the IAEA, the U.S., and the intelligence communities went after this detailed archive, went into it, and discovered that this supreme leader Ayatollah had an active program to build five atomic warheads and was a very detailed program with blueprints and designs, all of which was designed under Ahmad to build a nuclear weapons program.\nSo again, it's interesting to say that he doesn't have the intention to build nuclear weapons when he actually had an active nuclear weapons program.\nU and we can talk about what happened to that program after 2003, and there's a lot of interesting details.\nSo when you combine the fact that he has an active nuclear weapons program, he has sites that are buried deep underground, he has weapon scientists who come out of the Ahmad program and continued to work on the initial metallurgy work and computer modeling designed to actually begin that process of building a warhead.\nAnd all of this has been hidden from the international community.\nHe has spent estimates of a half a trillion dollars on his nuclear program in direct costs and in sanctions costs.\nAnd one has to ask, and I think it's an interesting question to compare the UAE and Iran, right?\nThe UAE signed the gold standard.\nThey said we'll have no enrichment capability or reprocessing.\nThey spent about $20 billion on that, and it supplies 25% of their electrical generation.\nKame spent a half a trillion, and that program supplies maybe 3% of their electrical needs.\nIn fact, they have a reactor that they bought from the Russians called Bucher.\nAnd there that reactor, it's exactly what you'd want in a proliferation-proof reactor.\nThey buy fuel rods from the Russians.\nThey use it, and they send the spent fuel back to Russia so it cannot be reprocessed into plutonium.\nSo, I just think it's important for your listeners to understand just some of the technical nuclear history here in order to unpack this question of did Kam want nuclear weapons?\nWhat was his goal here?\nAnd then we can talk about was this the right operation in order to for the U.S. to order the B2 bombers to strike these facilities in what again was a limited operation as President Trump has said and in order to drive the Iranians back to the negotiating table and finally do the deal that President Trump has asked them to do since he came into office in January.\nYeah, that is one of the fascinating questions whether this operation midnight hammer increased or decreased the chance that the Iran will develop a nuclear weapon.\nBefore you ask any more questions, I have to refute virtually everything he just said, which is completely false.\nI mean, really everything.\nThere was not one thing I said that was true.\nJust one thing.\nI mean, Iran is a nation over there somewhere.\nYou got that part right.\nAll right.\n22 years of working on Iran and I got that right.\nBut do you know the population of Iran?\n92 million.\nOkay.\nSo, first of all, they were trying to buy a lightwater reactor from the Europeans or the Chinese in the 1990s, and Bill Clinton wouldn't let them.\nAnd put tremendous pressure on China to prevent them from selling them a lightwater reactor, a turnkey reactor that produces waste that's so polluted with impurities that you can't make nuclear weapons fuel out of it.\nBy the way, they never have to this day had a reprocessing facility for reprocessing plutonium, even their current plutonium waste for their he from their heavy water reactor at Bucher to make weapons fuel out of that.\nThey have no plutonium route to the bomb under the JCPOA.\nIraq, not Bucher.\nThere's a difference between Iraq.\nIraq is a, Iraq is where they pour concrete into the reactor and shut it down.\nAnd the reason they poured concrete under the JCPOA, not they, but the Obama administration, he's right, under the JCPOA poured concrete into Kindria in order to prevent them from using that reactor to reprocess plutonium.\nSo there's a distinction between Iraq and Bucher.\nScott's exactly right.\nBusher is a reactor, a heavy water reactor provided by the Russians, as I described, for the generation of electricity.\nIt's proliferation proof.\nIraq has is the opposite.\nIt's a heavy water reactor that was built for a plutonium pathway to nuclear weapons, which is exactly why under the JCPOA, they literally had to pour concrete into the into the middle of it to prevent it from reprocessing plutonia.\nI think we're going to need a scientist to come in here and split the difference.\nOr maybe we need to go and look up some IAEA documents cuz I don't believe that Iraq ever had a reprocessing facility for their plutonium waste.\nAnd the deal under the JCPOA, the Russians would come and get all their plutonium waste, which the waste comes out all polluted and not useful.\nYou need the reprocessing facility to get all of the impurities to clarify.\nIt could be that I'm wrong about that, but I don't believe that they ever had a reprocessing facility at Iraq that they could use to remove all those impurities and then have weapons plutonium fuel as the North Koreans do.\nSo the Obama administration was very clear under the JCPOA, we are going to pour concrete into the into the Iraq facility as as Scott acknowledged because we are concerned that Iraq can be used for reprocessing plutonium for plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon.\ncan be used, but we don't know if it was used.\nOh, we know it never was.\nThere never was any reprocessing of weapons fuel there.\nBut there was concrete.\nI'm I'm happy to there's no indication.\nFor your viewers who are interested and not to plug my own podcast, so I apologize, but it is a very good podcast.\nI just recently had David Albbright on my podcast, who is actually a physicist and a weapons inspector and goes into a lot of detail about the Iranian nuclear program.\nPlease listen to the podcast.\nIran Breakdown, by the way, is the name of the podcast.\nYeah.\nAnd David's the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, by the way, spent decades on this.\nAnd to his credit, he was one of the deep skeptics of the Bush administration's rush to war with Iraq.\nAnd that's not true.\nHe vouched for claims that there were chemical weapons in Iraq and later said he was sorry for it.\nAgain, I mentioned the Bush administration's rush to war based on their claims that Saddam was building nuclear weapons.\nHe did debunk the aluminum tubes, though.\nHe debunked it, and he was a deep skeptic again of the of the Russia War in Iraq.\nYou know the argument today, Lex, which I think is the more interesting argument because there are very few people left today who don't believe that the Iranians were building the nuclear weapons capability that gave them the option to build nuclear weapons.\nI already said that.\nWe can debate, we can debate whether they had decided to, and and we I'm interested to hear Scott's opinion on this, but the recent intelligence that has come out that the Iranian nuclear weapons scientists have begun preliminary work on building a warhead came out from where this intelligence that came out, who put that in?\nIsraeli claims not verified by the U.S. and the Wall Street Journal anywhere, right?\nLet's talk about, let's talk about all of my list of reputations of all your false claims.\nCan the Wall Street Journal did verify this?\nLawrence Norman to refute one time.\nLawrence Norman actually wrote a piece.\nThis was during the Biden administration.\nUm, because the Biden DNI had actually come out and for the first time in their annual threat assessment had removed a line that said Iran is not working currently working on developing any capabilities that would put it in a position to to actually deliver a nuclear warhead.\nAnd what be what became the Lawrence Norman piece in the Wall Street Journal was that there actually was initial work done on metallurgy and on computer modeling.\nAnd so those actually were defined terms in section T of the 2015 JCPOA, which defined weaponization in that section.\nAnd metallergy and computer modeling were some of the initial steps.\nSo that the DNI was very concerned under Biden that these initial steps meant that either Kame had given the green lights or nuclear weapons scientists in order to get ahead of the boss so they could be in a position if he decided to move forward on this were in a position and their timelines were therefore expedited.\nSo it's interesting.\nI mean, again, you've got the DNI under Biden, you've got the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, you've got Israeli intelligence, you've got the Wall Street Journal, and you've got the IAEA asking questions of Iran on its past weaponization activities.\nWhy are you denying us?\nWho's the dog that didn't bark there?\nThe current director of national intelligence who issued her threat assessment, Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who issued her threat assessment in February, that repeated the exact same language that from the national intelligence estimate of 2007 and that the CIA and the NIE, the National Intelligence Council have reaffirmed repeatedly ever since then, which is that Supreme Leader has not decided to pursue nuclear weapons.\nHe has not made the political decision to pursue nuclear weapons.\nShe testified in fact in under oath in front of the Senate in March.\nAnd then according to CNN and the New York Times, there was a brand new that assessment that was put together the week before the attack was launched reaffirming the same thing.\nAnd at least in history, if you read it in Harets, MSAD agreed with the CIA.\nI'd like to just sort of quote CIA director John Radcliffe because Scott brought brought up the CIA and the intelligence community.\nI think Radcliffe had a good way of looking at this is and that he said is, you know, when you're in the 99 yard line as a football team, you have the intention to score a goal, quote unquote.\nAnd what what he was what he was actually pointing to is let's not talk about this debate about whether Kame had given the order or not given the order because Kame knows that if he gives an order, the U.S. and Israeli intelligence community will pick up on that order and that will be the trigger for strikes.\nWhat Rackcliffe is saying is that Kame had built the nuclear weapons capability, he's at the 99 yard line and both the CIA and European leaders, European intelligence community has said for years that if Iran has that capability and they're on the 99 yard line, at that point it's going to be too late to stop them once that decision is made to to assemble the final warhead, which by the way is the final piece of what you need for a deliverable nuclear weapon.\nThat's not true at all.\nRight.\nThey have to resort to a crude analogy about football yard lines because they can't say the truth, which is that they had zero weapons grade uranium.\nThey were not producing it.\nThey were trying to get the United States back in the deal that they are still officially within the JCPOA with the rest of the UN Security Council wherein they shipped all of their enriched uranium stockpile out of the country to France to be transferred to fuel rods.\nTheir insistence was on their continued ability to enrich uranium.\nAnd so this goes to one of the things that he at least sort of brought up that deserves addressing.\nWhen Trump came into power in 2017, he decided on this Israeli influence maximum pressure campaign and he said the JCPOA was the worst deal in the history of any time any two men ever shook hands and all these kinds of things in his hyperbolic way, which of course made it very difficult for him to figure out a way to stay in the thing or to to compromise along its lines.\nUh, but the fact of the matter is if he had just played it straight and said, &quot;Listen, Ayatollah, we don't have to be friends, but we do have a deal here, which my predecessor struck with you, but I don't like these sunset provisions, and I want to send my guys over there and see if we can figure out a way to convince you that we really wish you'd shut down commto together or this or that or the other thing.&quot;\nAnd tried to approach them in good faith.\nWe talk about yard lines and things.\nWe had a JCPOA.\nOkay.\nSo toward peace, we were past the 50-yard line.\nDonald Trump could have gone to Tyrron and shook hands with the Ayatollah.\nAs Dick Cheney complained that we had cold relations with Iran back in 1998 when he was the head of Allebertton and said, &quot;We can do business with these guys.&quot;\nUm, Donald Trump could have gone right over there and done business, and instead he gave into Netanyahu's lies in this ridiculous hoax that they had uncovered all these Iranian nuclear documents, which he pretends is legit, where all they did was recycle the fake Israeli forged smoking laptop of 2005, which they lied and pretended was the laptop of an Iranian scientist that was smuggled out of Iran by his wife and had all this proof of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program on it.\nBut every bit of that was refuted, including the thing about the warhead, he said, was refuted by David Albbright and his friend David Sanger in the New York Times that all those sketches of the warhead for the missile were wrong because when MSAD forged the documents, they were making a good educated guess, but they didn't know that Iran had completely redesigned the nose cone of their mid-range missiles and had an entirely different nose cone that would require an entirely different warhead than that described in the documents.\nAnd why would they have been designing a warhead to fit in a nose cone that they were abandoning?\nAnd so that was refuted.\nDavid Albbright completely discredited your claims there, pal.\nAnd then they later admitted that it was a CIA laptop.\nThere was no laptop.\nAnd they later admitted Ali Hin\n\n\nOnin admitted, uh, who was a very hawkish, uh, uh, one of the, not director, but a high-level executive at the International Atomic Energy Agency, admitted that that intelligence was brought into the stream by the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, a communist terrorist cult that used to work for the Ayatollah during the revolution, then turned on him and he turned on them and kicked them out.\nThen they went to work for Saddam Hussein, where they helped crush the Shiite and Kurdish insurrection of 1991, and then they became America, Donald Rumsfeld's and Ariel Sharon's sock puppets, and later Ahoud Almer's sock puppets when the U.S. uh, invaded Iraq and took possession of them.\nThey're now under American protection in Albania.\nAnd these are the same cooks who, just a few weeks ago, you might remember, said, \"Look, new satellite pictures of a whole new uh, nuclear facility in Iran.\"\nIsn't it funny how no one ever brought that up again?\nDidn't bomb it.\nIt was nothing.\nIt was fake.\nJust like before when they said, \"Hey, look, here's a picture of a vault door.\"\nAnd behind that is where the secret nuclear weapons program is.\nExcept, turned out that vault door was a stock photo from a vault company.\nIt meant nothing.\nAnd they had repeatedly, uh, you know, made claims that were totally refuted.\nJust like I'm about to refute his claim that they ever were the ones who revealed, for example, Natanz.\nHe was implying that Natanz and Qom were both buried and hidden until revealed, I think you said, by dissident groups.\nThat is the MEK sock puppets of the Israelis.\nBut it was your friend David Albright, not the Israeli Mossad through the MEK, who revealed Natanz's facility.\nAsk him, he'll fist fight you over it.\nHe claims credit.\nHe was first and said, \"This is a facility.\"\nHowever, they were not in violation of their safeguards agreement with the IAEA.\nThey were still six months away from introducing any nuclear material to that facility.\nAnd so when it was revealed, they weren't in violation of anything.\nAnd, uh, and then on, we had a huge fight about this at the time.\nThe party line came down in from all the government officials and the media that they had just exposed the facility there.\nQom is the same thing.\nUh, when in fact that wasn't true.\nThe IA, the, the Iranians had announced to the IAEA that we have built a new facility here and we are going to introduce nuclear material into it within six months.\nSo here's your official notification.\nAnd then a few days later, they just pretended to expose it when it was the Iranians themselves who had admitted to it in, in, uh, going along with their, uh, uh, obligations under their safeguards agreement.\nSo it's just completely wrong.\nWhy do they bury him?\nThey buried them for protection because clearly the Israelis have indicated since the 1990s that they consider any nuclear program in Iran to be the same thing as an advanced nuclear weapons program.\nYou're hearing that today.\nFor them to have a nuclear facility at all is is equivalent to them going ahead and breaking out and making a nuclear weapon.\nAnd so, of course, they know that they have to have it buried to protect it from Israel.\nThat doesn't mean that they are trying to get nukes.\nIt does mean, as I already said, that they wanted to prove to the world that they know how to enrich uranium and that they have facilities buried deeply enough where if we attack them, that would incentivize them to making nukes, and then we would might be unable to stop them without going all the way toward a regime change, which they're bluffing, basically betting that we won't go that far, considering how gigantic their country is and how mountainous and populous it is compared to Iraq next door.\nNow, here's some more things that he said that weren't true.\nSo, he said, \"Iran has been killing Americans all this time.\"\nWell, that's almost always a reference to Beirut 1983, which you can read in the book by Way of Deception by Victor Ostrovsky, the former Mossad officer, that the Israelis knew that they were building that truck bomb to bomb the Marines with and withheld that information from the United States and said that's what they get for sticking their big noses in.\nAnd, uh, that is in the book by Way of Deception by Victor Ostrovsky.\nAnd by the way, the Israelis were friends with them at with Iran at the time in, uh, all through the 1980s.\nAnd it was just a couple of years later when Ronald Reagan sold Iran missiles and using the Israelis as cutouts to do so when he switched sides temporarily in the Iran-Iraq War.\nAnd so that's just, and that was in 1983.\nIf Ronald, if Ronald Reagan can sell missiles a year or two years after that, three years after that, then surely the United States and the Ayatollah can bury the hatchet from that.\nAnd no one's ever even, I don't believe, ever really proven that Tyrron ordered that.\nIt was a Shiite militia backed by Iran that sort of proto-Hezbollah that did that attack that killed those Marines.\nUm, and if there's some responsibility for then damn them, like if there's direct responsibility for that, not just their support for the group, then damn them for that.\nBut that's still no reason in the world to say that we can't get along with them now when that was in the same year Return of the Jedi came out.\nOkay.\nAnd then, uh, the other one, and this is always referred to, you'll see this on TV news today.\nAnyone watching this, turn on TV news and you'll hear them say Iran killed 600 Americans in Iraq War II.\nBut that's a lie.\nThere was a gigantic propaganda campaign by Dick Cheney and his co-conspirators David Petraeus and Michael Gordon of the New York Times, now at the Wall Street Journal, where they lied and lied like the devil for about five, six months in early 2007, that every time a Shiite set off a roadside bomb, these new improved copper cord enhanced, uh, uh, they're called EFPs, explosively formed penetrators.\nNow, anytime that happened, Iran did it, which is what George Bush called shorthanding it.\nYeah.\nIn other words, just implying the lie.\nWhat they're saying is Iran backed Muqtada al-Sadr, also, also, who actually they were fighting the whole war for him.\nHe remains a powerful kingmaker in that country this day.\nHe was part of the United Iraqi Alliance.\nAnd in fact, as long as we're taking a long form here, he was the least Iran-tied of the three major factions in the United Iraqi Alliance in Iraq War II.\nThe other two major factions were Dawa and the Supreme Islamic Council, and they had been living in Iran for the last 20 years.\nThey're the ones who came and took over Baghdad.\nMuqtada al-Sadr is Shiite and close to Iran, but he's also an Iraqi nationalist, and at times he allied with the Sunnis and tried to, in, tried to limit American and Iranian influence in the country, was more of an Arab and an Iraqi nationalist.\nAnd the Americans decided they hated him the most, not because he was the most Iran-tied, but because he was willing to tell us and them to get the hell out.\nAnd America was betting that if we backed the same parties that Iran backed in Iraq War, that they would eventually end up needing our money and guns more than they would need their Iranian friends and co-religionists and sponsors next door, which of course did not work out.\nAnd America's had minimal influence in supermajority Shiite Iraq ever since the end of Iraq War II.\nAnd we can get back later in the show to how Israel helped lie us into that horrific war as well.\nBut the fact of the matter is it was not Iranians setting off those bombs.\nAnd it was not even Iranians making those bombs.\nAnd I show in my book enough already.\nI have a solid dozen sources.\nEnough already.\nThank you.\nI have a solid dozen sources, including, uh, Michael Gordon's own colleague, Alyssa Rubin, at the New York Times and many others, where they found these bomb factories in Shiite Iraq.\nThey were being made by Shiite Arab Iraqis.\nAnd when they, David Petraeus was going to have a big press conference and they laid out all the components, all the reporters gathered around and they started noticing that the components said made in UAE, made in Haditha, that is Iraq.\nIn other words, there was no evidence whatsoever that these came from Iran.\nAnd then they called off the press conference and Steven Hadley, George Bush's second secret, uh, national security adviser, admitted that, yeah, we didn't have the evidence that we needed to, uh, present that.\nAnd I also quote two, one Marine and one high-level army intelligence officer in there, uh, who were deeply involved in Iraq War, uh, reconfirming that that there was never any evidence that these bombs were coming across, uh, from Iran or especially that then even if they were, that that was at the direction of the Quds Force or the Ayatollah.\nThis was all just a propaganda campaign because Dick Cheney and David Petraeus were trying to give George Bush a reason to hit IRGC bases and start the war in 2007.\nAnd this sounds crazy, but there's like four major confirming sources for it.\nDick Cheney's national security advisor, David Wormser, who was the author of the clean break strategy, which we're going to talk about today.\nDavid Wormser in 2007 was saying, \"We want to work with the Israelis to start the war with Iran to force George Bush to do an end run around George Bush and force him into the war.\"\nAnd that was reported originally by Steven Clemens in the Washington Note, but it was later confirmed in the New York Times and by the Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman in his book Angler on Dick Cheney that there was this huge, this was the end that they were going for was they were trying so hard to force a war in 2007.\nAnd it was the commander of Centcom, Admiral Fallon, who said, \"Over my dead body, we are not doing this.\"\nAnd then a few months later, the National Intelligence Council put out their NIE saying that there is no nuclear weapons program at all.\nAnd W. Bush complained in his memoir, lect that in, in his story, it's the Saudi king, his royal highness Abdullah, rather than, um, Ahoud Dolmer, but he's saying, \"I'm sorry, your highness, majesty.\nI can't attack Iran's nuclear program cuz my own intelligence agency says they don't have a military program.\nSo, how am I supposed to start a war with him when my own intelligence agencies say that?\"\nThis is what Donald Trump just did.\nStart it anyway.\nHad his man Rubio say, \"Well, screw the intelligence.\nI don't care what it says.\nWe can just do this if we want to.\"\nSo, first, let me say on the cover of Enough Already, devastating.\nDaniel Ellsberg, outstanding.\nDaniel L. Davis, essential.\nRon Paul, you are respected by a very large number of people.\nYou have decades of experience in this.\nSame thing with Mark, extremely respected by a very large number of people, experts.\nThere's a lot of disagreements here, and we're going to, unfortunately, leave a lot of the disagreements on the table for the, uh, aforementioned nuclear scientists to, to deconstruct later.\nSo let's not like try to, every single claim does not have to be perfectly refuted.\nLet's just leave it on the table, the statements as they stand, and let's try to also find things we kind of agree on and try, I know this might be difficult, but to steel man the other side, that's the thing I would love to ask you, uh, maybe give Mark a chance to speak a little bit, but to, to try to, for both of you, to try to steel man the other side so people who are concerned about, uh, Iran developing a nuclear program can you steel man that case and the same, the people...\nI did in my opening statement, quite frankly, I, I'm, I don't carry any brief for the Ayatollah.\nI'm a Texan.\nI don't give a damn about what some Shiite theocrat says about nothing, right?\nMy interest is the people of this country and its future and what's true.\nAnd so I don't mind telling you, even though the Iranians never said, \"We're building a latent nuclear weapons capability.\"\nThat's clearly what they're doing is showing that they can make a nuke, so don't make me make a nuke.\nThat has been their position.\nTheir position has not been, \"I'm making a nuke so I can wipe Israel off the map.\"\nTheir position has been, \"Look, if you guys don't attack us, we could just keep this civilian program the way it is.\"\nAnd again, there's always the implication that they're just building up this uranium stockpile, but no, they're not.\nThat was in reaction to one, Donald Trump leaving the deal in 2018.\nTwo, the assassination in December of 2020 of the Iranian, uh, nuclear scientist, Far Cazada, or however you say that, and then in April of '21, the sabotage at Natanz.\nAnd there's a Reuters story that says right after they sabotaged Natanz, that's when the Ayatollah decided, let's enrich up to 60%.\nWhich, why stop 30% short of 90% 235?\nIt's because they're not even making a threat.\nThey're built, they're making like the most latent up threat, a bargaining chip to negotiate away.\nThey're trying to put pressure on the United States to come back to the table.\nThat's not the same as racing to the bomb.\nThat's why Marco Rubio says, \"Never mind the intelligence,\" cuz the intelligence says what I just said.\nYeah.\nPoint made.\nLet's try, let's try if possible to keep it to like a minute and two of back and forth, except, you know, the problem is we're talking about nuclear stuff, which is all very complicated and most people don't know much about it, which is what the war party is relying on, that people just hear nuclear, afraid, and mushroom cloud and and give the benefit of the doubt to the hawks, and so we got to get into the details of this stuff.\nDetails, 100%, but I like the tension between two people with different perspectives exploring those details, and the more we can go back and forth, the better, and there's a lot of disagreement on the table.\nI personally enjoy learning from the disagreement.\nI think that was a very long list of claims that he made though, where I felt like I had to go down the list as much as I could cuz there was a lot.\nI think you addressed like maybe one or two claims and it took 15 minutes.\nSo that's what I'm just commenting on.\nLet's do one at a time.\nI like the tension of the debate of back and forth.\nThat's that's all.\nMark, do you want to do you want to comment on stuff a little bit here?\nWhich, pick, pick whichever topic you want to go with here.\nYeah, there's a lot there.\nSo, um, just a couple things I think that are worth your viewers knowing because Scott's right.\nI mean, the nuclear physics is complicated and it's also important.\nUm, so the Iranians have assembled about, they say about 15 to 17 bombs worth of 60%\n\n\nEnriched uranium. And I think it's always important for your listeners to understand what does this all mean? Enriched to 3.67% to 20% to 60% and then to 90% weapons grade uranium, like what, what does this actual process mean? Um, first of all, obviously, enriched uranium is a key capability to develop a nuclear weapon. It can also be used for other purposes, civilian purposes and research purposes. You can use it to power a nuclear submarine. So, let's just, if you don't mind, if I could just break it down.\n\nThat's fascinating.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nJust, just, I think it's again important just to understand the, the sort of basics before we jump into the allegations and claims and counter claims. So, if you're going to enrich to 3.67%, enrich uranium, um, that's for civilian nuclear power, right? But when you do that, you've basically 70% of what you need to get to weapons grade. Right? So, you, you've done all the steps, 70% of the steps in order to get to weapons grade uranium. If you enrich to 20%, you are now at 90% of what you need to get to weapons grade uranium. Now, why would you need 20%? You may need it for something like a research reactor, right? And so, medical isotopes. Iran has, correct. Iran has a tan research reactor for medical isotopes. Now, you can, by the way, you can buy those isotopes from abroad, or you can, or you can produce them at home. If you're going to enrich to 60%, right, then you've done 99% of what you need to get to weapons grade uranium, and then n% is quote weapons grade uranium. By the way, you can use 60% to actually deliver a crude nuclear device. Um, that, that has been done in the past, but you want to get to quote 90%, that's, that's weapons grade uranium, as Scott's defining it. But just again, clarify the, these huge stockpiles of 60% that Iran has accumulated, right? This 16, 17 bombs worth of 60% is 99% of what they need for weapons grade. So, I, I just wanted to explain that.\n\nYeah. But when you say, you're saying if you include the mining, the refining of the ore into yellow cake, the transformation of that into uranium hexafluoride gas, the driving of it in a truck over to the centrifuge and then spinning it. This is where we get this 90% number from, right? In, in place of 90% enriched uranium or, or 80% enriched uranium, it's 90% of the way on some chart that includes picking up a shovel and beginning to mine, right? Like, so again, just to clarify, I, I just think it's important to understand the definition of terms, um, to get what, once you have 60% enriched uranium, you've done 99% of all the steps, including some of the steps that Scott's talking about. You've done 99% of what you need to have weapons grade uranium.\n\nThat's just meaningless.\n\nWhy is that meaningless?\n\nWell, as I've already established numerous times here, under the JCPOA, they shipped out every bit of their enriched uranium stockpile. The French turned it into fuel rods and then shipped it back. That's the deal they're trying to get the U.S. back into and were obviously clearly willing to do. And again, the only reason they were enriching up to 60% was to put the pressure on the Americans to go ahead and get back into the deal. And bad bet. It gave him an excuse to bomb based on the idea that people are going to listen to him. Pretend that somehow that's 99% of the way to the bomb when you're including, yeah, driving to the mine and mining it and converting it to yellow cake and all these other things. I, you have a deliverable nuclear weapon. So, you need the weapons grade uranium. And just to repeat, they have multiple bombs worth of the 60% enriched uranium, which again is 99% of the steps you need to take for weapons grade. So, they're, they're very close to, to weapons grade. It's that's 1% more that they need to do to enrich to weapons grade. The second aspect of a deliverable nuclear weapon is obviously the delivery vehicle, and those are the missiles. And according to the DNI and and other credible sources, Iran has got the largest missile infantry in the Middle East. Um, 3,000 missiles before the War began and, uh, at least the ballistic missiles, 2,000 capable of reaching Israel. So, there's no doubt that Iran has the ability once they have the weapons grade uranium and the warhead to fix that to a missile and deliver that, uh, certainly to hit Israel, hit our Gulf neighbors, hit southern Europe. They also have a active intercontinental ballistic missile program, an ICBM program, which ultimately is designed not to hit the Israelis or the Gulfies, but to hit deeper into Europe and ultimately to target the United States. So, so let's just understand the missile program. I think it's an important part of it. The third leg of the stool, and and Scott has already alluded to this, and we've had some debate on this, and I think we should talk about it, what it really means in detail, is you've got to develop a warhead, right, or a crude nuclear device. And according to estimates from both U.S. government sources and, uh, nuclear experts, it would take about four to six months for Iran to develop a crude nuclear device, right? This is something that you wouldn't use a missile to deliver, but you would use a plane or a ship. Uh, and it would take somewhere in the neighborhood of about a year and a half to deliver or to develop a warhead. And that's to affix to the missile. So, sort of the three legs of the nuclear stool, right? The weapons grade uranium, the missiles to deliver it, and the, uh, and the warhead. So, I just want to sort of define terms so that when we're having this big Debate, your listeners kind of understand what we're talking about. If I can jump in here on this point too, and I'll turn it back over to you, but I actually have a bit of a correction to make for anyone who's seen me on Pierce Morgan or Sager and Crystal. I actually oversimplified and made a mistake. I've been off of the Iran nuclear beat for a little while doing other things, and, um, and so I'd like to take this opportunity to clarify, and I'm going to try to clarify with them on their shows too, was, um, I have an old friend of mine used to make nuclear bombs, Gordon Prather, and I only just found out that he died two years ago. Uh, unfortunately, he used to write for us at Antiwar.com and a brilliant, uh, nuclear physicist and hbomb developer, uh, and he had really taught me all about this stuff, and, um, so I'm not correcting anything you said, what, what he said essentially is right. I maybe add a little more detail. The easiest kind of nuke to make out of uranium is a simple gun type nuke, like they dropped on Hiroshima, was a little boy. It's essentially a shotgun firing a uranium slug into a uranium target, and that's enough. They didn't even test it. They knew it would work. Uh, it was so easy to do, to do the Hiroshima bomb. The Nagasaki bomb was a plutonium implosion bomb. It's virtually always plutonium that's used in implosion bombs. Um, and, and in miniaturized nuclear warheads that can be married to missiles, right? As opposed to a bomb you can drop out of the belly of a plane. That's what he was saying, right? So, gun type nuke, you can't put that on a missile. That is by far the easiest kind of nuclear weapon for Iran to make if they broke out and made one, right? But it'd essentially be useless to them, right? What are they gonna do? Drive it to Israel in a flatbed truck, right? They, they got no way to, to deliver that. They could drop it as a\n\nYeah, they could test it in the desert and beat their chest, but essentially that's all they could do.\n\nOr you could drop it from a plane like we did as, as Scott said in with Hiroshima Nagasaki.\n\nYeah. Well, very slim chance of Iranian heavy bombers getting through Israeli airspace. But anyway, um, but to make an implosion bomb, they would have to do years worth of experiments unless the Chinese or the Russians just gave them the software or gave them the finished blueprints or something, which there's no indication of that whatsoever. The only people who gave them blueprints for a nuclear bomb was the CIA. Remember Operation Merlin, where they just changed one little thing and gave them nuclear bomb blueprints, but the Iranians didn't take the bait.\n\nThe blueprints were given, just, just to clarify, it's just interesting just in the terms of the history of proliferation. Um, so Iran's initial nuclear program, right, which is built on centrifuges, as Scott and I have been talking about, um, that was actually given to the designs of that were given to them by AQ Khan, who was really the father of the Pakistani nuclear program. Um, and he actually stole those designs from the Dutch and handed it to the Iranians. He also handed it to the North Koreans and the Libyans and others. So, they were able to illicitly acquire this technology, or at least the blueprints for this technology from the father of the Pakistani bomb. So, I think that's an interesting point. But if you, but it was, as I said earlier, because Bill Clinton clamped down on the Chinese and wouldn't let them sell, or anyone else wouldn't let them sell them lightwater reactors. So, then they went to AQ Khan and bought the stuff on the black market.\n\nYeah. And, and they obviously bought heavy water reactors from the Russians, which they've been using for electricity. Um, I want to just get to the, the second thing. I think it's just important for listeners to know, and then I want to get to JCPOA. I was in the middle of saying though, when you're trying to make a uranium implosion bomb or a plutonium implosion bomb, it's a much more difficult task than putting together a gun type nuke, takes an extraordinary amount of testing. And that's why he repeated, probably unknowingly, some false propaganda about Iran having this advanced testing facility. I think he was implying, correct me if I'm wrong, he was, I'm pretty sure you're implying at Parchin that they were testing these implosion systems, but that's completely debunked. It's completely false. What they were testing, what they were doing at Partin with that implosion chamber, uh, um, was making nano diamonds, and the scientist in charge of it was a Ukrainian who had studied in the Soviet Union at this, uh, military university where they said, \"Oh, see, they study nuclear stuff there.\" But that wasn't his specialty. His name was Dan Leno, and he was a specialist in making nano diamonds. And that facility was vouched by Robert Kelly in the Christian Science Monitor, told, um, Scott Peterson of the Christian Science Monitor that that stuff was nonsense, that that, that facility, that implosion chamber could not be used for in testing, uh, for testing an implosion system for nuclear weapons. And I know from Dr. Pray, they're telling me that when the Americans were doing this and the Russians too, that they test all their implosion systems outside, and you have to do it over and over and over again with lead instead of uranium in the core, and then you take all this high-speed X-ray film of the thing, and it's this huge and drawn out and incredibly complicated engineering process. And this is probably why the week before the War, the CIA said, \"Not only do we think that they're a year away from having enough nuclear material to make one bomb, we think they're three years away from having a finished warhead.\" That must have been assuming that they would try to make an implosion system that you could put on, uh, in other words, miniaturize and put on a missile, as opposed in, in other words, skipping a gun type nuke that would be useless to them. So, it's very important to understand then that if, if they have a uranium route to the bomb, if they withdraw from the treaty and kick out the IAEA inspectors and, and announce that now we're making nuclear bombs, they can either one, race to a gun type nuke that's essentially useless to them, or they can take their ponderous as time trying to figure out how to make an implosion system work. First of all, I'm glad Scott knows about what's going on at Partridge because the IAEA doesn't, and they've been asking the Iranians.\n\nThat's not true. The Iranians told the IAEA, \"You can inspect any five out of 10 facilities here, cart blanch, go ahead.\" And they did and found nothing. Then they made up the lies about the implosion chamber later. And the IAEA, again, Robert Kelly is the American IAEA guy, debunked that in the Christian Science Monitor. All right. So, uh, I, I want to just again, just put it out there for your listeners. They, they should just Google Ahmad program, and they should learn about the Ahmad program because it's, it's detailed in U.S. government documents, experts in Iran's nuclear program, including David Albbright, who actually saw the archive, went in there, wrote a whole book on it, and there's a lot of detail about how Iran had an active nuclear weapons program called the MOD to build five nuclear weapons. But I want to get to the JCPOA because I actually think that's an interesting discussion for Scott and I to have, um, because I think there are things that we agree on there and things that we disagree on. Right. So, this is the 2015 nuclear deal that Obama reaches. Um, it's negotiated painstakingly over two years between 2013 and 2015. And it follows the interimm agreement that United States negotiated with Iran. And it's, it's, it's in that interimm agreement in 2013 where the United States for the first time actually gives Iran the, the right to enrich uranium. There were five UN Security Council resolutions passed with the support of Russia and China that said Iran should have no enrichment capability and no plutonium reprocessing capability because of the fears that Iran would turn that into a nuclear weapons program. But in 2013, they give up, they give that up. 2015, we reached the JCPOA, and under the JCPOA, Iran is allowed to retain enrichment capability and reprocessing capability, but over time, so Scott mentioned these sunsets, and just want your listeners to understand what these sunsets are, essentially the restrictions that are placed on Iran's nuclear program, right? And there's some really serious restrictions placed on it, especially in the short term, and Scott's right, the enriched material has to be shipped out, not to the French, but to the Russians, um, and there's restrictions on Iran's ability to operate these facilities at ATANS and Foraux. They're not closed. They're still remain open, but there's restrictions on what they can do with it. There's also restrictions on Iran's ability to test and install advanced centrifuges. Now, the reason you'd want an advanced centrifuge rather than the first generation centrifuge that AQ Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, gave to the Iranians is you need a smaller number of these centrifuges to produ\n\n\nCE weapons grade uranium.\nIf it's smaller, less, it's easier to hide, right?\nYou can put it in clandestine facilities without this large enrichment centrifuge footprint.\nSo there's restrictions on these advanced centrifuge R&D.\nAnd Iran gets significant sanctions relief as part of this.\nBut the whole assumption here from both an Iranian and American perspective is these restrictions are going to sunset.\nThey're going to disappear over time.\nIn fact, 2025 is the year where some of the significant restrictions on Iran's capabilities begin to sunset, and all of them are effectively gone by 2031.\nOkay?\nSo, in 2031, Iran can emerge with an industrial size enrichment capability.\nThey can emerge with advanced centrifuges that they can install in as many enrichment facilities as they want to build.\nAnd Iran can enrich to higher and higher levels.\nSo, they can go from 3.67 to 20%, they can go to 60%.\nUm, there's nothing in the JCPOA that actually prohibits them from going to 90% in Richmondia.\nAnd I think at the time, the Obama administration's theory of the case was, yeah, sure, in 15 years time, but in 15 years time, we'll be gone.\nHopefully, there'll be a different government in Iran, and maybe we can renegotiate a different agreement with that government that will extend the sunsets.\nSo, that that's the JCPOA.\nThe reason that critics of the JCPOA, and I was one of them, we objected to the deal, is not because it didn't have some short-term temporary restrictions that were useful, but that if you got it wrong and there was the same regime in power in 15 years, that regime could emerge with this huge nuclear program with the capabilities to develop nuclear weapons in these multiple hardened sites.\nIran, we estimated, would have a trillion dollars in sanctions relief over that 15-year period.\nAnd if you got it wrong, that it was the same regime in power as it been in power in 2015, then you had some difficulties.\nOkay?\nI just wanted to lay out the case against the JCPOA.\nNow, to steal man uh Scott's argument, right, I think there's a legitimate argument because I actually didn't support the withdrawal from the agreement.\nUh President Trump withdrew in 2018.\nI did a similar version of what Scott was suggesting was I thought that the U.S. should negotiate with the Europeans, the French, the Germans, and the UK who were part of the original deal, extend the sunsets as an agreement between the U.S. and Europe, and then collectively go to the Iranians and say, \"Let's renegotiate this agreement to extend the sunsets.\"\nIf you if you don't want a nuclear weapons program, then you should agree that you would you don't need these capabilities and let's extend the sunsets for another 15, 20, 30 years.\nPresident, somebody give me a screenshot of this.\nGive me a pound, dude.\nThere we go.\nAgreement.\nThere we go.\nThat makes my heart feel so.\nAnd I think the hole would have gone for it too.\nWell, so I'm not sure if he would have, but but let's just a little bit of history.\nI think it's just useful for the viewers to know again the context, especially when Scott and I agree.\nYeah.\nUm, so a process was begun by the Trump administration.\nThey, uh, Trump appointed, uh, Brian Hook, or Secretary Pompeo actually appointed Brian Hook, who's the lead Iran envoy, and he began a process of talking to the Europeans.\nNow, the Europeans actually rejected this idea.\nUm, and so at some point, Trump said, \"Look, if the Europeans aren't prepared to get on side, then I'm out of the deal.\nI'm out of the deal.\"\nAnd if you're interested, I can talk about why I thought we should have stayed in the deal because I thought you gave us some important restrictions in the short term, certain leverage.\nBut Trump decides to withdraw from that agreement because he recognizes that the fatal flaw of the agreement, the fatal flaws of the agreement are one, giving them any enrichment capability, especially at an industrial size within 15 years, right?\nAnd two are these sunsets as Scott said which under which these restrictions are going to go away and Iran's going to end up with a massive nuclear program.\nSo I think that's just important.\nWe can talk about the JCPOA, the process, and everything else if you're interested.\nI'd like to go ahead and quickly accuse the FBI and the CIA of framing Trump for treason with Russia and pushing the Russia gate hoax.\nI'm trying to agree with my friend here because what it is is that that completely ruined Donald Trump's ability to engage in real diplomacy with Russia for his entire first term.\nCertainly for the first three years of it, he was completely handcuffed.\nIt was it was it was terrible as I'm sure you're well aware for the future now our past and current history of Ukraine as well as for this deal too.\nWhy couldn't Trump pick up the phone?\nI don't know the details here, but I'll take his word for it.\nThat the British and the French and the Germans weren't being nice to Trump.\nThey didn't like him.\nThey didn't want to do it.\nWhy couldn't he pick up pick up the phone and say, \"Hey, Putin, I need you to call the Ayatollah for me and tell him, 'Hey, you'd like to see him lift these sunsets, too, and this and that.'\"\nWhy?\nBecause they framed him for treason.\nSo, he was completely unable to engage in real diplomacy with Russia.\nAnd I bet that he'd agree with me on that one, too.\nSo, next, actually, could I just say one thing interesting?\nAnd again, I think it's going to be a later topic and so it it's going to be a provocative statement, but I think let's put it on the table.\nI absolutely agree with Scott.\nI mean, I think it was a travesty that the of the accusations against Donald Trump as a Russian agent.\nI mean, completely debunked, but it it did it I think it paralyzed his presidency for two, two and a half years.\nI I agree with Scott.\nThe idea that you would accuse the president of the U.S. of being a foreign agent for Vladimir Putin, I think is unfounded and I I I thought at the time disgraceful and I thought it was really important.\nI think Scott did really good work in in debunking that.\nI would say that just a couple days ago I was watching a podcast Scott was on and he accused uh Trump of being an agent for Netanyahu and the Israeli government.\nSo I think again the accusations that the president of the U.S. is a foreign agent for some foreign government.\nI think we should just put all of that aside in any discussion and just say President Trump makes his own decisions whether we agree with him or agree with him.\nBut he's not working for the FSB and he's not working for Mossad.\nPresident Trump makes his own decisions based on American national security.\nNow I was making a point.\nThat's hyperbole making a point.\nBut he did.\nIn fact, could you Google this for me because I always forget exactly how many hundreds of millions of dollars that he took from Sheldon add who are Americans, by the way, who are Americans who Sheldon Allison said his only regret in life is that he served in the American army instead of the IDF and said America should nuke Iran in order to get them to give up their nuclear weapons.\nHe said, \"I have one issue, one Israel.\"\nAnd they gave Trump hundreds of millions of dollars over three campaigns.\nThat's not just a gez.\nI really hope you'll think of me in the future.\nScott, first of all, a couple things.\nSo, one, there's a lot of people that are friends with Trump and try to gain influence.\nI believe that Trump as an American is making his own decisions.\nLet's for the purpose of this conversation just focus on that and see what are the right decisions and what are the wrong decisions.\nAnd uh maybe I wonder what decisions I could get you to make if I gave you hundreds of millions of dollars.\nWell, me personally, you couldn't give me It doesn't matter.\nI couldn't even get you I couldn't get you to drop in on a vert ramp or nothing for 100 million bucks.\nNothing.\nYou cannot control my decisions with money.\nIt's the American system, Lex.\nThat's how it works.\nIt's money.\nThey appreciate.\nYeah, we can we can go down that.\nIt's the same if we were talking about Archer Daniels Midland Company throwing hundreds of millions of dollars around.\nThey get policies based on their hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe squeaky wheel gets the grease, right?\nAll that.\nSo Lex, I think you're right.\nI mean, I think Elon Mus spent what, $400 million helping Trump get elected.\nUm, and obviously there a number of philanthropists.\nI think clearly his son Don Junior has had a lot of influence in who gets selected in these positions in the Pentagon, the NC.\nI think Tucker Coulson has had a lot of influence.\nSo I think as you say, he surrounds himself with people who have certain ideas, ideologies, policies.\nThe president makes his own decision.\nI just want to touch on just one thing because I I I don't want to leave this alone.\nUm just out of respect for for the victims of Iran-backed terrorism and hostage taking and assassinations since 1979.\nUm, you know, this is the regime that took our took hostages in 79, took our diplomats hostage.\nUm, Scott says, you know, 83 was really the only thing that happened and and throws out a lot of information.\nCertainly some some pretty breathtaking accusations that somehow the Israelis knew about this and didn't tell the Americans and and it's an Assad officer's accusation.\nYeah, Victor Ostroski is his name.\nYeah, I know exactly who he is and and he has been widely discredited um and having an axe to grind with with Mossad.\nBut anyway, um not only 83 but all through the 90s, the 2000s, 2010s, 20120s, um there have been hundreds of attacks, of um assassinations, of hostage taking.\nUm there are thousands of Americans who have been killed and maimed by the regime.\nCan you be specific what you're talking Yeah, I mean I I can give you a whole list and Sure.\nliterally I'm happy to pull it up.\nLex, I shared it with you.\nIt's a long list of attacks all through the 80s and 90s.\nUm I mean everything from the you know Kobar Towers Kobar towers was al Qaeda.\nThat was Osama bin Laden and Khali Shake Muhammad.\nLet him lay it out.\nAll right, let's hear him.\nOh, I got my pen in my hand.\nGo ahead.\nYeah.\nAnd again, according again, according to U.S. intelligence findings, it was actually Hzbala that worked with al-Qaeda, trained al-Qaeda in that attack in the Cobra Towers.\nUm they were they were kidnapping our diplomats in Beirut.\nUm they were they launched attacks against our um our soldiers while in Iraq.\nThe notion that somehow you debunked that.\nNo, I don't I don't think Well, you you say you debunked it.\nYou just made your claim.\nUm but those were Iran-backed militias.\nUm backed by the by Kasum Solommani who Scott referred to who was the commander of the RGC goods force who supplied them with those IEDs or those EFPs actually those explosive well again this has been all confirmed by why don't you search Alyssa Rubin New York Times EFP factory or you can look in the Christian Science Monitor for Operation Eagleclaw where they found these things you can it's it's easy to find in my book you can flip right to soda straws and EFPs.\nAnd you see where I I have all my citations for the solid dozen American newspaper reporters who were embedded with American soldiers who found these factories in Iraqi Shiastan, okay?\nWith Iraqi Arabs working the machines, not Iran.\nSo I' I'd like your viewers to to Google not just a couple of sources, but actually Google the U.S. government reports.\nThey did a whole afteraction report on the Iraq War.\nAll the mistakes were made in the Iraq War and there and there were legion of mistakes made.\nUm but it was very clear that Iran had actually provided the technology, the training, the funding for these Iran-backed militias to kill Americans.\nI mean I I could see Scott method from Lebanese Hezbala that got it from the IRA.\nThey didn't even get the technique from the Iranians at all.\nYeah.\nSo Lebanese asbal as I'm sure all your listeners know has been trained financed true but they got supported by Iran for the copper core for many years and that design did not come from Persia.\nYeah.\nSo again I think we all admit Scott admits as well that Hisbala was trained financed and uh supported by Iran.\nHisbala has been responsible for many of these terrorists.\nWhere does Hisbala come from?\nIt's a reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon where they went after the PLO and horribly mistreated the poor local Iraqi Shiites until they rose up and created these militias to fight in self-defense.\nThat's where Hezbollah comes from.\nHisbala was actually created by the RGC before the Israeli invasion.\nThis was the CIA's Bin Laden unit.\nMichael Shyer says it was Osama bin Laden and colleague Shake Muhammad that did the Cobar Towers attack.\nAnd who did they kill?\nThey killed 19 American airmen who were stationed there to bomb Iraq from bases of Saudi Arabia under the Israeli insisted upon dual containment policy.\nBill Clinton came from Yeetsak Shamir who had who had uh sent his man Martin Indic to work for Bill Clinton and push the dual containment policy is where that comes from in the first place.\nThe main reason al Qaeda turned against the U.S. and the Kobar Towers attack was bin Laden and he bragged about it himself to um Abdel Bari Atwan the uh reporter from Alud's Alarabi in London and spent days with him and bragged all about it and blessed the martyrs and the rest of that and uh is widely uh discredited the claim that it was Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbala that did the Kobar towers attack.\nThat was what the Saudi government told the U.S.\nIn fact, there's a great documentary about John O'Neal, who was the head of FBI counterterrorism, who told Louisie Free, \"Boss, the Saudis are blowing smoke up your ass about this Hezbala thing.\nIt was Al Qaeda that did it.\"\nAnd then Louis Free got all upset cuz he used the a word.\nUm he was a very conservative Catholic guy, Louis Free, and then uh refused to listen to another word from John O'Neal about it.\nSo, what we know now from Scott, because he's he's given certainly a lot of context to how he actually sees things, is um here's who lies to you and here's who doesn't.\nUm,\n\n\nU.S. government lies to you. Israeli government lies to you. Uh, the Israelis clearly lie to you. Menacious bunch. Saudis lie to you. Um, you know, but you know who doesn't lie to you? Actually, doesn't lie to you. Al-Qaeda doesn't lie to you.\nI didn't cite al-Qaeda or I himself and the Iran. I cited Michael Shawyer, the chief of the CIA's Bin Laden unit, didn't make it clear here.\nThe Iranian trusting Hezbollah, Scott, straight up, I hear you, but you're interrupting. And like, please just honestly, it's not about the content, but like honestly, how come you're not saying him? Isn't that weird that you just said he trusts Hezbollah even though he didn't say anything about trusting Hezbollah?\nI'm not calling out the content. I'm calling out the interruptions. He hasn't interrupted you. It's great. I'm loving the back and forth. It's great, but just a little less talking over each other, that's all.\nYeah. So I mean again the the sort of view of the regime in Iran and and I think Scott wisely said at the beginning of this discussion like what did you say? I I don't have any love for the Ayatollah. I'm a Texan. I don't have any love for the Ayatollah in Iran. And yet despite the fact Scott doesn't have love for the Ayatollah and I I agree with him and I think he's being sincere in every discussion that we've had on every topic. It's always about everyone's lying except the Ayatollah in Iran. He's not lying about having a nuclear weapons program.\nHe he didn't actually support all of these terrorist organizations that he founded, financed, and supported to kill Americans. It wasn't the Ayatollah and Iran. He's he's not lying about his um his deception campaign against the United States. He's not lying about negotiations with the Americans. It's Americans fault all the time. So he he's presented all the time in Scott's conception here as a sincere actor who doesn't want to develop nuclear weapons, who doesn't actually want to kill Americans. He is just always a victim of American and Israeli aggression. I I think it's an interesting conception. I think let's talk about it. And I I mean I'm I'm fascinated by the conception because it it's very contrary to mine. Obviously, it's very contrary to, I think, decades of overwhelming evidence that the Islamic Republic has been war with the United States since 1979. And, you know, I I don't take too much stock in what people say. I take stock in what they do. So, you know, death to America, death to Israel could just be a slogan. It could be just propaganda. But when it's actually operationalized, then you start to ask, well, maybe it's not just propaganda. Maybe it's intention operation operationalized into capabilities. You know, we what we're forgetting here and again it's it's this causal relationship. It's we aggress against Iran and the Israelis aggress against Iran and Iran is always reacting. I mean, let's give the Iranians their due because Comedy made it very clear when he established the Islamic Republic that there will be a revolutionary and expansionist regime and they will expand their power through the Middle East. And so he built and to his credit was very successful until October 7th. This axis of resistance as he calls it which are these terror proxy armies, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Iraqi Shiite militias, the Houthis in Yemen that and certainly supporting the Assad regime in Syria. He built a very very impressive and deadly axis that he turned against the United States and against Israel which saw its culmination on October 7th. I think after October 7th that was a huge miscalculation for Kame and we've seen the results of what's happened to his axis of resistance through quite devastating Israeli military capabilities over the past number of months but he has an ideology and I think where I agree with Scott is I'm not sure if Kame would actually use a nuclear weapon against Israel the United States because I don't think Kame is suicidal but I think what Kame wants is he wants a nuclear weapon as a backs stop for his conventional power. Right? He's it's very the it's very much the Kim Jong-un model of North Korea, right? I'm going to have nuclear weapons with ICBMs to threaten America, but what I'm actually going to do is threaten South Korea with having massive conventional capabilities on the DMZ that I could take South Korea in a week. I could destroy in a week. So, you the United States and South Korea have no military option. That's Kame's view. he can actually building up this massive ballistic missile arsenal that he's unleashed in the past 12 days that according to again the US and Israel was going to go from 2,000 to 6,000 to 20,000 that from Kame's perspective he didn't need to drop a nuclear bomb on Tel Aviv. What he needed to do was use the threat of nuclear escalation in order to use his conventional capabilities his missiles to destroy Tel Aviv. And you've already seen the damage from just uh a few dozen ballistic missiles getting through the kind of damage that he's wrought on Tel Aviv already. That is the conception that Kame has. It's a revolutionary regime. It aggresses and I I do think it's interesting and I think we should talk about it.\nActually, that's a good cue. Take a bath.\nLet's take a bath.\nOkay, we took a quick break and now uh Scott.\nYeah. Okay. So, a few things there. First of all, uh on Ahmad, the pre-2003 nuclear weapons research, um the CIA estimate in 2007 concluded that all research had stopped in 2003 and Seymour Hirs reported that the reasoning behind that was uh mainly that America had gotten rid of Saddam Hussein for them. Now, in Gareth Porter's book, Manufactured Crisis, he shows that the major conclusion that the uh DIA had made, that the Iranians were researching nuclear weapons was based on some invoices that they had intercepted for some dual use materials, some specialty magnets and things that they thought, boy, this looks like this could be part of a weaponization program, a secret program here. And you know, Gareth Porter, who's a really great critic of all of these policies and claims, says, \"Hey, this was a good faith misunderstanding by DIA. They were doing their job.\" But it turned out the IAEA later when America gave them that information, the IAEA went and verified, oh, there's the magnet and there's this and there's that and all those dual use items actually were being used for civilian purposes. And so then um as Gareth writes in his book, the only real reason um that the NIE said that they even had a program before 2003 was essentially because they didn't want to dispute their last mistaken conclusion. So they said, \"Okay, well that was right up until then.\" But that was when that changed. And then the other half of their reason for accepting that there ever was a nuclear weapons research program uh in the country before 2003 was the smoking laptop. And I'm sorry, I think I misspoke earlier when I said that the laptop was in 2005. That was just the Washington Post story that had a bunch of stuff about it. That was in 2003 as well or 2004 possibly. So this was why the um but it was still all again forged by the Israelis and funneled through the MEK cult um but was obsolete essentially and had nothing in it. At least the accusations and it weren't past 03. And so there's really no reason to believe that there was actually a nuclear weapons research program even before 03 which then again the National Intelligence Council says ended in 2003 and hasn't been restored.\nA question just not a comment by me but a question just your perspective. So just so I understand this. the the the nuclear archive, this this massive archive that the Israelis were able to take out of Tyrron, bring to the United States, bring to the IAEA, which is very detailed blueprints.\nIt's just the alleged studies documents again. It's the same stuff from the smoking laptop.\nYeah. So, let me just ask you because it's it's it's huge and it's very detailed and it shows clearly that the Iran had an active nuclear weapons program certainly until 2003 and then we can have a discussion about what happened after that. Are are you suggesting that that's all been forged by by Israel?\nYes. Nothing in this smoking lot held up.\nNot not the laptop, but this entire archive that they pulled out with this\nyou're you're thinking of like the big photo op with all the do all the full documents behind\nI've seen it. I've seen many many of the documents. There's thousands of pages.\nI'm asking this is not what I'm claiming. Is that all forged by Israel?\nIs that not all about the uranium tetraflloride and the warhead that David Albbright debunked and all the same claims that were in the smoking laptop from the Bush years? David David Albbright actually wrote an entire book. It's a very detailed book. Your listeners should Google it's it's David Albbright and the archive where he goes in he went in in detail and he confirms the information in that archive that Iran had an active program under something called Ahmad to develop five atomic weapons. So again, you and I can debate this all day, but\nnow this would have been before Natans was even dug and before a single centrifuge, right? Got all that.\nI'm just making sure everybody understands assuming that was true. We were talking about a piece of paper.\nBut you you it's not a piece of paper. It's a massive archive. I'm just asking the question. You you believe Mossad fabricated all of this as a lie to deceive the United States, the IAEA, and the international community? That's just my question. My understanding is that there is nothing significant in the 2018 archive that was not already in the debunked claims from the laptop. But my question is is not that it's debunked because we can argue about whether it was debunked or not, but are you saying that Mossad fabricated it?\nThat's what you're claiming.\nYeah, because the CIA admitted that there was no laptop and Olli Heinan admitted that he got it from the laptop.\nHe got it from the MEK and where did the MEK get it? The MEK got it from the Israelis.\nScott, I'm not asking about the laptop. I'm asking about this huge archive that was sitting in a warehouse in Tyrron. Full\nI don't know the truth behind those documents. I don't believe Israeli claims of what they were and where they came from without, for example, reading Albright's book and seeing what he has to say about all of that. I don't take Netanyahu's uh claims and and Okay. So, what's so significant in there? You say that there's a document that has a plan to to make five bombs, but isn't the rest of the proof the same green salt experiments and the warhead for the missile that David Albbright showed was obviously fake because the warhead was purportedly being designed for a missile that was now going to have an entirely different nose cone on it.\nNo. So David Albbright again, you know, we should bring David Albbright here.\nDavid Albbright is a prominent physicist, nuclear proliferation expert known for his detailed research and publications on nuclear weapons. Yeah,\nhe has a bunch of books. Peddling Peril, Iran's Perilous Pursuit of Nuclear Weapons, Plutonium, and Highly Enriched Uranium, 1996, and so on.\nYeah. So, so folks should should read the book on the on the archive because David had um full access to the archive, all the all the detailed documents and blueprints, and he writes a book that again, the conclusion of which is Iran had an active nuclear weapons program.\nNo, no, no. The conclusion of which was they were researching it right before 2003. They had no nuclear material to introduce into a single machine. Right.\nWell, they they active program meaning they had a piece.\nThey had already built a covert enrichment facility which was only\nNo, they hadn't. It was closed. Natans was empty by till the end of 2006, right? They didn't even start spinning centrifuges in gotten centrifuge for AQ. They'd built a deeply buried underground facility at Natans. They were putting in place the component parts for a nuclear weapons capability and Ahmad showed conclusively unless you believe Mossad fabricated it all that they actually had the plan to build nuclear warheads.\nAgain, Seymour Hirs says that it was when\nSeymour Hirs is not a nuclear weapons expert. David Albbright has you saw the archive Hersh's sources said America invaded Iraq and overthrew Saddam Hussein for them. That was when they gave up even considering the need for it. Remember, the Iranians held a million man vigil for the Americans on September 11th. The Iranians hated the Taliban. In fact, the Americans thought Iran might invade Afghanistan earlier in 2001. And they hated Saddam Hussein. So, they had every reason in the world to want to work with the United States September 11.\nIt's a distraction. My question is, let's not go to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and 9/11, and the Iranians and a million people. Let's just stay on the topic.\nasking me what I already answered.\nYou believe Mossad fabricated that entire\nI already told you I don't take their word for anything and I' have as far as I understand the accusations in there are the same ones from the laptop that are already discredited and I haven't read David Albbright's book. You're distracting from me refuting this giant list of false claims that you made previously that let's all agree you're going to read the book. Maybe Lex, you're going to read the book. Viewers, you should read the book. I think David Albbright has done a meticulous job.\nIt's a by the way just just warning it's a big book. very detailed, hundreds of pages, and he goes through it in meticulous detail in analyzing this archive and showed again that Iran had an active nuclear weapons program designed to build five atomic warheads.\nNow, we can talk about what happened after 2003 and did they make the decision to totally stop it?\nYeah, God changed his mind after the neoconservatives lied America into war with Iraq for Ariel Chiron. So just to clarify, you Mark and David Albbright uh believe that Iran was developing a nuclear weapon and you Scott are saying they were not before 2003.\nThat's just just to summarize what we were just talking about.\nWell, I I can tell you that. So Gareth's book came out in 2014, which is before this archive was supposedly revealed in Tyrron. But in in Garris book, he shows that the CIA and national intelligence estimate of 2007 that said that there was a program before 2003 and was halted after America invaded Iraq was based on one the the DIA's mistaken\n\n\nBut sincere interpretation of these invoices for these dual-use technologies and then the smoking laptop, which was completely fake and funneled into the stream by the Mujahideen cult, a communist terrorist cult. The same people who come up with, you know, 10 major hoaxes. The NCRI, they just put out the NCR, the National Council for Resistance in Iran. That's the MEK. They just put out a fake story, what, three, four weeks ago about a big secret nuclear weapons site in Iran. Don't you remember? And then nothing happened with that, because it was another lie by the MEK. It happens all the time.\n\nSo, Lex, maybe we should talk about what happened after 2003. What about this 2007 NIE? What does it mean? Did it mean Iran had now abandoned its nuclear weapons program or does something else? They never had a nuclear weapons program. But let's talk about that.\n\nInteresting. Interesting. According to the NIE, they had a nuclear weapons research program that never made anything at all. So, you can try to conflate that if you want, but I think everybody can see that's not what the 2007 NIE says. What the 2007 NIE says is that, and you are correct, according to the 2007 NIE, Iran made the decision after the invasion of Iraq not to pursue an active nuclear weapons program anymore because we were putting their best friends in power in Baghdad for them. Well, because the U.S. had gone in, worry no more, and in a matter of 100 days had taken down the Iraqi army and put in Abdul Aziz al-Hakim's faction, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, who'd been living in Iran for 20 years. That's why you and I did not publicly support the Iraq War. Did we? I publicly opposed it as far as I possibly should have publicly opposed it rather than just working on Iran in 2003. But you're right. It redounded to the benefit of Iran that invasion. But that's not actually what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is 100 days, the Iranian sea, that the U.S. military has taken down the Iraqi army that they had fought an 8-year War with, where almost a million people, Scott, as you know, had been killed. So, they were afraid that the United States was going to march from Baghdad to Tehran. So, they make a decision to end their active Ahmad program.\n\nThey make a decision to build up the key capabilities they need to retain an Iranian nuclear weapons option, specifically the enrichment capabilities at Natanz and then Fordow and at Iraq, giving them the plutonium route. Um, and then what they do is they take the members of the Ahmad program, the nuclear weapons scientists that have worked on this, and they disperse them. So, they're now no longer in a formal weapons program. They're put in a number of different research centers and universities and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who you mentioned earlier, who's in some respects, I wouldn't call him the Oppenheimer of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, he's more like, is it, was it, um, who was in the Oppenheimer movie, Leslie Groves, um, the guy who was actually responsible for the organization and the training and the recruitment and the guy that actually ran the program as opposed to Oppenheimer, the sort of brilliant nuclear physicist.\n\nUm, this is Fakhrizadeh. So, Fakhrizadeh takes control of this program and now it is dispersed and it is unstructured in that sense because they recognize that if they continue with this, the United States may march to Tehran. And so the NIE says Iran is retaining the key capabilities, the enrichment capabilities to give them an option for a nuclear weapon. But we, the NIE, decided or we have concluded that they no longer have an active structured nuclear weapons program. However, since then, what have we seen? We've seen them actually do what many suspected they would do, which is build all the key capabilities that they need so that at a time of their choosing, they can decide to develop a nuclear bomb, whether it's a crude nuclear device, as you described, whether it's a nuclear warhead. We've had that discussion so far, but just, sorry, just to finish. So just understand the brilliance of Iranian nuclear deception, right? I just, I think it's really interesting to get in the minds of the Ayatollah and understand this because he doesn't want to provoke the United States. He doesn't want to see another Iraq-style invasion this time of his country. He's building this capability on the enrichment side and on the reprocessing side. He is framing this as, \"I'm only building a civilian nuclear program.\" He's taken the weapon scientists who were building an active nuclear weapons program and he's dispersing them, putting them under the guidance and direction of Fakhrizadeh and starting to build out these capabilities. I mean, he, I, I admire, I have to say, I really admire the way he's played this three-dimensional nuclear chess game. It's very, very interesting, and I think he made a tragic mistake about six weeks ago when he rejected the offer from Trump at Oman and then provoked both an Israeli and then an American strike. But he was playing this game almost perfectly before then in building out these capabilities. And I think what he should have done, if I were him, I would have waited out Trump. I would have waited three and a half years. I would have taken the offer in Oman, which gave him enrichment capability above ground. This consortium that was going to be built in three and a half years would never be built, and even if it was built, he could just say, \"I'm not interested anymore,\" and challenge the next president, whoever that is, Republican or Democrat, to do anything about it. And I think the political calculation should have been the next president's not going to do anything about this. I'll be able to then be able to complete my nuclear weapons program. But he challenged Trump. He thought Trump was a paper tiger. He rejected that offer at Oman, and we've seen what's happened over the past couple weeks.\n\nTwo things. One, can you go and respond to certain things that you heard? And two, can we generally move in the direction of the modern day and trying to see what is the right thing now, our analysis of the situation now? We've been kind of staying in this in the context of history, which is really important, but sort of moving forward. But yeah, go ahead, please.\n\nI'm not sure how much time we have. I had kind of hoped, and let me talk about Israel's role in Iraq War II and for that matter in Barack Obama's dirty war in Syria that led to the rise of the bin Laden there. It's all part of America's Israel policy. So I don't want to, I'd rather go back before we go forward. But I also do, I need to go back over so many claims that he's made here that I'd like.\n\nSo I strongly prefer we go because there's so much history. We're going to lose ourselves, and there's not enough hours. We should take certain moments in history that instruct the modern day, but let's not get lost there if it's okay. I sure this is such a fascinating conversation about, you know, the JCPOA and the time between then and now, like quite a bit already, too. So we'll be going back over some of that. Oh no, I mean modern day, I don't mean JC. I mean, like this week, there a lot of stuff happened this week, and a lot of stuff will happen tomorrow and the next week, and we everyone is wants to know like what is going to happen? What is the worst case? What is the best case? Should we be freaking out? What do we need to understand about today? That's all.\n\nAll right. So there's a lot of things to address here. So first of all, something that me and Mr. Dubowitz agree about, Mark. Mark, something that Mark and I agree about is that there actually is not a threat of an aggressive first strike by Iran. I'm a little surprised to hear him say that, but I'm grateful to hear him say it is honest. I would, you know, advise you for, you may be unfamiliar with this, but I can tell you anyone in America who drives for a living and listens to AM radio have heard claims that Iran was making nuclear weapons probably 50,000 times in the last 25 years.\n\nOver and over and over again, we hear this propaganda. They still don't have a single atom bomb. The reason why they haven't been able to commold together an atom bomb in this 1940s technology is because they have not tried to, okay? So people can, you know, just essentially fog this dead horse, pretend there's this threat. Oh, he's going to break out any day now. But here's the thing about that. As the Ayatollah well knows, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and now Trump again have all vowed with all sincerity that they would bomb Iran off the face of the earth if they attempted to break out and make a nuclear weapon. Hillary Clinton, when she ran, said they'd be obliterated from the face of the earth. Barack Obama did an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg in the Atlantic in 2012 called \"As President, I don't bluff.\" And essentially the interview is him begging Jeffrey Goldberg to explain to the Israelis that he really, really, really, really means it, that he's trying to negotiate, but if the Ayatollah breaks out for a nuke, I'll nuke them if I have to.\n\nNo, they never said that.\n\nHe didn't say that. But the implication was, by the way, no, no U.S. president ever said they're going to obliterate Iran. U.S. president said, Hillary Clinton did.\n\nAll options are on the table.\n\nAnyone can Google her word.\n\nShe was never our president.\n\nNo, I said she was running for president.\n\nYeah, but she was never our president, but no U.S. president ever said they'd obliterate Iran. Nobody ever said the implication. The implication was clear under W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump, Biden, and Trump again that they would strike Iran's nuclear facility. If they broke out toward a nuclear weapon, America would do whatever it took to prevent that from happening. So, strike their nuclear facilities. That was always the case there. Please clarify, just to be accurate. And I'm almost talking about nuking Iran. No one's talking about bombing Iran to smithereens or obliterating or any of that.\n\nI mean, that's really not true. True. I mean, Barack Obama changed America's nuclear posture to say, because it used to say, \"We reserve the right to use a nuclear first strike against any country.\" And he changed that to say, \"No, we, we promise not to use a nuclear first strike against any non-nuclear weapon state except maybe Iran.\" Okay.\n\nOkay. That's true. All right. And so, um, in fact, that was the threat. And, and I got more here. Okay. Uh, Netanyahu also did an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg back when Ehud Barak was his defense minister, uh, in, I think this is also 2012, it might have been 2014, where the two of them explained that they agreed with what he said, too, that there the threat is not of a nuclear first strike, unlike every AM radio audience has been led to believe that the Ayatollah, as soon as he gets an atom bomb, he will nuke Tel Aviv, and he doesn't care if all of Persia is nuked by Israel's 200 nukes in response. He's trying to cause the end of the world by causing a nuclear war and all these things. Well, Netanyahu himself admitted that that's not true.\n\nYeah, I think it's really important. I agree with, I'm just agreeing with you, so you don't have to stop me. But I'm agreeing with you.\n\nI know, but I'm agreeing with you, so it's all right. So Netanyahu told Jeffrey Goldberg that he was not concerned about a first strike, that his only concern was that talented young Israelis would move to Miami, that there would be a brain drain. That was his words, a brain drain from Israel. And that also then Hezbollah, as this is what he put it, and I agree with this, that conventional forces would have a bit more freedom of action in the region if Iran was sitting on an A-bomb. Neither of them said that there was a threat of an offensive first strike against Israel. And I would point out, and I'm skipping ahead to Trump, but I'm skipping back here again in a second because I got more things to refute. But Trump just said the other day when he announced American air strikes there that this has neutralized a threat to Israel. He did not even pretend that it was a threat to the United States that he had ended in doing so.\n\nActually, he said exactly that.\n\nWell, actually, you can Google the statement.\n\nHe said President Trump has said that an Iranian nuclear weapon is a threat to the United States. He said that over announced his great victory in bombing, which is what I just said, right? President Trump sends out 20 truth posts a day. So let's look at the many, many, this whole thing about how I always believe Hezbollah and I always believe the Ayatollah, when in fact I did not quote the Ayatollah and I did not quote Hezbollah on anything. I did quote Osama bin Laden taking responsibility for the Gopar Towers attack, which he shared that with Abdelari Awan, anyone can read it, and he agrees with Michael Scheuer, the former chief of the CIA's bin Laden unit, who also said that it was a hoax, that it was Iranian-backed Saudi Hezbollah that did that attack, and again, who did they attack? They killed 19 American airmen, which was the number one complaint of al-Qaeda against the United States, that we had air forces and army stationed in Saudi Arabia in order to bomb and blockade Iraq, which again, this was the thing that you had asked about before, was part of the dual containment policy in the 1990s.\n\nSo, Scott, you're saying, no, wait a second. The fact is you're sitting here saying that, \"Oh, I, I trust them all so much.\" Well, what do you think, Lex? What do you think Ronald Reagan meant by \"trust but verify?\" He meant don't trust, but be polite, right? That's what he meant. Verify means we, we know with sensors and cameras and inspections what's going on. No one can find a quote that I said here about how we can trust the Ayatollah because he promised this or that or the other thing. I didn't say that, right? What I'm talking about is the process. They sign agreements, and then we have inspectors to verify their claims. And as anyone can search at IAEA.org, they have continued to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material in Iran to any military or other special purpose. IAEA has now said that they actually can no longer do this before because America withdrew from, before this war started. So I mean at\n\n\nAt the end of the day, let's just be factually accurate, and the fact of the matter is, anybody who knows anything about a nuclear weapons program knows that we do not have 100% certainty on anything.\n\nI mean, Scott is making claims here that the Mossad is fabricating, the CIA is fabricating, everybody's fabricating, but he's also assuming that we have 100% certainty about what we're doing inside a country more than two and a half times the size of Texas.\n\nAs Scott rightly said, mountainous, incredibly difficult to monitor, incredibly difficult to surveil.\nThey built underground facilities at Natanz and Fordo without our knowledge.\nThey didn't disclose it.\nWe finally found out about.\n\nRefuted that an hour ago.\nAnyone, but the fact of the matter is, they did it.\nIt's there.\nBoth the facilities are there.\n\nAnd by the way, you keep saying that I just say lies, lies, lies.\nBut I have explained exactly what I meant.\nI've cited my sources, and I haven't just sat here and said, \"Uh-uh, that's a lie,\" cuz I don't like it.\nI sat here and explained to you exactly how I know who was building those EFP bombs in Iraq, exactly how I know what the IAEA said about the state of inspections here, or what Robert Kelly told the Christian Science Monitor about Parchin and the rest, and on and on and on.\nYou sit here like I'm just saying, \"Well, that's not true cuz I don't like it,\" when in fact, I'm explaining exactly why your claims are not true, which they're not.\nUh, just like saying that I said I trust Hezbollah, when anyone can rewind that and break their finger trying to find the part where I said that, cuz I never did.\n\nUm, and now, uh, you brought up the DPRK.\nWell, in 2002, when George W. Bush said that they were part of the Axis of Evil, they were part of the NPT, and they had a safeguards agreement with the IAEA.\nAnd yes, they had bought centrifuge equipment from AQN, but they had not used it.\nIt was John Bolton's lie that they were enriching uranium to weapons grade and violating the agreed framework.\nJohn Bolton and George W. Bush in the fall of '02 then canceled the agreed framework deal that Bill Clinton had struck based on this misinformation.\nThey added new sanctions, and they launched what was called the proliferation security initiative, which was an illegal and unilateral uh claim of the authority to seize any North Korean ship on the high seas if they suspected it of proliferation.\nAnd then they added them to the nuclear posture review, putting them on the short list for a potential first strike.\nAnd it was only then, in the end of 2002, after these, what, four or five major things that the Bush government did to antagonize them, that North Korea then announced that they were going to withdraw from the treaty and begin making nuclear weapons, which is what they did.\nAnd then, as we know from all the scientists say, every time that they've tested a nuclear bomb, it's been a plutonium bomb.\nThey never tested, not never once used a uranium bomb.\nThere's no evidence that John Bolton's claims there that they were enriching uranium were ever true.\nAnd they had, you know, Sig Hecker, who's this important American nuclear expert, went and toured their facilities and all of these things.\nAnd so we know uh quite a bit about what they have.\nAnd it was simply Bush pushed North Korea to nukes, as Gordon Prather wrote in his last great article for us at Antiwar.com.\nAnd it was through this exact kind of belligerence when we already had a deal that we could have.\n\nTheme in your analysis.\nAnd again, I just want to, I want to look at it, maybe steel man it, maybe challenge it.\nBut the constant theme is the United States and Israel and the West.\nWe constantly aggress against North Korea, against Iran, against Russia, against these countries, and they respond to us.\nAnd they respond to us in ways that they build nuclear weapons programs that they're that are peaceful, but we force them to develop nuclear weapons.\nThey don't actually mean to kill us.\n\nLook, it's not right that I'm saying everything anyone does.\nYou're saying that everything I say is that everyone anyone else does is a reaction.\nBut that's not true.\nThe subject here is what has America done to make things worse rather than better.\nI'm citing I'm citing provocations.\nThat doesn't mean I'm saying that everything that happens in the world is only an equal and opposite reaction to an American provocation.\nAnd you can't find me saying that.\nYou can only somehow try to paraphrase me claiming that somehow or something like that.\nBut that's what's issue, right?\nIs as I said, for example, there's the Reuters story that says that after Israel did the sabotage, which they bragged about at Natanz in April of '21, that was when they started enriching up to 60%.\nOkay.\nSo now I'm saying that and I'm just denying the agency of the Iranians or anything.\nI said that no, I'm not.\nI'm just citing the Reuters news agency saying that this proactive action by Israel caused a negative reaction by your own lights.\nA very negative reaction in their beginning to again enrich up to 60% uranium.\nSo that means, oh, I'm just spinning for the Ayatollah or I believe that no one ever does anything except in reaction to Israel and America, except that I'm just citing specific examples of where that's exactly the case.\nDonald Trump withdrew from the deal.\nHe could have stayed in the deal and tried hard to make it better.\nHe didn't.\nAmerica has done America.\nThe US government has made numerous mistakes.\nIf this podcast is all about the American government and the mistakes it's made, it's a huge spend hours on it.\nCan we please get to today?\n\nUh, talk about use everything we just talked about and talk about today.\nWhat is maybe Mark, can you lay out what is the best case and the worst case, and Scott then lay out the best case and the worst case that can happen now.\nSo, Lex, I think the best case and something I've advocated for, I've been working on this for 22 years, is that the Iranians return to negotiations at Oman, uh, sit down with the United States and conclude an agreement that peacefully and permanently and fully dismantles their nuclear program.\nThey agree to that, which means they shut down any remaining facilities.\nThey give up all the remaining centrifuges and enriched material that they could use to develop nuclear weapons.\nThey let the IAEA in in order to supervise this.\nThey actually commit to not rebuilding this nuclear program.\nAnd we commit as we've done with 23 other countries to helping them provide civilian nuclear energy because it seems to me a little fanciful that the Kam would build a civilian nuclear program under 80 m of concrete surrounded by rock uh and take all the risks he's taken.\nAnd by the way, he faces a risk to his regime.\nSpent a half a trillion dollars to do this when it it makes no commercial sense.\nBut let's take him at his word that he wants civilian nuclear energy.\nLet's build it for him as long as there's no enrichment or reprocessing that gives him the key capabilities that he could if he decides to build nuclear weapons.\nThat seems to me a thoughtful approach.\nI think Scott would probably agree with it.\nProliferation proof, he can't build nuclear weapons, and we can do this all peacefully.\nThat's my preference.\nWhat can Trump do to help make that happen?\n\nI think what he can do is he can say to the Iranians, look, I made you that offer last time.\nYou rejected it.\nNow that offer is no longer on the table because that offer gave you enrichment now temporarily, but I now see the game that you would have played when I left office to turn that enrichedment and enrichment capability into nuclear weapons.\nSo that deal's off the table.\nBut here's the deal that's on the table.\nIt's a one-page deal.\nYou give up your nuclear capabilities, we help you build civilian nuclear energy.\nI think that's best case.\nAll right.\nI think worst case is that the Iranians do what they've unfortunately been doing over and over again and rejecting these deals and holding firm that they want to retain this enrichment capability.\nAnd the only reason they want to retain enrichment capability is the option to develop nuclear weapons.\nOtherwise, they can have civilian energy.\nTomorrow makes much more commercial sense to do that, and the entire international community would help them and pay for that.\nI I worry that they're going to just remain intransigent at the negotiating table.\nAnd I think if they do that, then what I worry that they're going to do is whatever remaining capabilities they have left, they'll b their time.\nThey'll wait for the opportunity.\nMaybe it's not now, maybe it's when Trump's gone, and they will rebuild this nuclear weapons program, and they'll be then inviting further strikes, further war, and further suffering.\nAnd I worry that that is the worst case.\nAnd by the way, as part of that worst case in retaining the capabilities, the extra worst case is they take those capabilities and they go for a nuclear bomb.\nNow, if Scott's right and the regime has never had any desire for a nuclear bomb, we don't have to worry about that because according to Scott, all of this has been fabricated.\nAll of this has been result of US and Israeli uh intelligence macity, and we don't have to worry about a nuclear weapon.\nI personally worry about it knowing this regime, looking at two and a half decades of of nuclear deception.\nI worry that they want to retain those capabilities and a time of their choosing develop a nuclear bomb.\nSo I think if you're responsible and you're trying to think through the various scenarios, you've got to consider an Iranian nuclear weapons breakout as a possibility, and you've got to try to mitigate that.\nYou can either mitigate that at the negotiating table through a full dismantlement deal or and that's not it's the least, well, it's it's the least good option for sure is you're going to have to go back in there either the Israelis andor the United States and you're going to have to continue to use both covert action and air power to destroy those capabilities.\n\nCan I just even uh dig in further on the worst case?\nDo you think it's possible to have where US gets pulled into a feet on the ground full-on war with Iran?\nI think one must never dismiss possibilities because as I said, you you've got to plan against worst case options.\nAnd I think that's what the Israel lobby has in store for you guys.\nAmerican lives mean nothing to the Israel firsters.\nThey don't care that Israel motivated September 11th and killed 3,000 of our guys.\nYou know, I was at the airport yesterday.\nThey had a big American flag with all the red and white stripes made out of the names of the dead as September 11th who are killed by people motivated by Israel's crimes in Palestine and in Lebanon and enforcing Bill Clinton's dual containment policy from Saudi Arabia.\nThey don't care about that.\nThey don't care about the 4,500 Americans who died in Iraq War II or the million something people who died in Iraq war, the half a million in Syria as long as the Shiite crescent somehow is limited.\nThey'll even celebrate openly, I don't know about him, but I know Ben Shapiro and many other leaders of the Israel lobby in America celebrated the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in Syria by Abu Muhammad al-Galani, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq in Syria.\nWhy?\nBecause he's not a Shiite.\nHe's not an Alawite.\nFriends with the Shiites and friends with Iran and friends with Hezbollah.\nAnd so that's good for Israel even though it's the worst thing that you could possibly imagine for the people of the United States of America.\nThose sworn loyal to Osama bin Laden and I alsawahhiri ruling Damascus now uh their own ISIS caliphate in our era.\nAnd this is why they always pretend they go, \"Oh, you know, over there the Muslims, the terrorists, greatest state sponsors of terrorism.\"\nIt's al Qaeda that threatens the United States of America.\nIt wasn't Hezbollah that knocked those towers down.\nAnd they have us siding with our enemies against their enemies.\nAnd as you just said, well, I guess time will tell, Lex, whether we're going to have to drop the 82nd Airborne in there, whether Americans are going to have to do a regime.\n\nI didn't actually change in.\nI wish you'd listened and and not put words in my mouth.\nI heard what he said.\nI forced him kind of to say what the worst case possibility of a full-on invasion as a thought experiment.\nAnd you can let him finish that as opposed to making the accusations.\nLet's just minimize both ways accusations, please.\nLet's just talk about the ideas.\nLet's the most charitable interpretation of his ideas.\nUh, well, I'm from the United States of America, unlike him, and I care about the future of this country, unlike him, who's here to serve a foreign power and make their case at our expense.\nScott, and next you're going to say that I'm an American.\nCuz you're an immigrant, too.\nWell, you're just hosting the show.\nI don't know.\nSeems like you're trying to be fair.\nNo, it's not.\nNo, it's not about fair.\nHe has an agenda.\nHe's from the FDD.\nStop.\nIt's not about being fair.\nThe implication here is somebody's unamerican because where they're from.\nI didn't say anyone who's not from here.\nI'm talking about him.\nOkay.\nI think that's a really deeply disrespectful accusation.\nCan I ask you, does it bother you that when Naftali Bennett bombed a UN shelter full of 106 women and children in Kana, Lebanon in 1996, that that's what motivated Muhammad Atani to join Ala and attack our country 22 years ago?\nI became a proud US citizen 10 years ago.\nI'm proud to be an American, and accusing me or Lex or any immigrants to this country of not being unamerican is deeply offensive.\nSo let me answer Lex's question.\nLex, let's get back to your question because I think it's an important question, right?\nWhat are the chain of events that could lead 500,000 mechanized US troops to have to invade Iran, which would be a disaster, and that's something we never want to see again?\nThat's one of the lessons of Iraq.\nI think Scott has done a good job over the years in demonstrating that we don't want to do that again.\nSo, is there is there such a scenario?\nI think one must never rule it out because there is a scenario, for example, where the regime collapses, okay, and the regime collapses and there's chaos inside Iran.\nNot suggesting that'll happen.\nThere are a whole bunch of scenarios maybe we should talk about with respect to um the the collapse of the regime.\nBut you could see a scenario where the United States would have to go in there in.\n\n\nIn order to try to secure military and nuclear and missile assets so that it doesn't end at the hands of warring, uh, factional and ethnic groups that Scott referred to, because again, as he's rightly pointed out, Iran is not Persia. Can't the IDF handle it? So, can I, can I just finish? Just who can handle it, who cannot handle it? Um, I think that it's a potential scenario, which is why I don't think anybody should be advocating for a U.S. decapitation of the regime in Iran. I have long been on record of supporting the Iranian people, right? Providing support to the Iranian people to, at one point, take back their country and take back their flag. It's very much sort of Reagan strategy that Reagan ran in the Cold War of maximum pressure on the regime, maximum support for anti-Soviet dissident. While, by the way, he was negotiating arms control agreements with the Soviet Union in order to try reduce the number of nuclear-tipped ICBMs that both countries had pointed at each other. So I think the Reagan strategy of providing support to the people is a far better strategy for trying to get transition, leadership transition, government transition inside Iran. But I think the scenario of decapitation strikes, killing, taking out the entire government could potentially lead to that scenario, and I think we have to be conscious of that. We have to guard against that. So I think that's important. I think Scott's right. I mean, if the scenario happened like that, yeah. I mean, I think the Israelis have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, and they could go in there, and they could secure loose nuclear materials that you would be worried could be fashioned for nuclear weapons. I mean, Scott doesn't seem to worry about these materials. I worry about these materials and capabilities in the hands of anybody because they're all capabilities that, just the physics of it, you can produce nuclear weapons. So, so best-case scenario, negotiation, we fully dismantle their program in Oman. Worst-case scenario, right, is having to return for continued military strikes that continue to escalate the situation. Worst, worst situation is some kind of decapitation strike that collapses the regime and causes chaos. There are a whole bunch of other scenarios we can talk about that are embedded in that, but I think if you're a responsible person and a responsible analyst, and certainly if you're a responsible policymaker, you got to be planning for all of these scenarios and more.\n Scott, what do you think is the best case and the worst case here? Uh, well, the best-case scenario is that we quit right now and that we, Trump figures out a way to reorder some paragraphs and get back in something like the JCPOA, which was also signed with the rest of the UN Security Council power.\n Can I ask you, like, is JCPOA a pretty good approximation of what would be a good deal?\n Pretty good.\nIt could have been better. As I said at the beginning, Trump could have gone in there and tried to negotiate a better result with the sunset provisions on some of those things. But, um, the concept that America is just going to insist on zero enrichment, zero nuclear program whatsoever when they have the unalienable right, quote unquote, in the nonproliferation treaty to civilian, uh, nuclear material and a civilian program, uh, it's a poison pill. It's meant to fail, just like it was a poison pill meant to destroy the talks here.\nGood enough to start a war. Again, as I quoted from earlier, uh, he said on TV last week, \"Well, America has to take out Fordo now because now they're more likely to break out towards a nuke.\" I think that's exactly right. So, there still is, or there's, there's strong reason to be skeptical, including Israeli and American officials told the New York Times that they thought that the damage was quite incomplete.\n Yeah, the IAEA just came out recently, just point of fact, sort of interesting. We'll see on the battle damage assessment, but they actually think the facility was destroyed and that the centrifuges, the sensitive centrifuges, were destroyed. So, just interesting for the viewers.\nAll the uranium, sell all the uranium mines, all the aluminum smelters so that they can't make any more centrifuges.\n Uh, they've already, they know how to make centrifuges. So, at this point, and you know, in for, uh, it's, this is why government doesn't work. They make matters worse and create more work for themselves and make things worse and worse and worse. We can make the same criticism about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, making matters worse for themselves and causing them to have to escalate even further. Now America's in the situation where the danger that Iran will now break out to a nuke is so heightened that now we're talking about, well, maybe we'll have to do a full regime change. And I appreciate you, Mark, saying that we should not kill the Ayatollah, but Benjamin Netanyahu says we should. He said just the other day that if we get rid of the Ayatollah, that will solve all the problems, which is just crazy to think that they have. Israeli officials have been tweeting out pictures of them ping around with the son of the Shah, talking about reinstalling his royal majesty's monarchy.\nSock puppet dictatorship that's taking back Iran for the people of Iran, giving them over to a bunch of foreign-backed exiles.\nWas that what Trump meant when he gave that speech in Qatar, saying we don't believe in neocon servatism and spreading democracy anymore? He's just setting up because we're going to try to reinstall a monarch.\n Can you go into the analysis of best case and worst case? You laid out the best case. What? So, worst case would be worst case. Did I hear what was the best case? I, I missed the...\n Best case is a deal.\n Yeah.\nThat, that we quit deal, basically. You guys agree on the best case.\nRespect their right to a civilian nuclear program and try to negotiate, as I said, back into something like the JCPOA, which again had them exporting their entire stock of uranium out of the country. He wants no nuclear program whatsoever.\n No, no, that's not what I said. That's not what I said. Be careful what I said.\n Well, no enrichment capabilities, entire dependence on other countries to supply their fuel needs.\nCan you teach me the difference when we...\n Yeah. So, so let me just step back from this, cuz we agree on some, and we disagree on a major issue, and then we both agree Iran deserves a civilian nuclear program.\n See, Ayatollah is never going to give in on enrichment. We know that it's a premise for our whole discussion here. Therefore, what he's saying is we're going to have to keep escalating the war until the mission is accomplished.\n Not sure I said that, Scott. I think it's again important, the distinction here, right? We both agree that Iran deserves a civilian nuclear program. Twenty-three countries have civilian nuclear programs, and they don't have enrichment, and they don't have reprocessing. Where we differ is I don't think Iran should have the Iran standard. I think that should Iran should agree to the gold standard that 23 U.S. allies have agreed to. So have civilian nuclear program, but you don't get to keep the key enrichment and reprocessing capabilities that you need to develop nuclear weapons. Do you think that Bill Clinton should have just let the Chinese sell them the lightwater reactor that they wanted to back in the '90s?\n Yeah. And America, of course, allowed Russia to sell them a heavy water reactor for the same purpose. But I agree with Scott that I think one of the ways out of this is, yes, whether it's the Chinese or, preferably, as an American, I'd prefer the Americans actually sell, uh, reactors to the Iranians. A great, you know, nuclear industry in this country. Let's do that. But if they can't, the South Koreans can. The Russians can, the Chinese can. I wouldn't want to have significant Russian and Chinese influence in Iran. So, better that it be a Western country that does it. Nevertheless, provide those reactors. They're proliferation-proof. There's no enrichment and no reprocessing. You buy your fuel rods from abroad. You put them in the reactors. You power the Iranian electrical grid, which is in terrible shape because the Ayatollah has spent a half a trillion dollars trying to build nuclear weapons and not trying to provide electricity for his people. Let's help him. Let's help his people get electricity. But the key difference in our argument, and it's a fundamental difference. God's right. Like the key difference is I do not want to give this regime enrichment or reprocessing, cuz they have shown over time, for whatever reason, whether you believe it's they intended to, or we were lying about it, or we broke them, it doesn't matter. What they have shown over the past number of years is they have gone up from 3.67% enrichment uranium for civilian purpose all the way up to 60%, which is 99% of what you need for weapons grade. Since we've seen them do it before, we don't want to see them do it again. So, no enrichment, full dismantlement, full deal, and then there's a peaceful resolution to what I, what I worry about is positions that are taken that undermine President Trump's negotiating leverage in Oman because...\n Can I ask you, you were saying you supported the JC, you were...\n Yeah, we're, that's, you opposed to withdrawing from it. Don't you think that Trump could have gone over there and negotiated to make it better? And would you agree that it was a huge mistake to withdraw that because they were, as we agreed, shipping out all of their enriched uranium to only be brought back in a form that they could not use to make nukes? The scientists had decided that if they kicked all the inspectors out and beat their chest and started making a nuke, it would take them a full year to have enough weapons-grade uranium for a single gun-type nuke under the JCPOA. Right. So, so can I, let me ask you a question because you're right. I mean, I'm glad you've pointed out because I, I try to take a nuanced position in during the JCPOA debate, and I got hammered by the left, and I got hammered by the right. Okay. The, the, the left hammered me because I criticized the JCPOA because its fundamental flaw was twofold. One, it gave Iran enrichment capability that would expand over time as the restrictions sunsetted, right? And number two, the restrict, the sunsets were going to kick in, and Iran would emerge with his industrialized program, which we would not be able to stop. Now, the nuance position, which I got hammered on by the right, was I said, go negotiate with the Europeans, agree on a common transatlantic position to approach the Iranians and say, \"Look, that deal that we did back in 2015, we think it's flawed. We want to extend that deal. We want to get rid of the sunsets, and we are going to negotiate a deal.\" Now, does that mean we have to give you more sanctions relief? Yeah, probably. The Iranians are not going to just agree without sanctions relief. What happened is the Trump administration tried to negotiate with the Europeans. The Europeans were opposed because they didn't want to revisit the agreement. We knew from, we knew the Iranians were completely opposed, and there was no way they were going to do this if the United States and Europe were divided. And so, at that, just, just a little bit of history, I just think it's interesting history. It was at that point that President Trump decided to withdraw from the agreement. But what I'm asking you is, if, say, you were the national security advisor under the JCPOA, where they are still shipping all their enriched uranium out of the country and all that, which you're, you would be advising him to not leave in the negotiations to improve the deal. Would you have been willing to accept some level of enrichment then, as long as we're still, we have the restriction part where they're shipping it all out of the country, or to you, enrichment at all is always a red line, essentially equivalent to them being 99% of the way to a nuclear weapon?\n Look, enrichment capability is a red line. It has to be a red line. And, and, even though you know it's protected by the NPT, the right to peaceful nuclear technology. Call it a loophole, but they have the right to enrich uranium in...\n As there's different interpretations of everything, including agreements. Um, there is a raging debate about whether the NPT actually gives you a right to enrich. In fact, the Obama administration, even with the JCPOA, was not willing to recognize Iran's right to enrich, but they were willing to recognize its de facto reality that they were enriching.\n Can you explain NPT?\n It's the non-proliferation treaty. Iran is a member of it, and it is supposed to promote civilian, peaceful civilian nuclear energy, right? And it's supposed to prevent countries from developing nuclear weapons. I think that's a basic summary of it, and it mandates that non-nuclear weapons states have a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, um, and full of additional protocols and whatever they have the right sign. Well, no, they had an additional protocol that they were abiding, not even enriching at all while they were negotiating with the E3. And then what the JCPOA really did was add a bunch of additional protocols and subsidiary arrangements and agreements.\n Refused to ratify the additional protocol. I just want to just be clear on the facts. I mean, it's really important.\n At which point in time did they refuse to ratify? Because they did ratify the JCPOA, which was full of additional protocols and and subsidiary arrangements and agreements. They're called...\n There's, there's an important additional protocol that Iran refused.\nWhich one was that? One where they promised not to enrich at all, which they actually did abide by while they were negotiating with the E3 in the W. Bush years before they even started spinning.\n The important point you ask me, you, you asked me what I would advise the national security advisor of the United States, or if I was the national security advisor of the United States, which I, I guess I can't be because I'm a foreigner, but the fact of the matter is, is...\n I think you could still be national security advisor. Zbigniew Brzezinski sure was.\nI think he was taking a shot back at the fact that you took a shot.\n You know what, Lex? I think that you probably would recognize that there are many people who lobby for Israel's interests in the United States who clearly don't care that much about what happens to the United States of America in as a consequence because they care about Israel, which is a different country than America, right? It's not part of...\n I think an American, an American citizen cares primarily about America. That is a fundamental belief for me to make an accusation that they don't requires a very large amount of proof for each individual. I don't care.\n To pretend that American and Israel's interests are the same requires a tremendous amount of cognitive dissonance by those who support Israel's...\n Sponsor of terror as though Iran has anything to do...\n\n\nwith anti-American terrorists.\nI don't know who is the they that we're talking about, but I believe American citizens care about America first.\nThey may discuss other nations and the interests in the Middle East or in Europe and those interests might align with their own worldview, whatever.\nBut when it comes at the end of the day, if everybody starts a war with everybody else, they're America first.\nLike I I'm America first.\nIf there's a war that breaks out and we have to pick up guns, I'm fighting for America.\nI'll take them on a case by case basis.\nI know immigrants who are absolutely super patriots who know American history and love and care about America more than their nextoor neighbors who are from here.\nBut that ain't universal.\nOkay.\nAnd let's talk about case by case then.\nThat's fine.\nWell, I think I think I think he's clearly accusing me.\nA worse war with Iran.\nHe was entertained the possibility of putting ground troops in there.\nDon't take personal catastrophe of you.\nYou've taken personal shots.\nLet's not do it.\nYou guys are just having fun and I'm having fun.\nJust on the idea, he said that there's there's a threat to missiles.\nThere's a threat from Iranian missiles to America's bases in the Middle East.\nYeah.\nBecause of Israel and because of this war.\nThe first time Iran ever fired missiles at an American base over there was in response to Trump bombing them.\nIt's never fault.\nIs that what everybody thinks?\nIt was Iran who started this.\nLet's bring it back.\nWhat a joke.\nScott, it's a remarkable management.\nI want to reiterate this.\nAnd then Iran shot missiles at Qatar and Iraq.\nScott, you're a patriotic American.\nGod bless you.\nGod bless the United States.\nThank you for allowing me to come to this country and become an American.\nIt's a great country.\nUm and as a patriotic American, I assume that the the United States government and the United States intelligence community and the United States military, okay, has America's best interest at heart.\nHowever, we have learned from the history and Scott's done a very good job of detailing this during the Iraq War that the United States gets it wrong.\nOkay, I don't think the United States lied us into war, but the United States got it wrong.\nSo, I think Scott's right.\nWe must make sure that we learn the lessons of Iraq, but not overarn the lessons of Iraq.\nI would also say this, there are many lobby organizations in the United States.\nThere's the China lobby, there's the oil lobby, there's the the pharmaceutical lobby, there's the Qatar lobby.\nI live in Washington.\nI see all these lobby organizations.\nOkay.\nFact of the matter is the pro-Israel lobby which actually lobbies in support of the US-Israel relationship is comprised of tens of millions of Christians and Jews and Hindus and yes yes Muslims who believe strongly in a strong US-Israel relationship.\nThe reason that relationship has been so strong over so many years and that this quote lobby has been so successful is they're pushing through an open door with policy makers, not because some nefarious money influence, but because at the end of the day, the interests align.\nWe we we counter terrorism together, we counter nuclear proliferation together, and we believe that the US-Israel relationship is a strong relationship.\nAnd and these accusations of dual loyalty and these accusations of Israel firsters that Scott's thrown around I think distract us from the conversation which I think we should return to right let's talk about today we we've talked about best case scenarios we talked about worst case scenarios and we talked about really worst case scenarios so I think let's let's talk about the way forward and I I'd be interested in hearing from Scott where he thinks we're going and I'm certainly I I don't crystal ball these things it's always difficult to predict but I I I think President Trump has done a really good job.\nHe has led this, right?\nHe has not been, you know, the uh at the beck and call of BB Netanyahu or Muhammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia or anyone else.\nHe has led this effort.\nHe has made these decisions.\nThis is a man who throughout his entire career and not just his political career, but many many years before that believed that an Iranian nuclear weapon was a threat to the United States of America.\nNot just to our allies but to the United States of America.\nAnd he's been very clear on record.\nHe led this campaign since he started in January.\nHe offered negotiations.\nHe got rebuffed by the Iranians in Oman.\nHe put pressure on the regime economically.\nHe continued to offer negotiations.\nHe offered a very good something that I thought was flawed.\nI mean, Lex, I got to tell you, the the offer in Oman that he gave to the Iranians, I thought it was flawed because I think it allowed Iran to retain this key enrichment capability.\nThe Iranians turned it down.\nAnd I think Kame to his everlasting regret is going to wonder why did I turn that down?\nI could have got the enrichment capability that Scott thinks they deserve.\nAnd yet I rejected it.\nWhy?\nWhy did I reject it?\nCuz now look what's happened in the past 12 days.\nYou know, I've lost mostly.\nWe'll see what happens on the BDA, the battle damage assessment.\nI've certainly lost Natans.\nI've uh lost my conversion facility at Isfahan which converts uranium hexafflloride into uh into well converts yellow cake into uranium hexafflloride to pump into centrifuges and the most important thing I lost at isvahan there's a conversion facility that takes 90% enriched uranium and turns it into uranium metal without uranium metal they don't have any 90% enriched uranium he just means hypothetically if they did have some be you know the 60% that's 99% of the to 90% enriched uranium.\nBy the way, you can make a a crude nuclear device with 60% enriched uranium.\nI just want to put that on the record.\nBut he lost that key conversion facility that turns 90% enriched uranium or even 60% enriched uranium into uranium metal.\nYou need uranium metal to fashion a crude nuclear device or a warhead that's been destroyed.\nAnd I just when I was coming in this morning, I just checked.\nI thought it was interesting.\nBeen a whole lot of discussion about the fact that about 12 or 16 trucks showed up at Foraux in the days before the the US strikes and moved something out of Foraux.\nWell, according to reports just this morning, we'll we'll see if they're verified.\nI I don't trust single sourcing.\nI don't trust what some reporter just says in their stories because reporters got it wrong over and over again, especially all the ones who accuse President Trump of being a Russian agent.\nBut we'll see what happens.\nWe'll see if it's verified.\nBut according to the reports um most of the material remained at Fordo because the Iranians were calculating this was the most heavily fortified facility.\nThey were also calculating that President Trump was not going to strike it because what they had been doing was listening to lots of voices and we can name the voices or we can just talk talk to them about a collective who were who they thought were telling Trump don't do it and we're telling Trump don't do it and Trump decided on his own to do it.\nSo, they kept the enriched material at Foraux.\nAnd if that's the case, it may be that much of it was destroyed.\nAgain, caveat, it's just one or two stories right now, uh, one in NBC News, and let's see what happens over the coming days, but if that's the case, that material may have been destroyed.\nOne other element that we haven't even talked about at all today, which I think your listeners should be aware of, we talked a lot about nuclear weapons development, warhead development.\nWhat the Israelis did was they took out the top 15 nuclear weapons scientists who have been part of, you remember I talked about that original Ahmad program and the development of those five atomic weapons.\nWell, some of them who are old enough come from the Ahmad program which was the early 2000s.\nSome of them are new, but they've been or not new but younger and they've been trained by the veterans.\nThe 15 top guys taken out.\nThat is akin to it's January or February 45 and the entire central team of Oppenheimer gets eliminated three to four months between the Trinity test before the Trinity test where we explode our first nuclear weapon.\nSo I would say significant damage to Iran's nuclear weapons program suggests that we potentially have rolled them back for years.\nI don't know how many years and all those technical assessments are still to come but significant damage.\nSo the question, as I said, is have they retained enough capabilities that they've squirreled away, stored in covert sites, put under deeply buried tunnels to break out to nuclear weapons?\nThat's Scott's concern.\nIt's my concern.\nLike I'm sure it's your concern that they could do that.\nOr have have they set back the program so significantly that Kame then has to decide will I be inviting another Israeli and or US attack if I try to break out?\nAnd if I do, do I risk my regime?\nwho thinks that if they break out and try to start making nukes now that any hawk supporting this war will take responsibility for driving them to it.\nSo the the suggestion you're making is we're actually driving of course as opposed to doing the opposite.\nWe're actually driving them to develop nuclear weapons.\nThat's right.\nCan you make the case that?\nYeah.\nPreviously he said let's take the Ayatollah at his word that he only wants a civilian electricity program.\nWell, let's not take him at his word.\nAgain, I never said in this conversation, trust the Ayatollah.\nHe did.\nNow he's kind of But you said that the Ayatollah doesn't want nuclear weapons programs.\nScott, you were very clear about that.\nWhat I said about nuclear weapons program, are you going back on that now?\nJesus Christ.\nWhat I was very clear about from my very first statement when we sat down was that the Ayatollah was building himself a latent nuclear deterrent putting Iran as what they call a threshold nuclear weapon state just like Brazil and Germany and Japan so everyone knows they have mastered the fuel cycle they could enrich uranium up to 90% don't make me do it that was his position weapons program did you ever hear me say anything about believing the Ayatollah saying he only wanted an electricity program.\nThis is why enrichment is a red line.\nIt's because if all the enrichment is done overseas somewhere, then it's not a latent nuclear deterrent at all.\nSo, it's a red line for you as well as for me.\nWe agree, Scott.\nI'm saying it's a red line for the Ayatollah that he's clearly not going to give in on and it's a poison pill by the Israelis in the West.\nThey know he's never going to give up enrichment 100%.\nUm because that's the whole point of it.\nSo it's just disingenuous to say, &quot;Oh, let's believe him that he wants an an electricity program.&quot;\nHe's not saying that.\nI don't even think that's his official position.\nOr if it is, it's with a strong implication as everyone understands that it's a latent nuclear weapons capability and a potential actual nuclear weapons capability.\nDo you a deal will have to include enrichment?\nYes, that is a red line.\nHe won't move off.\nYes.\nAnd then the thing is too, just like I was saying before, if Trump had come in in 2017 and said, &quot;Screw this.\nI hate this deal.&quot;\nAnd then got on a plane and flown straight to Tyrron and said, or you know, sent his guys and said, &quot;Now listen here, Ayatollah, I want to fix this deal up better.&quot;\nI think that he really could have.\nAnd I don't I already said I don't know the details, but I believe Mark when he says that the Europeans were being intrigent on that.\nAnd again, I criticize the CIA and FBI for framing Trump for treason, for preventing him from being able to work with the Russians to see if maybe they could put pressure on the Ayatollah to deal with him.\nBut I think that it's clear when the Ayatollah was willing in the JCPOA to well, first of all, to sign the additional protocol back in the W.\nBush years for year for three years, he didn't enrich anything under that deal as long as he was negotiating with the E3.\nAnd then under the JCPOA where he's shipping out every bit of his declared nuclear material, he's clearly keeping the ability to enrich uh if necessary to uh weapons grade if if a crisis breaks out.\nAnd he feels like he has to make nukes, but he has he had no stockpile to enlist this whole thing about 99% of the way there.\nHe had no stockpile.\nSo even if you uh you know count drive gassing up your truck on the way to the mine as part of this long time scale of percentages here they were much further from a nuke under the deal which he agrees we shouldn't have even gotten out of.\nCan I just say technically just I think again important for your listeners to understand under the JCPOA um Iran is allowed to keep a stockpile of maximum of 300 kg as I remember of 3.67% enriched material.\nThey're allowed to continue to enrich as long as if they go over the 300 kilogram, they have to continue to send that out to Russian um to to Russia to blend down.\nAnd so they kept the enrichment capability, the ability to enrich.\nThey did keep a stockpile.\nScott's right.\nThey weren't able to they're not allowed in those early years to go under 3.67%.\nThey would be allowed to go to 20% and 60% and 90% as the restrictions sunseted, but they were able to keep all of those keep capabilities.\nSo, I just want to clarify just technically what the JCPOA actually said and what it didn't say.\nYeah.\nCan you comment on the so-called operation midnight hammer now that we can look back at it?\nWhat parts were successful or what parts were a mistake?\nWas the whole operation a mistake that accelerates the Iran nuclear program, the incentives for it, or is there some components that actually is a disincentive, disincentive for Iran to develop the program?\nAnd then maybe you can comment on the same.\nIt'd be nice to get comment.\nI think we really don't know, right?\nThere's some initial battle assessments and arguments and all that about just how much was destroyed and what and we don't know exactly what their reaction is going to be.\nUm the you know there were reports of them saying hey we're already starting up a new facility somewhere else.\nUh there were reports where they said hey a lot of our centrifuges survived and we're going to start spinning them up right now and this kind of thing.\nUm the potential is there.\nI don't know what the ITL is going to do.\nAnd I think this goes to the larger argument about the apocalyptic threat of the ayah which\n\n\nMark has not made, but which Israel hawks often do, that these guys just can't wait to get into a war and all this. In fact, if you look at a war. But the argument I make is we're not going to use a nuclear weapon. You interrupt me every time. I try to, Scott. I just, you're mischaracterizing what I'm saying. I need to clarify when you misar. He's not interrupting you every time, but sometimes interrupting. Yes. Uh, so try not to interrupt as much. Uh, go ahead, Scott. Don't take it personally. Come on. Let's go.\n\nIt seems like a deliberate attempt to obfuscate and and prevent me from just being able to complete a point. You know, he does it virtually every time.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nAs a listener, I'm enjoying this. Uh, well, look on the face of it, they blew up a lot of stuff, and they made them very angry. So are they going to now give in, or they're now going to double down, or they're now going to hold still? We don't really know. As I was trying to explain from the Ayatollah's position that he's in. What are you going to do with a problem like the United States of America? Right? They can chant \"Great Satan\" this and that all they want. They have no ability to really threaten this country in any way. And they, and they know that America absolutely does have the ability to, in fact, even without nuclear weapons, essentially wipe their civilization off the face of the earth just with B-52s if we wanted to carpet bomb their major cities. And they, so they know that the Ayatollah knows he's in a very difficult position. And look at what he did when they assassinated Soleimani. He sent essentially a symbolic strike at an empty corner of an American base in Iraq. It did cause some concussions and head trauma, but it was, he deliberately did that to not cause casualties. And then Trump let him have the last word. And then also when they shot down the drone, which I think Trump was suspicious that the Pentagon had flown that into Iranian airspace, and they demanded strikes, and Trump said, \"No, it's just a drone. How many Iranians will die at the base you want me to hit? No, I don't want to kill them. I don't want to do it.\" And again, he let the Ayatollah get the last word. Same thing happened again with yesterday's strikes. Iran hit America's, our central command headquarters, the Aludid air base in Qatar, and also an American uh base, I think in Baghdad, and I'm not sure about in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nZero casualties so far.\n\nZero casualties so far. So what is going on there essentially is he's got to do something, and he's doing like these symbolic strikes essentially to say like, \"Hey, you can't do that to me,\" but then he's also telegraphing that, \"Hey, like, I can't do anything about you, and I don't really want to fight.\" And so in a way, he's like kind of backing down. He's doing, and then what did Donald Trump say? Donald Trump again let him have the last word and in fact, like, bragged and mocked and said, \"Hey, thanks, Ayatollah, for giving us a warning that you were about to shoot missiles at our base so we could be ready to shoot them all down,\" and this kind of thing. And he said, \"Now is the time for peace.\" In other words, Trump again letting the Ayatollah get the last word. Why? Because the Ayatollah, he might be a horrible leader if you live in Iran, but he is not perfectly, but essentially cautious in foreign policy because what's he going to do? He's going to decimate our naval base at Bahrain. He's going to slaughter all our troops in Kuwait. And then what's Trump going to do? And so the Ayatollah knows. So, it's the same people who, who, and I don't include him in this, but you hear a lot of the hawkish talk about just how easy this has been. These same people talking about what an absolutely irrational uh, religiously uh, motivatedly and motivated and therefore, you know, crazy and irrational uh, group of people, the mullazar, and why they can only be dealt with with force, when in fact what they're showing is essential conservatism, trying to hold on to what they got, making a latent deterrent because they know if they break out toward a bomb, that'll get them boned. So they were hoping having the latent deterrent would be enough to just keep them at the status quo. That's why it's so disingenuous, just again with um, uh, Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, saying, \"Forget the intelligence because 60% hey, it's 99% of the way there, close enough for us.\" So it doesn't matter if the Ayatollah has decided to make a nuke or not. They're just too close to one as it is. Which is really silly because they're not much closer than they've been for 20 years since the W. Bush administration, they proved they've mastered the fuel cycle. That is one of the fundamental disagreements in the room that you're saying they don't have, they really don't have interest to develop a nuclear uh, weapon, and they're not quite.\n\nWell, not exactly. I mean, I more towards that direction than Mark is saying.\n\nMore toward, but they're saying, \"Look at us, we're a threshold state. Don't push your luck and and force us to make the bad decision.\" They have now, that's an implication. They have not said that outright, but clearly the implication is that if we force them, then they will go ahead and make a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhat I mean is, if left on their own devices, they would not develop. That's the case you're making.\n\nNot just on their own devices, but if we were to try to negotiate with them in good faith and try to have normal relations with them, that would disincentivize a nuclear weapon even further.\n\nOkay. Can you comment on the mission operation and general?\n\nSure. A couple things I think were interesting what Scott said, and I agree with, with certainly with some of it. Um, I mean, the first thing is, I, I do believe President Trump has negotiated in good faith. I mean, he sent Steve Wickoff, he's chief negotiator for five rounds of negotiations since he came in office. Um, the second is, I mean, we can keep going around in circles, but the, the fact of the matter is, I do believe that Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations have, for since 1979, uh, killed and tried to kill and maim Americans and taken them hostage. I think it's important for me again to put that on the record. But where I agree with, with Scott is, I, and it's interesting, and I don't know if Kame has changed in his, you know, he's 86 years old, he's been in power since 1989, and there's a little bit of history that I think is really interesting, Lex. It was the, it was 1988, and uh, Iran and Iraq had fought this brutal 8-year War, million people dead, and um, the United States accidentally shot down a Iranian passenger airline. The United States offered to pay compensation and apologized. The Iranians didn't believe it. They didn't believe we could accidentally do that. They thought we were going to be intervening militarily on behalf of Saddam. So, Kame, who's not the supreme leader at the time, he was the Iranian president. He and Raf Sanjani, they go to Kmeni and they say, \"Mr. Ayatollah, we got to sue for peace with the Iraqis because the Americans are intervening, and and we cannot fight the Americans. We fought this brutal war. We'll continue with Saddam. We cannot fight the United States of America.\" I think Scott's right, like that perception that there's no way they can fight the United States of America because that's regime-ending potentially, even if we don't intend to, that could actually happen. And there's a famous line where Kmeni says, \"All right, I agree. I will drink the poison chalice. I'll drink the poison chalice, and I will agree to a ceasefire on pretty tough terms for Iran.\" It's interesting now, 36 years later, or 37 years later, Kame is now going to decide to drink the poison chalice. Does he agree to a negotiated deal with the United States? Does he agree to a deal that President Trump, and I mean, Scott criticizes me for it, but that's President Trump's position is no enrichment, full dismantlement. By the way, that's backed up by 52 of 53 Republican senators and 177 House GOP members and backed by everybody in his administration, including JD Vance, who's been emphatic about that. Does he agree to that deal, or does he decide, \"I'm not going to join the poison chalice, and I am going to, I'm going to take other options?\" Now, I agree with Scott, like going after U.S. military bases, except in a symbolic way, suicidal. Closing the Straits of Hormuz. 40% of Chinese oil goes through there. The Chinese have been saying to the Iranians, \"Don't you dare.\" By the way, 100% of Iranian oil goes from Iran in Carg Island through the Straits of Hormuz. So economically suicidal for the Iranians to do that. Um, terror attacks, absolutely. I mean, that has been their modus operand for years. So, I would be concerned about uh, terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, against civilians, um, potentially sleeper cells in the United States. So, he's used terasels around the world. He's engaged in a decades-long assassination campaign, including on American soil, by the way, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, including most recently where he went after an Iranian-American three times to try to assassinate her in New York, a woman named Masielad. And so he's got to be calculating, like, what is my play? So if I don't do a deal, how can I actually squeeze the Americans? And Scott's right, like he must be thinking to himself, \"You know what? I was literally on the 99-yard line with an entire nuclear weapons capability. I should have crossed the goal line. If I had had a warhead, a nuclear warhead or multiple nuclear warheads, as they had been trying to build since the Ahmad plan in early 2000s, there's no way Israel and the United States would have hit me militarily if I had nuclear weapons. Then I would have had the ultimate deterrence to prevent that. And then I would be like Kim Jong-un with nuclear weapons. I would then build ICBMs, and then I'd have the ultimate deterrent to stop that.\" So he's got to be thinking maybe now, and I, I can guarantee you the revolutionary guards.\n\nDo you think that that might have anything to do with the fact that America attacked Iraq and Libya when they did not have weapons of mass destruction programs?\n\nCan I tell you the Libya example? I think Scott is the most interesting one for me. Right. Because the Libya example, it was a big mistake. By the way, Ukraine is another good example of this. We went to the Libyans and we said, \"You must fully dismantle your program.\" And Gaddafi said, reluctantly, under huge American pressure, \"Okay, I'll do it.\" And the Brits and the and the Americans went in there and literally hauled out his entire nuclear.\n\nIt wasn't really a program. It was just a bunch of AQN's junk sitting in crates in a warehouse. They did not have the capability to make a nuclear program at all in Libya. They didn't have the the engineers, the scientists, or anyone. So Gaddafi had bought that junk just to trade it away.\n\nJust to be clear, there never was a nuclear weapons program or a nuclear program of any kind in Libya, unlike what you just heard.\n\nThat wasn't my point. Okay. My point is, is he had a nuclear program. We can debate about, again, how we debating about whether, again, it's always Gaddafi and Kame and all these people. They don't really want nuclear weapons. We just misunderstand them. But, but that's not the point. The point is, we did a deal with Gaddafi. We pulled out his nuclear program, and then, I don't know how many years later, but it wasn't too many years later. Seven years later, thank you, Scott. We actually took, took Gaddafi out, and he didn't have a nuclear program. So, we took him out in in the Libya operation. Now, Ukraine is another great example. The Ukrainians after the fall of Soviet Union, you know this, they had the Soviet nuclear arsenal or or good parts of it on their soil. So, we went to them and we said, \"All right, well, here's a deal for you. Give up the nuclear arsenal right off your territory, and we, we, and the Russians and the French guarantee your territorial integrity and your sovereignty as a country.\" So the Ukrainians said, \"Fair deal to me,\" gave up all the nuclear weapons, and then Putin has now invaded Ukraine.\n\nThat's not what Bucharest declaration says that we promised their security. We promised to respect it, and the Russians promised to, and both sides broke that promise. But there is nothing like a guarantee that America would protect Ukraine's sovereignty. They gave up those nukes, and they had no ability to use those nukes anyway because they were Soviet nukes with Soviet codes. They belong to the Soviet military, and the Ukrainians would had no ability to use them or deliver them. They were married to missiles that were made to fly around the world, not to Russia next door.\n\nScott, my point is, and I think this, you'll agree with this. My point is, if you're Kame, and you've seen those two examples of Libya, you gave up your nuclear program, Gaddafi gets taken down.\n\nYou're Ukraine, you gave up your nuclear weapons, and the Russians invaded twice. If you're Kame thinking to yourself, the only thing that matters more to me than my nuclear weapons program is my regime survival. And in 12 days of war, the Israelis specifically, because we hit Foraux and Isvahan and Hans, we, the United States hit those sites. We, the United States hit those sites. The gleeful nature, Scott, like, stop. Take that out. There's no place here in this room with me. The un-American bullshit. Don't do that. The implication here, man, is that I me un-American. And I've been attacked just like the Russian hoax for being a Putin shill. I'm an American.\n\nWell, when you talk about Ukraine's war with Russia, do you say we or do you say they?\n\nI said we, the United States. We, we actually.\n\nWell, you added the United States, but you were just described Israel strikes. Israel didn't strike for Scott. You talked about the US attack on you. You're you're speaking to this other people that you've heard that somehow they do say we, and they talk about, I would say ridiculously, as if uh, I've even heard some people basically put Israel above us, and they're American citizens. Yeah, that's fucking ridiculous. But none of those people are in this room. The, the, the there are demons under the bed. I'm sure those people exist. There's ridiculous people on the internet. There's ridiculous people in Congress who can criticize them, make fun of them, say they\n\n\n're fucking.\n\nThe Foundation for Defense of Democracies has been the vanguard of the war party in this country for 25 years.\nWell, that's a different criticism, but I was, I was... It's an important one. Yeah. Yeah. But no, you just switched. You just switched. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's no... You just switched from the unamerican discussion to criticizing policies that that particular institute. Fine, and criticize the policies. Do that unamerican bullshit.\n\nLex, the neoconservative movement is the vanguard of the Israel lobby. That's who they are. That's what neoconservatism is about. I'm not a... who the neoconservative, so I don't know who he's talking about, but I'm not. Let's not mix stuff up. There, there, there is a massive Israel lobby in America in Washington that is inseparable from the American war party. Yeah. Yeah. I've talked to John Mir. I respect him deeply. He is one of the most brilliant uh people speaking on that topic. Great. Great. Let's just talk about today and the nuclear proliferation. You guys have been brilliant on this. I'm learning a lot. Let's continue. Yeah. So, let's let's go back to where where Kame may be. I mean, in a bunker, 86 years old, thinking he's going to drink the poison chalice and agree to a deal with Donald Trump and Oman, or is he going to do all of the things that Scott and I are concerned about? And one of those, and Scott has pointed this out rightly so, is he may decide now to to break out for the nuke or creep out for the nuke. He may decide not to do it now. He may decide to do it in three and a half years when President Trump is gone. Right? And I think that the the the important thing is he's seen we, the United States, we took out Fordo and Natans and Isvahan in one operation with B2 bombers and and 12 30,000 lb massive orange penetrators and Tomahawk missiles. So if he doesn't think, if he didn't think that the United States had serious military power before, he now knows we do. So to you, that operation was geopolitically a success. It sends a message of strength that if you try to build, you're going to be punished for it.\n\nSo I've said online in the past 12 days and even before that, curb your enthusiasm. Curb your enthusiasm to all the people...\n\nRelated to which topic? Yeah. Just just this sort of idea that this has been like this unbelievable success and everything's great and everything's going to be amazing and we've stopped the Nuclear Weapons program and this has been a resounding success. I've just said kind of curb your enthusiasm. Kame remains very dangerous. The regime remains very dangerous. A wounded animal is the most dangerous animal in the animal kingdom. He retains key capabilities to build weapons.\n\nYou demanded unconditional surrender on Twitter again last night. Right after Trump said there's a ceasefire. What does unconditional surrender mean? No enrichment, full dismantlement. Yes. Exactly right. It's exactly what President Trump... Well, I... not regime change. Unconditional surrender in World War II meant the end of the Nazi regime and the imperialist Japanese regime entirely. Right. But President Trump made it very clear. President Trump made it very clear. He, he made it clear, I don't support regime change. Well, except for that one... a few hours earlier, right? I, I'll actually, I'll explain that one, cuz I thought it was analyze it like a Shakespeare. What is that? Yeah. Yeah. And what, what, what did he also mean? We have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. What's that about? He was angry that Israel was still attacking after he promised they weren't. He demanded they turn their planes around. He felt that they were doing it in defiance of their agreement. But he didn't say Israel. He says the both countries... different quote, different quote. He did say, I demand, I believe it was a tweet from True Social. I demand that Israel turn those planes around right now was how upset he was about.\n\nI guess Donald Trump doesn't listen to BB all the time, does he? Yeah. I guess he's finding out they respect him about as much as they respect a Palestinian. Well, that's called world leaders. Help. World leaders are interested in their own nation. That's right. They fuck you over. Good important lesson there, everyone. What does Israel care about? Israel. Every country, every country then defends its national interest. I mean, that's not unusual for Israel or any other country. But I think to understand... we're supposed to pretend that, hey, whatever Israel needs, we're here to serve their interest. If those people exist, they're unamerican. If people put Israel's interest, we fight terrorism together. Well, we do. Well, we, we generate terrorism together. What are you talking about? But that doesn't mean you put Israel's interest above America's. If you do, you're unamerican. You know how many American lives these Israeli intelligence community has saved? Um, and ask, ask people in the FBI and CIA who were counterterrorism, how many American lives the Israelis have saved because of their intelligence capabilities. How about when enough Bennett... well, again, bomb that shelter full of women and children and caused the September 11th attack. That's what happened. In fact, I don't know if you know the story, but you could Google this. You like googling things. It's on Google books. You can read Perfect Soldiers by Terry McDermott, or you could read The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, where both of them explained how when Shimon Perez launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, that Ramsay bin Ali and Muhammad Ata filled out their last will and testament, which was like symbolically joining the army to fight against the infidels, etc., etc. And when Bin Laden put out his first declaration of war a couple of months later, it began with a whole rant about the 106 women and children that Naftali Bennett had killed with an artillery strike in a UN shelter in, in, um, in Kana in 1996. And, and he said, \"We'll never forget the severed arms and heads and legs of the little babies, etc.\" And it was then that Muhammad Ata and Ramsay bin Alshe decided that they would join al-Qaeda and that they, these Egyptian engineering students studying in Hamburg, Germany, would volunteer for this Saudi chic to kill 3,000 Americans to get revenge for what Israel was doing to helpless women and children in Lebanon. As well as, of course... of course ignores the history of al-Qaeda, which for years before that was the United States operations against the United States, but executing them. You guys love pulling each other into history. They went, they went out with al-Qaeda. Just one second. America's problems with al-Qaeda is Israel. America and Israel are terrorist, terrorist states. They were America's mercenaries that we used in Afghanistan, in Bosnia, and Chechnya. When they turned against, I mean, America, they turned against us. Anyone could read Michael's book, the former chief of the CIA, Bin Laden, Imperial Hubris, and it's about how the number one reason they attacked us was American bases on Saudi soil to bomb Iraq as part of Israel's dual containment policy. And the second reason was American support for Israel in their merciless persecution of the Palestinians and the Lebanese. That's the most articulate justification I've ever heard for al-Qaeda in my life. But let's... it's not a justification. I'm not saying that makes what they did right. I'm saying that was how Bin Laden recruited his foot soldiers to attack this country was by citing American foreign policies that were directly to the detriment of the people of the Middle East and specifically our support for Israel. And I've never heard a pro, in fact, I take that back. There's one guy, a liberal from The Nation magazine named Eric Alterman is the only pro-Israel guy I've ever heard say, \"Well, that may be true, but I still say we got to support Israel anyway.\" The others, they'll just pretend that Terry McDermott never wrote that book, that Lawrence Wright never wrote that book, that Muhammad Ata had no motive to turn on the United States except for Muhammad made him do it. When in fact what it was is it was the ultraviolence of Shimon Perez and artillery officer Naftali Bennett slaughtering women and children that turned America's mercenaries... America backed the Arab Afghan army in Afghanistan, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and in Cheschna, as I demonstrate in my book, and yet, as he correctly says, they turned on us all through the 1990s. Bill Clinton was still backing them anyway after they were attacking us and including at Cobar Towers, and they were doing that is this was a bin Laden plot, not Hezbollah, not the Shiites. This was the Bin Laden getting revenge against us for support for Israel and being too close to their local dictators that they wanted to overthrow, namely the king of Saudi and the El Presidente of Egypt. That is the cause of the September 11th attack against the United States. Not the Taliban hate freedom, but the bin Laden hate American support for Israel and America adopting policies, Israeli-centric policies like Martin Indict's uh dual containment policy in 193.\n\nI think al-Qaeda hates America, Scott, I think. Why? You know what? I'll tell you what, Ali Sufan, you know, Ali Sufan, the former FBI agent, counterterrorism agent, he wrote in his book, The Black Banners, that the Bin Laden said to Bin Laden, \"We don't understand why you're so angry at America. They've been so good to us in Afghanistan, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and now here in Chechnya. Why do you want to attack them?\" Said, \"I have a larger agenda that you don't understand.\"\n\nThe disagreement between you is clear. I've talked to Nam Chsky twice. Scott, you focus on the criticism. Interview Michael Shyer. Well, although he's gone pretty crazy lately. I don't know, maybe not. Anyway, we're going into history. We're learning a lot. The perspectives differ strongly. Uh, can we look into the, maybe a ridiculous question, but a nuclear proliferation? You already started to speak to both of you. Uh, if you look like 10, 20 years out now, does, does the U.S. attacking Iran, does that send a message... even to NBS, to other Middle Eastern nations that they need to start thinking about a nuclear weapon program, specifically, like, do you think just in a numbers way, does the number of nukes in the world go up in 10, 20, 30 years?\n\nSo, look, I, I think, uh, it's a great question. Will there be more nuclear weapons powers in the future or less as a result of this decision by President Trump? So, I actually think there'll be less, um, and I'll tell you, uh, it's succinently as I can, and that is that it's been very clear from the Saudis, from the Turks, um, certainly from the, um, even the Algerians and others that if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, they too want a nuclear weapon. In fact, the Saudis have gone even further and said if, if Iran is allowed to retain the key enrichment capability that they have under JCPOA, that we want that too. If there's an Iran standard, we want the Iran standard. We don't want the gold standard. In fact, that's been the subject of intensive negotiations between the United States and Saudi Arabia for the past couple years, both under Biden and Trump as part of the U.S.-Saudi uh agreement, defense agreement and economic agreement that that has been underway. It is, it's very clear that there's going to be a proliferation cascade in the Middle East if the Iranians get a nuclear weapon and certainly if they're allowed to retain this enrichment capability. I also worry about, we haven't even talked about at all this conversation. I mean, the most important area in the world, the United States is not the Middle East, it's China and the Indopacific. And I worry that the South Koreans, the Taiwanese, and the Japanese will say, \"You know what? We don't trust any U.S. commitments to stop nuclear weapons. You failed on Iran. We don't trust you. We don't trust your nuclear umbrella. We too want nuclear weapons in order to guard our security against China.\" And so what you would see, I, I hope it doesn't happen, but I worry about is this kind of proliferation cascade in the Middle East and in the Indo Pacific, two of the most important areas for American national security, which is why I think it's very important that that be that Iran's be stopped. Now whether this attack is succeeds in stopping Iran's nuclear weapon or accelerates it, we, we disagree, but I think neither of us know yet. Hard to predict. But what I think is absolutely certain is that if Iran develops that nuclear weapon and is allowed to retain the key capabilities to do so, you're going to see five, six countries in the Middle East, at least three, four countries in the Indo Pacific asking for the same capability. And then you're going to have a club of nuclear weapons powers uh that will have an additional five, six, seven over the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nWhat if they don't? What if they're prevented? Doesn't that still send the same message to everybody that they should build? Oh, I think it sends the opposite message, Lex. I think if they see what has happened and that it's and that it's successful and it stopped Iran from developing nuclear weapons and in addition, Trump was able to negotiate an agreement for zero enrichment and full dismantlement. And the message to all these other countries is number one, you don't need it. And number two, if you try to get it, then the United States is going to use American power. Now, I'm not suggesting the United States is going to start bombing the Saudis or the Turks or the Amiradis. Clearly, not the Japanese. I mean, these are many of them are allies. But I think the United States retains many tools, counterpril tools to prevent these countries from developing nuclear weapons, including, you know, sanctions and export controls and many of the things. And plus, I think those countries, you know, understand that in the Middle East, despite Scott's focus on Israel, you know, when you talk to Arab leaders, their biggest concern is the threat from Iran. It's not the threat from Israel. They're not concerned with the threat from Israel. That's why you had the Abraham Accords. It, you know, this is why the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco entered into this peace agreement with Israel. The Saudis will one day, and they'll bring many other Arab and Muslim countries in it. They don't say Israel is a threat. They see Iran as a threat. And so if you counter that threat, you eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons proliferation and expansion. Those countries now...\n\n\nLonger.\nHave to build nuclear weapons capabilities to counter the Iranians.\nNow, we've also restored our credibility.\nWe don't bluff.\nWe said Iran doesn't develop nuclear weapons.\nThey won't.\nAnd now it's the Japanese who have, as Scott rightly pointed out, they do have reprocessing and plutonium capabilities.\nUm, the Taiwanese who used to have a military nuclear weapons program and gave it up.\nAnd the South Koreans who agreed to our gold standard of zero enrichment, zero reprocessing, those three countries can now say, \"Okay, we rely on the United States on your word, on your power, and on your ability to actually turn words into action.\nWe don't need nuclear weapons.\nSo I say if successful, big if, big if, if successful, then it's going to be a significant um guard against the potential of greater nuclear proliferation and we will have less nuclear powers, nuclear weapons powers than uh than we otherwise would have.\nMy favorite thing is when you guys point out when you agree with the other person.\nAnyway, uh Scott, what do you think?\nWhat what do you think everything that's just happened over the past two weeks does to nuclear proliferation over the next 5, 10, 20 years?\nWell, I mean, I really don't know for sure, but I would think that um the uh there's a very great danger that it's going to reinforce the lessons of North Korea, Iraq, and Libya, which is you better get a nuke to keep America out and you better hurry before it's too late.\nNow, for the Saudis, they're not going to do that cuz they're obviously a very close American client state.\nSo, it's a different dynamic there.\nBut, you know, for any country that has trouble with the U.S. or is worried about the future of their ability to maintain their national sovereignty, obviously getting their hands on an A-bomb as quickly as possible is uh has been, you know, reincentivized to a great degree.\nAlso, I'm really worried about the future of the non-proliferation treaty with the nuclear weapons states promise to respect the right of non-nuclear weapons states to civilian nuclear energy and where here you have a non-PT signatory nuclear weapons state Israel launch an aggressive war against an NPT signatory that is was not attacking them and was not making nuclear weapons and with the assistance of the world empire the United States.\nAnother nuclear weapons state signatory to the NPT.\nAnd I don't really take this that seriously, but it's worth at least listening to is uh Madv, the uh once and probably future president of Russia.\nHe said, \"Oh yeah, well maybe we'll just give him a nuke or kind of implied maybe get Pakistan too.\"\nNow, for people familiar with like Key and Peele, Madv is sort of angry Obama, right, for Putin.\nYou know that skit where it's like Obama talks all calm and translator.\nPeele goes off like an angry black guy kind of character, right?\nHe's been going nuts on X.\nYeah.\nVev, he he goes way out, you know, above and beyond.\nBut I think he's probably acting on instructions to talk that way.\nAnd it is a real risk that the MPT could just fall apart when it becomes when it's treated uh so callously by the United States who invented it and insisted that the rest of the world adopt the thing to such a great degree.\nTrump did say don't use the nword.\nHe he talked down to midv around the end the nuclear word.\nYeah.\nWell and and I appreciate that.\nGood.\nHe's right.\nHe's right in that not Pakistanis could give a nuke to Iran who are their friends.\nI think not the tightest of allies.\nI'm not saying I predict that, but there's a danger of that.\nUm, now when it comes to, you know, Eastern Asia, obviously there's a concern about a Chinese threat to Taiwan, but nobody thinks China's coming for South Korea or Japan.\nThe the question of Taiwan is one that's very different because, as the American president agreed with Ma Tong 50 years ago, Taiwan is part of China and eventually will be reunited, although we hope that's not by force.\nSince then, they have essentially abandoned Marxism, although it's still a one-party authoritarian state, but they've essentially abandoned Marxism, adopted markets, at least to the degree that they've been able to afford to now build up a a giant naval force that is capable of retaking Taiwan.\nAnd so I think the way to prevent that is not from making a bunch of threats and setting examples in other places about how tough we are, but to negotiate with the Chinese and the Taiwanese and figure out a way to reunite the two in a peaceful way in order to prevent that war from breaking out.\nBecause in fact, we don't really have the naval and air capability to defend Taiwan.\nWe could lose a lot of guys trying and probably kill a lot of Chinese trying, but in the end, they'd probably take Taiwan anyway, and we'd have lost a bunch of ships and and planes for nothing.\nSo, we can negotiate an end to that.\nAnd then even if America just withdrew from the region, we could still negotiate long-term agreements between China, Japan, South Korea, and whoever, there's no reason to think that everyone would make a mad scramble to a bomb to protect them uh if the moment they are out from under America's nuclear umbrella and so forth.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that um you know the greatest threat to the status quo as far as the nuclear powers go probably is what just happened.\nAmerica and Israel launching this war against the non-nuclear weapons state as a member in good standing of this treaty throws the the whole as they call it the liberal rules-based world order into question.\nI mean, if these rules repeatedly always apply to everyone else, but very often not to us, then are they really the law or this is just the will of men in Washington DC?\nAnd how long do we expect the rest of the world to go ahead and abide by that?\nIf you know, a deal is a deal until we decide, as Bill Clinton said, to wake up one morning and decide that we don't like it anymore and and change it.\nThat was a phrase from the founding act of '97.\nHuh?\nMaybe we'll wake up one morning and decide that we want to do something else entirely.\nIs that your Bill Clinton impression?\nNo, I'll spare you.\nOkay, that was pretty good.\nAfter the show when we're not recording, I'll show.\nCan I respond to a couple things here just really quickly?\nI'll try to do it quickly.\nUm, first of all, you know, the notion that Iran is in full compliance with the NPT um is is just not the case.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has made it clear in report after report after report that Iran is in violation of its obligations under the um protocols of the IAEA under the request that the IAEA have made and under the NPT.\nSo they are a serial violator of the NPT unlike all these other countries we've been talking about that are our allies.\nSecond is this this quote um Iran is not attacking Israel.\nThat's quite an amazing quote um which kind of ignores I think uh 50, 60 years of Iranian attacks against Israel including um suicide bombings and missiles and drones and October 7th and it it's indisputable that Iran has been attacking Israel and they've been they've been doing it for many years through their terror proxies that they fund and finance and and weaponize and since uh October 7th, they directly struck Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles in April and October of last year.\nSo this notion that before 12 days ago, Iranians were just playing nice with the Israelis and the Israelis just came out out of the blue.\nWell, you said quote unquote Iran is not is not attacking Israel.\nSo I mean it's just not true.\nYeah.\nThey were not in a state of war until Israel launched a state of war.\nThat's the fact that you go oh well they backed a group that did a thing.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nThat kill thousands and of Israelis, ma thousands of Israelis, but that was not ordered in Tehran.\nThe Wall Street Journal says that U.S. intelligence does not believe that Tehran ordered that attack.\nThey found out about Journal says and what the U.S. intelligence says, and we can dispute whether they directed it on October 7th.\nEverybody knows indisputably that Iran financed Hamas, provided Hamas weapons.\nJust well, just a second.\nProvided Hamas with weapons that the IRGC and the Quds Force were training Hamas.\nHisbala backed by Iran was training Hamas.\nThere were three meetings before October 7th, one in Beirut, one in Damascus, and one in Tehran where the IRGC, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were together.\nThere was a meeting in Tehran that was attended by Khamenei, the Supreme Leader.\nNow, at those three meetings right before October 7th, you know, maybe they're discussing the weather, maybe they were discussing Persian poetry, I don't know, but it is hard to believe they weren't discussing something.\nAnd the fact that they had armed Hamas, financed Hamas, and weaponized Hamas suggests to me that there is pretty overwhelming evidence that Iran has been at war with Israel for decades.\nCritics of Israel will say that Benjamin Netanyahu has also been indirectly financing Hamas by allowing the fund the funds going America backs Israel, so anything Israel does is America's responsibility, too, under that same logic.\nRight.\nI think you started to make a a point disagreeing with Scott about that.\nThey're not a good member of the NPT.\nThat's all tiny technical violations.\nNone of that has anything to do with weaponization.\nIt's always, oh yeah, how do you explain this isotope?\nAnd they go, well, it must have came with the Pakistani junk that we bought from A.Q. Khan.\nAnd then later that's verified.\nAnd they go, yeah, well, we want to inspect this.\nLet us.\nAnd they go, no.\nOh, and then they do a year later and then they find nothing there.\nYeah, that's just not the case.\nEntire history of Iran of the IAEA's objections to Iran.\nSo your listeners, I know they're not going to do it because it's a lot of technical, but just go out, go out and read IAEA reports dating back at least 20 years and you'll see the IAEA meticulously, methodically, dispassionately outlining all of the violations that Iran has embarked on of the NPT.\nVirtually all those are resolved later.\nThey won't answer this and then later they do.\nThey won't answer that and then later they do.\nAnd many open files are still there.\nI mean, just again like I just I just want your viewers to walk away from this conversation thing, okay, that's interesting.\nI I I didn't know that.\nAnd that I'm gonna go fact check Mark and fact check Scott and just kind of see what this is all about, right?\nBecause otherwise it's just he says, she says, or he says, he says.\nUm the fact of the matter is is that Iran has been in violations of its obligations under the NPT under the additional protocol.\nIt never it never uh it never ratified under its safeguards obligations under the NPT.\nIt suggests a pattern of nuclear macity.\nThey abided by the additional protocol without having ratified it.\nThey abided about it for three years and did not proceed with any enrichment at all as long as they were dealing in good faith with the EU until W. Bush ruined those negotiations and closed them down.\nOnly then did they began to install the centrifuges at Natanz.\nIt's always the American screw things up.\nComplain they didn't ratify the thing but they abided by it for years.\nSo that's an interesting they were in violation of it.\nBut I I think a more pragmatic and important disagreement that we already spoke to is how do we decrease the incentive for Iran to build nuclear programs not just in the next couple years but in the next 10, 20 years.\nWhat that's you're mocking that there's a lot of people that will there's neocons that say basically invade everything let's make money off of war but there's people that will say that you know operation midnight hammer is actually a focused hard demonstration of strength a piece of strength that is an effective way to do geopolitics I mean there's cases to be made for all of it if we're really lucky.\nYeah so it's a big risk is your case.\nSo here's some practical recommendations that I think the United States should follow.\nI think the first is, you know, get the Iranians back to Oman, negotiate with them, and do a deal.\nAgain, the deal has to be no enrichment, full dismantlement.\nI I I think for the reasons we talked about today, Scott and I passionately disagree, but that's fine.\nWe This is This is a reasonable debate.\nNeither of us is crazy.\nNeither of us is rational.\nIt is what would it take to get a deal with Iran?\nI say I say this is the deal.\nThis has to be our red line.\nScott disagrees.\nThat's fine.\nBut we got to get a deal.\nIn that deal, we got to provide them financial incentives, right?\nWe're going to have to lift a certain number of sanctions because they're going to have to get something in return.\nOkay, we can argue about exactly how much, but I think our opening negotiating position is no sanctions relief and then we'll get negotiated down from that.\nRight?\nI mean, like I think a lot of this is about how do you position yourself for a negotiation?\nHow do you how do you come in with leverage and then how do you find areas of compromise where you you satisfy your objectives?\nOne is Oman.\nTwo is the credible threat of military force needs to remain right needs to understand that the United States of America and Israel will use military force to stop him from developing nuclear weapons.\nIf he didn't believe that before 12 days ago, he now believes that and I think that's the credibility of that military force has to be maintained in order to ensure that he does not break out or sneak out to a nuclear weapon.\nI I think that's absolutely critical.\nThird is I think we have to reach agreements with all the other countries in the Middle East to say, \"Hey, listen.\nWe're demanding zero enrichment and full dismantlement from the Iranians.\nYou don't get enrichment and you don't get a nuclear program that is capable of developing nuclear weapons.\nOur gold standard is the American standard.\nCivilian nuclear energy like 23 countries, no enrichment and reprocess.\nWe should be consistent.\nWe should be consistent not just with American allies but also very clear with American enemies.\nI think that's the third important thing we do.\nFourth is I think it's really important that we find some kind of accommodation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nWe can go down many rabbit holes on that, but I think that lays the predicate for a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal that then brings in multiple Arab countries and Muslim countries.\nAnd finally is we talked about the Abraham Accords.\nI I think we need to start thinking\n\n\nAbout.\nWhat did the Cyrus Accords look like, right?\nCyrus was the great Persian king, right?\nWho, by the way, brought the, you know, the Jews back from, um, from, uh, the diaspora to Jerusalem, and Cyrus Accords would be, let's find an agreement between the United States and Israel and Iran.\nThat would be a remarkable transformation in the region if we could actually do that.\nSo imagine a Middle East, and again, I know this sounds fanciful, but I think this is what Trump has in mind when he starts to talk about the things you're seeing in these truth posts, is actually a Middle East that can be fundamentally transformed where we actually do bring peace between Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of these countries.\nI, by the way, completely agree with you on Syria.\nThe idea that we are trusting a former al-Qaeda ISIS jihadist, uh, to rule Syria, I think is a big bet President Trump has made.\nHe's made it on the advice of NBS.\nWe'll see how that transforms, uh, or transpires and see if Syria is transformed.\nBut the notion that somehow we should just be rolling the dice, lifting all the sanctions, and taking this former al-Qaeda jihadist at his word is, uh, a big bet.\nIf we got the bet right, that is actually a remarkable occurrence because now all of a sudden Syria and Lebanon are brought into this Abraham Accord, Cyrus Accords structure, and then we actually have what I think all three of us want is peace in the Middle East, stability in the Middle East.\nI don't think we need democracy in the Middle East.\nI think if the Middle East looked like the UAE, that'd be a pretty good Middle East.\nI think we'd all be pretty comfortable with that if that kind of stability and prosperity.\nAnd ultimately, you could put these countries on a pathway to greater democracy the way that we did during the Cold War where countries like Taiwan and South Korea that were military dictatorships ended up becoming pro-western democracy.\nSo, that's kind of stepping back maybe a little bit polyianish.\nUm, but I think we should also always keep in mind what a potential vision for peace could look like.\n\nSo, Scott, as many people know here in Austin, Texas, you're the director of the Libertarian Institute.\nUm, let's zoom out a bit.\nWhat are the key pillars of libertarianism and how that informs how you see the world?\nWell, the very basis of libertarianism is the non-aggression principle, but, uh, which essentially is the same thing as our social rules for dealing with each other in private life.\nNo force, no theft, no fraud, and keep your hands to yourself.\nAnd we apply that same moral law to government.\nAnd so, you know, some libertarians are anarcho-capitalists, some are, uh, so-called minarchists, meaning we want the absolute minimum amount of government, a night watchman type state.\nUh, in other words, just enough to enforce contracts and protect property rights and allow freedom in a free market to work.\nThere's also, of course, natural rights theory, Austrian school economics, and a lot of revisionist history.\nUm, and, uh, and it something very, uh, key to, uh, libertarian theory was is expressed by Muran Rothbart was that war is the key to the whole libertarian business because especially in the United States of America as long as we maintain a world empire makes it impossible for us to have a limited and decentralized government here at home as our constitution describes.\nAnd so I was going to crack a joke, but neither of you have called me an isolationist yet, but I was going to joke.\nYes.\nAs, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Isolation, um, that the same guy, the principal author of the Declaration of isolation, he said in his first inaugural address, &quot;We seek peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations and entangling alliances with none.&quot;\nThat's the true libertarian philosophy.\nThink Dr. Ron Paul, the great congressman, uh, for many years up there.\nHe was opposed to all sanctions, all economic war on the rest of the world and the entire state of the United States as world empire.\nAnd what's strange now is that anyone who wants just peace as the standard is considered an isolationist.\nAnd people who are for world empire and a permanent state of conflict with the rest of the world, economic war, coups and regime changes and even invasions, those are considered normal people.\nIt's almost like people who want peace should be called cis foreign policy because now we gota, we have to come up with a funny word to describe a normal state of being when no one calls Mexico an isolationist state.\nIt's cuz they mind their own business.\nAnd is there any faction anywhere in America that calls themselves isolationist?\nEven the paleoconservatives who favor much more like trade protectionism and that kind of thing than libertarians, they don't call themselves isolationists.\nThey still want to have an open relationship with the world to some degree when isolation means like the hermit kingdom of North Korea or some crazy thing like that.\nNo one wants that for the United States of America.\nWhat we want is independence, non-interventionism and peace.\n\nSo to you isolationism is a kind of dirty word term invented by interventionists and internationalists to attack anyone who didn't want to go along with their agenda.\nThe term itself is used essentially as a smear against anyone who doesn't want to go to war.\n\nSo can you actually just deeper describe what non-interventionism means?\nSo how much sort of display of military strength should be there do you think?\nDr. Paul said we could defend this country with a couple of good submarines, which by the way, for people who don't know, one American Trident sub could essentially kill every city and military base in Russia.\nJust one.\nSo he's absolutely right about that.\nCouple of good submarines are enough to defend our coast and deter anyone from messing with the United States of America.\nAnd then I admit I'm a little bit idealistic about this that I think of that old William Jennings Brian speech, behold a republic where unlike the empires of Europe burdened under the weight of militarism, here we have a free country and where you know what we could do?\nWe could be the host of peace conferences everywhere.\nThere are frozen conflicts in the conflicts in the Donbass, in Kinenrad, in Transnistria, in Taiwan, in Korea.\nUm, virtually all the borders of Africa and Eurasia were drawn by European powers to either divide and conquer their enemies or artificially group their enemies together in order to keep them internally divided and conquered in those ways.\nThere are great many borders in the world that are in contention and that people might even want to fight about.\nAnd I think that America could play a wonderful role in helping to negotiate and resolve those types of conflicts without resorting to force or or even making any promises on the part of the US government like we'll pay Egypt to pretend to be nice to Israel or anything like that.\nBut just find ways to host conferences and and find resolutions to these problems.\nAnd I think quite sincerely that Donald Trump right now could get on a plane to Tyrron.\nHe could then go to Moscow to Beijing and Pyongyang and he could come home and be Trump the Great.\nWe in fact don't have to have the especially the American hyper power as the French called it the world empire.\nWe have everything to give and nothing to lose to go ahead.\nAnd Donald Trump even talked like this.\nYou might remember when he first was sworn in this time.\nHe said, &quot;You know what?\nInstead of pivoting from terrorism to great power competition with Russia and China.\nI don't want to do that.\nI just want to get along with both of them.\nLet's just move on and have the rest of the century be peace and prosperity and not fighting at all.\nWhy should we have to pivot to China?\nLet's just pivot to capitalism and trade and freedom and peace.\nThat's America first.\nYeah, I've, uh, I've criticized Trump a lot, but I think maybe he's just rhetoric, but I think he talks about peace a lot.\nEven just recently the, the number of times the word peace is mentioned and with seriousness, not, you get like a genuine desire for peace from him and that's just beautiful to see for the leader of of this country.\n\nAnd look, man, there used to be a time when a third of the planet was dominated by the communists, right?\nSo like, I'm not going to sit here and argue the first cold war with you, my book's about the second one and I'm not as good on the first, but since the end of the first cold war, we have let the neoconservative policy of the defense planning guidance of 92 and rebuilding America's defenses and the rest of this American, uh, dominance centered policy, uh, control our entire direction in the world.\nIt's led to the War on Terror in the Middle East.\nSeven countries we've attacked.\nIt's led to the disaster in Eastern Europe and it's leading toward disaster in Eastern Asia when there's just no reason in the world that it has to be this way with the commies dead and gone.\nAnd again, I to stipulate here, the Chinese flag is still red.\nIt's still a one-party dictatorship, but they have abandoned Marxism.\nI mean, people were starving to death by the tens of millions there.\nIt's a huge, it's a probably the greatest improvement in the condition of mankind anywhere ever in the shortest amount of time when Deng Xiaoping and the right-wing of the Communist Party took over in that country.\n\nJust one more thing.\nYou mentioned the two submarines.\nWhat's the role of nuclear weapons?\nWell, I would like for America to have an extremely minimal nuclear deterrent and work toward a world free of nuclear weapons.\nAnd I know that that sounds utopian.\nHowever, I would remind your audience that Ronald Reagan and Mikall Gorbachev came within a hair of achieving a deal just like that at Reichovic, Iceland in 1986.\nAnd they were both of them dead serious about it, complete and total nuclear disarmament.\nAnd then Reagan was essentially bullied by Richard Pearl and others on his staff saying, &quot;You promised the American people that you would build them a defensive anti-missile system, the Star Wars system,&quot; which was total pie in the sky technological fantasy of the 1980s.\nAnd if you're getting rid of all the ICBMs, then why the hell do you need a missile shield anyway?\nIt is the world's probably greatest tragedy that ever took place that Ronald Reagan walked away from those negotiations.\nThey literally were within a hair.\nAnd it wasn't magic and there was no trust in evil bad guys.\nThis is by the way two years before the wall came down.\nThis is when everybody still thought the USSR was going to last.\nAnd Reagan had the plan was that America and the Soviet Union would dismantle our nuclear weapons until we were right around with parody with the other nuclear weapon states who all have right around two or 300 nukes.\nFrance, Britain at that time, Israel and China.\nIndia and Pakistan came later.\nSouth Africa only had a few then that but gave up whatever they had.\nAnd the idea was we would get down to two or 300 and then America and the Soviet Union both together would lean hard on Britain, France, and China.\nLet's all get down to 100.\nLet's all see if we can get down to 50, etc.\nLike that in stages.\nAgain, Ronald Reagan we're talking about here.\nTrust but verify means do not trust at all.\nIt means be polite while you verify.\nAnd in fact, America did help dismantle upwards of 60s something thousand Soviet nuclear missiles in the after the end of the cold war.\nAnd so it is possible to live in a world where at the very least we have a situation where the major powers have a few nukes and potentially can even come to an arrangement to get rid of the rest.\nWe should also just say one more thing, not to be agist, but most of the major leaders with nukes and those with power in the world are in their 70s and 80s.\nI don't know if that contributes to it, but they kind of are grounded at a different time that maybe I have a hope for the fresher, younger leaders to have a more optimistic view towards peace and to be able to reach towards peace.\nAnd underlying so much of what we're talking about here is all this enmity, right?\nBut if America could just work, remember when China cut that pseudo sort of peace deal between Saudi and Iran a couple years ago or last year was it?\nWell, we could try to double up on that.\nWe should, we could try to come up with ways for Saudi and Iran to exchange as much as possible.\nYou know, um, I know you don't like all the going back too far in history, but it's important.\nIt's in my book that in 1993 Zabign Brazinski, who the revolution had happened on his watch.\nOperation Eagleclaw, the disaster of the rescue mission in 79 after the hostage crisis and everything.\nAll that egg was on ZB space.\nBut in 93 he said we should normalize relations.\nWe should build an oil pipeline across Iran so they can make money.\nWe can make money and we can start to normalize.\nAnd Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State, Alexander Heg, who had been Kissinger's right-hand man, agreed.\nThey both were trying to push that.\nBut the Clinton administration went ahead with Martin Indic, who had been Yeetsak Shamir's man, and inaugurated the dual containment policy instead because the Israelis were concerned that America had just beaten up on Iraq so bad in Iraq War I now wasn't powerful enough to balance against Iran.\nSo, America had to stay in Saudi to balance against them both.\nAnd that was the origin of the dual containment policy.\nIt was Martin Indic, who had been Yets Shamir's man who pushed it on Clinton.\nAnd this was not the Israelis.\nIt was the Kuwaitis who lied that there was a truck bomb attempt assassination against HW Bush, which was a total hoax.\nIt was debunked by Seymour Hirs by the end of the year.\nIt was just a whiskey smuggling ring.\nAnd it was the same guy whose daughter had claimed to have seen the Iraqi soldiers throw the babies out of the incubators.\nHe was the guy who two years later, uh, made up this hoax about Saddam Hussein trying to murder Bush Senior.\nBut when he did, that was when Bill Clinton finally gave in and adopted the dual containment policy because he had been interested in potentially reaching out to Saddam and the Ayatollah both at that time.\nBut instead of having normalization with both, we had to have permanent cold war through the end of the century with both.\nAnd my argument is simply it just didn't have to be that way.\nIs the same thing with Russia.\nLook at, you know, how determined the Democrats especially are to have this conflict with Russia where to Donald Trump, nah, not at all.\nWe could get along with them.\nAnd so it's perfectly within reason.\nIf Zabnzinski says we can talk with Iran and get along with Iran and Donald Trump says we can get along with Russia, then the same thing for North Korea.\nThe same thing for China.\nAnd then and then who do we have left to fight?\nHzbala is nothing without Iran.\n\n\nWe'll just have Scott and I fighting.\nThat'll be the last remaining fight.\nThat's the fun kind of fight.\nThat'll be fun.\nFight peaceful.\nYou're the CEO of FDD, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nIt's a DC-based organization that focuses on national security and foreign policy.\nWhat has been your approach to solving some of these problems of the world?\nSo, look, I I love the vision that Scott painted.\nUm, and I I agree with some of the libertarian instincts that he has, but my view is that America is the indispensable power.\nUm, Scott mentioned earlier in the conversation about the rules-based order that is so important and the NPT and all these rules-based agreements that are important to maintain.\nWell, the rules-based order has been maintained by the United States since World War II, right?\nThere is no American prosperity to the degree that we have.\nThere's no recovery of Europe.\nThere's no recovery of Asia after the devastation of World War II without American power and the rules-based order that America has led and backstopped.\nAnd I think America first is about American power and deterrence.\nI think if you want to avoid war, I think you cannot just believe in some fantasy where all the world's leaders are going to get together in some place and are just going to agree to disarm all their nuclear weapons and we'll disarm our entire military and we'll have one submarine off our coast and some all of that is going to lead to peace.\nI mean, I think what has led to peace in the past has been the American forward deterrence of our military and a belief that our enemies think we will credibly use it.\nI think if they believe we'll credibly use it, then it's less likely they will challenge us.\nAnd if they less likely to challenge us and challenge our allies, there's less likely to be war.\nSo for me, deterrence leads to peace and any kind of unilateral disarmament, any kind of I think sort of fanciful notion that somehow they're our enemies are going to respect the non-aggression principle that is the core fundamental underpinnings of libertarianism, which I think in in in a personal relationship, I think is very important.\nBut remember, these are aggressors.\nThey don't respect the non-aggression principle.\nI think we can spend a lot of time, we did over how many hours now has it been talking about the fact that in Scott's view of the world, it's America that provokes.\nIt's America that provokes.\nAnd then it's not America provoking, it's Israel provoking.\nAnd oh, by the way, America provokes because we're being seduced or paid or browbeaten by those those Israelis and you know, those Jews in America.\nI mean I think that whole notion that somehow we are we are the provocative force in global politics I think is is wrong.\nI think the fact of the matter is we make mistakes.\nWe are an imperfect nation.\nWe have made some serious sometimes catastrophic mistakes but the there is a bad world out there.\nThere are evil men who want to do us harm and we have to prevent away prevent them from doing us harm.\nTo do that, we need an American military that is serious and well supported.\nWe don't need a military-industrial complex that ultimately is going to pull us into wars.\nWe need thoughtful leaders like President Trump who will resist that and will say at the end of the day, I will use force when it is selective, narrow, overwhelming, and deadly.\nAnd that was Trump's operation just a few days ago.\nHe he went after three key facilities that were being used to develop the capability for nuclear weapons.\nNuclear weapons are the greatest danger to humanity.\nI totally agree with Scott.\nLike I think a world without nuclear weapons, the kind of world that that Reagan envisioned and others have envisioned since is really the only way we can eliminate the most devastating weapons that could end humankind.\nBut we have to make sure that those weapons don't end up in the hands of regimes that seek to do us harm and that have have done us harm over over many many decades.\nSo yeah, I mean deterrence, peace through strength, rules-based order, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies is not the foundation for promotion of democracy.\nWe don't believe in this important concept that we have to promote democracy around the world.\nI'll speak for myself because we have many people in my think tank.\nWe're 105 people.\nWe have different views.\nI don't personally believe that it is the role of the United States to bring democracy to the Middle East or democracy around the world.\nI think to the extent we've tried, we failed.\nI'm not sure the Middle East is ready for democracy.\nNow, Iran is interesting because it's not an Arab country, right?\nIt is a it is a different country altogether.\nCulturally, it's a very sophisticated country.\nIt has a long history.\nIt actually has a history where it has had democracy in the past.\nIt is a country that I think could have incredible potential under the right leadership and under the right circumstances.\nI don't know if the right circumstances are a constitutional monarchy with Reza Palavi as the as the as the crown prince or the sha.\nI don't know whether it's a secular democracy or not.\nLet let let Iranians make that decision.\nHave I been pronouncing it wrong this whole time?\nResp.\nYou know the guy?\nI met him.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nPalavi.\nPali.\nWhat were you saying?\nI thought it was Palavi.\nOh wow.\nNo, it's okay.\nOkay.\nIt's okay.\nThe only thing you've ever gotten wrong is you're pronouncing a problem.\nThat's not bad.\nI've been pronouncing so many things correctly.\nI think people will give you a pass.\nCan I ask you though?\nLike I I mean all this militarization has led to a state of permanent war.\nWe've been bombing Iraq for 34 years.\nWe uh launched we put uh a war against the Taliban who didn't attack us instead of al-Qaeda who did.\nfought for 20 years and the Taliban won anyway.\nWe overthrew a launch an aggressive war against Saddam Hussein, put the Ayatollah's best friends in power.\nWe launched an aggressive war against Libya and this ridiculous hoax that Gaddafi was about to murder every last man, woman, and child in Benghazi.\nImagine Charlotte, North Carolina being wiped off the map.\nBarack Obama lied in order to start that war and completely destroyed Libya.\nIt's now three pieces in a state of semi-permanent civil war, including, and this wasn't just back then.\nThis is to this day the relegalization and reinstitutionalization of chatt slavery of subsaharan black Africans in Libya to this day as a result the our intervention this was not a direct overt war but America Israel Saudiq and Turkey all back the bin Laden in Syria completely destroyed Syria to the point where the caliphate grew up and then we had to launch Iraq war II to destroy the caliphate again and so I'm I'm not seeing the peace through strength I'm seeing permanent militarism and perman permanent war through strength.\nPoint well made.\nHe's speaking to the the double-edged sword of a strong military.\nThat what you mentioned that Trump did seems like a very difficult thing to do, which is keep it hit hard and keep it short.\nWe don't know how this ended yet, but even the beginning part is not trivial to do like just hitting one mission and vocalizing except for one post.\nuh no regime change, like really pushing peace, make a deal, ceasefire, like that's that's an uncommon way to operate.\nSo, I guess you said that we should resist the military-industrial complex.\nThat's not easy to do.\nThat that that's the double-edged sword of a strong military.\nYemen, let me say real quick, and I promise I'll say one thing and then I'll stop.\nYou made a good point.\nLet me I just I just want to add this is a really important point, okay?\nIs grassroots effort.\nThere is no Houthi lobby in America, okay?\nIt was grassroots efforts by libertarians, Quakers, and leftists to get war powers resolutions introduced in Trump's first term to stop the war in Yemen, which was launched not for Israel, for Saudi Arabia and UAE by Barack Obama in 2015.\nThat's not a first.\nThe Afghan war wasn't about Israel either.\nOkay.\nBut this Yemen war was\nI thought 911 was about Israel.\nWell, it was in great part, but the af the decision to sack Kbble and do a regime change and all that had nothing to do with the loot whatsoever other than well, we got to keep the war going long enough to go to Baghdad.\nOh, okay.\nSo, it was Israel's fault.\nI was in the middle of saying about the war in Yemen that we got the war powers resolution through twice and Trump vetoed it twice and his man Pete Navaro explained to the New York Times that this was just welfare for American industry.\nA lot of industrialists were angry about the tariffs disrupting trade with China and somehow they substituted Rathon for all American industry somehow and said industry will be happy if we funnel a lot of money to Rathon.\nThat's Pete Navaro talking to the New York Times about why they continued the war in Yemen throughout Trump's entire first term.\nHe had no interest in it at all.\nThe whole thing was it was Obama's fault.\nThe whole thing was essentially on autopilot.\nAnd what was he doing?\nflying as al-Qaeda's air force against the Houthis who originally, if you go back to January of 2015, America was passing intelligence to the Houthis to use to kill al Qaeda.\nYou know, AQAP, the guys that tried to blow up the plane over Detroit with the underpants bomb on Christmas Day 2009 that did all those horrific massacres in Europe, real ass bin Laden terrorists.\nThe Houthis were our allies against them before Barack Obama stabbed them in the back.\nAnd why did Trump keep that going when he inherited that horrific war from Barack Obama?\nWhy'd he do it?\naccording to his trade guy, so that they could keep funneling American taxed and inflated dollars into the pocketbooks of stockholders of Rathon Incorporated, right?\nMilitary industrial complex.\nThe point was made.\nYeah, maybe I could respond to that because I mean again, it's always America's fault.\nAccording to Scott,\nhe's taking jab at.\nNo, no, but Saudi and UAE asked Barack Obama for permission to start that war and for American help in prosecuting it and he said yes and then helped.\nI'm going to segue into an answer cuz I I think it deserves an answer.\nmilitary-industrial complex is a serious concern.\nUm because I think you're right, it there, you know, the bigger it gets um and the more weapons you have, you think the more the greater the temptation to use it, right?\nI think that's sort of the the argument.\nAnd then there's also self-enrichment and how much money can be made and and all of that I think is of serious concern to people.\nLook, I think Trump is somebody who it's hard pressed to say that Donald Trump um is a great advocate of the military-industrial complex or that he is he is in their pocket the same way that he's in the pocket of the Israelis and in the pocket of the Saudis and in the pocket of everybody.\nI mean, I think the one thing with Trump is that Trump has he has learned the lessons of American engagement over the past few decades.\nAnd I think Scott's done a good job of kind of laying out the mistakes that have been made even though, you know, we can discuss about causal connections and who's responsible.\nAnd, you know, I I lean on\nCan we I want to\nWell, Scott, can I finish because you know, your your causal connection is always it's America aggressing, Israel aggressing, and all these poor people responding to us.\nUm, but nonetheless, I think Trump has he's learned the lessons, but he hasn't overlearned the lessons.\nHe he's not paralyzed by Iraq or Afghanistan or the mistakes made by his predecessors.\nHe understands that at the end of the day, we need serious American power.\nWe need lethal power.\nWe need foreign deterrence.\nAnd he's been very careful and very selective about how he uses American power.\nI mean, we've talked about it throughout this whole conversation.\nTrump used American power to kill Kasumsmani, one of the world's most dangerous terrorists.\nHe killed Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, one of the world's most dangerous terrorists.\nHe he refrained from going after the Iranian takedown of our drone.\nHe refrained from when the Iranians fired on Saudi Aramco and took off 20% of our oil.\nRight.\nHe's been very very selective about the use of American power.\nHe did go after the Houthies who are Iranbacked and were using Iranian missiles to go after our ships.\nThat's not true.\nThose are North Korean missiles.\nCompletely debunked by Jane's Defense Weekly.\nNice try.\nYeah, nice try.\nUm anyway, everybody knows that the Iranians have been financing the Houthis.\nHisbal has been training the Houthis.\nAnd Iran has given capabilities to the Houthis to develop their own indigenous missile capability.\nThe fact of the matter is he he did in a way go after the Houthis much more intensively than Biden did in order to prevent them from continuing to shut down Red Sea shipping on which both America and our allies depend as a trade route.\nHe actually did it quite successfully because after a few days of pretty intensive bombing, the Houthis got the message and they cut a deal with Donald Trump.\nThey're not going to interfere with our ships anymore.\nHe cut a deal with them.\nThey kept bombing Israel, which is what got him involved in the first place, he completely backed out.\nSounds to me like they won and he backed down.\nWell, it sounds it sounds like he in terms of promoting American national security interests.\nSounds like he did he did a pretty good job of sending a message to the Houthies and the Iranians.\nDon't we mess with the United States?\nAnd that gets us to the contemporary reality.\nHe took a decision one day on one day to send our B2s and our subs in order to do severe damage to three nuclear facilities.\nIt was a one-day campaign.\nIt was selective.\nIt was narrow.\nIt was overwhelming.\nAnd I think it sends a message to Kam.\nI think it sends a message to regimes around the world, anti-American regimes around the world, that Donald Trump has not overlearned the lessons of the past 20 years, right?\nbut that in fact he is not going to dismantle the US military and dismantle our nuclear program and fly around to all these cities and call peace conferences and hope that these dictators will just sit down with America and say you know what all is forgiven the United States of America it's all your fault you did this all we we admit our responsibility and then we have we have peace and paradise on earth I think Trump is much more um pragmatic and in some respects cynical when he looks at the world and he realizes the world is a dangerous place.\nI have to be very careful about how I use American military forces.\nI am not going to send hundreds of thousands of\n\n\nPeople around the world.\nBy the way, I mean you all talk about Israel.\nI mean the Israelis are one of the best allies we could possibly have.\nThey fight and they die in their own defense.\nThey fought multiple wars against American enemies.\nThey haven't asked for American troops on the ground.\nThere no boots on the ground in Israel defending Israel.\nThe best we've given them is we've given them a THAAD system to help them shoot down ballistic missiles that have aimed at them.\nAnd our American pilots have been in the air recently with our Israeli friends shooting down ballistic missiles.\nBut the Israelis have had a warrior ethos.\nWe will fight and we will die in our own defense.\nI would just say if you're going to actually build out a model where you're going to minimize the risk to American troops, let's find more allies like that.\nRight?\nI worry about, I'm like Scott.\nI really worry about China, Taiwan.\nI really really worry about that because the Taiwanese are not capable of defending themselves without U.S. assistance and we may have to send American men and women to go defend Taiwan and we can have a whole debate about the wisdom of that.\nBut again, it would be very very helpful to have more Israels in the world, more countries that are capable of fighting against common enemies and against common threats without having to always put American boots on the ground in order to do that.\n\nSo you made a case for it's okay if you made a case for strength here.\nJust practically speaking, why do you think Trump has talked about peace a lot?\nWhy do you think he hasn't been able to uh get to a ceasefire with Ukraine and Russia, for example, if he just move away from Iran without getting into the history of the whole thing?\nLike why?\nHe's been talking peace, peace, peace, peace, peace.\nHe's been pushing it and pushing it.\nWhat can we learn about that so far?\nFailure that's also instructive for Iran.\n\nLook, I'm not a Russia expert.\nI'm not a Ukraine expert.\nI'm sitting in front of two people who know a lot more about that conflict than I do.\nI, I...\nYou are, we should say, banned by Putin.\nI am, I have been sanctioned by Russia and by Iran.\nUm, sanctioned.\nYes.\nYes.\nBanned.\nSanctioned, uh, threat.\nCongratulations.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nWell, it's it causes some difficulties.\nBut anyway, um, I think the answer to that is that for Putin, he needs to understand that like Kame, he has two options here, right?\nOption one, which President Trump has signaled over and over and over again, is come sit down and negotiate a ceasefire with the Ukrainians.\nI don't want to get into the details and the back and forth about who's responsible for the fact there's no ceasefire, Putin or Zelensky.\nI mean, that's a whole other debate, and I'm sure you guys have a lot of opinions on that.\nUm, but path one is sit down and let's negotiate a ceasefire.\nPath two is the United States will use American power in order to build our leverage so that Vladimir Putin understands that he has to do a ceasefire.\nNow, I'm not suggesting U.S. troops.\nAbsolutely not.\nRight.\nWhat I am suggesting is there's a package right now of sanctions that have 88 co-sponsors in the Senate across party lines.\nAnd I think Trump is using that and will use that as a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over Putin and the Russian economy to say, \"Look, if Vladimir, we either do a ceasefire or I'm going to have no choice but to have to start imposing much more punishing sanctions on you and on the Russian economy.\"\nSo, I think there's an economic option.\nI think there's a military option.\nI think the biggest mistake Biden made in this whole war and there's many mistakes uh in terms of signaling not having U.S. credibility, you know, Afghan debacle which signal to Putin that he could invade without any kind of American response is he kind of went in and he tied Ukraine's uh hands behind their back.\nI mean, he actually tied one hand behind their back while they were fighting with the other hand.\nAnd he refused to give him the kinds of systems that early on in the war would have allowed the Ukrainian military to be able to hit Russian forces that were mobilizing on the Russian Ukrainian border.\nAnd I think if he had done that, I think this war would have ended sooner.\nThere'd be far less casualties.\nAnd I think Putin would then understand maybe I need to strike a deal.\nI'm not a Russia expert or a Ukraine expert.\nI don't know what the deal looks like.\nYou keep the Donbass, you keep Crimea, you keep, you know, larger chunks of eastern Ukraine.\nThat's for smarter people than me on this issue to decide what the deal looks like.\nBut there's no doubt today Putin thinks that he can just keep fighting, keep killing Ukrainians, keep driving forward.\nEventually, he's going to wear down the Ukrainians through a sheer war of attrition.\nHe'll throw hundreds of thousands of Russians at this.\nHe doesn't care how many Russians are going to die.\nThat's the way the Russians and the Soviets have fought wars for many, many years.\nJust endless number of Russian bodies being thrown into the meat rider and he thinks he can continue without any consequences.\nAnd I worry that as a result of the fact that we are not showing Putin that we've got leverage, it's made war more likely.\nIt's made a war more brutal and it's going to make a war more protracted.\nBut increasing military aid to Ukraine in the case that you've described also has to be coupled with extreme pressure to make peace.\nCorrect.\nExtreme pressure to make peace, which Trump hopefully is appears to be doing now in Iran.\nI think Trump is early.\nI mean, it's interesting you said that because he's early indicators again.\nWho knows where the ceasefire goes, but I think it was important.\nIt was he he slapped Kame, but he also said to BB, \"Enough, enough.\"\nAnd it's like, \"Okay, now we're going back to Oman.\nThere's going to be a temporary ceasefire.\nNow, let's negotiate.\"\nAnd I think that's important.\nAnd I think it shows that Donald Trump is leading, not following.\nIt shows that Donald Trump is his own man, not on the payroll of the Russians or the Iranians or the Israelis or all these other crazy accusations that have been made about this guy for many, many years.\nUm, and he's going to give, you know, as they say, peace a chance.\nAnd he's going to give give a ceasefire a chance and he's going to give negotiations a chance.\nBut I'll think he's sending the message to the Iranians and he needs to send it to Putin is if you don't take me up on my offer, right?\nI've already demonstrated that I am serious and I will use American power carefully and selectively in the way that I've done in the past.\nAt the risk of doing the thing I shouldn't do.\nUh but just to test the ideas of libertarianism and uh the things we've been talking about, can we for a brief time unrelated to everything we've been talking about talk about World War II?\nWhat was the right thing to do in 1938, 1939?\nLike what would you do?\nOkay, to be clear, World War II has nothing to do with the current events.\nIn fact, many of the horrible policies of the United States, in my opinion, have to have to do with projecting World War II onto every single conflict in the world.\nOkay, agree.\nBut overarning, overarning, overarning.\nBut it is an interesting extreme case.\nJust to clarify, I'm just like philosophically talking about.\nYeah.\nAt which point do you hit do you do military intervention?\nAnd that's a nice case.\nMaybe you have a better case study, but that's such an extreme one.\nYeah.\nThat it's interesting.\nWe're talking about Germany or Japan.\nGermany said.\nYeah.\nSo, Japan attacked us and Germany declared war on us.\nTough for them.\nAnd that's what happens when you declare war on the United States, you get hit.\nBut that was idiotic on the part of Hitler to declare war on the United States.\nYou know, I never understood why he ever did that.\nThey always said it was just cuz he was crazy.\nBut what it was is he was trying to get the Japanese to invade the Soviet Union from the east and in order to divide Stalin's forces, which failed and it didn't work and it was a huge blunder from his point of view.\nI guess philosophically from an interventionalism perspective, you're saying United States should have stayed out from that war as long as possible until they're attacked.\nYes.\nI mean, and look at how powerful they ended up being and the amount of damage that they were able to inflict on the Soviets.\nBetter them than us.\nWhat do you think?\nSo, look, I...\nIs this a useful discussion?\nIt's interesting.\nI mean I think it's interesting of you know libertarianism um or or isolationism in practice.\nI mean I think the 30s are more interesting to me than what happened between 39 and 45.\nI think the debate in America was very interesting in the 30s um where there was really a strong uh isolationist movement um you know with Charles Lindberg and and Henry Ford and Father Coughlin and many Joe Kennedy.\nYeah.\nJoe Kennedy.\nI mean, they defined themselves as sort of America firsters.\nUm, but it was very much an isolationist strain.\nAnd I think, you know, we can talk about that history.\nAnd Coughlin was a New Dealer, not a right-winger.\nAnyway, um, very much an isolationist talking about America having to stay out these entangling alliances.\nThis is not our war.\nEmotionally understandable, right?\nBecause you can you can also overlearn the lessons of World War I, right?\nAnd I think they overlearned the lessons of World War I.\nI mean, which was a brutal war and a devastating war mostly for Europe, but obviously for the United States.\nWe we lost thousands of American men and women.\nSo the 30s was this big debate between the um those who saw the gathering storm of what was happening uh with Nazi Germany and those who wanted to keep America out.\nAnd I think in some respects it's like today with the contemporary reality with Kame is that because these isolationist voices were so prominent and so vocal um and in some cases quite persuasive to American leaders, Hitler calculated that the United States would not enter the war.\nAnd so he could do what Scott says.\nHe could focus on the Eastern Front.\nUm he could gather his forces and then he could do a kill shot on the Western democracies in Western Europe and the United States would not intervene.\nI mean, you're right, the the big mistake he makes is declaring war in the United States after Pearl Harbor.\nBut he believes all through the 30s and before Pearl Harbor that the isolationist voices are keeping FDR from entering the war.\nEven while Churchill and the Brits and the French and others are imploring the Americans uh not only to just just to provide provide them with material support with weapons so that they could hold hold on to the island and and defend themselves and I think Hitler miscalculates in the same way I think Kame miscalculates.\nKame heard the debate over the past number of years.\nHe believed that this sort of isolationist wing of the Republican party right represented I think in you know by Tucker Carlson and others who have been very anti-intervention with respect to Iran.\nI think he believed that that was the dominant voice within Trump's MAGA coalition and that as a result the United States would not use military force.\nSo in the same way that Hitler miscalculated the influence of the isolationists on FDR, Kame misjudged the influence of the isolationists on Trump and both ended up miscalculating to uh to their great regret.\nSo to me that's the sort of parallel between kind of World War II in the 30s and the prelude to World War II and what we're seeing in the in the current reality over the past few weeks.\nTo make clear, you mentioned there's a parallel, but mostly there's no parallel.\nIt's a fundamentally different.\nAbsolutely.\nThere will never be a war like that.\nAnd I have...\nIt's a real problem, too, because they always say everybody's Hitler.\nAll enemies are Hitler.\nAnd to compromise with them at all is to appease Hitler.\nAnd you can never do that.\nAgreed.\nAnd they do that to Manuel Noriega, to David Caresh, to Saddam Hussein, to whoever they feel like demonizing and saying, too crazy to negotiate with when, let's get real, and I think we're agreed about this probably that right in 2002, W. Bush could have just sent Colin Powell, the four-star general, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of State, to read the riot act to Saddam Hussein, and tell him, \"Look, man, you help keep al Qaeda down, and we'll let you live.\"\nAnd everything would have been fine.\nAnd and in fact, just like Saddam Hussein, and there's a great article by James Risen.\nDon't agree.\nHang on, hang on.\nNow, there's there's an article by Surprisingly, there's an article by James Risen in the New York Times, and there's another one by Seymour Hersh as well about how Saddam Hussein offered to give in on everything.\nHe said, \"You want us to search for weapons of mass destruction, you can send your army and FBI everywhere you want.\nYou want us to switch sides in the Iran-Israel conflict, we'll stop backing Hamas.\nYou want us to hold elections, we'll hold us, we'll hold elections.\nJust give us a couple years.\nIf this is about the oil, we'll sign over mineral rights.\"\nThis is James Risen, New York Times.\nThey sent an emissary to meet with Richard Pearl in London.\nThat was who was the chair of the Defense Policy Board and was a major ring leader of getting us into Iraq War II.\nAnd then they I don't know why this is a real mistake.\nYou want to talk about mistakes?\nWhy does he always send his guys to meet with Richard Burl?\nBecause the there was a Saudi businessman, pardon me, a Lebanese businessman I think that they tried to get to intervene as well who again offered virtually total capitulation and Pearl told him, \"Tell Saddam, we'll see you in Baghdad after he was attempting to essentially unconditionally surrender.\"\nThe same thing happened with Iran in 2003.\nRight after America invaded, they issued what was called the golden offer, which the Bush administration buried, and they castigated the Swiss ambassador who had delivered it.\nBut in the golden offer, and you can find the PDF file of it online, they talk about we're happy to negotiate with you our entire nuclear program, which didn't even really exist yet, but nuclearization\n\n\nWe're willing to negotiate with you about Afghanistan and Iraq because again, they hated Saddam Hussein and wanted rid of him, too.\nSo they're perfectly happy to work with us on Afghanistan and Iraq.\nAnd they had captured a bunch of Bin Laden and they were willing to trade them for the MEK.\nAnd that included one of Bin Laden's sons and another guy named Aff.\nIranians held under house arrest for years.\nAnd it was only in the, I think, late...\nand they're giving refuge to al-Qaeda.\nAnd the CIA said this is a key facilitation pipeline between Iran and al-Qaeda.\nWilling to negotiate between these dangerous Bin Laden and the MEK, and America refused to negotiate that, and it was years later when the Bin Laden abducted some Iranian diplomats in Pakistan that they then traded them away to get their diplomats back.\nAnd, I think, Bin Laden's son ended up being killed not long after that, Hamza, but and and too, but both of those dangerous terrorists were released and were involved in terrorism between then them then then and the time that they were later killed, I think, within a couple of years of that.\nSo the hawks always like to say, \"Oh yeah, Iran gives such aid and comfort to al-Qaeda and all that.\"\nThere's a great document at the counterterrorism center at West Point where they debunk all of that.\nYeah.\nThere's a 9/11 report by the 911 commission.\nThere's a 911 commission report, people can Google it, which talks about the cooperation between Iran and al-Qaeda only in Bosnia when they were doing a favor for Bill Clinton.\nBeyond that, and the CIA released um thousands of pages of classified material that they declassified showing the relationship between Iran and al-Qaeda.\nThe US Treasury Department under Obama and under Trump actually designated a number of Iranian uh individuals for facilitating al-Qaeda.\nSo anyway, I mean, these are important facts, but I, I actually...\nYou mentioned Baghdaddy and Solommani in the same breath a minute ago when they're deadly enemies, and it was Solommani's Shiite forces in Iraq War II that helped destroy the enemy of my enemy is my friend with America flying air power for them.\nThe greatest era that we've made in the Middle East is this notion, not the greatest, but one of the greatest is this sort of conceptual era that somehow Sunnis and Shi don't work together and Iran doesn't work with al-Qaeda.\nI'm not saying you say that, but but many people think that, and of course they do work.\nThey hate each other, but of course they work together because they hate us more.\nBut can I just say something, Lex?\nBecause I actually think just stepping back from like all of this detail...\nThe more we start to zoom out now, the better.\nYeah, I'd like to zoom out a little bit.\nI look, I think the lessons for me um over 22 years on working on these issues is one must learn about the mistakes that we've made in Iraq and in Afghanistan and Libya.\nOkay.\nOne must learn about the mistakes that we made in Vietnam, mistakes that we made in World War II, so we can make them all over again in Iran this time.\nCan I finish or go ahead?\nAre you good?\nYeah, I'm I'm ready.\nAll right.\nSo, um, I think that what what President Trump is trying to do is learn but not overlearn, right?\nI think he understands the mistakes that have been made.\nI think he's trying to rectify those mistakes, and he also understands that American power is important.\nIt is been a, it is a force for good in the world.\nEven though we have made major mistakes, I think there's a great danger amongst certain people to believe that no power should ever be exercised, that all American power is a bad thing and a destructive thing.\nAnd sometimes to confuse major tactical decisions, right, that have been made, whether it's been made by the Brits in World War II or the Americans or us or whoever it is in whatever war with the fact that there is a strategic reality that we always have to be conscious of and that we have enemies, right?\nThis is not the Garden of Eden yet.\nI hope the libertarians create one.\nI want to go live there when they do, and Scott and I will be neighbors, believe it or not, living living in that uh garden of Eden together.\nBut there are major threats in this world.\nAnd we need to find the right balance between the overuse of military power and the underuse of military power.\nIf we want to avoid wars, we have to have serious deterrence because our enemies need to understand we will use selective and narrowly focused overwhelming military power.\nWhen we are facing threats like an Iranian nuclear weapon, that is a serious threat.\nIt's a serious threat to us.\nIt's a serious threat to to to the region.\nIt's a serious threat with respect to proliferation around the world.\nAnd I think with that respect, I think President Trump's decision to drop bombs on three key nuclear facilities was a selective targeted military action that I hope will drive the Iranians back to the negotiating table where they can negotiate finally the dismantlement of their nuclear weapons program.\nRight.\nI think there's a nuclear weapons program.\nAgain, we've had a 4-hour debate on this, so I'm sure if you want to rewind, you can listen to all our arguments once again.\nUm, but the fact of the matter is is that the our unwillingness to use power, if we're never going to use power, all that's going to do is send a signal to our enemies that they can do whatever they want.\nThey can violate whatever agreements they want.\nThey can they can use aggression against anyone they want.\nAnd I think that makes that puts American lives in danger.\nAnd we've seen the results of that where we we delayed and delayed and delayed and we didn't move and we didn't move too early and we didn't preempt and the and the threat grew and we ignored the gathering storm.\nAnd so I think the lessons of you know hundred years of American military involvement is if you have an opportunity early on as the storm is gathering to use all instruments of American power with the military one being the last one you use, then deter when you can and strike when you must in order to prevent the kinds of escalation and wars that everybody at this table and I'm sure everybody listening in your audience is is seeking to avoid.\nOn that topic.\nQuestion for both of you, Scott.\nIf human civilization destroys itself in the next 75 years, it probably most likely will be a World War II type of scenario, maybe a nuclear war.\nHow do we avoid that?\nWe've been talking about Iran, but there will be new conflicts.\nThere's Ukraine, China, Kashmir.\nKashmir.\nUm, North Korea.\nNo.\nYeah.\nDon't forget North Korea.\nYeah.\nI mean, there was a time when North Korea was the biggest threat to human civilization.\nAccording to...\nWe could have had a deal except John Bolton ruined it.\nSo, that's the bigger question.\nNot so much in the specifics.\nOh, I mean the second time he ruined the Clinton deal of '94.\nThen he ruined the Trump deal of 2018.\nMay maybe the Korean dictator, North Korean dictator ruined it.\nBut again, one doesn't want to blame our enemies for their mistakes.\nWell, you know that at the second meeting, Trump sent John Bolton to outer Mongolia so that he couldn't sit at the table and ruin the deal.\nBut but what happened then?\nThe Democrats had his lawyer testify against him while he was at the meeting.\nAnd they had this huge propaganda campaign that Kim Jong-un is going to walk all over Trump and take such advantage of him.\nAnd they made it virtually impossible for him to walk away claiming a victory.\nDo you ever blame the enemy ever?\nDo you ever blame the enemy?\nNorth Korea is not my enemy.\nNorth Korea is not your enemy.\nNo.\nReally?\nThey they they build nuclear weapons, ICBMs that target America.\nIt's George Bush and John Bolton's fault.\nI already said that.\nWhatever fault it is, the fact of the matter is, do you ever ever blame an American adversary?\nOr is it always our fault?\nIn fact, what happened was always our fault.\nSee, all you can do is characterize, but you don't want to talk about the details.\nThe details are that Steven Began who worked for for Donald Trump gave a speech and said, \"You know what?\nWe can put normalization first and denuclearization later.\nI know him very well.\"\nAnd then they brought Donald Trump brought John Bolton to the meeting.\nAnd he prevented that from being the uh from being the uh the message of the meeting.\nRuined the deal.\nJohn Bolton's fault.\nAlways John Bolton's fault because how reasonable does it sound to you, Lex?\nGive up all your nuclear weapons first, then we'll talk about every other issue.\nDoes that sound like a poison pill or that sounds like a reasonable negotiation?\nGive me a break.\nSounds like a beginning of a negotiation.\nYeah.\nWell, they got nowhere because Trump brought John Bolton with him and helped to ruin it.\nAnd maybe they went nowhere because the North Korean dictator at the end of the day is a dictator who wants to threaten the United States with ICBMs and nuclear.\nListen, you're you're criticizing the the sequential decisions made in negotiation.\nI'm asking you a serious question after hours of talking, which I must say I've really enjoyed.\nI've learned a lot.\nI enjoyed it.\nI think there's been areas of agreement, obviously, real disagreement, but here's the question to you.\nLike really, I mean, do you ever ever hold our adversaries responsible or do you just don't think we have any adversaries?\nThis is ridiculous.\nThe topic has been from from your point of view, it's all the adversaries and all America and Israel trying to do is survive and fix the situation the best they can.\nI'm refuting that by bringing up all the things that America and Israel have done to make matters worse.\nI didn't ever say that the Ayatollah is some great guy or that Kim Jong-un is some hero or like any kind of spin for their side.\nAre they a threat to America?\nNo, of course not.\nAs a big Brazinski said in 1993, we could have perfectly normalized relations then.\nYou talk about Iranian support for al-Qaeda.\nIran supported al-Qaeda in Bosnia in 1995 as a favor to Bill Clinton because they were trying to suck up to the United States is why they supported Ala.\nYour position.\nYour position.\nMy position is whatever you say it is, not what I say it.\nNo, no.\nI'm just I'm trying to summarize.\nYou know who's the last person who told me I need to beware about overarning the lessons of Iraq?\nIt was Charlie Savage from the New York Times when on the subject was his absolute ridiculous hoax that Russia was paying the Taliban to murder American soldiers in Afghanistan in 2020 which ruined Trump's potential which he was floating balloons about withdrawing in the summer of 2020 which would have absolutely prevented the Joe Biden era attack and Charlie Savage who published these ridiculous lies that were later refuted by the general in charge of the Afghan war the head Sentcom the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director as much detail as possible.\nHe told me, \"You know what your problem is, Horton, is you have overlearned the lessons of Iraq War II.\"\nBut it turned out those lessons were perfectly apt for Charlie Savage's hoax.\nIt wasn't true what Charlie Savage said.\nYou know what he resorted to?\nHe said, \"Well, it's true that there was a rumor I was reporting on.\"\nScott, you made it very clear America has no adversaries.\nThat's called learning the lessons of Iraq, not overarning them.\nAll right.\nSo, I guess the the answer to the question I asked about avoiding World War three is the two of you becoming friends.\nThat's my my goal.\nIf you can try to find the light at the end of the tunnel, one one last question.\nWhat gives you hope to the degree of hope about the future?\nWhat gives you hope about this great country of ours and humanity too?\nYeah.\nI mean, look, there are a million wonderful things about this country, the land, the people, our culture, and our resources and everything.\nAnd the kind of society that we could build in a not with a controlled system, but with just a pure free market, capitalist system in this country where people are allowed to own their property, improve its value, and exchange it on the market and build this country up.\nWe would be living in comparatively a paradise compared to what we have now.\nAnd if you look at the opportunity costs just since the end of the cold war on on all that has been wasted on militarism in the Middle East especially, but also in Eastern Europe and in East Asia, all of that wealth put here could have gone much more to something like perfecting our society.\nIt's always an unfinished project.\nSo that then we really have something to point to the rest of the world and say this is how you're supposed to do it.\nNot like that.\nI think it's crucial that for all of the problems that Somalia, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan have, the worst thing about those countries is America's wars there.\nIt's what we have done to them as the worst thing about those places.\nSo, we're not in much of a position to criticize, you know, whatever horrible and political uh practices uh you know, cultural and and things about their societies that we would like to criticize when the worst chaos that's happened to them has been inflicted by our country against them virtually all in in wars of choice that were unnecessary from the get-go.\nWhat gives you hope?\nWhat gives me hope?\nI think first of all, um I have a lot of um hope and confidence in the wisdom of the American people.\nUm, I think Americans understand the end of the day that they need leaders who are about making America great again.\nI think they elected Donald Trump who is flawed in many many ways, but I think Trump is wrestling with some of the questions that we have been wrestling with for the past 5 hours.\nUm, I think that um we I think most Americans know that we have adversaries.\nUh, and you know, it's just overwhelming numbers of Americans understand that.\nThey may disagree on exactly who is an adversary and how you rank them, but they know we have adversaries.\nI think the third thing is Americans greatly admire the men and women in uniform.\nI mean, I think the institution with the greatest popularity in America still remains the US military while many of other institutions are are failing the American people and are reflected in the in the polling.\nI think we got to be very judicious about how we use this incredibly powerful military.\nUm and because most importantly it comes down to it's not about weapons and technology.\nIt's about the people.\nIt's about the men and women who have sacrificed their lives um to serve our country.\nAt the end of the day, if we understand we have adversaries, we're care\n\n\nFul about how we use our military, we understand the importance of foreign deterrence in order to actually confront threats before they become so severe that we ended up plunging ourselves in a war.\nI agree totally with Scott in terms of how we use our money and how judiciously we must we have to guard it.\nI agree with how we've we've run out these massive debts and we have to be actually if we're serious and conservatives are really serious, they need to stop, they need to tackle these massive budget deficits.\nUm, and you know, it would be really easy if it was just all about the military and we could just kind of get rid of the Pentagon and all of a sudden we'd be running balanced budgets.\nIt's not the case.\nWe have much deeper structural economics economic problems in this country, and everybody knows that.\nAnd so we got huge challenges as a country.\nUm, but I really believe, uh, as I believe since I was a little kid that America is the greatest force for good in the world and that we do, we make mistakes, sometimes tragic mistakes.\nWe make huge miscalculations, and I think we will be much more clear in how to rectify those mistakes if we stop obsessing with these boogeymen that are out there, the Israelis, the Jews, theians.\nWell, and we start focusing on our adversaries, which are not the Iranians, because the 80% of Iranians despise this regime.\nAnd you know, Lex, I feel really bad that we in 5 hours we actually haven't even talked about that in any detail.\nMany of my friends are Iranian, and they're beautiful people and and as one of the great cultures on earth.\nYeah.\nAnd you know, the only place they don't succeed in the world is inside the Islamic Republic.\nWhen they come to America and Canada and Europe, they're incredibly successful people.\nAnd 80% of Iranians despise this regime and they long for a free and prosperous Iran.\nAnd so it's a big question that they're ever going to get there.\nAnd who knows the right way to get them there.\nBut at the end of the day, I am convinced that the vast majority of Iranians are our friends.\nBut there is a regime that has been trying to build nuclear weapons, has been engaged in terrorism for decades, has killed and maimed thousands of Americans and our allies.\nAnd it's a regime that has to be stopped.\nAnd I think Donald Trump in the past couple of weeks, I would argue in the past number of months, has tried to try to play a strategy, try to figure out a way to offer the Iranians negotiations and a peaceful solution to this, but use overwhelming military power recently against Iran's nuclear sites in a very targeted way in order to send a message to the Islamic Republic of Iran that they cannot continue to build nuclear weapons and threaten America.\nAnd so I hope that things will work out well on this.\nI I've always said curb your enthusiasm because we have still a lot of of pieces that still need to fall into place.\nAnd this is going to be a windy road as we try to figure this out.\nI'm hoping for the best, preparing for the worst, and want to thank you very much for having me on the show.\nScott, it was a real pleasure to meet you.\nI enjoyed the debate.\nVery lively.\nI admire your dedication to the issue and your and your attention to detail, and I think all of that speaks well of of you and your commitment and and your passion for this.\nSo I am thank you deeply grateful that you guys will come here.\nUh, this was really mind-blowing.\nUh, also that you have it's silly maybe to say, but the courage to sit down and talk through this through the tension.\nI've learned a lot.\nI think a lot of people are going to learn a lot.\nI'm a fan of both of your work.\nAnd um, it means a lot that you come here today and talk to a silly kid like me.\nSo Scott, thank you so much brother.\nThank you.\nThank you Mark.\nThanks Lux.\nAppreciate it.\nBam.\nThanks Scott.\nThanks for listening to this debate between Scott Horton and Mark Dubowitz.\nTo support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel.\nAnd now let me leave you with some sobering words on the cost of war from Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nFor some context, Eisenhower was the 34th president of the U.S..\nBut before that, during World War II, he was the supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, orchestrating some of the most significant military operations of the war with leadership marked by strategic and tactical brilliance.\nIt is in this context that the following words carry even more power and wisdom spoken in 1953.\nEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\nThis world in arms is not spending money alone.\nIt is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of a scientist, the hopes of its children.\nThe cost of one modern heavy bomber is this, a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.\nIt is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.\nIt is two fully equipped hospitals.\nIt is on 50 mi of concrete highway.\nWe pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat.\nWe pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.\nThis is not a way of life at all in any true sense under the cloud of threatening war that is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.\nAnd now allow me to add some additional brief excerpts.\nIn 1946, Eisenhower said, \"I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can.\nOnly as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity.\"\nIn 1950, Eisenhower said, \"Possibly my hatred of war blinds me so that I cannot comprehend the arguments they aduce.\nBut in my opinion, there's no such thing as a preventative war.\nAlthough the suggestions repeatedly made, none has yet explained how war prevents war.\nWorse than this, no one has been able to explain away the fact that war creates the conditions that beget war.\nAnd finally, an excerpt from Eisenhower's farewell address in 1961 on the military-industrial complex.\nA vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment.\nOur arms must be mighty, ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.\nAmerican makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well.\nBut now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.\nWe have been compelled to create a permanent armament industry of vast proportions.\nThis conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.\nYet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.\nIn the councils of government, we must guard against an acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryindustrial complex.\nThe potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\nThank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n",

    "cleanText": "The following is a conversation with Terence Tao. Widely considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history. Often referred to as the Mozart of Math, he won the Fields Medal and the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics and has contributed groundbreaking work to a truly astonishing range of fields in Mathematics and Physics.\n\nThis was a huge honor for me for many reasons, including the humility and kindness that Terry showed to me throughout all our interactions. It means the world. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfridman.com/sponsors.\n\nAnd now, dear friends, here's Terrence Tao.\n\nWhat was the first really difficult research level math problem that you encountered? One that gave you pause maybe. Well, I mean in your undergraduate um education, you learn about the really hard impossible problems like the reman hypothesis, the twin primes conjecture. You can make problems arbitrarily difficult. That's not really a problem. In fact, there's even problems that we know to be unsolvable. What's really interesting are the problems just at the on the boundary between what we can do relatively easily and what are hopeless. Um but what are problems where like existing techniques can do like 90% of the job and then you just need that remaining 10%. Um I think as a PhD student the CA problem certainly caught my eye and it just got solved actually. It's a problem I've worked on a lot in my early research. Historically it came from a little puzzle by the Japanese mathematician Soji Kaya uh in like 1918 or so. Um, so the puzzle is that you you you have um a needle um in on the plane. Um think like like a like driving like on on on a road something and you you want it to execute a U-turn. You want to turn the needle around. Um but you want to do it in as little space as possible. So you want to use as little area in order to turn it around. So um but the needle is infinitely maneuverable. So you can imagine just spinning it around its um as a unit needle. You can spin it around its center. Um, and I think, um, that gives you a disc of of area, I think pi over four. Um, or you can do a three-point U-turn, which is what they we teach people in in the driving schools to do. Uh, and that actually takes area pi over 8. So, it's it's a little bit more efficient than um a rotation. And so, for a while, people thought that was the most efficient uh way to turn things around. But, Mazikovich uh showed that in fact, you could actually uh turn the needle around using as little area as you wanted. So 0001 there was some really fancy multi- um u back and forth U-turn thing that you could you could do that that you could turn a needle around and in so doing it would pass through every intermediate direction. Is this in the two dimensional plane? This is in the two dimensional plane. Yeah. So we understand everything in two dimensions. So the next question is what happens in three dimensions. So suppose like the Hubble space telescope is tube in space and you want to observe every single star in the universe. So you want to rotate the telescope to reach every single direction. And here's unrealistic part. Suppose that space is at a premium, which it totally is not. Uh you want to occupy as little volume as possible in order to rotate your your needle around in order to see every single star in the sky. Um how small a volume do you need to do that? And so you can modify basic construction. And so if your telescope has zero thickness, then you can use as little volume as you need. That's a simple modification of the two dimensional construction. But the question is that if your telescope is not zero thickness but but just very very thin some thickness delta what is the minimum volume needed to be able to see every single direction as a function of delta. So as delta gets smaller as you need gets thinner the volume should go down but but how fast does it go down? Um and the conjecture was that it goes down very very slowly um like logarithmically um uh roughly speaking and that was proved after a lot of work. So this seems like a puzzle. Why is it interesting? So it turns out to be surprisingly connected to a lot of problems in partial differential equations, in number theory, in geometry, comics. For example, in in wave propagation, you splash some some water around um you create water waves and they they travel in various directions. Um but waves exhibit both both particle and wave type behavior. So you can have what's called a wave packet, which is like a a very localized wave that is localized in space and moving a certain direction in time. And so if you plot it in both space and time, it occupies a region which looks like a tube. And so what can happen is that you can have a wave which initially is very dispersed but it all comes it all focuses at a single point later in time. Like you can imagine dropping a pebble into a pond and ripples spread out. But then if you time reverse that that um that scenario and the equations of wave motion are time reversible. You can imagine ripples that are converging um to a single point and then a big splash occurs um maybe even a singularity.\n\nUm and so it's possible to do that. Uh and geometrically what's going on is that there's always s of light rays. Um so like if if if this wave represents light for example um you can imagine this wave as a superp position of photons um all traveling at the speed of light. They all travel on these light rays and they're all focusing at this one point. So you can have a very dispersed wave focus into a very concentrated wave at one point in space and time, but then it defocuses again and it separates. But potentially if the conjecture had a negative solution. So what that meant is that there's there's a very efficient way to pack um tubes pointing different directions into a very very narrow region of of of very narrow volume. Then you would also be able to create waves that start out some there'll be some arrangement of waves that start out very very dispersed but they would concentrate not just at a single point but um um there'll be a large um there'll be a lot of concentrations in space and time and uh um and you could create what's called a blowup where these waves their amplitude becomes so great that the laws of physics that they're governed by are no longer wave equations but something more complicated and nonlinear. Um and so in mathematical physics we care a lot about whether certain equations in in wave equations are stable or not whether they can create um these singularities.\nThere's a famous unsolved problem called the Navia Stokes regularity problem. So the Navia Stokes equations equations that govern the fluid flow for incompressible fluids like water. The question asks if you start with a smooth velocity field of water can it ever concentrate so much that like the velocity becomes infinite at some point that's called a singularity. We don't see that um in real life. You know, if you splash around water on the bathtub, it won't explode on you. Um or or have have water leaving at the speed of light, I think. But potentially, it is possible. Um and in fact, in recent years, the the consensus has has drifted towards the uh the belief that uh that in fact for certain very special initial configurations of of say water that singularities can form. But people have not yet been able to uh to actually establish this. The clay foundation has these seven millennium prize problems has a million dollar prize for solving one of these problems that this is one of them. Of these seven only one of them has been solved the point conjecture by Pelman. So the Ka conjecture is not directly directly related to the Navis Stokes problem but understanding it would help us understand some aspects of things like wave concentration which would indirectly probably help us understand the Navis problem better. Can you speak to the neighbors? So the existence and smoothness like you said millennial prize problem right you've made a lot of progress on this one in 2016 you published a paper finite time blow up for an averaged threedimensional navia stoke equation right so we're trying to figure out if this thing usually doesn't blow up right but can we say for sure it never blows up right yeah so yeah that is literally the the million- dollar question yeah so this is what distinguishes mathematicians from pretty much everybody else like it If something holds 99.99% of the time, um that's good enough for most, you know, uh for for most things, but mathematicians are one of the few people who really care about whether every like 100% really 100% of all um situations are covered by by um yeah, so most fluid most of the time um water that does not blow up. But could you design a very special initial state that does this? And maybe we should say that this is a this is a set of equations that govern in the field of fluid dynamics. Trying to understand how fluid behaves and it's actually turns out to be a really comp you know fluid is yeah extremely complicated thing to try to model. Yeah. So it has practical importance. So this clay price problem concerns what's called the incompressible navio stokes which governs things like water. There's something called the compressible navio stokes which governs things like air. And that's particularly important for weather prediction. Weather prediction it does a lot of computational fluid dynamics. A lot of it is actually just trying to solve the ny stokes equations as best they can. Um also gathering a lot of data so that they can get they can in initialize the equation. There's a lot of moving parts. So it's very important practically. Why is it difficult to prove general things about the set of equations like it not not blowing up? Short answer is Maxwell's demon. Um so exos demon is a concept in thermodynamics like if you have a box of two gases and oxygen and hydrogen uh and maybe you start with all the oxygen one side and nitrogen the other side but there's no barrier between them right then they will mix um and they should stay mixed right there there's no reason why they should unmix but in principle because of all the collisions between them there could be some sort of weird conspiracy that that um like maybe there's a microscopic demon called Maxwell's demon that will um every time a oxygen and nitrogen atom collide they will bounce off in such a way that the oxygen sort of drifts onto one side and then goes to the other and uh you could have an extremely improbable configuration emerge. Uh which we never see. Um and and we statistically it's extremely unlikely but mathematically it's possible that this can happen and we can't rule it out. Um and this is a situation that shows up a lot in mathematics. Um a basic example is the digits of pi 3.14159 and so forth. The digits look like they have no pattern and we believe they have no pattern. On the long term, you should see as many ones and twos and threes as fours and fives and sixes. There should be no preference in the digits of pi to favor let's say 7 over 8. Um, but maybe there's some demon in the digits of pi that that like every time you compute more digits, it sort of biases one digit to another. Um, and this is a conspiracy that should not happen. There's no reason it should happen, but um there's there's there's no way to prove it.\nuh with our current technology. Okay. So getting back to Nabia Stokes, a fluid has a certain amount of energy and because a fluid is in motion, the energy gets transported around and water is also viscous. So if the energy is spread out over many different locations, the natural viscosity of the fluid will just damp out the energy and will it will go to zero. Um and this is what happens um in um uh when we actually experiment with water like you splash around there. there's some turbulence and waves and so forth. But eventually it it settles down and and and the the lower the amplitude, the smaller the velocity, the the more calm it gets. Um but potentially there is some sort of a demon that keeps pushing the uh the energy of the fluid into a smaller and smaller scale and it will move faster and faster and at faster speeds the effective viscosity is relatively less. And so it could happen that that it it creates a some sort of um um what's called a self similar blowup scenario where you know um the energy of fluid starts off at some um large scale and then it all sort of um transfers it energy into a smaller um region of of of the fluid which then at a much faster rate um moves into um an even smaller region and so forth. Um and and each time it does this uh it takes maybe half as as long as as the previous one and then you you could you could actually uh converge to all the energy concentrating in one point in a finite amount of time. Um and that that's uh that scenario is called finite blow up.\nUm so in practice this doesn't happen. Um so water is what's called turbulent. Um so it is true that um if you have a big eddy of water it will tend to break up into smaller eddies but it won't transfer all the the energy from one big eddy into one smaller eddy. It will transfer into maybe three or four and then those must split up into maybe three or four small edies of their own and so the energy gets dispersed to the point where the viscosity can can then keep that thing under control. Um but if it can somehow um concentrate um all the energy keep it all together um and do it fast enough that the viscous effects don't have enough time to calm everything down then this blob can occur. So there were papers who had claimed that oh you just need to take into account conservation energy and just carefully use the viscosity and you can keep everything under control for not just Navia Stokes but for many many types of equations like this and so in the past there have been many attempts to try to obtain what's called global regularity for Navio Stokes which is the opposite of final time blow up that velocity say smooth and it all failed there was always some sign error or some subtle mistake and and it couldn't be salvaged. Um so what I was interested in doing was trying to explain why we were not able to disprove um planet time blow up. I couldn't do it for the actual equations of fluids which were too complicated. But if I could average the equations of motion of naval basically if if um if I could turn off certain types of of ways in which water interacts and only keep the ones that I want. Um, so in particular, um, if, um, if there's a fluid and it could transfer energy from a large Eddie into this small Eddie or this other small Eddie, I would turn off the energy channel that would transfer energy to this this one and and direct it only into um, this smaller Eddie while still preserving the law of conservation of energy. So you're trying to make it blow up. Yeah. Yeah. So I I I basically engineer um, a blow up by changing the laws of physics,\n\n\nWhich is one thing that mathematicians are allowed to do.\nWe can change the equation.\nHow does that help you get closer to the proof of something?\nRight?\nSo, it provides what's called an obstruction in Mathematics.\nUm, so, so what I did was that uh basically if I turned off the um certain parts of the equation, so which usually when you turn off certain interactions make it less nonlinear, it makes it more regular and less likely to blow up.\nBut I found that by turning off a very well-designed set of of of of interactions, I could force all the energy to blow in finite time.\nSo what that means is that if you wanted to prove um global regularity for Navier–Stokes um for the actual equation you had, you must use some feature of the true equation which which my artificial equation um does not satisfy.\nSo it it rules out certain um certain approaches.\nSo um the thing about Math is is it's not just about finding you know taking a technique that is going to work and applying it, but you you need to not take the techniques that don't work.\nUm and for the problems that are really hard, often there are dozens of ways that you might think might apply to solve the problem.\nBut uh it's only after a lot of experience that you realize there's no way that these methods are going to work.\nSo having these counter examples for nearby problems um kind of rules out um uh it saves you a lot of time because you you're not wasting um energy on on things that you now know cannot possibly ever work.\nHow deeply connected is it to that specific problem of fluid dynamics or just some more general intuition you build up about Mathematics?\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo the key phenomenon that uh my my technique exploits is what's called super criticality.\nSo in partial differential equations, often these equations are like a tug-of-war between different forces.\nSo in Navier–Stokes there's the dissipation um force coming from viscosity and it's very well understood.\nIt's linear.\nIt calms things down.\nIf if viscosity was all there was, then then nothing bad would ever happen.\nUm but there's also transport um that that energy from in one location of space can get transported because the fluid is in motion to to other locations.\nUm and that's a nonlinear effect and that causes all the all the problems.\nUm so there are these two competing terms in the Davis equation, the dissipation term and the transport term.\nIf the dissipation term dominates, if it's if it's large, then basically you get regularity.\nAnd if um if the transport term dominates, then uh then we don't know what's going on.\nIt's a very nonlinear situation.\nIt's unpredictable.\nIt's turbulent.\nSo sometimes these forces are in balance at small scales, but not in balance at large scales or or vice versa.\nUm so Navier–Stokes is what's called supercritical.\nSo at at smaller and smaller scales, the transport terms are much stronger than the viscosity terms.\nSo the viscosity are the things that calm things down.\nUm and so this is um um this is why the problem is hard in two dimensions.\nSo the Soviet mathematician Ladish skaya, she in the 60s shows in two dimensions there is no blow up and in two dimensions the nav equations is what's called critical, the effect of transport and the effect of viscosity about the same strength even at very very small scales and we have a lot of technology to handle critical and also subcritical equations and proof um regularity, but for supercritical equations it was not clear what was going on and I did a lot of work and then there's been a lot of follow-up showing that for many other types of supercritical equations you create all kinds of blow up examples.\nOnce the nonlinear effects dominate the linear effects at small scales, you can have all kinds of bad things happen.\nSo this is sort of one of the main insights of this this line of work is that supercriticality versus criticality and subcriticality.\nThis this makes a big difference.\nI mean that's a key qualitative feature that distinguishes some equations for being sort of nice and predictable and you know like like planetary motion and I mean there are certain equations that that you can predict for millions of years and or thousands at least.\nAgain, it's not really a problem, but but there's a reason why we can't predict the weather past 2 weeks into the future because it's a supercritical equation.\nLots of really strange things are going on at very fine scales.\nSo, whenever there is some huge source of nonlinearity, yeah, that can create a huge problem for predicting what's going to happen.\nYeah.\nAnd if the nonlinearity is somehow more and more featured and interesting at at small scales.\nUm I mean there's there's many equations that are nonlinear but um in in many equations you can approximate things by the bulk.\nUm so for example planetary motion, you know if you want to understand the orbit of the moon or Mars or something, you don't really need the micro structure of like the seismology of the moon or or like exactly how the mass is distributed.\nUm you just basically you can almost approximate these planets by point masses and just the aggregate behavior is important um but if you want to model a fluid um like like the weather, you can't just say in Los Angeles the temperature is this, the wind speed is this.\nFor supercritical equations, the finance confirmation is is really important.\nIf we can just linger on the Navier–Stokes uh equations a little bit, so you've suggested maybe you can describe it that one of the ways to uh solve it or to negatively resolve it would be to sort of to construct a liquid computer, right?\nAnd then show that the halting problem from computation theory has consequences for fluid dynamics.\nSo uh show it in that way.\nCan you describe this this?\nYeah.\nSo this came out of of this work of constructing this this this average equation that that blew up.\nUm so one um as as part of how I had to do this.\nSo there this naive way to do it.\nYou you just keep pushing um um every time you you get energy at one scale, you you push it immediately to the next scale as as fast as possible.\nThis is sort of the naive way to to to to force blow up.\nUm it turns out in five and high dimensions this works.\nUm but in three dimensions there was this funny phenomenon that I discovered that if you if you keep if if you change the laws of Physics, you just always keep trying to push um the energy into smaller smaller scales.\nUm what happens is that the energy starts getting spread out into multi many scales at once.\nUm so that you you have energy at one scale, you're pushing it into the next scale and then um as soon as it enters that scale, you also push it to the next scale, but there's still some energy left over from the previous scale.\nUm you're trying to do everything at once.\nUm and this spreads out the energy too much.\nUm and then it turns out that that um it makes it vulnerable for viscosity to come in and actually just damp out everything.\nSo um so it turns out this this direct push doesn't doesn't actually work.\nThere was a separate paper by some other authors that actually showed this um in three dimensions.\nUm so what I needed was to program a delay.\nUm so kind of like air locks.\nSo um I needed an equation which would start with a fluid doing something at one scale.\nIt would push this energy into the next scale, but it would stay there until all the energy from the from the larger scale got transferred and only after you pushed all the energy in, then you sort of open the next gate and and then you you push that in as well.\nSo um by doing that, it kind of the energy inches forward scale by scale in such a way that it's always um localized at one scale at a time.\nUm and then it can resist the effects of viscosity because it's not dispersed.\nUm so in order to make that happen, um yeah, I had to construct a rather complicated nonlinearity.\nUm and it was basically like um you know like was constructed like electronic circuit.\nSo I I actually thank my wife for this because she was trained as a electrical engineer.\nUm and um you know he talked about um uh you know he had to design circuits and so forth.\nAnd you know if if you want a circuit that does a certain thing like maybe have a light that that flashes on and then turns off and then on and then off.\nYou can build it from from more primitive components, you know, capacitors and resistors and so forth and you have to build a diagram and you um and these diagrams you can you can sort of follow your eyeballs and say oh yeah the the current will build up here and then it will stop and then it will do that.\nSo I knew how to build the analog of basic electronic components, you know, like resistors and capacitors and so forth.\nAnd and I would I would stack them together um in in such a way that that I would create something that would open one gate and then there'll be a clock that would and then once the clock hits a certain threshold, it would close it, kind of a rude Goldberg type machine but described mathematically and this ended up working.\nSo what I realized is that if you could pull the same thing off for the actual equations.\nSo if the equations of water support a computation, so um like if you can imagine kind of a steampunk but really water punk uh type of thing where um you know so modern computers are electronic, you know they they they're powered by by electrons passing through very tiny wires and interacting with other electrons and so forth.\nBut instead of electrons, you can imagine these pulses of of water moving at certain velocity and maybe it's they're two different configurations corresponding to a bit being up or down.\nProbably if you had two of these moving bodies of water collide, it would come out with some new configuration which is which would be something like an AND gate or OR gate.\nYou know that if the the the output would depend in a very predictable way on on the inputs and like you could chain these together and maybe create a Turing machine and and then you could you have computers which are made completely out of water um and if you have computers then maybe you can do robotics so I you know hydraulics and so forth um and so you could create some machine which is basically a fluid analog what's called a von Neumann machine.\nSo von Neumann proposed if you want to colonize Mars, the sheer cost of transporting people machines to Mars is just ridiculous.\nBut if you could transport one machine to Mars and this machine had the ability to mine the planet, create some more materials to smelt them and build more copies of the same machine.\nUm, then you could colonize a whole planet um over time.\nUm, so uh if you could build a fluid machine, which uh yeah, so it's it's it's a robot.\nOkay.\nAnd what it would do, it its purpose in life, it's programmed so that it would create a smaller version of itself in some sort of cold state.\nIt wouldn't start just yet.\nOnce it's ready, the big robot configuration water would transfer all his energy into the smaller configuration and then power down.\nOkay?\nAnd then like I clean itself up.\nAnd then what's left is this newest state which would then turn on and do the same thing but smaller and faster.\nAnd then the equation has a certain scaling symmetry.\nOnce you do that, it can just keep iterating.\nSo this in principle would create a blow up uh for the actual Navier–Stokes and this is what I managed to accomplish for this average Navier–Stokes.\nSo it provided the sort of road map to solve the problem.\nNow this is uh a pipe dream because uh there are so many things that are missing for this to actually be a reality.\nUm so um I I I can't create these basic logic gates.\nUm I I don't I don't have these in these special configurations of water.\nUm, I mean there's candidates there things called vortex rings that might possibly work but um um but also you know analog computing is really nasty um compared to digital computing.\nI mean because there's always errors um you you have to you have to do a lot of error correction along the way.\nI don't know how to completely power down the big machine so that it doesn't interfere with the the running of the smaller machine but everything in principle can happen like it doesn't contradict any of the laws of Physics.\nUm so it's sort of evidence that this thing is possible.\nUm there are other groups who are now pursuing ways to make navis blow up which are nowhere near as ridiculously complicated as this.\nUm um they they actually are pursuing much closer to the the direct self similar model which can it doesn't quite work as is, but there could be some simpler scheme than what I just described to make this work.\nThere is a real leap of genius here to go from Navier–Stokes to this Turing machine.\nSo it goes from what the self similar blob scenario that you're trying to get the smaller and smaller blob to now having a liquid toying machine gets smaller and smaller and smaller and somehow seeing how that could be used to say something about a blowup.\nI mean that's a big leap.\nSo there's precedent.\nI mean um so the the thing about Mathematics is that it's really good at um spotting connections between what you think of what you might think of as completely different um problems.\nUm but if if the mathematical form is the same, you you can you you can draw a connection um so um there's a lot of work previously on what called cellular automator, um the most famous of which is Conway's Game of Life.\nThere's this infinite discrete grid and at any given time the grid is either occupied by a cell or it's empty and there's a very simple rule that uh tells you how these cells evolve.\nSo sometimes cells live and sometimes they die.\nUm and this um you know um when I was a a student it was a very popular screen saver to actually just have these these animations going and and they look very chaotic.\nIn fact they look a little bit like turbulent float sometimes.\nBut at some point people discovered more and more interesting structures within this Game of Life.\nUm so for example they discovered this thing called a glider.\nSo a glider is a very tiny configuration of like four or five cells which evolves and it just moves at a certain direction and that's like this this vortex rings, this um yeah so this is an analogy, the Game of Life is kind of like a discrete equation and and um the flu navis is a continuous equation but mathematically they have some similar features um and um so over time people discovered more and more interesting things you could build within the Game of Life.\nThe game life is a very simple system.\nIt only has like three or four rules um to to do it, but but you can design all kinds of interesting configurations inside it.\nUm there's something called a glider gun that does nothing to spit out gliders one at a one one at a time.\nUm and then after a lot of effort, people managed to to create um and gates and or gates for gliders.\nLike there's this massive ridiculous structure which if you if a if you have a stream of gliders um coming in here and a stream of gliders coming in here, then you may produce a stream of gliders coming out.\nIf so maybe if both of\n\n\nof the um streams um\nhave gliders then there'll be an output\nstream, but if only one of them does, then\nnothing comes out. Mhm. So they could\nbuild something like that. And once you\ncould build and um these basic gates,\nthen just from software engineering, you\ncan build almost anything. Um, you can\nbuild a touring machine. I mean, it's\nlike an enormous steampunk type things.\nThey look ridiculous. But then people\nalso generated self-replicating objects\nin the game of life. A massive machine, a\nvon Neumann machine, which over a huge period of\ntime, and it always look like glider guns\ninside doing these very steampunk\ncalculations, it would create another\nversion of itself which could replicate.\nIt's so incredible. A lot of this was\nlike community crowdsourced by like\namateur mathematicians actually. Um, so I\nknew about that, that work, and so\nthat is part of what inspired me to\npropose the same thing with Navier\nStokes. Um, which is a much, as I said,\nanalog is much worse than digital, like\nit's going to be, um, you can't just\ndirectly take the constructions in the\ngame of life and plunk them in. But\nagain, it just it shows it's possible.\nYou know, there's a kind of emergence\nthat happens with these cellular automata.\nLocal rules.\nMaybe it's similar to fluids. I don't\nknow. But local rules operating at scale\ncan create these incredibly complex\ndynamic structures. Do you think any of\nthat is amendable to mathematical\nanalysis?\nDo we have the tools to say something\nprofound about that? The thing is, you\ncan get this emerg in very complicated\nstructures, but only with very carefully\nprepared initial conditions. Yeah. So, so\nthese these these glider guns and and\ngates and and so forth machines, if you\njust plunk down randomly some cells and\nyou and you will not see any of these.\nUm, and that's the analogous situation\nwith Navier Stokes, again, you know, that\nthat with with typical initial\nconditions, you you will not have any of\nthis weird computation going on. Um, but\nbasically through engineering, you know,\nby by by specially designing things in a\nvery special way, you can make clever\nconstructions. I wonder if it's possible\nto prove the sort of the negative of\nlike, basically prove that only through\nengineering can you ever create\nsomething interesting. This this is a\nrecurring challenge in mathematics that\num, I call it the dichotomy between\nstructure and randomness. That most\nobjects that you can generate in\nmathematics are random. They look like\nrand, like the digits of pi. Well, we\nbelieve is a good example. Um, but\nthere's a very small number of things\nthat have patterns. Um, but um, now you\ncan prove something has a pattern by\njust constructing, you know, like if\nsomething has a simple pattern and you\nhave a proof that it it does something\nlike repeat itself every so often. You\ncan do that. But um, and you you can\nprove that that, for example, you can you\ncan prove that most sequences of of\ndigits have no pattern. Um, so like if\nyou just pick digits randomly, there's\nsomething called low large numbers. It\ntells you you're going to get as many\nones as as twos in the long run. Um, but\num, we have a lot fewer tools to to to, if\nI give you a specific pattern like the\ndigits of pi, how can I show that this\ndoesn't have some weird pattern to it.\nSome other work that I spend a lot of\ntime on is to prove what are called\nstructure theorems or inverse theorems\nthat give tests for when something is is\nvery structured. So some functions are\nwhat's called additive, like if you have\na function that maps natural numbers\nwith natural numbers. So maybe um, you\nknow, two maps to four, three maps to six\nand so forth. um, some functions what's\ncalled additive, which means that if you\nadd if you add two inputs together, the\noutput gets gets added as well. uh, for\nexample, multiplying by a constant, if you\nmultiply a number by 10, um, if you if you\nmultiply a plus b by 10, that's the same\nas multiplying a by 10 and b by 10 and\nthen adding them together. So some um,\nfunctions are additive, some are kind of\nadditive, but not completely additive. um,\nso for example, if I take a number n, I\nmultiply by the square root of two and I\ntake the integer part of that. So 10 by\nsquare of two is like 14 point\nsomething. So 10 up to 14. Um, 20 up to\n28. Um, so in that case, additively is\ntrue then. So 10 + 10 is 20 and 14 + 14\nis 28. But because of this rounding,\nsometimes there's roundoff errors and\nand sometimes when you um, add a plus b,\nthis function doesn't quite give you the\nsum of of the two individual outputs, but\nthe sum plus minus one. Um, so it's\nalmost additive, but not quite additive.\nUm, so there's a lot of useful results in\nmathematics and I've worked a lot on\ndeveloping things like this to the\neffect that if if a function exhibits\nsome structure like this, then um, it's\nbasically there's a reason for why it's\ntrue, and the reason is because there's\nthere's some other nearby function which\nis actually um, completely structured\nwhich is explaining this sort of partial\npattern that you have. Um, and so if you\nhave these so inverse theorems, it um, it\ncreates this sort of dichotomy that they\neither the objects that you study are\neither have no structure at all or they\nare somehow related to something that is\nstructured. Um, and in either way, in\neither um, in either case, you can make\nprogress. Um, a good example of this is\nthat there's this old theorem in\nmathematics called sim theorem, proven in\nthe 1970s. It concerns trying to find a\ncertain type of pattern in a set of\nnumbers. The patterns that have make\nprogression things like 3, five, and seven\nor or or 10, 15, and 20 andreli\nproved that um, any set of of numbers\nthat are sufficiently big um, what's\ncalled positive density has um,\narithmetic progressions in it of of any\nlength you wish. um, so for example, um, the\nodd numbers have a set of density 1/2, um,\nand they contain arithmetic progressions\nof any length. um, so in that case, it's\nobvious because the the odd numbers are\nreally, really structured. I can just take\n11, 13, 15, 17. I just I can I can easily\nfind arithmetic progressions in in in\nthat set. Um, but um, zerminism also\napplies to random sets. If I take the\nset of odd numbers and I flip a coin, um,\nand for each number and I only keep the\nnumbers which for which I got a heads,\nokay, so I just flip coins. I just\nrandomly take out half the numbers, I\nkeep one half. So that's a set that has\nno no patterns at all. But just from\nrandom fluctuations, you will still get\na lot of um, um, of arithmetic\nprogressions in that set. Can you prove\nthat\nthere's arithmetic progressions of\narbitrary length within a random? Yes.\nUm, have you heard of the infinite monkey\ntheorem? Usually mathematicians give\nboring names to theorists, but\noccasionally they they give colorful\nnames. Yes. The popular version of the\ninfinite monkey theorem is that if you\nhave an infinite number of monkeys in a\nroom with each with a typewriter, they\ntype out uh text randomly, almost surely\none of them is going to generate the\nentire screw of Hamlet or any other\nfinite string of text. Uh, it will just\ntake some time, quite a lot of time\nactually, but if you have an infinite\nnumber, then it happens. Um, so um,\nbasically the the, if you take an\ninfinite string of of digits or whatever,\num, eventually any finite pattern you\nwish will emerge. Um, it may take a long\ntime, but it will eventually happen. Um,\nin particular, arithmetic progressions of\nany length will eventually happen. Okay.\nBut you need that, but you need an\nextremely long random sequence for this\nto happen. I suppose that's intuitive.\nIt's just infinity. Yeah. Infinity\nabsorbs a lot of sins. Yeah. How are we\nhumans supposed to deal with infinity?\nWell, you can think of infinity as as as\njust an abstraction of um, a finite\nnumber for which you you do not have a\nbound for. Um, that uh, you know, I mean, so\nnothing in real life is truly infinite.\nUm, but you know, you can um, you know, you\ncan ask yourself questions like, you know,\nwhat if I had as much money as I wanted,\nyou know, or what if I could go as fast\nas I wanted, and a way in which\nmathematicians formalize that is\nmathematics has found a formalism to\nidealize instead of something being\nextremely large or extremely small to\nactually be exactly infinite or zero. Um,\nand often the the mathematics becomes a\nlot cleaner when you do that. I mean, in\nphysics, we we joke about uh, assuming\nspherical cows. um, you know, like real\nworld problems have got all kinds of\nreal world effects, but you can idealize,\nsend certain things to infinity, send\ncertain things to zero, um, and um, and the\nmathematics becomes a lot simpler to\nwork with there. I wonder how often\nusing infinity\nuh, forces us to deviate from um, the\nphysics of reality. Yeah. So there's a\nlot of pitfalls. Um, so you know, we we\nspend a lot of time in undergraduate\nmath classes teaching analysis. Um, and\nanalysis is often about how to take\nlimits and and and and whether you you\nknow, so for example, a plus b is always b\nplus a. Um, so when you have a finite\nnumber of terms, you add them, you can\nswap them and there there's no problem.\nBut when you have infinite number of\nterms, there these sort of shell games\nyou can play where you can have a series\nwhich converges to one value, but you\nrearrange it and it suddenly converges\nto another value. And so you can make\nmistakes. You have to know what you're\ndoing when you allow infinity. Um, you\nhave to introduce these epsilons and\ndeltas and and this there's a certain\ntype of way of reasoning that helps you\navoid mistakes. Um,\nin more recent years, um, people have\nstarted taking results that are true in\ninfinite limits and what's called\nfinetizing them. Um, so you know that\nsomething's true eventually, but um, you\ndon't know when. Now give me a rate.\nOkay. Okay, so it's such a, if I have\ndon't have an infinite number of monkeys,\nbut but a large finite number of\nmonkeys, how long do I have to wait for\nH to come out? Um, and that's a more\nquantitative question. Um, and this is\nsomething that you can you can um, attack\nby purely finite methods and you can use\nyour finite intuition. Um, and in this\ncase, it turns out to be exponential in\nthe length of the text that you're\nyou're trying to generate. Um, so um, and\nso this is why you never see the monkeys\ncreate Hamilton. You can maybe see them\ncreate a four-letter word, but nothing\nthat big. And so I personally find once\nyou finitize an infinite statement, it's\nit does become much more intuitive and\nit's no longer so so weird. Um, so even\nif you're working with infinity, it's\ngood to finitize so that you can have\nsome intuition. Yeah. The downside is\nthat the finite groups are just much\nmuch messier and and uh, yeah. So, so the\ninfinite ones are found first, usually\nlike decades earlier, and then later on\npeople finize them. So since we\nmentioned a lot of math and a lot of\nphysics, uh, what is the difference\nbetween mathematics and physics as\ndisciplines, as ways of understanding of\nseeing the world? Maybe we can throw in\nengineering in there. You mentioned your\nwife is an engineer, give it new\nperspective on circuits, right? So this\ndifferent way of looking at the world,\ngiven that you've done mathematical\nphysics, so you you've you've worn all\nthe hats, right? So I think science in\ngeneral is interaction between three\nthings. Um, there's the real world, um,\nthere's is what we observe of the\nreward, our observations, and then our\nmental models as to how we think the\nworld works. Um, so um, we can't directly\naccess reality. Okay. Uh, all we have are\nthe observations, which are incomplete\nand they they have errors. Um, and um,\nthere are many, many cases where we would\num, uh, we want to know, for example, what\nis the weather like tomorrow, and we\ndon't yet have the observation, we'd like\nto a prediction. Um, and then we have\nthese simplified models, sometimes making\nunrealistic assumptions, you know,\nspherical cow type things. Those are the\nmathematical models. Mathematics is\nconcerned with the models. Science\ncollects the observations and it\nproposes the models that might explain\nthese observations. What mathematics\ndoes, we we stay within the model and we\nask what are the consequences of that\nmodel? What observations would what\npredictions would the model make of the\nof future observations, um, or past\nobservations, does it fit observed data?\num, so there's definitely a symbiosis. um,\nit's ma, I guess mathematics is is\nunusual among other disciplines is that\nwe start from hypothesis, like the axims\nof a model and ask what conclusions come\nup from that that model. um, in almost any\nother discipline, uh, you start with the\nconclusions, you know, I want to do this, I\nwant to build a bridge, you know, I I\nwant to to make money. I want to do\nthis. Okay. And then you you you find\nthe path to get there. Um,\na lot there there's a lot less sort of\nspeculation about suppose I did this,\nwhat would happen? Um, you know, planning\nand and and modeling, um, uh, speculative\nfiction maybe is one other place. Uh, but\nuh, that's about it actually. Most of\nthings we do in life is conclusions\ndriven, including physics and science.\nYou, I mean, they want to know, you know,\nwhere is this asteroid going to go? What\nwas what what is the weather going to be\ntomorrow? Um, but um, Bathe also has this\nother direction of of going from the uh,\nthe axioms. What do you think there is\nthis tension in physics between theory\nand experiment? Mhm. What do you think\nis the more powerful way of discovering\ntruly novel ideas about reality? Well,\nyou need both top down and bottom up. Um,\nyeah, it's it's a real interaction\nbetween all these things. So over time,\nthe observations and the theory and the\nmodeling should both get closer to\nreality. But initially, and it is, I mean,\nthis is um, this is always the case. You\nknow, they're always far apart to begin\nwith. Um, but you need one to figure out\nwhere to push the other, you know. So, um,\nif your model is predicting anomalies, um,\nthat are not picked up by experiment,\nthat tells experimenters where to look,\nyou know, um, to to to find more data\nto refine the models. Um, yeah, so it it\nit goes it goes back and forth. Um,\nwithin mathematics itself, there's\nthere's also a theory and experimental\ncomponent. It's just that until very\nrecently, theory has dominated almost\ncompletely, like 99% of mathematics is\ntheoretical mathematics, and there's a\nvery tiny amount of experimental\nmathematics. Um, I mean, people do do it,\nyou know, like if they want to study\nprime numbers or whatever, they can just\ngenerate large data sets and with a so\nonce we had computers, um, we be to do it\na little bit. Um, although even before\nwell, like Gaus, for example, he discovered\nhe conjectured the most basic theorem in\nin number theory to call the prime\nnumber theorem, which predicts how many\nprimes that up to a million, up to a\ntrillion. It's not an obvious question\nand basically what he did was that he\ncomputed, I mean, mostly um, by himself, but\nalso hired human computers, um, people who\nwhose professional job it was to do\narithmetic, um, to compute the first\n100,000 tribes or something and made\ntables and made a prediction. um, that was\nan early example of experimental\nmathematics\num, but until very recently, it was not, um,\nyeah, I mean, theoretical mathematics was\njust much more successful, I mean, because\ndoing complicated mathematical\n\n\nComputations is, uh, was just not not feasible until very recently. Uh, and even nowadays, you know, even though we have powerful computers, only some mathematical things can be, um, explored numerically. There's something called the combinatorial explosion. If you want us to study, for example, Zodius, you want to study all possible subsets of the numbers 1 to 1,000. There's only 1,000 numbers. How bad could it be? It turns out the number of different subsets of 1 to 1,000 is 2 to the power of 1,000, which is way bigger than any computer can currently, can, in fact, anybody ever will ever, um, enumerate. Um, so you have, you have to be, um, there are certain math problems that very quickly become just intractable to attack by direct brute force computation. Uh, chess is another, um, famous example. The number of chess positions, uh, we can't get a computer to fully explore.\n\nBut now we have AI, um, um, we have tools to explore this space, not with 100% guarantees of success, but with experiment, you know, so like, um, we can empirically solve chess now, for example. We have, we have very, very good AIs that, that can, you know, they don't explore every single position in the game tree, but they have found some very good approximation. Um, and people are using actually these chess engines to make, uh, to do experimental chess, um, that they're revisiting old chess theories about, oh, you know, when you do this type of opening, you know, this is a good, this is a good type of move, this is not, and they can use these chess engines to actually refine, in some cases, overturn, um, um, conventional wisdom about chess. And I do hope that, uh, that Mathematics will, will have a larger experimental component in the future, perhaps powered by AI. We'll, of course, talk about that. But in the case of chess, and there's a similar thing in Mathematics that I don't believe it's providing a kind of formal explanation of the different positions. It's just saying which position is better or not that you can intuit it as a human being, and then from that, we humans can construct a theory of the matter.\n\nYou've mentioned the Plato's cave allegory. Mhm. So in case people don't know, it's where people are observing shadows of reality, not reality itself, and they believe what they're observing to be reality. Is that in some sense what mathematicians and maybe all humans are doing is, um, looking at shadows of reality? Is it possible for us to truly access reality? Well, there are these three ontological things: there's actual reality, there's our observations, and our models. Um, and technically, they are distinct, and I think they will always be distinct. Um, but they can get closer, um, over time. Um, you know, so, um, and the process of getting closer often means that you, you have to discard your initial intuitions. Um, so, um, like astronomy provides great examples, you know, like, you know, like your initial model of the world is flat because it looks flat, you know, and, um, and it's, and it's big, you know, and the rest of the universe, the skies is not, you know, like the sun, for example, looks really tiny, um, and so you start off with a model which is actually really far from reality, um, but it fits kind of the observations that you have, um, you know, so, you know, so things look good, you know, but, but over time, as you make more and more observations, bring it closer to reality. Okay. Um, the model gets dragged along with it, and so over time, we had to realize that the earth was round, that it spins. It goes around the solar system. Solar system goes around the galaxy, and so on and so forth. And the guys universe is expanding, the expansion itself expanding, accelerating, and in fact, very recently, in this year. So this, uh, even the acceleration of the universe itself is this evidence that this non-constant, and, uh, the explanation behind why that is, it's catching up. Um, it's catching up. I mean, it's still, you know, the dark matter or dark energy, this, this kind of thing. We have, we have a model that sort of explains that, fits the data really well. It just has a few parameters that, um, you have to specify. Um, but so, you know, people say that's fudge factors, you know, with enough fudge factors, you can explain anything. Um, but, uh, the mathematical point of the model is that, um, you want to have fewer parameters in your model than data points in your observational set. So if you have a model with 10 parameters that explains 10, 10 observations, that is a completely useless model. It's what's called overfitted. But like, if you have a model with, you know, two parameters and it explains a trillion observations, which is basically, uh, so yeah, the, the, the dark matter model, I think, has like 14 parameters, and it explains petabytes of data, um, that, that, that the astronomers have. Um, you can think of a theory like one way to think about, um, physical math theory theory is it's a compression of the universe, um, and data compression. So, you know, you have these petabytes of observations, you'd like to compress it to a model which you can describe in five pages and specify a certain number of parameters, and if it can fit to reasonable accuracy, you know, almost all of your observations. I mean, the more compression that you make, the better your theory. In fact, one of the great surprises of our universe and of everything in it is that it's compressible at all. It's the unreasonable effectiveness of Mathematics. Yeah, Einstein had a quote like that. The, the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible, right? And not just comprehensible. You can do an equation like E=MC². There is actually a some mathematical possible explanation for that. Um, so there's this phenomenon in Mathematics called universality. So many complex systems at the macro scale are coming out of lots of tiny interactions at the macro scale, and normally, because of the common form of explosion, you would think that, uh, the macro scale equations must be like infinitely exponentially more complicated than the, the microscale ones, and they are, if you want to solve them completely exactly, like if you want to model, um, all the atoms in a box of air, that's like Avogadro's number is humongous, right? There's a huge number of particles if you actually have to track each one, it'll be ridiculous. This, but certain laws emerge at the microscopic scale that almost don't depend on what's going on at the micros scale or only depend on a very small number of parameters. So if you want to model a gas, um, of, you know, quintillion particles in a box, you just need to know its temperature and pressure and volume and a few parameters, like five or six, and it models almost everything you need to know about these 10 to the 23rd or whatever particles. Um, so we, we have, um, we, we don't understand universality anywhere near as we would like mathematically, but there are much simpler toy models where we do, um, have a good understanding of why universality occurs. Um, um, most basic one is the central limit theorem that explains why the bell curve shows up everywhere in nature, that so many things are distributed by what's called a Gaussian distribution, famous bell curve. There's now even a meme with this curve, and even the meme applies broadly universality to the meme. Yeah. Yes, you can go meta if you like. But there are many, many processes, for example, you can take lots and lots of independent, um, random variables and average them together, um, uh, in various ways. You take a simple average or more complicated average, and we can prove in various cases that these bell curves, these Gaussians emerge, and it is a satisfying, satisfying explanation. Um, sometimes they don't. Um, so, so if you have many different inputs and they're all correlated in some systemic way, then you can get something very far from a bow curve show up. Uh, and this is also important to know when this system fails. So universality is not a 100% reliable thing to rely on, that, um, um, the global financial crisis was a famous example of this. Uh, people thought that, uh, um, mortgage defaults, um, had this sort of, um, Gaussian type behavior, that, that if you, if you ask if a population of, of, of, uh, you know, 100,000 Americans with mortgages, ask what proportion of them would default on the mortgages. Um, if everything was decorated, it would be an asset bell curve, and, and like, you can, you can manage risk with options and derivatives and so forth, and, um, and it, there's a very beautiful theory, um, but if there are systemic shocks in the economy, uh, that can push everybody to default at the same time, that's very non-Gaussian behavior, um, and, uh, this wasn't fully accounted for in 2008.\n\nNow I think there's some more awareness that this is systemic risk is actually a much bigger issue, and, uh, just because the model is pretty, uh, and nice, uh, it may not match reality. Right. So, so the Mathematics of working out what models do is really important. Um, but, um, also the science of validating when the models fit reality and when they don't. Um, I mean, that you need both. Um, and but Mathematics can help because it, it can, for example, these central limit theorems, it tells you that if you have certain aums, like, like non-correlation, that if all the inputs were not correlated to each other, um, then you have this kind of behavior, things are fine. It, it tells you where to look for weaknesses in the model. So if you have a mathematical understanding of central limit theorem, and someone proposes use these Gaussian copy or whatever to model, um, default risk, um, if you're mathematically, um, trained, you would say, okay, but what if this systemic correlation between all your inputs, and so then, then you can ask the economists, you know, how, how, how much of a risk is that, um, and then you can, you can, you can go look for that. So there's always this, this, this synergy between science and Mathematics. A little bit on the topic of universality. Mhm.\nYou're known and celebrated for working across an incredible breadth of Mathematics, reminiscent of Hilbert a century ago. In fact, the great Fields Medal winning mathematician, Tim Gowers, has said that you are the closest thing we get to Hilbert.\nHe's a colleague of yours. Oh yeah. Good friend. But anyway, so you are known for this ability to go both deep and broad in Mathematics. So you're the perfect person to ask, do you think there are threads that connect all the disparate areas of Mathematics? Is there a kind of deep underlying structure, uh, to all of Mathematics? There's certainly a lot of connecting threads. Um, and a lot of the progress of Mathematics has can be represented by taking, by stories of two fields of Mathematics that were previously not connected and finding connections. Um, an ancient example is, um, geometry and number theory, you know. So, so in the times of the ancient Greeks, these were considered different subjects. Um, I mean, mathematicians worked on both. You know, you could work both on geometry, most famously, but also on numbers. Um, but they were not really considered related. Um, I mean, a little bit like, you know, you could say that that this length was five times this length because you could take five copies of this length and so forth. But it wasn't until Descartes who really realized that, who developed analytic geometry, that you can, you can parameterize the plane, a geometric object, by, um, by two real numbers. Every point can be, and so geometric problems can be turned into problems about numbers. Um, and the, the today, this feels almost trivial, like, like there's, there's, there's no content to this, like, of course, uh, you, you know, um, a plane is x and y, and because that's what we teach, and it's internalized. Um, but it was an important development that these, these two fields were unified. Um, and this process has just gone on throughout Mathematics over and over again. Algebra and geometry were separated, and now we have a student algebraic geometry that connects them, and over and over again, and that's certainly the type of Mathematics that, that I enjoy the most. So I think there's sort of different styles to being a mathematician. I think hedgehogs and fox, a fox knows many things a little bit, but a hedgehog knows one thing very, very well. Um, and in Mathematics, there's definitely both hedgehogs and foxes. Um, and then there's people who are kind of, uh, who can play both roles. Um, and I think like ideal collaboration between mathematicians involves a very, you need some diversity, like, um, a fox working with many hedgehogs or or vice versa. So yeah, but I identify mostly as a fox, certainly. I, I like, uh, arbitrage, somehow, you like, like, um, learning how one field works, learning the tricks of that field, and then going to another field which people don't think is related, but I can, I can adapt the tricks. So see the connections between the fields. Yeah. So there are other mathematicians who are far deeper than I am, like, who really, they're really hedgehogs. They, they know everything about one field, and they're much faster and, and, and more effective in that field. But I can, I can give them these extra tools. I mean, you said that you can be both the hedgehog and and the fox, depending on the context, depending on the collaboration. So what can you, if it's at all possible, speak to the difference between those two ways of thinking about a problem? Say you're encountering a new problem, you know, searching for the connections versus like very singular focus. I'm much more comfortable with, with the, uh, the, uh, the fox paradigm. Yeah. So, um, yeah, I, I like looking for analogies, narratives. Um, I, I spend a lot of time, if there's a result I see in one field, and I like the result, it's a cool result, but I don't like the proof, like it uses types of Mathematics that I'm not super familiar with. Um, I often try to reprove it myself using the tools that I favor. Um, often my proof is worse. Um, but, um, by the exercise of doing so, um, I can say, oh, now I can see what the other proof was trying to do. Um, and from that, I can get some understanding of the tools that are used in that field. So it's very exploratory, very doing crazy things in crazy fields, and like reinventing the wheel a lot. Yeah. Whereas the hedgehog style is, uh, I think much more scholarly, you know, you, you, you're very knowledge-based. You, you, you stay up to speed on like all the developments in this field. You, you know all the history. Um, you have a very good understanding of, of exactly the strengths and weaknesses of, of each particular, uh, technique. Um, yeah, uh, I think you, you rely a lot more on sort of calculation than sort of trying to find narratives. Um, so yeah, I mean, I can do that too, but, uh, there are other people who are extremely good at that. Let's step back and, uh, uh, maybe look at the, the a bit of a romanticized version of Mathematics. Mhm. So, uh, I think you've said that early on in your life, uh, math was more like a puzzle-solving activity when you were, uh, young. When did you first encounter a problem or proof where you realize math can have a kind of elegance and beauty to it?\nThat's a good question. Um, when I came to graduate school, uh, in Princeton, um,\n\n\nSo John Conway was there at the time.\nHe passed away a few years ago.\nBut uh, I remember one of the very first research talks I went to was a talk by Conway on what he called extreme proof.\nSo Conway had just had this this amazing way of thinking about all kinds of things in a way that you would normally think of.\nSo um, he thought of proofs themselves as occupying some sort of space, you know.\nSo, so um, if you want to prove something, let's say that there's infinitely many primes, okay, you avoid different proofs, but you could you could rank them in different axes like some proofs are elegant, some are long, some proofs are are um elementary and so forth.\nUm, and so there's this cloud.\nSo the space of all proofs itself has some sort of shape.\nUm, and so he was interested in in extreme points of this shape like out of all all these proofs what is one that is the shortest at the the extent of every everything else or or the most elementary or or whatever.\nUm, and so he gave some examples of well-known theorems and then he would give what he thought was was the extreme proof um in these different aspects.\nUm, and I I just found that really eye opening um that that um you know it's not just getting a proof for a result was interesting but but once you have that proof you know trying to to uh to optimize it in various ways.\nUm, that that proof um uh proofing itself had some craftsmanship to it.\nUm, it it certainly informed my writing style.\nUm, but you know like when you do your your math assignments and as undergraduate your homework and so forth, you you're sort of encouraged to just write down any proof that works, okay, and hand it in and get a get as long as it gets a tick mark, you you move on.\nUm, but if you want your your results to actually be influential and be read by people, um, it can't just be correct.\nIt should also um be a pleasure to read, you know, um motivated um be adaptable to to generalize to other um things.\nUm, it's the same in many other disciplines like like coding.\nIt's a there's a lot of analogies between math and coding.\nI like analogies if you haven't noticed.\nUm, but um, you know like you can code something spaghetti code that works for a certain task and it's quick and dirty and it works.\nBut uh there's lots of good principles for for um writing code well so that other people can use it build upon it and so on and has fewer bugs and whatever.\nUm, and there's similar things with mathemat mathematics.\nSo yeah the first of all there's so many beautiful things there and and is one of the great minds uh in mathematics ever and computer science.\nUh just even considering the space of proofs.\nYeah.\nAnd saying, \"Okay, what does this space look like and what are the extremes?\"\nUh, like you mentioned, coding as an analogy is interesting because there's also this activity called the code golf.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhich I also find beautiful and fun where people use different programming languages to try to write the shortest possible program that accomplishes a particular tasks.\nThen I believe there's even competitions on this.\nYeah.\nAnd uh it's also a nice way to stress test not just the sort of the programs or in this case the proofs but also the different languages maybe that's the different notation or whatever to use to to accomplish a different task.\nYeah, you learn a lot.\nI mean it may seem like a frivolous exercise but it can generate all these insights which if you didn't have this artificial um objective to to to pursue you might not see.\nWhat to you is the most beautiful or elegant equation in mathematics?\nI mean one of the things that people often look to in in beauty is the simplicity.\nSo if you look at E= MC², so when when a few concepts come together that's why the oiler identity is often considered uh the most beautiful equation in mathematics.\nDo you do you find beauty in that one and the oil identity?\nYeah.\nWell, as I said, I mean, what I find most appealing is is connections between different things that um so the if e^iπ= -1 um so yeah people oh uses all the fundamental constants okay that that's I mean that's cute um but but to me so the exponential function was interested by oil to measure exponential growth you know so compound interest or decay anything which is continuously growing continuously decreasing growth and decay or dilation or contraction is modeled by the exponential function.\nUm whereas pi uh comes around from circles and rotation right if you want to rotate a needle for example 180° you need to rotate by pi radians and i complex numbers represents the swing between imagine axis of a 90° rotation so a change in direction so the x function represents growth and decay in the direction where you really are um when you stick an i in the exponential it now it's it's instead of motion in the same direction as your current position it's the motion has right angles to composition.\nSo rotation um and then so e^iπ= -1 tells you that if you rotate for time pi you end up at the other direction.\nSo it unifies geometry through dilation and exponential growth or dynamics through this act of of complexification rotation by by i.\nSo it connects together all these tools mathematics.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nDynamic structure and complex and complex and um the complex numbers they all considered almost yeah they were all next door neighbors in mathematics because of this identity.\nDo do you think the thing you mentioned is cute the the the collision of notations from these disparate fields?\nUm, it's just a frivolous side effect or do you think there is legitimate like value in when the notation all the our old friends come together night?\nWell, it's it's it's confirmation that you have the right concepts.\nUm, so when you first study anything um you you have to measure things and give them names.\nUm, and initially sometimes your because your your model is again too far off from reality you give the wrong things the best names and you only find out later what's what's really important physicists can do this sometimes I mean but it turns out okay so actually with physics okay so E= MC² okay so one of the the big things was the E right so when when Aristotle first came up with his laws of of motion and then and then um Galileo or Newton and so forth you know they saw the things they could they could measure they could measure mass and acceleration and force and so forth and so Newtonian mechanics for example F= ma was the famous Newton second law of motion so those were the the primary objects so they gave them the central building in the theory it was only later after people started analyzing these equations that there always seemed to be these quantities that were conserved um so momentum and energy um uh and it's not obvious that things happen energy like it's not something you can directly measure the same way you can measure mass and and and velocity so forth but over time people realize is that this was actually a really fundamental concept.\nHamilton eventually in 19th century reformulated Newton's laws of physics into what's called Hamiltonian mechanics where the energy which is now called the Hamiltonian was the dominant object once you know how to measure the Hamiltonian of any system.\nYou can describe completely the dynamics like what happens to to all the states like it's um it it really was a central actor which was not obvious initially.\nUm, and this uh helped actually uh this change of perspective really helped when quantum mechanics came along.\nUh because um the early physicists who studied quantum mechanics, they had a lot of trouble trying to adapt their Newtonian thinking because everything was a particle and so forth to to to quantum mechanics, you know, because I think because it was a wave.\nIt just looked really really weird.\nUm like you ask what is the quantum version of F equals MA?\nAnd it's really really hard to to give an answer to that.\nUm, but it turns out that the Hamiltonian which was so um secretly behind the scenes in classical mechanics also is the key uh object in um um in quantum mechanics that there's there's also an object called Hamiltonian.\nIt's a different type of object.\nIt's what's called an operator rather than than a function.\nBut um and um but again once you specify it you specify the entire dynamics.\nSo there's something called Shingers equation that tells you exactly how quantum systems evolve once you have a Hamiltonian.\nSo side by side they look completely different objects you know like so one involves particles one involves waves and so forth but with this centrality you could start actually transferring a lot of intuition and facts from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.\nFor example, in classical mechanics, there's this thing called Noether's theorem.\nEvery time there's a symmetry in a physical system, there is a conservation law.\nSo the laws of physics are translation invariant.\nLike if I move 10 steps to the left, I experience the same laws of physics as if I was here.\nAnd that corresponds to conservation momentum.\nUm if I turn around by by some angle again, I experience the same laws of physics.\nThis corresponds to conservation angular momentum.\nIf I wait for 10 minutes, um I still have the same laws of physics.\nUm, so this time translation variance.\nthis corresponds to the low conservation of energy.\nUm, so there's this fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation.\nUm, and that's also true in quantum mechanics.\nEven though the equations are completely different, but because they're both coming from the Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian controls everything.\nUm, every time the Hamiltonian has a symmetry, the equations will will have a conservation law.\nUm, so it's it's it's it's once you have the right language, it actually makes things um a lot a lot cleaner.\nOne of the problems why we can't unify quantum mechanics and general relativity yet we haven't figured out what the fundamental objects are like for example we have to give up the notion of space and time being these almost Euclidean type spaces and there has to be um you know and you know we kind of know that at very tiny scales um there's going to be quite fluctuations of space space-time foam um and trying to to use Cartesian coord xyz is going to be it's it's just it's a non-starter but we don't know how to what to replace it with.\nUm, We don't actually have the mathematical um um concepts the analog Hamiltonian that sort of organized everything.\nDoes your gut say that there is a theory of everything.\nSo this is even possible to unify to find this language that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics?\nI believe so.\nI mean the history of physics has been out of unification much like mathematics um over the years.\nYou know electricity and magnetism were separate theories and then Maxwell unified them.\nyou know, Newton unified the the motions of the heavens with the motions on of objects on the earth and so forth.\nSo, it should happen.\nIt's just that the um u again to go back to this model of the observations and and theory.\nPart of our problem is that physics is a victim's own success that our two big theories of of of physics general relativity and quantum mechanics are so are so good now that together they cover 99.9% of sort of all the observations we can make.\nUm, and you have to like either go to extremely insane particle accelerations or or the early universe or or or things that are really hard to measure um in order to get any deviation from either of these two theories to the point where you can actually figure out how to how to combine them together.\nUm, but I have faith that we, you know, we've we've been doing this for centuries and we've made progress before.\nThere's no reason why we should stop.\nDo you think it will be a mathematician that develops uh theory of everything?\nWhat often happens is that when the physicists need uh um some of mathematics, there's often some precursor that the mathematicians um worked out earlier.\nSo when Einstein started realizing that space was curved, he went to some mathematician and asked is there is there some theory of curved space that the mathematicians already came up with that could be useful and he said oh yeah there's I think Reman came up with something um and so yeah Reman had developed Riemannian geometry um which is precisely you know a theory of spaces that occurred in various general ways which turned out to be almost exactly what was needed um for Einstein's theory.\nThis is going back to Dwick's unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.\nI think the theories that work well to explain the universe tend to also involve the same mathematical objects that work well to solve mathematical problems.\nUltimately, they're just sort of both ways of organizing data um in in in useful ways.\nIt just feels like you might need to go some weird land that's very hard to to intuit it like you know you have like string theory.\nYeah, that that's that was that was a leading candidate for many decades.\nIt's I think it's slowly falling out of fashion because it's it's not matching experiment.\nSo one of the big challenges of course like you said is experiment is very tough.\nYes.\nBecause of the how effective both theories are.\nBut the other is like just you know you're talking about you're not just deviating from spaceime.\nYou're going into like some crazy number of dimensions.\nYou're doing all kinds of weird stuff that to us we've gone so far from this flat earth that we started at like now we're just it's it's very hard to use our limited ape descendants of uh uh cognition to intuitit what that reality really is like.\nThis is why analogies are so important, you know.\nI mean, so yeah, the round earth is not intuitive because we're stuck on it, but you know, but you know, but round objects in general, we have pretty good intuition over uh and we have intuition about light works and so forth.\nAnd like it's it's actually a good exercise to actually work out how eclipses and phases of of the sun and the moon and so forth can be really easily explained by by by by round earth and round moon, you know, um and models.\nUm, and and you can just take you know a basketball and a golf ball and and and a light source and actually do these things yourself.\nUm, so the intuition is there.\nUm, but yeah you have to transfer it.\nThat is a big leap intellectually for us to go from flat to round earth because you know our life is mostly lived in flat land.\nYeah.\nTo load that information and we all like take it for granted.\nWe take so many things for granted because science has established a lot of evidence for this kind of thing.\nBut you know, we're on a round rock.\nYeah.\nFlying through space.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd it's a big leap and you have to take a chain of those leaps the more and more and more we progress.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo modern science is maybe again a victim of its own success is that you know in order to be more accurate it has to to move further and further away from your initial intuition.\nAnd so um for someone who hasn't gone through the whole process of science education it looks more more suspicious because of that.\nSo, you know, we we need we need more grounding.\nI mean,\n\n\nI think, um, I mean, you know, there are scientists who do excellent outreach.\nUm, but there's this, there this, there's, there, there's lots of science things that you can do at home.\nThere's lots of YouTube videos.\nI did a YouTube video recent of Grant Sanderson.\nWe talked about this earlier that, uh, you know, how the ancient Greeks were able to measure things like the distance to the moon, distance to the earth, and, you know, using techniques that you, you could also replicate yourself.\nUm, it doesn't all have to be like fancy space telescopes and and very intimidating mathematics.\nYeah, that's, uh, I highly recommend that.\nI believe you give a lecture and you also did an incredible video with Grant.\nIt's a beautiful experience to try to put yourself in the mind of a person from that time.\nMhm.\nShrouded in mystery, right?\nYou know, you're like on this planet, you don't know the shape of it, the size of it.\nYou see some stars, you see some, you see some things and you try to like localize yourself in this world.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd try to make some kind of general statements about distance to places.\nChange your perspective is really important.\nYou say travel broadens the mind.\nThis is intellectual travel.\nYou know, put yourself in the mind of the ancient Greeks or or some other person, some other time period.\nMake hypothesis, spherical cows, whatever, you know, speculate.\nUm, and you know, this is, this is what mathematicians do and somewhat artists do, actually.\nIt's just incredible that given the extreme constraints, you could still say very powerful things.\nThat's why it's inspiring looking back in history.\nHow much can be figured out, right, when you don't have much to figure out stuff like if you propose axioms, then the mathematics lets you follow those a to their conclusions and sometimes you can get quite a, quite a long way from, you know, initial hypothesis.\nIf we can stay in the land of the weird, you mentioned general relativity.\nYou've, uh, you've contributed, uh, to the mathematical understanding of Einstein's field equations.\nCan you explain this work and from a sort of mathematical standpoint, uh, what aspects of general relativity are intriguing to you, challenging to you?\nI have worked on some equations.\nThere's something called the, the wave maps equation or the sigma field model, which is not quite the equation of space-time gravity itself, but of certain fields that might exist on top of space-time.\nUm, so Einstein's equations of relativity just describes space and time itself.\nUm, but then there's other fields that live on top of that.\nThere's the electromagnetic field.\nUm, there's control fields, and there's this whole hierarchy of different equations of which Einstein is considered one of the most nonlinear and difficult.\nBut relatively low in the hierarchy was this thing called the wave maps equation.\nSo it's a wave which at any given point, uh, is fixed to be like on a sphere.\nUm, so, uh, I can think of a bunch of arrows in space and time and and the arrows pointing in in different directions.\nUm, but they propagate like waves.\nIf you wiggle an arrow, it was, it will propagate and make all the arrows move kind of like sheets of wheat in the wheat field.\nAnd I was interested in the global regularity problem again for this question, like, is it possible for, for all the energy here to collect at a point?\nSo the equation I considered was actually what's called a critical equation where it's actually the behavior at all scales is roughly the same.\nUm, and I was able barely to show that, um, that you couldn't actually force a scenario where all the energy concentrated at one point, that the energy had to disperse a little bit, and the moment it dis little bit, it, it would, it would stay regular.\nYeah.\nThis was back in 2000.\nThat was part of why I got interested in Navier–Stokes equations afterwards, actually.\nYeah.\nSo I developed some techniques to, um, solve that problem.\nSo part of it is, it was, um, this problem is really nonlinear, uh, because of the curvature of the sphere.\nUm, this, there was a certain nonlinear effect which was a non-perturbative effect.\nIt was when you sort of looked at it normally, it looked larger than the linear effects of the wave equation.\nUm, and so it was hard to, to keep things under control even when the energy was small.\nBut I developed what's called a gauge transformation.\nSo the equation is kind of like an evolution of of of heaves of wheat, and and they're all bending back and forth, and so there's a lot of motion.\nUm, but like if you imagine like stabilizing the flow by attaching little cameras at different points in space which are trying to move in a way that captures most of the motion, and under this stabilized flow, the flow becomes a lot more linear.\nI discovered a way to transform the, the equation to reduce the amount of of nonlinear effects.\nUm, and then I was able to, to, to solve the equation.\nI found this transformation while visiting my aunt in Australia, and I was trying to understand the dynamics of all these fields, and I, I couldn't do it with pen and paper.\nUm, and I had not enough facility of computers to do any computer simulations.\nSo I ended up closing my eyes, being on, on the floor, and just imagining myself to actually be this vector field and rolling around to try to, to see how to change coordinates in such a way that somehow things in all directions would behave in a reasonably linear fashion.\nAnd yeah, my aunt walked in on me while I was doing that, and she was asking what do I, what am I doing doing this?\nIt's complicated is the answer.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd you know, okay, fine.\nYou know, you're a young man.\nI don't ask questions.\nI, I, I have to ask about the, you know, um, how do you approach solving difficult problems?\nWhat if it's possible to go inside your mind when you're thinking?\nAre you visualizing in your mind the mathematical objects, symbols, maybe?\nWhat are you visualizing in your mind usually when you're thinking?\nUm, a lot of pen and paper.\nOne thing you pick up as a mathematician is sort of, uh, I call it cheating strategically.\nUm, so, uh, the, the beauty of mathematics is that is that you get to change the rule, change the problem, change the rules as you wish.\nThis you don't get to do this for any other field, like, you know, if, if you're an engineer and someone says build a bridge over this, this, you can't say I want to build this up bridge over here instead, or I want to build out of paper in instead of steel.\nUm, but a mathematician, you can, you can do whatever you want.\nUm, it's, it's like trying to solve a computer game where you can, there's unlimited cheat codes available.\nUh, and so, you know, you, you can, you can set this.\nSo there's a dimension that's too large.\nI'll set it to one.\nI'd solve the one dimension problem first.\nSo there's a main term and an error term.\nI'm going to make a spherical car assumption.\nI'll assume the error term is zero.\nAnd so the way you should solve these problems is is not in sort of this iron man mode where you make things maximally difficult.\nUm, but actually the way you should, you should approach any reasonable math problem is that you, if, if there are 10 things that are making your life difficult, find a version of the problem that turns off nine of the difficulties, but only keeps one of them.\nUm, and so that, um, and then that, just so you, you, you install nine cheats.\nOkay.\nYou install 10 cheats, then, then the game is trivial.\nYou saw nine cheats, you solve one problem that, that, that teaches you how, how to deal with that particular difficulty, and then you turn that one off and you turn someone else something else else on, and then you solve that one, and after you, you know how to solve the 10 problems, 10 difficulties separately, then you have to start merging them a few at a time.\nUm, I, I, as a kid, I watched a lot of these Hong Kong action movies.\nUm, it's from a culture.\nUm, and, uh, one thing is that every time there was a fight scene, you know, so maybe the, the hero will get swarmed by a hundred bad guy goons or whatever.\nBut it would always be choreographed so that he'd always be only fighting one person at a time, and then he would defeat that person and move on, and and because of that, he could, he could defeat all of them, right?\nBut whereas if they had fought a bit more intelligently and just swarmed the guy at once, uh, it would make for much, much worse, um, cinema, but, uh, but they would win.\nAre you usually, uh, pen and paper?\nAre you working, uh, with computer and latte?\nI'm mostly pen and paper, actually.\nSo in my office, I have four giant blackboards.\nUm, and sometimes I just have to write everything I know about the problem on the four blackboards and then sit my couch and just sort of see the whole thing.\nIs it all symbols like notation or is there some drawings?\nOh, there's a lot of drawing and a lot of bespoke doodles that that only make sense to me.\nUm, I mean, and and the beauty of blackboard is you erase and it's it's very organic thing.\nUm, I'm beginning to use more and more computers.\nUm, partly because AI makes it much easier to do simple coding things that you know, if I wanted to plot a function before, which is moderately complicated as some iteration or something, you know, I'd have to to remember how to set up a Python program and and and and how does a for loop work and and and debug it, and it would take two hours and so forth, and and now I can do it in 10, 15 minutes is much.\nUm, yeah, I'm using more and more, uh, computers to do simple explorations.\nLet's talk about AI a little bit if we could.\nSo, um, maybe a good entry point is just talking about computer-assisted proofs in general.\nCan you describe the Lean formal proof programming language and how it can help as a proof assistant, and maybe how, uh, it has helped you?\nSo, um, we is a computer language, um, much like sort of standard languages like Python and C and so forth, except that in most languages, the focus is on producing executable code.\nLines of code do things, you know, they, they flip bits or or they make a robot move or or they, they deliver you text on the internet or something.\nUm, so Lean is a language that can also do that.\nUh, it can also be run as a standard traditional language, but it can also produce certificates.\nSo a software like, like Python might do a computation and give you that the answer is seven.\nOkay, that does a sum of 3 + 4 is equal to 7, but, uh, Lean can produce not just the answer, but, but a proof that how it got the, the answer of seven as 3 + 4 and all the steps involved in, in, so it creates these more complicated objects, not just statements, but statements with proofs attached to them.\nUm, and, um, every line of code is just a way of piecing together previous statements to to create new ones.\nSo the idea is not new.\nThese things are, are called proof assistants, and so they provide languages for which you, you can create quite complicated, um, intricate mathematical proofs, and, um, they produce these certificates that that give a 100% um, guarantee that your arguments are correct if you trust the compiler of, but they made the compiler really small and you can, there are several different compilers available for the same for, um, can you give people some intuition about the, the difference between writing on pen and paper versus using Lean programming language?\nHow hard is it to formalize a statement?\nSo Lean, a lot of mathematicians were involved in the design of Lean.\nSo it's, it's designed so that individual lines of code resemble individual lines of mathematical argument, like you might want to introduce a variable.\nYou want want to prove a contradiction.\nYou, you, um, there are various standard things that you can do, and and it's, it's written so ideally it should like a one correspondence.\nIn practice, it isn't because Lean is like explaining a proof to an extremely pedantic colleague who will will point out, okay, did you really mean this, like, what, what happens if this is zero?\nOkay.\nUm, did you, how do you justify this?\nUm, so Lean has a lot of automation in it, um, to try to, to, uh, to be less annoying.\nUm, so for example, um, every mathematical object has to come with a type, like if I, if I talk about X is X a real number or, um, a natural number or or a function or something.\nUm, if you write things informally, um, it's up in terms of context, you say, you know, um, clearly x is equal to let x be the sum of y and z, and y and z were already real numbers, so x should also be a real number.\nUm, so Lean can do a lot of that, um, but every so often it, it says, wait a minute, can you tell me more about what this object is, uh, what type of object it is.\nYou see, you have to think more, um, at a philosophical level.\nWell, not just sort of computations you're doing, but sort of what each object actually, um, is in some sense.\nIs he using something like LLMs to do, uh, the type inference or like you mention the real number?\nIt's, it's using much more traditional what's called good old fashioned AI.\nYeah, you can represent all these things as trees, and there's always algorithm to match one tree to another tree.\nSo it's actually doable to figure out if something is a a real number or a natural number.\nYeah.\nEvery object sort of comes with a history of where it came from, and you can, you can kind of trace.\nOh, I see.\nUm, yeah, so it's, it's designed for reliability.\nSo, uh, modern AIs are not used in, it's a disjoint technology.\nPeople are beginning to use AIs on top of Lean.\nSo when a mathematician tries to program, um, a proof in Lean, um, often there's a step, okay, now I want to use, um, the fundamental thing of calculus, say, okay, to do the next step.\nSo the Lean developers have built this, this massive project called mathlib, a collection of tens of thousands of useful facts about mathematical objects, and somewhere in there is the fundamental theorem of calculus, but you need to find it.\nSo a lot the bottleneck now is actually lemma search, you know, there's a tool that that, you know, is in there somewhere and you need to find it.\nUm, and so you can, there are various search engines specialized for math loop that you can do, um, but there's now these large language models that you can say, um, I need the fundamental calculus at this point, and it say, okay, uh, um, uh, for example, um, when I code, I have GitHub copilot installed as a plugin to my IDE, and it scans my text and it sees what I need, says, you know, I might even type here, okay, now I need to use the final thing with calculus, okay, and then it might suggest, okay, try this, and like maybe 25% of the time it works exactly, and then another 10, 15% of the time it doesn't quite work, but it, it's close enough that I can say, oh, if I just change it here and here, it, it will work, and then like half the time it gives me complete rubbish.\nUm, so, but people are beginning to use AI a little bit on top, um, mostly on the level of basically fancy autocomplete, um, but, uh, you can type half of one line of a proof and it will find, it will tell you, yeah, but a fancy, especially fancy with the sort of capital letter F is, uh, uh, removes some of the friction mathematician might.\n\n\nfeel when they move\nfrom pen and paper to formalizing.\nYes.\nYeah.\nSo, right now I estimate that the effort, time, and effort taken to formalize a proof is about 10 times the amount taken to write it out.\nYeah.\nSo, it's doable, but uh, you don't, it's, it's annoying.\nBut doesn't it like kill the whole vibe of being a mathematician?\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, having a pedantic coworker, right?\nYeah.\nIf if that was the only aspect of it.\nOkay.\nBut um, okay, there, there are some, there's some case it was actually more pleasant to do things formally.\nSo there was a theorem I formalized, and there was a certain constant, 12, um, that that came out at um, in the final statement, and so this 12 had to be carried all through the proof, um, and like everything had to be checked that it goes all the, all these other numbers had to be consistent with this final number 12.\nAnd so we wrote a paper through this theorem with this number 12, and then a few weeks later someone said, \"Oh, we can actually improve this 12 to an 11 by reworking some of these steps.\"\nAnd when this happens with pen and paper, um, like every time you change a parameter, you have to check line by line that every single line of your proof still works, and there can be subtle things that you didn't quite realize.\nSome properties on the number 12 that you didn't even realize that you were taking advantage of.\nSo a proof can break down at a subtle place.\nUm, so we had formalized the proof with this constant 12, and then when this, this new paper came out, uh, we said, \"Okay, let's...\"\nSo that took like three weeks to formalize and and like 20 people to formalize this, this, this original proof.\nI said, \"Oh, but now, now let's, let's um, uh, uh, let's update the 12 to 11.\"\nAnd what you can do with Lean is that you just in your headline theorem, you, you change a 12 to 11.\nYou run the compiler, and like of the thousands of lines of code, you have 90% of them still work, and there's a couple that are lined in red.\nNow I can't justify this, these steps, but it, it immediately isolates which steps you need to change, but you can skip over everything which, which works just fine.\nUm, and if you program things correctly, um, with sort of good programming practices, most of your lines will not be read.\nUm, and there'll just be a few places where you, I mean, if if you don't hard code your constants, but you sort of, uh, um, um, you use smart tactics and so forth.\nYeah, you can localize um, the things you need to change to to a very small um, period of time.\nSo like within a day or two, we had updated our proof to this is very quick process.\nYou um, you make a change, there are 10 things now that don't work.\nFor each one you make a change, and now there's five more things that don't work, but but the process converges much more smoothly than with pen and paper.\nSo that's for writing.\nAre you able to read it?\nLike if somebody else sends a proof, are you able to, like, how, what's, what's the uh, versus paper?\nAnd yeah, so the proofs are longer, but each individual piece is easier to read.\nSo, um, if you take a math paper and you jump to page 27, and you look at paragraph 6, and you have a line of of of text of math, I often can't read it immediately because it assumes various definitions which I have to to go back and and maybe 10 pages earlier this was defined, and this um, the proof is scattered all over the place, and you basically are forced to read fairly sequentially.\nUm, it's, it's not like say a novel where like, you know, in theory you could, you open up a novel halfway through and start reading.\nThere's a lot of context.\nBut when a proven Lean, if you put your cursor on a line of code, every single object there, you can hover over it and it would, it would say what it is, where it came from, where stuff is justified.\nYou can trace things back much easier than sort of flipping through a math paper.\nSo, one thing that Lean really enables is actually collaborating on proofs at a really atomic scale that you really couldn't do in the past.\nSo traditionally with pen and paper, um, when you want to collaborate with another mathematician, um, either you do it as a blackboard where you um, you can really interact, but if you're doing it sort of by email or something, um, basically, yeah, you have to segment it, say, \"I'm going to, I'm going to finish section three, you do section four,\" but uh, you can't really sort of work on the same thing collaboratively at the same time.\nBut with Lean, you can be trying to formalize some portion of the proof and say, \"I got stuck at line 67 here.\nI need to prove this thing, but it, it doesn't quite work here is like the three lines of code I'm having trouble with.\"\nUm, but because all the context is there, someone else can say, \"Oh, okay.\nI recognize what you need to do.\nYou need to to apply this trick or this tool,\" and you can do extremely atomic level conversations.\nSo, because of Lean, I can collaborate, you know, with dozens of people across the world, most of whom I don't have, never met in person.\nUm, and I may not know actually even whether they're um, how reliable they are in in in their um, um, in in the process, but Lean gives me a certificate of of of trust.\nUm, so I can do, I can do trustless mathematics.\nSo there's so many interesting questions there's.\nSo one, you're you're known for being a great collaborator.\nSo what is the right way to approach solving a difficult problem in mathematics?\nWhen you're collaborating, are you doing a divide and conquer type of thing, or are you brains, are you focusing on a particular part and you're brainstorming?\nThere's always a brainstorming process first.\nYeah.\nSo math research projects sort of by their nature when you start, you don't really know how to do the problem.\nUm, it's not like an engineering project where somehow the theory has been established for decades and it's, it's implementation is the main difficulty.\nYou have to figure out even what is the right path.\nSo so this is what I said about about cheating first, you know, um, it's like um, to go back to the bridge building analogy, you know, so first assume you have infinite budget and and like unlimited amounts of of of workforce and so forth.\nNow can you can you build this bridge?\nOkay.\nOkay.\nNow have infinite budget but only finite workforce, right?\nNow can you do that and so forth.\nUm, so uh, I mean, of course, you know, no engineer can actually do this, like I say, they have fixed requirements.\nYes, there's this sort of jam sessions always at the beginning where you try all kinds of crazy things and you, you make all these assumptions that are unrealistic, but you plan to fix later, um, and you try to see if there's even some skeleton of an approach that might work, um, and then hopefully that breaks up the problem into smaller sub problems which you don't know how to do, but then you uh, you focus on on sub ones, and sometimes different collaborators are better at at working on on certain things.\nUm, so one of my themes I'm known for is a theorem of Ben Green, which called the Green-Tao theorem.\nUm, it's a statement that the primes contain arithmetic progressions of any length.\nSo it was a modification of this theoret.\nAnd the way we collaborated was that Ben had already proven a similar result for progressions of length three.\nUm, he showed that sets like the primes contain lots and lots of progressions of length three.\nUm, even and even um, subsets of the prime, certain subsets do, um, but his techniques only worked for um, for length three progressions.\nThey didn't work for longer progressions.\nUm, but I had these techniques coming from agotic theory, which is something that I had been playing with and and uh, I knew better than Ben at the time.\nUm, and so um, if I could justify certain randomness properties of some set relating to primes, like there, there's a certain technical condition which if I could have it, if if Ben could supply me this fact, I could, I could conclude the theorem, but I what I asked was a really difficult question in number theory, which um, he said, \"There's no way we can prove this.\"\nCan so he said, \"Can you prove your part of the theorem using a weaker hypothesis that I have a chance to prove it?\"\nAnd he proposed something which he could prove, but it was too weak for me, I can't use this.\nUm, so there's this, there was this conversation going back and forth.\nUm, so different cheats to.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI want to cheat more, he wants to cheat less.\nBut eventually we found a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a property which a he could prove and b I could use, um, and then we, we could prove our view, and um, yeah, so there's, there's a, there all kinds of dynamics, you know, I mean, it's every, every um, collaboration has a, has a, has some story, no two are the same.\nAnd then on on the flip side of that, like you mentioned with Lean programming, now that's almost like a different story because you can do, you can create, I think you've mentioned a kind of a blueprint, right, for a problem, and then you can really do a divide and conquer with Lean where you're working on separate parts, right, and they're using the computer system proof checker essentially to make sure that everything is correct along the way.\nYeah.\nSo it makes everything compatible and uh, yeah, and trustable.\nUm, yeah, so currently only a few mathematical projects can be cut up in this way at the current state of the art.\nMost of the Lean activity is on formalizing boos that have already been proven by humans.\nA math paper basically is a boop, a blueprint in a sense.\nIt is taking a a difficult statement like big theorem and breaking up into 100 little lemmas, um, but often not all written with enough detail that each one can be sort of directly formalized.\nA blueprint is like a really pedantically written version of a paper where every step is explained as to as much detail as as as possible and trying to make each step kind of self-contained, um, and or depending on only a very specific number of of previous statements that been proven so that each node of this blueprint graph that gets generated can be tackled independently of of the others, and you don't even need to know how the whole thing works.\nUm, so it's like a modern supply chain, you know, like if you want to create an iPhone or or some other complicated object, um, no one person can can build up um, a single object, but you can a specialist who who just if they're given some widgets from some other company, they can combine them together to form a slightly bigger widget.\nI think that's a really exciting possibility because you can have, if you can find problems that could be broken down this way, then you can have, you know, thousands of contributors, right, distributed.\nSo I told you before about the split between theoretical and experimental mathematics, and right now most mathematics is theoretical, and when you type it, it's experimental.\nI think the platform that Lean and and other software tools so um, GitHub and things like that, um, allow, they will allow experimental mathematics to be to scale up um, to a much greater degree than we can do now.\nSo right now, if you want to um, um, do any mathematical exploration of some mathematical pattern or something, you need some code to write out the pattern, and I mean, sometimes there are some computer algebra packages that help, but often it's just one mathematician coding lots and lots of Python or whatever, and because coding is such an errorprone activity, it's not practical to allow other people to collaborate with you on writing modules for your code because if one of the modules has a bug in it, the whole thing is unreliable.\nUm, so it's these are uh, so you get these bespoke uh, spaghetti code that written by not, not professional programmers, but by mathematicians, you know, and they're clunky and and and slow, and um, and so because of that, it's it's hard to to really massproduce experimental results, um, but um, yeah, but I think with Lean, I mean, so I'm already starting some projects where we are not just experimenting with data, but experimenting with proofs.\nSo I have this project called the equation theories project.\nBasically, we generated about 22 million little problems in abstract algebra.\nMaybe should back up and tell you what what the project is.\nOkay.\nSo abstract algebra studies operations like multiplication and addition and the abstract properties.\nOkay.\nSo multiplication, for example, is commutive.\nX * Y is always Y * X, at least for numbers.\nUm, and it's also associative.\nX * Y * Z is the same as X * Y * Z.\nUm, so um, these operations obey some laws that don't obey others.\nFor example, x * x is not always equal to x.\nSo that law is not always true.\nSo given any any operation, it obeys some laws and not others.\nUm, and so we generated about 4,000 of these possible laws of algebra that certain operations can satisfy.\nAnd our question is which laws imply which other ones?\nUm, so for example, does commutivity imply associativity?\nAnd the answer is no, because it turns out you can describe an operation which obeys the commitive law but doesn't obey the associative law.\nSo by producing an example, you can, you can show that commitivity does not imply associativity, but some other laws do imply other laws by substitution and so forth, and you can write down some some algebraic proof.\nSo we look at all the pairs between these 4,000 laws and this 22 million of these pairs, and for each pair, we ask, does this law imply this um, law?\nIf so, give a, give u, give a proof.\nIf not, give a counter example.\nMhm.\nUm, so 22 million problems, each one of which you could give to like an undergraduate algebra student, and they had a decent chance of solving the problem.\nAlthough there are a few of these 22 million, there like 100 or so that are really quite hard.\nOkay.\nBut a lot are easy, and the project was just to to work out to determine the entire graph, like, like which ones imply which other ones.\nThat's an incredible project by the way.\nSuch a good idea.\nSuch a good test of the very thing we've been talking about at a scale that's remarkable.\nYeah.\nSo it would not have been feasible.\nYeah, I mean, the state-of-the-art in the literature was like, you know, 15 equations and sort of how they apply.\nThat's sort of at the limit of what a human repentant paper can do.\nSo, so you need to scale it up.\nSo, you need to crowdsource, but you also need to\n\n\nTrust.\nAll the, um, I mean, no one person can check 22 million of these proofs.\nYou needed to be computerized, and so it only became possible with Lean.\nUm, we were hoping to use a lot of AI as well.\nUm, so the project is almost complete.\nUm, so of these 22 million, all but two had been settled.\nUm, wow, and, uh, well, actually, and of those two, we have a pen and paper proof of the two, uh, and we, we're formalizing it.\nIn fact, I was this morning, I was working on finishing it.\nUm, so we're almost done on this.\nUm, incredible is, yeah, fantastic.\nHow many people were able to get about 50, um, which in Mathematics is, is considered a huge number.\nIt's a huge number.\nThat's crazy.\nYeah.\nSo we kind of have a paper with 50 authors, uh, and a big appendix of who contribute to what.\nHere's an interesting question.\nNow, to maybe speak even more generally about it, when you have this pool of people, is there a way to, uh, organize the contributions by level of expertise of the people of the contributors?\nNow, okay, uh, I'm asking you a lot of pthead questions here, but I, I'm imagining a bunch of humans and maybe in the future some AIs.\nCan there be like an ELO rating type of situation where like a gamification of this?\nThe beauty of, of these Lean projects is, is that automatically you get all this data, you know, so like, like everything has to be uploaded for this GitHub, and GitHub tracks who contributed what.\nUm, so you could generate statistics from at any, at any later point in time.\nYou can say, oh, this person contributed this many, this many lines of code or whatever.\nI mean, these are very crude metrics.\nUm, I would, I would definitely not want this to become like, you know, part of your tenure review or something.\nUh, um, but, um, I mean, I think already in, in, in enterprise computing, right, people do use some of these metrics as part of, of the assessment of, of performance of a, of an employee.\nUm, again, this is a direction which is a bit scary for academics to go down.\nWe, we don't like metrics so much, and yet academics use metrics, they just use old ones.\nNumber of papers.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's true.\nIt's true that, yeah.\nI mean, um, it feels like this is a metric, while flawed, is, is going in the more in the right direction.\nRight.\nYeah.\nIt's an interesting, at least it's a very interesting metric.\nYeah.\nI think it's interesting to study.\nI mean, I, I think you can, you can do studies of, of whether these are better predictors.\nUm, there's this problem called Goodhart's law.\nIf a statistic is actually used to incentivize performance, it becomes gained.\nUm, and then it is no longer a useful measure.\nOh, humans always.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI know.\nIt's rational.\nSo what we've done for this project is, is self-report.\nSo, um, there are actually standard categories, um, from the sciences of what types of contributions people give.\nSo there's, there's concept and validation and resources and, and, and coding and so forth.\nUm, so we, we, we, there's a standard list of troll or so categories.\nUm, and we just ask each contributor to, there's a big matrix of all the, of all the authors in all the categories, just to tick the boxes where they think that they contributed.\nUm, and just give a rough idea, you know, like, oh, so you did some coding and, and, uh, and you provided some compute, but you didn't do any of the pen and paper verification or whatever.\nAnd I think that that works out.\nTraditionally, mathematicians just order alphabetically by surname.\nSo we don't have this tradition as in the sciences of, you know, lead author and second author and so forth, like which we're proud of, you know, we make all the authors equal status, but it doesn't quite scale to this size.\nSo a decade ago, I was involved in these things called Polymath projects.\nIt was the crowd-sourcing Mathematics, but without the Lean component, so it was limited by you needed a human moderator to actually check that all the contributions coming in were actually valid, and, and this was a huge bottleneck actually.\nUm, but still, we had projects that were, you know, 10 author or so.\nBut we had decided at the time, um, not to try to decide who did what, um, but to have a single pseudonym.\nSo we created this fictional character called DHJ Polymath in the spirit of Bourbaki.\nBourbaki is, is the pseudonym for a famous group of mathematicians in the 20th century.\nBut, um, and so the paper was authored under the pseudonym.\nSo none of us got the author credit.\nUm, this actually turned out to be not so great for a couple of reasons.\nSo, so one is that if you actually wanted to be considered for tenure or whatever, you could not use this paper in your, uh, uh, as your submitted as one of your publications because it wasn't, you didn't have the formal author credit.\nUm, um, but the other thing that we've recognized much later is that when people referred to these projects, they naturally refer to the most famous person who was involved in the project.\nOh, so this was Tim Gowers' project.\nThis was Terence Tao's project and not mention the other 19 or whatever people that were involved.\nYeah.\nSo we're trying something different this time around where we have everyone's an author.\nUm, but we will have an appendix with this matrix, and we'll see how that works.\nI mean, uh, so both projects are incredible, just the fact that you're involved in such huge collaborations.\nBut I think I saw a talk from Kevin Buzzard about, uh, the Lean programming language just a few years ago, and he was saying that, uh, this might be the future of Mathematics.\nAnd so it's also exciting that you're embracing, uh, one of the greatest mathematicians in the world embracing this what seems like the paving of the future of Mathematics.\nUm, so I have to ask you here about the integration of AI into this whole process.\nSo DeepMind's AlphaProof was trained using reinforcement learning on both failed and successful formal Lean proofs of IMO problems.\nSo this is sort of high-level high school, oh, very high level, yes, very high level high school level Mathematics problems.\nWhat do you think about the system, and maybe what is the gap between this system that is able to prove the high school level problems, uh, versus graduate level, uh, problems?\nYeah, the difficulty increases exponentially with the number of steps involved in the proof.\nIt's a commentatorial explosion, right?\nSo the thing with large language models is, is that they make mistakes.\nAnd so if a proof has got 20 steps and your model has a 10% failure rate, um, at each step, um, of, of going in the wrong direction, like, uh, it's just extremely unlikely to actually, um, reach the end.\nActually, uh, just to take a small tangent here, is how hard is the problem of mapping from natural language to the formal program?\nOh yeah, it's extremely hard actually.\nUm, natural language, you know, it's very fault tolerant.\nUm, like you can make a few minor grammatical errors, and a speaker in the second language can get some idea of what you're saying.\nUm, yeah, but, but formal language, yeah, you, if you get one little thing wrong, um, like the whole thing is, is, is nonsense.\nUm, even formal to formal is, is, is very hard.\nThere, there are different incompatible, um, uh, proofist languages.\nUh, there's Lean, but also Coq and Isabelle and so forth, and actually even converting from a formal language to formal language, um, is, is an unsolved, basically unsolved problem.\nThat is fascinating.\nOkay.\nSo, uh, but once you have an informal language, they're using, um, their RL train model.\nSo some something akin to AlphaZero that they used to go to, then try to come up with proofs.\nThey also have a model, I believe it's a separate model for geometric problems.\nSo what impresses you about the system, and, um, what do you think is the gap?\nYeah, we talked earlier about things that are amazing over time become kind of normalized.\nUm, so yeah, now somehow it's, oh, of course, geometry is a silver problem, right?\nThat's true, that's true.\nI mean, it's still beautiful, yeah, these are great works.\nIt shows what's possible.\nI mean, um, it's, it, um, the approach doesn't scale currently is, yeah, 3 days of Google's survey server time to solve one high school math problem.\nThis is not a scalable, uh, prospect.\nUm, especially with the exponential increase in, um, as, as the complexity, um, increases.\nWe should mention that they got a silver medal performance, the equivalent of, I mean, yeah, equivalent of a silver.\nSo first of all, they took way more time than was allotted, um, and they had this assistance where, where the humans started helped by, by formalizing, um, but, uh, also they, they're giving us those full marks for the solution, which I guess is formally verified.\nSo I guess that, that's, that's fair.\nUm, yeah, um, there, there are efforts, there was, there will be a proposal at some point to actually have an AI math olympiad where at the same time as the human contestants get the, the actual Olympia, um, problems, AIs will also be given the same problems with the same time period, um, and the outputs will have to be graded by the same judges, um, um, and which means that will have be written in natural language rather than formal language.\nOh, I hope that happens.\nI hope that this IMO, it happens.\nI hope, I hope next one, it won't happen this IMO, the performance is not good enough in, in the time period, and, and, uh, um, but there are smaller competitions, um, there are competitions where the, the answer is a, is a number rather than a long form proof, um, and that's, that's, um, AI are actually a lot better at, um, problems where there's a specific numerical answer, um, because it's, it's easy to, to, to, uh, to reinforce, do reinforcement learning on it.\nYeah, you got the right answer, you got the wrong answer.\nIt's, it's a very clear signal.\nBut a long form proof either has to be formal, and then the Lean can give it a thumbs up, thumbs down, or it's informal.\nUm, but then you need a human to grade it to tell, uh, and if you're trying to do billions of, of reinforcement learning, um, you know, um, um, runs, you're not, you can't hire enough humans to, uh, to grade those.\nUm, it's already hard enough for, for the last language to do reinforcement learning on, on just the regular text that that people get.\nBut now if you actually hire people not just give thumbs up, thumbs down, but actually check the, the output mathematically.\nYeah, that's too expensive.\nSo if we, uh, just explore this possible future, what, what, what is the thing that humans do that's most special in, um, in Mathematics?\nSo that you could see AI, uh, not cracking for a while.\nSo inventing new theories.\nSo coming up with new conjectures versus, uh, proving the conjectures, right?\nBuilding new abstractions, new representations, maybe, uh, an AI turn style with seeing new connections between disparate fields.\nIt's a good question.\nUm, I think the nature of what mathematicians do over time has changed a lot.\nUm, you know, um, so a thousand years ago, mathematicians had to compute the date of Easter, uh, and there was really complicated, uh, calculations, you know, but it's all automated, been automated for centuries, we don't need that anymore, you know, they used to navigate, to do spherical navigation, spherical trigonometry to navigate how to get from, from, um, the old world to the new, or very complicated calculations, again, we've been automated.\nUm, you know, even a lot of undergraduate Mathematics, even before AI, um, like Wolfram Alpha, for example.\nIt's not a language model, but it can solve a lot of undergraduate level math tasks.\nSo on the computational side, verifying routine things like having a problem and, um, and say, here's a problem in partial equations.\nCould you solve it using any of the 20 standard techniques?\nUm, and they say, yes, I've tried all 20, and here are the 100 different permutations, and, and here's my results.\nUm, and that type of thing, I think it will work very well.\nUm, type of scaling to once you solve one problem to to make the AI attack 100 adjacent problems.\nUm, the things that humans do still.\nYeah.\nSo, so where the AI really struggles right now, um, is knowing when it's made a wrong turn.\nUm, that it can say, &quot;Oh, I'm going to solve this problem.\nI'm going to split up this problem into, um, into these two cases.\nI'm going to try this technique.&quot;\nAnd, um, sometimes if you're lucky and it's a simple problem, it's the right technique, and you solve the problem, and sometimes it, it will get, it will have a problem, it would propose an approach which is just complete nonsense.\nUm, and but like it looks like a proof.\nUm, so this is one annoying thing about LM generated Mathematics.\nSo, um, yeah, we, we, we've had human generated Mathematics as very low quality, um, uh, like, you know, submissions, people who don't have the formal training and so forth.\nBut if a human proof is bad, you can tell it's bad pretty quickly.\nIt makes really basic mistakes.\nBut the AI generated proofs, they can look superficially flawless.\nUh, and that's partly because that's what the reinforcement learning has actually trained them to do, right?\nTo, to make things, to, to produce text that looks like, um, what is correct, which for many applications is good enough.\nUm, uh, so the errors often really subtle, and then when you spot them, they're really stupid.\nUm, like, you know, like no human would have actually made that mistake.\nYeah, it's actually really frustrating in the programming context because I, I program a lot, and yeah, when a human makes, when low-quality code, there's something called code smell, right?\nYou can, you can tell, you can tell immediately like, okay, there's signs.\nBut with, with a generated code of, and then you're right, eventually you find an obvious dumb thing that just looks like good code.\nYeah.\nSo, um, it's very tricky to and frustrating for some reason to.\nYeah, to work.\nYeah.\nSo the sense of smell.\nOkay, there you go.\nThis is, this is one thing that humans have.\nUm, and there's a metaphorical mathematical smell that, uh, this we, it's not clear how to get the AI to duplicate that eventually.\nUm, I mean, so the way, um, AlphaZero and so forth make progress on go and chess and so forth is, is in some sense they have developed a sense of smell for go and chess positions, you know, that that this position is good for white, is good for black.\nUm, they can't initiate why.\nUm, but just having that, that sense of smell lets them strategize.\nSo if AIs gain that ability to sort of a sense of viability of certain proof strategies, say, so, so you can say, I'm going to try to break up this problem into two small subtasks, and they can say, well, this looks good, two tasks look like they're simpler tasks than than your main task, and they still got a good chance of being true.\nUm, so this is good to try, or no, you've, you made the problem worse because each of the two sub problems is actually harder than your original problem, which is actually what normally happens if you try a random, uh, thing to try, normally actually, it's very easy to transform a problem into even harder problem.\nMhm.\nVery rarely do you problem transport a simpler problem.\nUm, yeah, so if they can pick up a sense of smell, then they could maybe start competing with human level mathematicians.\nSo, this is a hard question, but not competing, but collaborating.\nYeah.\n\n\nIf okay, hypothetical.\n\nIf I gave you an oracle that was able to do some aspect of what you do, and you could just collaborate with it.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhat would that oracle?\nWhat would you like that oracle to be able to do?\nWould you like it to uh maybe be a verifier?\nLike check Mhm.\nDo the codes like you're Yes.\nuh professor to this is the correct this is a good this is a promising fruitful direction.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOr or would you like it to uh generate possible proofs and then you see which one is the right one?\nUm or would you like it to maybe generate different representation different totally different ways of seeing this problem?\nYeah, I think all of the above.\nUm a lot of it is we don't know how to use these tools because it's a paradigm that is not um yeah we have not had in the past systems that are competent enough to understand complex instructions.\nMhm.\nUm that can work at massive scale but are also unreliable.\nUh like it's it's an interesting uh bit unreliable in subtle ways while we while providing sufficiently good output.\nUm it's a interesting combination.\nUm you know I mean you have you have like graduate students that you work with who kind of like this but not at scale um you know and and and we have previous software tools that um can work at scale but but very narrow um so we have to figure out how to how to use um I mean um so Tim C actually imagine he actually foresaw like in in 2000 he was envisioning what Mathematics would look like in in actually two and a half decades and that's funny yeah.\nHe he wrote in his in in his article like a a a hypothetical conversation between a mathematical assistant of the future um and himself you know trying to solve a problem and they would have have a conversation that sometimes the human would would propose an idea and the AI would would evaluate it and sometimes the AI would propose an idea um and u and sometimes that computation was required and a would just go and say okay I've checked the 100 cases needed here or um the first you you said this is true for all n I've checked for n up to 100 um and it looks good so far or hang on there's a problem at n equals 46 you so just a free form conversation where you don't know in advance where things are going to go but just based on on I think ideas get proposed on both sides calculations get proposed on both sides.\nI've had conversations with AI where I say okay let's we're going to collaborate to solve this math problem and it's a problem that I already know the solution to so I I try to prompt it okay so here's the problem I suggest using this tool and then you'll find this this lovely argument using a totally different tool which eventually goes you know, into the weeds and say, \"No, no, no.\nIf I using this, okay, and it might start using this and then it'll go back to the tool that I wanted to to before.\"\nUm, and like you have to keep railroading it um onto the path you want.\nAnd like I I could eventually force it to give the proof I wanted.\nUm, but it was like hurting cats um like and the amount of personal effort I had to take to not just sort of prompt it, but also check it output because it like a lot of what it looked like was going to work.\nI know there's a problem on online 17 and basically arguing with it.\nUm like it was more exhausting than doing it unassisted.\nSo like it but that's the current state of the art.\nI wonder if there's there's a phase shift that happens to where it's no longer feels like hurting cats and maybe it'll surprise us how quickly that comes.\nI I believe so.\nUm so in formalization I I mentioned before that it takes 10 times longer to formalize a proof than to write it by hand with these modern AI tools is and also just better tooling um the lean um um developers are doing a great job adding more and more features and making it user friendly.\nIt's going up from 9 to 8 to 7.\nOkay, no big deal.\nBut one day it will drop below one.\nUm and that's a phase shift because suddenly um it makes sense when you write a paper to to write it in lean first or through a conversation with AI who is generally um on the fly with you and it becomes natural for journals to accept you know maybe they'll offer expedite refereeing you know if if a paper has already been formalized in in lean um they'll just ask the referee to comment on on the significance of the results and how it connects to literature and not worry so much about the correctness.\nUm because that's been certified.\nUm papers are getting longer and longer in Mathematics and actually it's harder and harder to get good refereeing for um the really long ones unless they're really important.\nIt is actually an issue which and the formalization is coming in at just the right time for this to be and the easier and easier to guess because of the tooling and all the other factors then you're going to see much more like math lib will grow potentially exponentially.\nIt's a it's a it's a virtuous uh cycle.\nOkay.\nI mean one facet of this type that happened in the past was the adoption of LaTeX.\nSo so LaTeX is this type setting language that all mathematicians use now.\nSo in the past people use all kinds of word processors and typewriters and whatever but at some point LaTeX became easier to use than all other competitors and that people just switched you know within a few years like it was just a dramatic um pay shift.\nIt's a wild out there question, but what what year how far away are we from a uh AI system being a collaborator on a proof that wins the Fields Medal.\nSo that level.\nOkay.\nUm well, it depends on the level of collaboration.\nI mean, no, like it deserves to be to get the Fields Medal.\nlike so half and half already like I I can imagine if it was a winning paper having some AI systems in writing it you know uh just you know like the order complete alone is already I I use it like it speeds up my my own writing um um like you know you you can have a theorem you have a proof and the proof has three cases and I I write down the proof of the first case and the autocomplete just suggests all right now now here's how the proof of second case could work and like it was exactly correct that was great saved me like 5 10 minutes of uh of typing but in that case The AI system doesn't get the Fields medal.\nNo.\nUh are we talking 20 years, 50 years, 100 years?\nWhat do you think?\nOkay.\nSo I I gave a prediction in print.\nSo by 2026, which is now next year, um there will be math collaborations, you know, where the AI, so not Fields Medal winning, but but like actual research level math like published ideas that in part generated by AI.\nUm maybe not the ideas but at least uh some of the computations um um the verifications.\nYeah.\nI mean has that already happened?\nHas that already happened?\nYeah.\nThere are there are problems that were solved uh by a complicated process conversing with AI to propose things and the human goes and tries it and the contract doesn't work but it might propose a different idea.\nUm it it's it's hard to disentangle exactly.\nUm there are certainly math results which could only have been accomplished because there was a math method human mathematician and an AI involved.\nUm but it's hard to sort of disentangle credit.\nUm I mean these tools they they do not uh replicate all the skills needed to do Mathematics but they can replicate sort of some non-trivial percentage of them you know 30 40%.\nThey can fill in gaps.\nUm, you know, so, uh, coding is is is a is a good example, you know.\nSo, I I um um it's annoying for me to code in Python.\nI'm not I'm not a native um I'm not a professional um programmer.\nUm, but um the with AI that the the friction cost of of doing it is is is much reduced.\nUh so it it fills in that gap for me.\nUm AI is getting quite good at literature review.\nUm I mean there's still a problem with um hallucinating you know the references that don't exist.\nUm but this I think is a civil war problem if you train in the right way and so forth you can you can and um and verify um you know using the internet um you know um you should in a few years get to the point where you you have a a lemma that you need and uh we say has anyone proven this lemma before and it will do basically a fancy web search AI assistant and say yeah yeah there are these six papers where something similar has happened and I mean it you can ask it right now and it'll give you six papers of which maybe one is is legitimate and relevant.\nOne exists but is not relevant and four are hallucinated.\nUm it has a non-zero success rate right now, but uh it's there's so much garbage.\nUh so much the signal to noise ratio is so poor that it's it's um it's most helpful when you already somewhat know the literature.\nUm and you just need to be prompted to be reminded of a paper that was already subconsciously in your memory versus helping you discover new you were not even aware of but is the correct citation.\nYeah, that's yeah, that it can sometimes do.\nBut but when it does, it's it's buried in in a list of options for which the other that are bad.\nYeah.\nI mean, being able to automatically generate a related work section that is correct.\nYeah.\nThat's actually a beautiful thing that might be another phase shift because it assigns credit correctly.\nYeah.\nIt does.\nIt breaks you out of the silos of Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nthought, you know.\nYeah.\nNo, there's a big hump to overcome right now.\nI mean, it's it's like self-driving cars, you know.\nthe the safety margin has to be really high for it to be um uh to be feasible.\nSo yeah, so there's a last mile problem um with a lot of AI applications um that uh you know they can develop tools that work 20% 80% of the time but it's still not good enough um and in fact even worse than good some ways.\nI mean another way of asking the Fields metal question is what year do you think you'll wake up and be like real surprised?\nyou read the headline, the news of something happened that AI did like you know real breakthrough something it doesn't you know like feels metal even hypothesis it could be like really just this alpha zero moment with go that kind of thing right um yeah this this decade I can I can see it like making a conjecture between two unrelated two two things that people thought was unrelated oh interesting generating a conjecture that's a beautiful conjecture Yeah.\nAnd and actually has a real chance of being correct and and and meaningful and um because that's actually kind of doable I suppose but the word of the data is Yeah.\nNo, that would be truly amazing.\nUm the current models struggle a lot.\nI mean so um a version of this is um I mean the physicists have a dream of getting the AI to discover new new laws of Physics.\nUm you know the the dream is you just feed it all this data.\nOkay.\nand and this is here's a new patent that we didn't see before but it actually even struggle the current state of the art even struggles to discover old laws of Physics um from the data uh or if it does there's a big concern contamination that that it did it only because like somewhere in this training data it some new um you know boils law or whatever ball you're trying to to to reconstruct um part of it is that we don't have the right type of training data for this um yeah so for laws of Physics like we we don't have like a million different universes with a million infant laws of nature.\nUm and um like a lot of what we're missing in math is actually the negative space of so we have published things of things that people have been able to prove um and conjectures that ended up being verified um or maybe counter examples produced but um we don't have data on on things that were proposed and they're kind of a good thing to try but then people quickly realized that it was the wrong conjecture and then they they said oh but we we should actually change um our claim to modify it in this way to actually make it more plausible.\nUm there's this there's a trial and error process which is a real integral part of human mathematical discovery which we don't record cuz it's embarrassing.\nUh we make mistakes and and we only like to publish our wins.\nUm and uh the AI has no access to this data to train on.\nUm I sometimes joke that basically AI has to go through um grad school and actually you know go to grad courses, do the assignments, go to office hours, make mistakes, um get advice on how to correct the mistakes and learn from that.\nLet me uh ask you if I may about uh Grigori Perelman.\nMhm.\nYou mentioned that you try to be careful in your work and not let a problem completely consume you.\njust you really fall in love with the problem and really cannot rest until you solve it.\nBut you also hasted to add that sometimes this approach actually can be very successful.\nAn example you gave is Grigori Perelman who proved the point conjecture and did so by working alone for 7 years with basically little contact with the outside world.\nCan you explain this one millennial prize problem that's been solved point conjecture and maybe speak to the journey that Grigori Perelman's been on.\nAll right.\nSo it's it's a question about curb spaces.\nEarth is a good example.\nSo you can think of a 2D surface in being round could maybe be a Taurus with a hole in it or it can have many holes and there there are many different topologies up priori that that a surface could have.\num even if you assume that it's it's bounded and and uh and smooth and so forth.\nSo we have figured out how to classify surfaces as a first approximation everything is determined by something called the genus how many holes it has.\nSo a sphere has genus 0 a donut has genus one and so forth and one way you can tell these surfaces apart probably the sphere has which is called simply connected if you take any closed loop on the sphere like a big closed little rope you can contract it to a point and while staying on the surface and the sphere has this property but a taurus doesn't if on a taurus and you take a rope that goes around say the the outer diameter taurus there's no way it can't get through the hole there's no way to to contract it to a point so it turns out that the this the sphere is the only surface with this property of contractability up to like continuous deformationations of the sphere.\nSo um things that I want to call topologically um equivalent of the sphere.\nSo point asked the same question in higher dimensions.\nUm so this it becomes hard to visualize because um surface you can think of as embedded in three dimensions but a curved free space we don't have good intuition of 4D space to to to live and and there are also 3D spaces that can't even fit into\n\n\nFour dimensions. You need five or six or or higher. But anyway, uh mathematically, you can still pose this question that if you have a bounded three-dimensional space now, which is also has this simply connected property that every loop can be contracted. Can you turn it into a three-dimensional version of a sphere? And so this is the Poincaré conjecture. Weirdly, in higher dimensions, four and five, it was actually easier. So uh it was solved first in higher dimensions. There's somehow more room to do the deformation. It's easier to to move things around to a sphere. But three was really hard. So people tried many approaches. There's sort of commentary approaches where you chop up the the surface into little triangles or or tetrahedra and you you just try to argue based on how the faces interact each other. Um there were um algebraic approaches. There's there's various algebraic objects like things called the fundamental group that you can attach to these homology and cohomology and and and all these very fancy tools. Um they also didn't quite work. Um but Richard Hamilton's proposed a um partial differential equations approach. So you take um you take so the problem is that you so you have this object which is so secretly is a sphere, but it's given to you in a in a really um in in a weird way. So like like think of a ball that's been kind of crumpled up and twisted and it's not obvious that it's a ball. Um but um like if you if you have some sort of surface which is which is a deformed sphere, you could um you could for example think of it as a surface of a balloon. You could try to inflate it. You you blow it up. Um and naturally as you fill it with air, um the the wrinkles will sort of smooth out and it will turn into um um a nice round sphere. Um unless of course it was a torus or something, in which case it would get stuck at some point, like if you instead of torus, it would there'll be a point in the middle when the inner ring shrinks to zero, you get you get a singularity and you can't blow up any further. You can't flow any further. So he created this flow, which is called Richie flow, which is a way of taking an arbitrary surface or or space and smoothing it out to make it rounder and rounder to make it look like a sphere. And he wanted to show that that either uh this process would give you a sphere or it would create a singularity. Um actually very much like how PDEs either they have global regularity or finite blow, like basically it's almost exactly the same thing. It's all connected. Um and so and and he showed that for two dimensions, two-dimensional surfaces surfaces, um if you started simply connected, no singularities ever formed, um you never ran into trouble and you could flow and it would give you a sphere. And it so he he got a new proof of the two-dimensional result. But by the way, that's a beautiful explanation of reach flow and its application in this context. How difficult is the mathematics here? Like for the 2D case, is it? Yeah, these are quite sophisticated equations on par with the Einstein equations, slightly simpler, but um Um yeah, but but they were considered hard nonlinear equations to solve. Um and there's lots of special tricks in 2D that that that helped. But in 3D, the problem was that uh this equation was actually super critical, the same problems as Navier Stokes. As you blow up, um maybe the curvature could get constraint in finer, smaller, smaller regions and it um it looked more and more nonlinear and things just look worse and worse and there could be all kinds of singularities that showed up. Um some singularities, um like if there's these things called neck pinches where where the uh the surface sort of creates behaves like like a like a a barbell and it it pinches at a point. Some some singularities are simple enough that you can sort of see what to do next. You just make a snip and then you can turn one surface into two and evolve them separately. But there was there was a the prospect that there's some really nasty, like knotted singularities showed up that you you couldn't see how to um resolve in any way that you couldn't do any surgery to. Um so you need to classify all the singularities, like what are all the possible ways that things can go wrong. Um so what Perelman did was first of all, he he made the problem, he turned the problem a super critical problem to a critical problem. Um I said before about how um the invention of the of of energy, the Hamiltonian, like really clarified um Newtonian mechanics. Um uh so he introduced something which is now called Perelman's reduced volume and Perelman's entropy. He introduced new quantities, kind of like energy that look the same at every single scale and turned the problem into a critical one where the nonlinearities actually suddenly looked a lot less scary than they did before. Um and then he had to solve, he still had to analyze the singularities of this critical problem. Uh and that itself was a problem similar to this wake up thing I worked on actually, um so on the on the level of difficulty of that. So he managed to classify all the singularities of this problem and show how to apply surgery to each of these and through that was able to to resolve the Poincaré conjecture. Um quite like a lot of really ambitious steps. Um and like like nothing that a large language model today, for example, could I mean um at best uh I could imagine a model proposing this idea as one of hundreds of different things to try, um but the other 99 would be complete dead ends, but you'd only find out after months of work. He must have had some sense that this was the right track to pursue because you know, I it takes years to get them from A to B. So you've done like you said. Actually, you see even strictly mathematically, but more broadly in terms of the process, he's done similarly difficult things. What what can you infer from the process he was going through because he was doing it alone? What are some low points in a process like that? When you start to like you've mentioned hardship, like uh AI doesn't know when it's failing. What happens to you? You're sitting in your office when you realize the thing you did for the last few days, maybe weeks, weeks. Yeah. Is a failure? Well, for me, I switch to a different problem. Uh so, uh as said, I'm I'm a fox. I'm not a hedgehog. But you legitimately, that is a break that you can take is is to step away and look at a different problem. Yeah, you can modify the problem too. Um I mean um yeah, you can ask some cheat if if there's a specific thing that's blocking you, that this um some bad case keeps showing up that that that for which your tool doesn't work, you can just assume by fiat this this bad case doesn't occur. So you you do some magical thinking um for the but but but strategically okay for the point to see if the rest of the argument goes through. Um if there's multiple problems uh with with with your approach, then maybe you just give up, okay? But if this is the only problem that you know, but everything else checks out, then it's still worth fighting. Um so yeah, you have to do some some sort of forward reconnaissance sometimes to uh you know, and that is sometimes productive to assume like, okay, we'll figure it out. Oh yeah, yeah, eventually. Um Sometimes, actually, it's even productive to make mistakes. So um one of the I mean um there was a project which actually u we won some prizes for actually, four other people. Um we worked on this PD problem again, actually, this blow of regularity type problem. Um and it was considered very hard. Um Sean Bain, who was another Fields medalist, who worked on a special case of this, but he could not solve the general case. Um and we worked on this problem for two months and we found, we thought we solved it. We we had this this cute argument that if everything fit and we were excited, uh we were planning celebrationally um to all get together and have champagne or something. Um and we started writing it up. Um and one of one of us, not me actually, but another co-author said, \"Oh, um in this in this lemma here, we um we have to estimate these 13 terms that that show up in this expansion.\" And we estimate 12 of them, but in our notes, I can't find the estimation of the 13th. Can you can someone supply that? And I said, \"Sure, I'll look at this.\" And actually, yeah, we didn't cover, we completely omitted this term and this term turned out to be worse than the other 12 terms put together. Um in fact, we could not estimate this term. Um and we tried for a few more months and all different permutations and there was always this one thing, one term that we could not control. Um and so like um this was very frustrating. Um but because we had already invested months and months of effort into this already, um we stuck at this. We we tried increasingly desperate things and and crazy things. Um and after two is, we found an approach which was actually somewhat different by quite a bit from our initial um strategy, which did actually didn't generate these problematic terms and and and actually solve the problem. So we we solved a problem after 2 years, but if we hadn't had that initial false dawn of nearly solving a problem, we would have given up by month two or something and and worked on an easier problem. Um yeah, if we had known it would take two years, not sure we would have started the project. Yeah, sometimes actually having the incorrect, you know, it's like Columbus's incorrect version of measurement of the size of the earth. He thought he was going to find a new trade route to India, or at least that was how he sold it in his prospectus. I mean, it could be that he actually secretly knew, but just on the psychological element.\nDo you have like emotional or like self-doubt that just overwhelms you moments like that? You know, because this stuff, it feels like math is is so engrossing that like it can break you when you like invest so much yourself in the problem and then it turns out wrong. You could start to, in a similar way, chess has broken some people. Yeah. Um I I think different mathematicians have different levels of emotional investment in what they do. I mean, I think for some people it's just a job. You know, you you have a problem and if it doesn't work out, you you you go on the next one. Um yeah, so the fact that you can always move on to another problem, um it reduces the emotional connection. I mean, there are cases, you know, so there are certain problems that are what I call back diseases, where where where just latch on to that one problem and they spend years and years thinking about nothing but that one problem and um you know, maybe their career suffers and so forth, but okay, this big win, this will you know, once I once I finish this problem, I will make up for all the years of of of lost opportunity. But that's that's I mean, occasionally, occasionally it works. But I I um I really don't recommend it for people without the the right fortitude. Yeah. So I I've never been super invested in any one problem. Um one thing that helps is that we don't need to call our problems in advance. Uh um well, uh when we do grant proposals, we say we we will study this set of problems. But even then, we don't promise definitely by 5 years I will supply a proof of all these things. You know, or um you promise to make some progress or discover some interesting phenomena. Uh and maybe you don't solve the problem, but you find some related problem that you you can say something new about and that's that's a much more feasible task. But I'm sure for you there's problems like this. You have you have um made so much progress towards the hardest problems in the history of mathematics. So is there is there a problem that just haunts you? It sits there in the dark corners, you know, twin prime conjecture, Riemann hypothesis, global conjecture. Twin prime, that sounds again. So, I mean, the problem is like a Riemann hypothesis, those are so far out of reach. Why do you think so? Yeah. There's no even viable strate, like even if I activate all my all the cheats that I know of in this problem, like it there's just still no way to get me to be um like it's um I think it needs a breakthrough in another area of mathematics to happen first and for someone to recognize that it that would be a useful thing to transport into this problem. So we we should maybe step back for a little bit and just talk about prime numbers. Okay. So they're often referred to as the atoms of mathematics. Can you just speak to the structure that these uh atoms, the natural numbers, have two basic operations attached to them? Addition and multiplication. Um so if you want to generate the natural numbers, you can do one of two things. You can just start with one and add one to itself over and over again and that generates you the natural numbers. So additively, they're very easy to generate, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or you can take the prime, if you want to generate multiplicatively, you can take all the prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, 7, and multiply them all together. Um and together that gives you all the the natural numbers except maybe for one. So there these two separate ways of thinking about the natural numbers from an additive point of view and point of view. Um and separately, they're not so bad. Um so like any question about that only was addition is relatively easy to solve and any question that only was multiplication is easy to solve. Um but what has been frustrating is that you combine the two together. Um and suddenly you get this extremely rich. I mean, we know that there are statements in number theory that are actually as undecidable. There are certain polynomials in some number of variables. You know, is there a solution in the natural numbers and the answer depends on on an undecidable statement, um like like whether um the aims of of mathematics are consistent or not. Um but um yeah, but even this, the simplest problems that combine something multiplicative, such as the primes, with something additive, such as shifting by two, uh separately we understand both of them well, but if you ask when you shift the prime by two, do you can you get a how often can you get another prime? We it's been amazingly hard to relate the two, and we should say that the twin prime conjecture is just that it posits that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by do. Yes. Now the interesting thing is that you have been very successful at pushing forward the field in answering these complicated questions uh of this variety, like you mentioned the Green-Tao theorem. It proves that prime numbers contain arithmetic progressions of any length, right? Which is mind-blowing that you can prove something like that, right? Yeah. So, what we've realized because of this this this type of of research is that there's different patterns have different levels of uh indestructibility. Um so, so what makes the twin prime problem hard is that if you take all the primes in the world, you know, 3, 5, 7, 11, so forth, there are some twins in there. 11 and 13 is a twin prime pair of twin primes and so forth. But you could easily\n\n\nIf you wanted to redact the primes to get rid of to get rid of the um these twins, like the twins, they show up and they're infinitely many of them, but they're actually reasonably sparse.\nUm, not there, there's not, I mean, initially there's quite a few, but once you got to the millions, the trillions, they become rarer and rarer, and you could actually just, you know, if if someone was given access to the database of primes, you just edit out a a few primes here and there, they could make the twin prime conjecture false by just removing like 0.01% of the primes or something, um, just well-chosen to to um, to do this.\nAnd so you could present a censored database of the primes which passes all of the statistical tests of the primes.\nYou know that it it obeys things like the paralle theorem and and other texts about the primes, but doesn't contain any true primes anymore.\nUm, and this is a real obstacle for the twin prime conjecture.\nIt means that any proof strategy to actually find twin primes in the ecto primes must fail when applied to these slightly edited primes.\nAnd so it must be some very um subtle, delicate feature of the primes that you can't just get from like like aggregate statistical analysis.\nOkay.\nSo that's all, yeah, on the other hand, progressions has turned out to be much more robust.\nUm, like you can take the primes and you can eliminate 99% of the primes actually, you know, and you can take take any 99% you want, and uh, it turns out, and another thing we prove is that you still get arithmetic progressions.\nUm, arithmetic progressions are much, you know, they're like cockroaches of arbitrary length.\nYes, that's crazy.\nI mean, so so this for for people who don't know, arithmetic progressions is a sequence of numbers that differ by some fixed amount.\nYeah, but it's again like it's infinite monkey type phenomenon for any fixed length of your set.\nYou don't get arbitrary as progressions.\nYou only get quite short progressions.\nBut you're saying twin prime is not an infinite monkey phenomena.\nI mean, it's a very subtle monkey.\nIt's still an infinite monkey phenomenon.\nYeah.\nIf the primes were really genuinely random, if the primes were generated by monkeys, um, then yes, in fact, the infinite monkey theorem would, Oh, but you're saying that twin prime is it doesn't, you can't use the same tools, like the, it doesn't appear random almost.\nWell, we don't know.\nYeah, we, we, we believe the prior behave like a random set.\nAnd so the reason why we care about the twin prime conjecture is is a test case for whether we can genuinely confidently say with with 0% chance of error that the primes behave like a random set.\nOkay.\nRandom.\nYeah.\nRandom versions of the primes we know contain twins.\nUm, at least with with 100% probability or probably tending to 100% as you go out further and further.\nUm, yeah.\nSo the primes we believe that they're random.\nUm, the reason why arithmetic progressions are indestructible is that regardless of whether you looks random or looks um structured like periodic, in both cases, um, arithmetic regressions appear, but for different reasons.\nUm, and this is basically all the ways in which the there are many proofs of of these sort of arithmetic region epithems, and they're all proven by some sort of dichotomy where your set is either structured or random, and in both cases, you can say something, and then you put the two together.\nUm, but in twin primes, if if the primes are random, then you're happy, you win.\nBut if your primes are structured, they could be structured in in a specific way that eliminates the twin the twins.\nUh, and we can't rule out that one conspiracy, and yet you were able to make a, as I understand, progress on the Kupal version.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo, um, the one funny thing about conspiracies is that any one conspiracy theory is really hard to disprove, that you know, if if you believe the water is won by lizards, you say, here's some evidence that that it it's not run by lizards, well, that that evidence was planted by the lizards.\nYeah.\nRight.\nYou may have encountered this kind of phenomen.\nYeah.\nSo like, like, um, a pure, like, there's there's almost no way to um, definitively rule out a con, and the same is true in mathematics, that a con is to solely devote devoted to learning twin primes, you know, like it would, you have to also infiltrate other areas of mathematics to sort of, but but like it could be made consistent, at least as far as we know, but there's a weird phenomenon that you can make one um, one conspiracy rule out other conspiracies.\nSo you know, if the if the world is is run by lizardists, it can't also be run by Right.\nRight.\nSo one unreasonable thing is is is hard to dispute, but but more than one, there are there are tools.\nUm, so yeah, so for example, we we know there's infinitely many primes that are um, no two which are um, so there infinite pair of primes which differ by at most um, 246, actually, is is a is the current.\nSo there's like a bound, yes, on the right.\nSo like there's twin primes, this thing called cousin primes that differ by by four.\nUm, there's called sexy primes that differ by six.\nUh, what are sexy primes?\nPrimes that differ by six.\nThe name is much less, the concept is much less exciting than the name suggests.\nGot it.\nUm, so you can make a conspiracy rule out one of these, but like once you have like 50 of them, it turns out that you can't rule out all of them at once.\nIt just it requires too much energy somehow in this conspiracy space.\nHow do you do the bound part?\nHow do you, how do you develop a bound for the difference between the prize that okay, so, um, that there's an infinite number of, so it's ultimately based on what's called the pigeonhole principle.\nUm, so the pigeonhole principle, uh, it's a statement that if you have a number of pigeons and they all have to go into into pigeon holes, and you have more pigeons than pigeon holes, then one of the pigeon holes has to have at least two pigeons in, so there has to be two pigeons that that are close together.\nSo for instance, if you have 100 numbers and they all range from one to a thousand, um, two of them have to be at most 10 apart.\nMhm.\nBecause you can divide up the numbers one to 100 into 100 pigeon holes.\nLet's let's say you have, if you have 101 numbers, 100 one numbers, then two of them have to be distance less than 10 apart because two of them have to belong to the same pigeon hole.\nSo it's a basic um, basic feature of uh, a basic principle in mathematics.\nUm, so it doesn't quite work with the primes directly because the primes get sparer and sparser as you go out, that fewer and fewer numbers are prime.\nBut it turns out that there's a way to assign weights to the to to numbers, like um, so there are numbers that are kind of almost prime, but they're not, they, they don't have no factors at all other than themselves in one, but they have very few factors.\nUm, and it turns out that we understand almost primes a lot better than primes.\nUm, and so for example, it was known for a long time that there were twin almost primes.\nThis has been worked out.\nSo almost primes are something we can't understand.\nSo you can actually restrict attention to a a suitable set of almost primes and uh, whereas the primes are very sparse overall, relative to the almost primes actually are much less sparse.\nThey make um, you can set up a set of almost primes where the primes have density like say 1%.\nUm, and that gives you a shot at proving by applying some sort of original principle that that those pairs of primes are just only 100 100 apart.\nBut in order to with the twin pan conjecture, you need to get the density of primes inside the also size up to up to a first of 50%.\nUm, once you get up to 50%, you will get twin primes.\nBut uh, unfortunately, there are barriers.\nUm, we know that that no matter what kind of good set of almost primes you pick, the density primes can never get above 50%.\nIt's called the parity barrier.\nUm, and I would love to find, yes.\nSo one of my long-term dreams is to find a way to breach that barrier because it would open up not only the trip conjecture, the go back conjecture, and many other problems in number theory are currently blocked because our current techniques would require improve going beyond this theoretical um, parity barriers.\nIt's like it's like pulling past the speed of light.\nYeah.\nSo we just say a twin prime conjecture, one of the biggest problems in the history of mathematics, go by conjecture also, um, they feel like nextdoor neighbors.\nUh, has there been days when you felt you saw the path?\nOh, yeah.\nUm, um, yeah, uh, sometimes you try something and it it works super well.\nUm, you you again, again, the sense of methac smell, uh, we talked about earlier, uh, you learn from experience when things are going too well, because there are certain difficulties that you sort of have to encounter.\nUm, um, I think the way a colleague might put it is that, um, you know, like if if you are on the streets in New York and you put in a blindfold and you put in a car and and, um, after some hours, um, you the blindfold's off and you're in Beijing.\nUm, you know, I mean, that was too easy somehow, like, like there was no ocean being crossed.\nEven if you don't know exactly what how what what was done, you're suspecting that that something wasn't right.\nBut is that still in the back of your head to do you return to these to the prime, do you return to the prime numbers every once in a while to see?\nYeah, when I have nothing better to do, which is less and less tired, which is I get busy with so many things these days, but yeah, when I have free time and I'm not and I'm too frustrated to to work on my sort of real research projects, and I also don't want to do my administrative stuff, I don't want to do some errands for my family, um, I can play with these these things, um, for fun, uh, and usually you get nowhere.\nYeah, you have you have to learn to just say, okay, fine, once again, nothing happened, I I will move on.\nUm, yeah, very occasionally, one of these problems I actually solved, or sometimes as you say, you think you solved it, and then you're euphoric for maybe 15 minutes, and then you think I should check this because this is too easy, too good to be true, and it usually is.\nWhat's your gut say about when these problems would be uh solved, when prime and go back?\nPrime, I think we'll keep getting, keep getting more partial results.\nUm, it does need at least one, this parity barrier is is the biggest remaining obstacle.\nUm, there are simpler versions of the conjecture where we are getting really close.\nUm, so I think we will in 10 years, we will have many more much closer results.\nMay not have the whole thing.\nUm, yeah, so trens is somewhat close, reman hypothesis, I have no, I mean, it has to happen by accident, I think.\nSo the reman hypothesis is a kind of more general conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers, right?\nYeah, it's it's states are sort of viewed multiplicatively, like for questions only involving multiplication, no addition, the primes really do behave as randomly as as you could hope.\nSo there's a phenomenon in probability called square root cancellation that um, you know, like if you want to poll, say America upon on some issue, um, and you you ask one or two voters and you may have sampled a bad sample, and then you get you get a really imprecise um measurement of of the full average, but if you sample more and more people, the accuracy gets better and better, and it actually improves like the square root of the number of people you you sample.\nSo yeah, if you sample a thousand people, you can get like a 2, 3% margin of error.\nSo in the same sense, if you measure the primes in a certain multiplicative sense, there's a certain type of statistic you can measure, and it's called the reman's data function, and it fluctuates up and down, but in some sense, um, as you keep averaging more and more, if you sample and more and more, the fluctuation should go down as if they were random, and there's a very precise way to quantify that, and the reman hypothesis is a very elegant way that captures this, but um, as with many others in mathematics, we have very few tools to show that something really genuinely behaves like really random.\nAnd this is actually not just a little bit random, but it's it's asking that it behaves as random as it actually random set, this this square root cancellation, and we know actually, because of things related to the parity problem, actually, that most of us usual techniques cannot hope to settle this question.\nUm, the proof has to come out of left field.\nUm, yeah, but uh, what that is, yeah, no one has any serious proposal.\nUm, yeah, and and there's there's various ways to sort of, as I said, you can modify the primes a little bit and you can destroy the human hypothesis.\nUm, so like it has to be very delicate.\nYou can't apply something that has huge margins of error.\nIt has to just barely work.\nUm, and like, um, there's like all these pits pitfalls that you have like dodge very adeptly.\nThe prime numbers are just fascinating.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhat, what to you is um, most mysterious about the prime numbers?\nSo that's a good question.\nSo like, conjecturally, we have a good model of them.\nI mean, like, as I said, I mean, they have certain patterns, like the primes are usually odd, for instance, but apart from this of obvious patterns, they behave very randomly, and just assuming that they behave, so there's something called the crema random model of the primes that that after a certain point, primes just behave like a random set.\nUm, and there's various slight modifications this model, but this has been a very good model.\nIt matches the numeric.\nIt tells us what to predict.\nLike I can tell you with complete certainty the truth is true.\nUh, the random model gives overwhelming odds it is true.\nI just can't prove it.\nMost of our mathematics is optimized for solving things with patterns in them.\nUm, and the primes have this anti-attern, um, as do almost everything really.\nBut we can't prove that.\nYeah.\nI guess it's not mysterious that the prize be kind of random because there no reason for them to be um, uh, to have any kind of secret pattern, but what is mysterious is what is the mechanism that really forces the randomness to happen.\nUh, and this is just absent.\nAnother incredibly surprisingly difficult problem is the colots's conjecture.\nOh, yes.\nSimple to state, beautiful to visualize in its simplicity, and yet extremely uh, difficult to solve, and yet you have been able to make progress.\nUh, Paular said about the coloss conjecture that mathematics may not be ready for such problems.\nOthers have stated that it is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach, this is in 2010, out of reach of present-day mathematics, and yet you have made some progress.\nWhy is it so difficult to make?\nCan you actually even explain what it is?\nOh, yeah.\nSo, it's it's it's a problem that you can explain.\nUm, yeah, it um, it helps with some um, visual aids, but yeah.\n\n\n, so you take any natural number like, say, 13. And you apply the following procedure to it. So, if it's even, you divide it by two, and if it's odd, you multiply by three and add one. So, even numbers get smaller, odd numbers get bigger. So, 13 will become 40 because 13 * 3 is 39. Add one, you get 40. So, it's a simple process for odd numbers and even numbers. They're both very easy operations. And then you put it together. It's still reasonably simple. Um, but then you ask what happens when you iterate it. You take the output that you just got and feed it back in. So, 13 becomes 40. 40 is now even, divide by 2 is 20. 20 is still even, divide by 10, 2, 10, 5, and then 5 * 3 + 1 is 16. And then 8, 4, 2, 1. So, uh, and then from 1 it goes 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1. It cycles forever. So this sequence I just described, um, yeah, 13, 40, 20, 10, so these are also called hailstone sequences because there's an oversimplified model of hailstone formation, yeah, which is not actually quite correct, but it's somehow taught to high school students as a first approximation is that, um, like a little nugget of ice gets, gets an ice crystal forms in a cloud, and it, it goes up and down because of the wind, and sometimes when it's cold, it gets, acquires a bit more mass, and maybe it melts a little bit, and this process of going up, down creates this s of partially melted ice, which event hell stone, and eventually it falls out the earth. So the conjecture is that no matter how high you start up, like you take a number which is in the millions or billions, you go this process that that goes up if you're odd and down if you're even, eventually, um, goes down to to earth all the time, no matter where you start with this very simple algorithm, you end up at one, and you might climb for a while, right? Yeah, so yeah, if you plot it, um, these sequences, they look like Brownian motion, um, they look like the stock market, you know, they just go up and down in a, in a seemingly random pattern, and in Usually that's what happens, that that if you plug in a random number, you can actually prove at least initially that it would look like, um, random walk. Um, and that's actually a random walk with a downward drift. Um, it's like if you're always gambling on, on roulette at at the casino with odds slightly weighted against you. So sometimes you you win, sometimes you lose, but over in the long run you lose a bit more than you win. Um, and so normally your wallet will hit, will go to zero, um, if you just keep playing over and over again. So statistically it makes sense. Yes. So, so the result that I I proved, roughly speaking, such that that statistically, like 99% of all inputs would, would drift down to, maybe not all the way to one, but to be much, much smaller than what you started. So, it's it's like if I told you that if you go to a casino, most of the time you end up, if you keep playing for long enough, you end up with a smaller amount in your wallet than when you started. That's kind of like the what the result that I proved. So why is that result, like, can you continue down that thread to prove the full conjecture? Well, the problem is that, um, my I I used arguments from probability theory, um, and there's always this exceptional event. So you know, so in probability we have this, this law of large numbers, um, which tells you things like if you play a casino with a, um, a game at a casino with a losing, um, expectation over time, you are guaranteed or almost surely, with probably probability as close to 100% as you wish, you're guaranteed to lose money. But there's always this exceptional outlier. Like it is mathematically possible that even in when the game is is the odds are not in your favor, you could just keep winning slightly more often than you lose. Very much like how in Navier–Stokes equations there could be, you know, um, most of the time, um, your waves can disperse. There could be just one outlier choice of initial conditions that would lead you to blow up. And there could be one outlier choice of, um, um, special number that they stick in that shoots off infinity while all other numbers crash to earth, uh, crash to one. Um, in fact, um, there's some mathematicians, um, who Alex Kovvich, for instance, who've proposed that, um, that actually, um, these collat, uh, iterations are like the similar automator, um, actually if you look at what they happen on in binary, they do actually look a little bit like, like these Game of Life type patterns. Um, and in an analogy to how the Game of Life can create these, these massive, like self-plicating objects and so forth, possibly you could create some sort of heavier than air flying machine, a number which is actually encoding this machine, which is just whose job it is is to encode is to create a version of itself which, which is larger, heavier than air machine encoded in a number that flies forever. Yeah. So Conway in fact worked on worked on this problem as well. Oh, wow. So Conway, so similar in fact, that was one of inspirations for the Navier–Stokes project that Conway studied generalizations of the collapse problem where instead of multiplying by three and adding one or dividing by two, you have a more complicated branch, but but instead of having two cases, maybe you have 17 cases, and then you go up and down, and he showed that once your iteration gets complicated enough, you can actually encode Turing machines, and you can actually make these problems undecidable and and do things like this. In fact, he invented a programming language for uh, these kind of fractional linear transformations. He called a factrat as a play on forrat. Uh, and he showed that that you could, um, you can program it was too incomplete. You could, you could, uh, um, you could make a program that if if your number you insert in was encoded as a prime, it would sink to zero. It would go down, otherwise it would go up, uh, and things like that. Um, so the general class of problems is is really uh, as complicated as all of Mathematics. Some of the mystery of the cellular automa that we talked about, uh, having a fra mathematical framework to say anything about cellular automa, maybe the same kind of framework is required, yeah, injecture, yeah, if you want to do it not statistically, but you really want 100% of all inputs to to fall to earth, yeah. So what might be feasible is is statistically 99%, you know, go to one, but like everything, yeah, that looks hard. What would you say is out of these within reach famous problems is the hardest problem we have today? Is there a reman hypothesis? We want is up there. Um, P = NP is a good one because like, uh, that's that's a meta problem, like if you solve that in the, um, in the positive sense, that you can find a P = NP algorithm, that potentially this solves a lot of other problems as well, and we should mention some of the conjectures we've been talking about. You know, a lot of stuff is built on top of them. Now there's ripple effects. P = NP has more ripple effects than basically any other, right? If the reman hypothesis is disproven, um, that would be a big mental shock to the number theorist, uh, but it would have follow on effects for, um, cryptography, um, because a lot of cryptography uses number theory, um, it uses number theory constructions involving primes and so forth, and, um, it relies very much on the intuition that number theories are built over many, many years of what operations involving prime behave randomly and what ones don't. Um, and in particular, our encryption, um, methods are designed to turn text with information on it into text which is indistinguishable from, um, from random noise. So, um, and hence we believe to be almost impossible to crack, um, at least mathematically. Um, but, uh, if something has core to our belief as human hypothesis is is wrong, it means that there are, there are actual patterns of the primes that we not aware of, and if there's one, there's probably going to be more. Um, and suddenly a lot of our crypto systems are in doubt. Yeah. But then how do you then say stuff about the the primes? Yeah. That you're going towards the Collatz conjecture again. Um, because if I, I, you want it to be random, right? You want it to be randomly. Yeah. So more broadly, I'm just looking for more tools, more ways to show that that that things are random. How do you prove a conspiracy doesn't happen, right? Is there any chance to you that P equals NP? Is there some Can you imagine a possible universe? It is possible. I mean, there's, there's various uh, scenarios. I mean, there there's one where it is technically possible, but in practice is never actually implementable. The evidence is sort of slightly pushing in favor of no, that we probably is not equal to NP. I mean, it seems like it's one of those cases similar, similar to reman hypothesis that I think the evidence is leaning pretty heavily on the no. Certainly more on the no than on on the yes. The funny thing about P = NP is that we have also a lot more obstructions than we do for almost any other problem. Um, so while there's evidence, we also have a lot of results ruling out many, many types of approaches to the problem. Uh, this is the one thing that the computer scientists have actually been very good at. It's actually saying that that certain approaches cannot work. No go theorems. It could be undecidable. We don't Yeah, we don't know. There's a funny story I read that when you won the Fields Medal, somebody from the internet wrote you and asked, uh, you know, what are you going to do now that you've won this prestigious award? And and then you just quickly, very humbly said that, you know, this a shiny metal is not going to solve any of the problems I'm currently working on. So, I'm just I'm going to keep I'm going to keep working on them. It's just first of all, it's funny to me that you would answer an email in that context, and second of all, it, um, it just shows your humility. But anyway, uh, maybe you could speak to the Fields Medal, but it's another way for me to ask uh about Grigori Perelman. What do you think about him famously declining the Fields Medal and the Millennial Prize, which came with a $1 million of prize money? He stated that I'm not interested in money or fame. The prize is completely irrelevant for me. If the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed. Yeah. No, he's he's somewhat of an outlier. Um, even among mathematicians who tend to uh, to have uh, somewhat idealistic views. I've never met him. I think I'd be interested to meet him one day, but I I never had the chance. I know people who met him, but he's always had strong views about certain things. Um, you know, I mean, it's it's not like he was completely isolated from the math community. I mean, he would he would give talks and write papers and so forth. Um, but at some point he just decided not to engage with the rest of the community. He was he was disillusioned or something. Um, I don't know. Um, and he decided to to uh, uh, to peace out, uh, and you know, collect mushrooms in St. Petersburg or something. And then that's that's fine. You know, and you can you can do that. Um, I mean that's another sort of flip side. I mean, we are not a lot of our problems that we solve, you know, they some of them do have practical application, and that's that's great, but uh, like if you stop thinking about a problem, you know, so he's he hasn't published since in in this field, but that's fine, there's many, many other people who've done so as well. Um, yeah, so I guess one thing I didn't realize initially with the Fields Medal is that it it sort of makes you part of the establishment. Um, you know, so you know most mathematicians, you there's uh, just career mathematicians, you know, you just focus on publishing the next paper, maybe getting one to promote one one rank, you know, and and starting a few projects, maybe taking some students or something. Yeah. But then suddenly people want your opinion on things, and uh, you have to think a little bit about, you know, things that you might just so foolishly say because, you know, no one's going to listen to you. Uh, it's more important now. Is it constraining to you? Are you able to still have fun and be a rebel and try crazy stuff and well play with ideas? I have a lot less free time than I had previously. Um, I mean, mostly by choice. I mean, I I I obviously I have the option to sort of uh, decline. So I decline a lot of things. I I could decline even more. Um, or I could acquire a reputation for being so unreliable that people don't even ask anymore. Uh, this is I love the different algorithms here. This is great. This is it's always an option. Um, but you know, um, there are things that are like, I mean, so I mean, I I I don't spend as much time as I do as a postto, you know, just just working on one problem at a time or um, fooling around. I still do that a little bit, but yeah, as you advance in your career, somehow the more soft skills, so math somehow frontloads all the technical skills to the early stages of your career. So, um, yeah, so it's as a post office publisher or parish, you're you're incent, you're incentivized to basically focus on on proving very technical themsel, um, as well as proof the theorems. Um, but then as as you get more senior, you have to start, you know, mentoring and and and and giving interviews, uh, and uh, and trying to shape, um, direction of the field both research wise and and you know, uh, sometimes you have to uh, u, you know, do various administrative things, and it's kind of the right social contract because you you need to to work in the trenches to see what can help mathematicians. The other side of the establishment, sort of the the really positive thing is that, um, you get to be a light that's an inspiration to a lot of young mathematicians or young people that are just interested in Mathematics. It's like it's just how the human mind works. This is where I would probably uh, say that I like the Fields Medal, that it does inspire a lot of young people somehow. I don't this just how human brains work. Yeah. At the same time, I also want to give sort of respect to somebody like Grigori Perelman who is critical of awards in his mind. Those are his principles, and any human that's able for their principles to like do the thing that most humans would not be able to do, it's beautiful to see. Some recognition is is necessarily important. Uh, but yeah, it's it's also important to not let these things take over your life. um, and like only be concerned about uh, getting the next big award or whatever. Um, I mean, yeah, so again, you see these people try to only solve like a really big math problems and not work on on on things that are less uh, sexy, if you wish, but but but actually still interesting and instructive as you say, like the way the human mind works, it's um, we understand things better when they're attached\n\n\nto humans, and also,\nuh, if they're attached to a small number\nof humans, like this. This way, our human\nmind is wired. We can comprehend the\nrelationships between, you know, 10 or\n20 people, you know, but once you get\nbeyond like 100 people, like there,\nthere's a limit, I think.\nThere's a name for it, um, beyond which, uh,\nit just becomes the other.\nUm, and so we have, you have to simplify the pole\nmaster, you know, 99.9% of humanity\nbecomes the other, um, and, uh, often these\nmodels are incorrect, and this causes\nall kinds of problems. But, um, so, yeah, so\nto humanize a subject, you know, if you\nidentify a small number of people and\nsay, you know, these\nrepresentative people of the subject,\nrole models, for example, um, that has some\nrole, um, but it can also be, um, uh, yeah,\ntoo much of it can be harmful because\nit's\nI'll be the first to say that my own\ncareer path is not that of a typical\nmathematician. Um, I, the very accelerated\neducation, I skipped a lot of classes. Um,\nI think I was had very fortunate\nmentoring opportunities, um, and I think I\nwas at the right place at the right time.\nJust because someone doesn't have\nmy, um, trajectory, you, it doesn't mean\nthat they can't be good mathematicians.\nI mean, they be good mathematician in\na very different style. Uh, and we need\npeople of a different style. Um, and you\nknow, even if, and sometimes too much\nfocus is given on the person who\ndoes the last step to complete, um, a\nproject in Mathematics or elsewhere.\nThat's, that's really taken, you know,\ncenturies or decades with lots and lots\nof building, lots of previous work. Um,\nbut that's a story that's difficult to\ntell, um, if you're not an expert because,\nyou know, it's easier to just say one\nperson did this one thing. You know, it\nmakes for a much simpler history. I\nthink on the whole, it, um, is a hugely\npositive thing to talk about Steve\nJobs as a representative of Apple, when I\npersonally know, and of course, everybody\nknows the incredible design, the\nincredible engineering teams, just the\nindividual humans on those teams.\nThey're not a team. They're individual\nhumans on a team, and there's a lot of\nbrilliance there. But it's just a nice\nshorthand, like a very, like pi. Yeah.\nSteve Jobs. Yeah. Yeah. As a starting\npoint, you know, as a first\napproximation, that's how you, and then\nread some biographies, and then look into\nmuch deeper. First approximation. Yeah.\nThat's right. Uh, so you mentioned you\nwere a Princeton to, um, Andrew Wiles at\nthat time. He's a professor there. It's\na funny moment how history is just all\ninterconnected. And at that time, he\nannounced that he proved Fermat's Last\nTheorem. What did you think, maybe\nlooking back now with more context about\nthat moment in math history? Yes. So I\nwas a graduate student at the time. I\nmean, I vaguely remember, you know, there\nwas press attention, and, uh, um, we all had\nthe same, um, we had pigeon holes in the\nsame mail room, you know. So we all\npicked our mail, and like suddenly Andrew\nWiles's mailbox exploded to be overflowing.\nThat's a good, that's a good metric.\nYeah. Um, you know, so, yeah, we, we all\ntalked about it at tea and so forth. I\nmean, we, we didn't understand, most of us\ndidn't understand the proof, um, we\nunderstand sort of high-level details. Um,\nfact, there's an ongoing project to\nformalize it in Lean, right? Kevin Buzzard.\nYeah, can, can we take that small tangent?\nIs it, is it how difficult does that, cuz\nas, as I understand the proof for, uh,\nfor Fermat's Last Theorem has like\nsuper complicated objects. Yeah, really\ndifficult to formalize now. Yeah, I guess,\nyeah, you're right, the objects that they\nuse, um, you can define them. Uh, so\nthey've been defined in Lean. Okay. So,\nso just defining what they are can be\ndone. Uh, that's really not trivial, but\nit's been done. But there's a lot of\nreally basic facts about, um, these\nobjects that have taken decades to prove,\nand that they're in all these different\nmath papers, and so lots of these have to\nbe formalized as well. Um, Kevin's, uh,\nKevin Buzzard's goal, actually, he has a\nfive-year grant to formalize Fermat's Last\nTheorem, and his aim is that he doesn't\nthink he will be able to get all the way\ndown to the basic axioms, but he wants to\nformalize it to the point where the only\nthings that he needs to rely on as black\nboxes are things that were known by 1980\nto, um, to number theorists at the time.\nUm, and then some other person, some other\nwork would have to be done to, to, to get\nfrom there. Um, so it's, it's a different\narea of Mathematics than, um, the type of\nMathematics I'm used to. Um, um, in\nanalysis, which is kind of my area, um,\nthe objects we study are kind of much\ncloser to the ground. We study, I study\nthings like prime numbers and and\nfunctions and things that are within\nscope of a high school, um, math education\nto at least, uh, define. Um, yeah, but then\nthere's this very advanced algebraic\nside of number theory where people have\nbeen building structures upon structures\nfor quite a while. Um, and it's, it's a\nvery sturdy structure. It's, it's been,\nit's been very, um, at the base at least,\nis extremely well developed in the\ntextbooks and so forth. But, um, um, it\ndoes get to the point where, um, if you, if\nyou haven't taken these years of study,\nand you want to ask about what, what is\ngoing on at, um, like level six of of this\ntower, you have to spend quite a bit of\ntime before they can even get to the\npoint where you can see, you see\nsomething you recognize. What, uh,\ninspires you about his journey that we\nsimilar as we talked about seven years\nmostly working in secret? Yeah. Uh, that\nis a romantic, uh, Yeah. So it kind of\nfits with sort of the romantic image\nI think people have of mathematicians to\nthe extent they think of them at all as\nthese kind of eccentric, uh, you know,\nwizards or something. Um, so that\ncertainly kind of, uh, uh, accentuated that\nperspective, you know. I mean, it is a\ngreat achievement. His style of solving\nproblems is so different from my own, um,\nbut which, but which is great. I mean, we,\nwe need people. Speak to it like what, uh,\nin terms of like the, you like the\ncollaborative, I like moving on from a\nproblem if it's giving too much\neverybody. Um, got it. But you need the\npeople who have the tenacity and the\nfearlessness. Um, you, I've collaborated\nwith with people like that where, where I\nwant to give up, uh, cuz the first\napproach that we tried didn't work, and\nthe second one didn't approach, but\nthey're convinced, and they have the\nthird, fourth, and the fifth approach\nworks. Um, and I have to eat my words.\nOkay. I didn't think this was going to\nwork, but yes, you were right all along.\nAnd we should say for people who don't\nknow, not only are you known for the\nbrilliance of your work, but the\nincredible productivity, just the number\nof papers, which are all of very high\nquality. So there's something to be said\nabout being able to jump from topic to\ntopic. Yeah, it works for me. Yeah, I\nmean, there are also people who are very\nproductive, and they focus very deeply on\nYeah. I think everyone has to find their\nown workflow. Um, like one thing which is\na shame in Mathematics is that we have\nMathematics, there's sort of a one size\nfits all approach to teach teaching\nMathematics, um, and you know, so we have a\ncertain curriculum and so forth. I mean,\nyou know, maybe like if you do math\ncompetitions or something, you get a\nslightly different experience, but, um, I\nthink many people, um, they don't find\ntheir, their native math language, uh,\nuntil very late, or usually too late, so\nthey, they stop doing Mathematics, and\nthey have a bad experience with a\nteacher who's trying to teach them one\nway to do Mathematics. They don't like\nit. Um, my theory is that, um, humans don't\ncome, evolution has not given us a math\ncenter of a brain directly. We have a\nvision center and a language center and\nsome other centers, um, which have\nevolution has honed, but we, it doesn't, we\ndon't have innate sense of Mathematics.\nUm, but our other centers are\nsophisticated enough that different\npeople, we, we, we can repurpose other\nareas of our brain to do Mathematics. So\nsome people have figured out how to use\nthe visual center to do Mathematics, and\nso they think very visually when they do\nMathematics. Some people have repurposed\ntheir, their language center, and they\nthink very symbolically. Um, you know,\num, some people, like if they are very\ncompetitive, and they, they like gaming,\nthere's a type, there's this part of your\nbrain that's very good at, at, at, uh, at\nsolving puzzles and games, and, and, and\nthat can be repurposed. But like when I\ntalked about the mathematicians, you\nknow, they don't quite think, they, I can\ntell that they're using some different\nstyles of of thinking than I am. I mean,\nnot, not disjoint, but they, they may\nprefer visual. Like I, I don't actually\nprefer visual so much. I need lots of\nvisual aids myself. Um, you know,\nMathematics provides a common language.\nSo, we can still talk to each other even\nif we are thinking in in different ways.\nBut you can tell there's a different\nset of subsystems being used in the\nthinking process, like they take\ndifferent paths. They're very quick at\nthings that I struggle with, and vice\nversa. Um, and yet they still get to the\nsame goal. Um, that's beautiful. And\nyeah, but I mean, the way we educate,\nunless you have like a personalized\ntutor or something. I mean, education\nsort of just by natural scale has to be\nmass-produced, you know, you have to teach\nto 30 kids, and you know, if they have 30\ndifferent styles, you can't, you can't\nteach 30 different ways. On that topic,\nwhat advice would you give to students,\nuh, young students who are struggling\nwith math and but are interested in it\nand would like to get better? Is there\nsomething in this, Yeah. um, in this\ncomplicated educational context, what,\nwhat would you, Yeah, it's a tricky\nproblem. One nice thing is that there\nare now lots of sources for mathematical\nenrichment outside the classroom. Um, so\nin, in, in my day, there already, there are\nmath competitions. Um, and you know, there\nalso like popular math books in the\nlibrary. Um, yeah, but, but now you have,\nyou know, YouTube, uh, there, there are\nforums just devoted to solving, you know,\nmath puzzles, and, um, and math shows up in\nother places, you know, like, um, for\nexample, there, there are hobbyists who\nplay poker for fun, uh, and, um, they, they\nyou know, they for very specific reasons\nare interested in very specific\nprobability questions, um, and, and they\nactually know, there's a community of\namateur proists in in in poker, um, in\nchess, in baseball. I mean, there's,\nthere's, there's, uh, yeah, um, there's math\nall over the place. Um, and I'm, I'm, I'm\nhoping actually with, with these new sort\nof tools for Lean and so forth, that\nactually we can incorporate the broader\npublic into math research projects, um,\nlike this is almost, is, doesn't happen at\nall currently. So in the sciences,\nthere's some scope for citizen science,\nlike astronomers, uh, they amateurs who\ndiscover comets, and there's biologists,\nthere people who could identify\nbutterflies and so forth. Um, and in\nMathematics\nwhere, um, amateur mathematicians can like\ndiscover new primes and so forth, but, but\npreviously, because we have to verify\nevery single contribution, um, like most\nmathematical research projects, it would\nnot help to have input from the general\npublic. In fact, it would, it would just\nbe be time-consuming because just error\nchecking and everything. Um, but you know,\none thing about these formalization\nprojects is that they are bringing\ntogether more, bringing in more people.\nSo I'm sure there are high school\nstudents who've already contributed to\nsome of these, these formalizing projects\nwho contributed into math lib. Um, you\nknow, you don't need to be a PhD holder\nto just work on one atomic thing.\nThere's something about the\nformalization here that also at as a\nvery first step opens it up to the\nprogramming community too. The people\nwho are already comfortable with\nprogramming. It seems like programming\nis somehow, maybe just the feeling, but it\nfeels more accessible to folks than\nmath. Math is seen as this like extreme,\nespecially modern Mathematics, seen as\nthis extremely difficult to enter area,\nand programming is not. So that could be\njust an entry point. You can execute\ncode, and you can get results. You know,\nyou can print a hello world pretty\nquickly. Um, you know, like if, uh, if\nprogramming was taught as almost\nentirely theoretical subject where you\njust taught the the computer science,\nthe theory of functions and and and\nroutines and so forth, and and outside of\nsome, some very specialized homework\nassignments, you're not actually program\nlike on the weekend for fun. Yeah. Or\nYeah. They would be as considered as\nhard as math. Mhm. Um, Yeah. Yeah. So, as\nI said, you know, there are communities\nof non- mathematicians where they're\ndeploying math for some very specific\npurpose, you know, like, like optimizing\ntheir poker game, and, and for them, then\nmath becomes fun for them. Uh, what\nadvice would you give in general to\nyoung people, how to pick a career, how\nto find themselves? Like that's a tough,\ntough, tough question. Yeah. So, um,\nthere's a lot less certainty now in the\nworld, you know. I mean, I, there was this\nperiod after the war where, uh, at least\nin the West, you know, if you came from a\ngood demographic, you, uh, you know, like\nyou, there was a very stable path to to a\ngood career, you go to college, you get an\neducation, you pick one profession, and\nyou stick to it, becoming much more a\nthing of the past. So I think you just\nhave to be adaptable and flexible. I\nthink people have to get skills that are\ntransferable, you know, like, like learning\none specific programming language or one\nspecific subject of Mathematics or\nsomething. It's, it's, it's that itself is\nnot a super transferable skill, but sort\nof knowing how to, um, reason with with\nabstract concepts or how to problem\nsolve when things go wrong. So these are\nthings which I think we will still need\neven as our tools get, get better, and\nyou know, you, you would be working with AI\nsport and so forth. But actually, you're\nan interesting case study. I mean, you're\nlike a\none of the great living mathematicians,\nright? And then you had a way of doing\nthings, and then all of a sudden, you\nstart learning, I mean, first of all, you\nkept learning new fields, but you learn\nLean. That's not, that's a non-trivial\nthing to learn. Like that's a, that's a,\nfor a lot of people, that's an extremely\nuncomfortable leap to take, right? Yeah,\nmathematicians, um, first of all, I've\nalways been interested in new ways to do\nMathematics. I, I, I feel like a lot of the\nways we do things right now are\ninefficient. Um, I, I, I spend, me, my\ncolleagues, we spend a lot of time doing\nvery routine computations or doing\nthings that other mathematicians would\ninstantly know how to do, and we don't\nknow how to do them. Uh, and why can't we\nsearch and get a quick response? And so\nthat's why I've always been interested\nin exploring new workflows.\nAbout four or five years ago, I was on a\ncommittee where we had to ask for ideas\nfor interesting workshops to run at a\nmath institute. And at the time, Peter\nSchulze had just formalized one\n\n\nOf his, um, new theorems.\nAnd, um, there are some other developments in computer-assisted proof that look quite interesting.\nAnd I said, \"Oh, we should, we should, uh, um, we should run a workshop on this.\nThis be a good idea.\"\nUm, and then I was a bit too enthusiastic about this idea.\nSo I, I got volunte.\nUm, so I did with a bunch of other people, Kevin Bisard and Jordan Ellenberg and, and a bunch of other people.\nUm, and it was, it was a, a nice success.\nWe brought together a bunch of mathematicians and computer scientists and other people, and, and we got up to speed and state, um, and it was really interesting, um, developments that, that most mathematicians didn't know was going on.\nUm, that lots of nice proofs of concept, you know, just sort of hints of, of what was going to happen.\nThis was just before chat GBD, but there was even then there was one talk about language models and the potential, um, capability of those in the future.\nSo that got me excited about the subject.\nSo I started giving talks, um, about this is something we should, more of us should start looking at, um, now that I'd arranged to run this conference, and then chat GPT came out, and like, suddenly AI was everywhere.\nAnd so, uh, I got interviewed a lot, um, about, about this topic, um, and in particular, um, the interaction between AI and formal proof assistance, and I said, yeah, they should be combined.\nThis, this is, this is, um, this perfect synergy to happen here.\nAnd at some point, I realized that I have to actually do not just talk the talk, but walk the book, you know, like, you know, I don't work in machine learning, I, and I don't work in proof formalization, and there's a limit to how much I can just rely on authority and saying, you know, I, I'm a, I'm a warn mathematician, just trust me, you know, when I say that this is going to change athletics, and I'm not doing it any, when I don't do any of it myself.\nSo I felt like I had to actually, uh, uh, justify it.\nYeah, a lot of what I get into, actually, I don't quite see in advance as how much time I'm going to spend on it, and it's only after I'm sort of waste deep in, in, in, in, in a project that I, I, I realized by that point I'm committed.\nWell, that's deeply admirable that you're willing to go into the fray, be in some small way a beginner, right?\nOr have some of the sort of challenges that a beginner would, right?\nNew concepts, new ways of thinking also, you know, sucking at a thing that others, I think, I think in that talk, you could be a Fields Medal winning mathematician and undergrad knows something better than you.\nYeah.\nUm, I think mathematics inherently, I mean, mathematics is so huge these days that nobody knows all of modern mathematics.\nUm, and inevitably we make mistakes, and, um, you know, uh, you can't cover up your mistakes with just sort of bravado and, and, uh, I mean, because people will ask for your proofs, and if you don't have the proofs, you don't have the proofs.\nUm, I don't love math.\nYeah.\nSo it does keep us honest.\nI mean, not, not, I mean, you can still, it's not a perfect, uh, panacea, but I think, uh, we do have more of a culture of admitting error than because we're forced to all the time.\nBig ridiculous question.\nI'm sorry for it once again.\nWho is the greatest mathematician of all time?\nMaybe one who's no longer with us.\nUh, who are the candidates?\nZyler, Gaus, Newton, Raman, Hilbert.\nSo, first of all, as, as mentioned before, like, there's, there's some time dependent on the day.\nYeah.\nLike, like if, if you, if you plot cumulatively over time, for example, Uklid, like, like sort of like is, is one of the leading contenders.\nUm, and then maybe some unnamed anonymous mathematicians before that, um, you know, whoever came up with the concept of, of numbers, you know, you know, um, do mathematicians today still feel the impact of Hilbert?\nJust, oh yeah, directly of everything that's happened in the 20th century.\nYeah, Hilbert spaces, we have lots of things that are named after him, of course, just the arrangement of mathematics and just the introduction of certain concepts.\nI mean, 23 problems have been extremely influential.\nThere's some strange power to the declaring ing which problems are hard to solve.\nThe statement of the open problems.\nYeah.\nI mean, this is bystander effect in everywhere.\nLike if no one says you should do X, everyone just moves around waiting for somebody else to, to, uh, to do something, and, and like nothing gets done.\nUm, so, and, and like it, like it's one, one thing that actually, uh, you have to teach undergraduates in mathematics is that you should always try something.\nSo, um, you see a lot of paralysis, um, in an undergraduate trying a math problem.\nIf they recognize that there's a certain technique that that can be applied, they will try it, but there are problems for which they see none of their standard techniques obviously applies, and the common reaction is then just paralysis, I don't know what to do, or, um, or I think there's a quote from the Simpsons, I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas.\nUm, so, you know, like the next step then is to try anything, like, no matter how stupid, um, and in fact, almost as stupid of the better, um, which you know, and one a technique which is almost guaranteed to fail, but the way it fails is going to be instructive, um, like it fails because you, you, you're not at all taking into account this hypothesis, oh, this hypothesis must be useful, that's a clue.\nI, I think you also suggested somewhere this, this fascinating approach, which really stuck with me, I started using it and really works.\nI think you said it's called structured procrastination.\nNo, yes, it's when you really don't want to do a thing.\nDo you imagine a thing you don't want to do more?\nYes.\nThat's worse than that.\nAnd then in that way, you procrastinate by not doing the thing that's worse.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's a nice, it's a nice hack.\nIt actually works.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThis, um, I mean, with anything, like, you know, I mean, like you, um, psychology is really important, like you, you talk to athletes, like marathon runners and so forth, and, and they talk about what's the most important thing, is it their training regimen or the diet and so forth.\nActually, so much of it is actually psychology.\nUm, you know, just tricking yourself to, to think that the problem is feasible, um, so that you can, you're motivated to do it.\nIs there something our human mind will never be able to comprehend?\nWell, I sort of, as a mathematician, I mean, you, there must be some suffer that you can't understand.\nThat was the first thing that came to mind.\nSo that, but even broadly, is there, are we li, is there something about our mind that's we're going to be limited even with the help of mathematics?\nWell, okay, I mean, like, how much augmentation are you willing, like, like, for example, if, if I didn't even have pen and paper, um, like if I had no technology whatsoever, okay, so I'm not allowed blackboard, pen and paper, right?\nYou're already much more limited than you would be incredibly limited, even language, the English language is a technology.\nIt's a, it's one that's been very internalized.\nSo, you're right.\nThere really the, the, the formulation of the problem is incorrect because there really is no longer a just a solo human.\nWe're already augmented in extremely complicated, intricate ways, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWe're already like a collective intelligence.\nYes.\nYeah.\nYes.\nSo, humanity plural has much more intelligence in principle on it good days than than the individual humans put together.\nIt can also have less.\nOkay.\nBut, uh, um, yeah, so yeah, mathemat, mathematical community plural is, is incredibly super intelligent, uh, entity, um, that, uh, no single human mathematician can, can come closer to, to replicating.\nYou see it a little bit on these like question analysis sites.\nUm, so this math overflow, which is the math version of stack overflow, and like sometimes you get like this very quick responses to very difficult questions from the community.\nUm, and it's, it's, it's a pleasure to watch actually as a, as an expert.\nI'm a fan spectator of that, uh, of that site, just seeing the brilliance of the different people, the, um, the depth of knowledge that people have and the, the willingness to engage in the in the rigor and the nuance of the particular question.\nIt's pretty cool to watch.\nIt's fun.\nIt's almost like just fun to watch.\nUh, what gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on, human civilization?\nI think, uh, yeah.\nUm, the younger generation is always like, like really creative and enthusiastic and and inventive.\nUm, it's a pleasure working with, with, with, uh, with young students.\nUm, you know, the, uh, the progress of science tells us that the problems that used to be really difficult can become extremely, you know, can become like trivial to solve.\nYou know, I mean, like it was like navigation, you know, just just knowing where you were on the planet was this horrendous problem.\nPeople died, um, you know, or or lost fortunes because they couldn't navigate, you know, and we have devices in our pockets that do this automatically for us, I guess, a completely solved problem, you know.\nSo things that are seem unfeasible for us now could be maybe just sort of homework exercises for.\nYeah.\nBut one of the things I find really sad about the finitness of life is that I won't get to see all the cool things we create as a civilization.\nYou know that, cuz in the next 100 years, 200 years, just imagine showing, showing up in 200 years.\nYeah.\nWell, already plenty has happened, you know, like if, if you could go back in time and and talk to your teenage self or something, you know what I mean?\nYeah.\nAnd just the internet and and our AI.\nI mean, again, they, they've been in, they're beginning to be internalized and say, yeah, of course, an AI can understand our voice and and give reasonable, you know, slightly incorrect answers to to any question, but yeah, this was mind-blowing even 2 years ago, and in the moment, it's hilarious to watch on the internet and so on, the the drama, uh, people take everything for granted very quickly, and then they, we humans seem to entertain ourselves with drama out of anything that's created.\nSomebody needs to take one opinion, another person needs to take an opposite opinion, argue with each other about it.\nBut when you look at the arc of things, I mean, just even in progress of robotics.\nYeah.\nJust to take a step back and be like, \"Wow, this is beautiful that we humans are able to create this.\"\nYeah.\nWhen the infrastructure and the culture is is healthy, you know, the community of humans can be so much more intelligent and mature and and and rational than the individuals within it.\nWell, one place I can always count on rationality is the comment section of your blog, which I'm a big fan of.\nThere's a lot of really smart people there.\nAnd thank you, of course, for, uh, for putting those ideas out on the blog, and it's I can't tell you how, uh, honored I am that you would spend your time with me today.\nI was looking forward this for a long time, Terry.\nI'm a huge fan.\nUm, you inspire me.\nYou inspire millions of people.\nThank you so much for talking.\nOh, thank you.\nIt was a pleasure.\nThanks for listening to this conversation with Terence Tao.\nTo support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfridman.com/sponsors.\nAnd now, let me leave you with some words from Galileo Galile.\nMathematics is a language with which God has written the universe.\nThank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n",

    "cleanText": "There was a 5-year waiting list, and we got a rotary telephone, but it dramatically changed our lives. You know, people would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. You know, I, I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records, and it would take 2 hours to go, and they would say, \"Sorry, it's not ready. Come back the next day.\" 2 hours to come back. And that became a five-minute thing. So as a kid, like, I mean, this light bulb went in my head, you know, this power of technology to kind of change people's lives. We had no running water, you know, it was a massive drought. So they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight buckets per household. So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that, and bring it back home.\n\nMany years later, like, we had running water, and we had a water heater, and you could get hot water to take a shower. I mean, like, so, you know, for me, everything was discreet like that. Uh, and so I've always had this thing, you know, firsthand feeling of, like, how technology can dramatically change, like, your life and, like, the opportunity it brings. I think if pdoom is actually high at some point, all of humanity is, like, aligned in making sure that's not the case, right? And so we'll actually make more progress against it, I think. So the irony is, so there is a self-modulating aspect there. Like, I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is, I think we can get there. So because of that, I think I'm optimistic on the pdoom scenarios.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high. But I'm, uh, you know, I have a lot of faith in humanity kind of rising up to the to meet that moment. Take me through that experience when there's all these articles saying you're the wrong guy to lead Google through this. Google is lost. It's done. It's over.\n\nThe following is a conversation with Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and Alphabet, on this, the Lex Fridman Podcast. Your life story is inspiring to a lot of people. It's inspiring to me. You grew up in India, whole family living in a humble two-room apartment, very little, almost no access to technology. And from those humble beginnings, you rose to lead a $2 trillion technology company. So if you could travel back in time and told that, let's say, 12-year-old Sundar that you're now leading one of the largest companies in human history, what do you think that young kid would say? I would have probably laughed it off. Um, you know, uh, probably too far-fetched to imagine or believe at that time. You would have to explain the internet first, for sure. I mean, computers to me at that time. You know, I was 12 in 1984. So probably, uh, you know, by then I started reading about them. I had seen one. What was that place like? Take me to your childhood.\n\nYou know, I grew up in Chennai. Uh, it's in south of India. It's a beautiful, bustling city. Lots of people, lots of energy, you know, simple life. Definitely, like, fond memories of playing cricket outside the home. We just used to play on the streets. All the neighborhood kids would come out, and we would play till it got dark and we couldn't play anymore barefoot. Um, traffic would come, we would just stop the game, everything would drive through, and you would just continue playing, right? Just to kind of get the visual in your head. You know, precomputers, there's a lot of free time now. Now that I think about it, now you have to go and seek that quiet solitude or something. Newspapers, books is how I gained access to the was information at the time, you will. Uh, my grandfather was a big influence. He worked in the post office. He was so good with language. His English, you know, his handwriting till today is the most beautiful handwriting I've ever seen. He would write so clearly. He was so articulate. And so he kind of got me introduced into books. He loved politics. So we, we could talk about anything, and you know, that was there in my family throughout. So, uh, lots of books, trashy books, good books, everything from Ayn Rand to books on philosophy to stupid crime novels. So books was a big part of my life. But that kind of this soul, it's not surprising I ended up at Google because Google's mission kind of always resonated deeply with me, this access to knowledge. I was hungry for it, but definitely have, you know, fond memories of my childhood. Access to knowledge was there, so that's the wealth we had.\n\nUh, you know, every aspect of technology, I had to wait for a while. I've obviously spoken before about how long it took for us to get a phone, about 5 years, but it's not the only thing, a telephone. There was a 5-year waiting list. Uh, and we got a rotary uh, telephone. Mhm. But it dramatically changed our lives. You know, people would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. You know, I, I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records, and it would take 2 hours to go, and they would say, \"Sorry, it's not ready. Come back the next day.\" 2 hours to come back. And that became a 5-minute thing. So as a kid, like, I mean, this light bulb went in my head, you know, this power of technology to kind of change people's lives. We had no running water, you know, it was a massive drought. So they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight buckets per household. So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that, and bring it back home.\n\nMany years later, like, we had running water, and we had a water heater, and you could get hot water to take a shower. I mean, like, so, you know, for me, everything was discreet like that. Uh, and so I've always had this thing, you know, firsthand feeling of, like, how technology can dramatically change, like, your life and, like, the opportunity it brings. So, you know, that was kind of a subliminal takeaway for me throughout growing up. And, you know, I, I kind of actually observed it and felt it, you know. So, we had to convince my dad for a long time to get a VCR. Do you know what a VCR is? Yeah. I'm trying to date you now. But, you know, because before that, you only had, like, kind of one TV channel. Mhm. Right. That's it. Um, and so, you know, you can watch movies or something like that, but this was by the time I was in 12th grade, we got a VCR. You know, it was a uh, like a Panasonic, which we had to go to some, like, shop, which had kind of smuggled it in, I guess, and that's where we bought a VCR, but then being able to record, like, a World Cup football game and then or, like, get put, like, video tapes and watch movies, like, all that. So, like, you know, I had these discrete memories growing up, and so, you know, always left me with the feeling of, like, how getting access to technology drives that step change in your life. I don't think you'll ever be able to equal the first time you get hot water to have that convenience of going and opening a tap and have hot water come out. Yeah. It's interesting. We take for granted the progress we've made. If you look at human history, just those plots that look at GDP across 2,000 years, and you see that exponential growth to where most of the progress happened since the industrial revolution, and we just take for granted. We forget how how far we've gone. So our ability to understand how great we have it and also how quickly technology can improve is quite poor.\n\nOh, I mean, it's it's extraordinary. You know, I go back to India now. The power of mobile. You know, it's mind-blowing to see the progress through the arc of time. It's phenomenal. What advice would you give to young folks listening to this all over the world who look up to you and uh, find your story inspiring, who want to be maybe the next Bachai, who want to start create companies, uh, build something that has a lot of impact in the world? Look, it's you have a lot of luck along the way, but you obviously have to make smart choices. You're thinking about what you want to do. Your brain is telling you something. But when you do things, I think it's important to kind of get that, listen to your heart and see whether you actually enjoy doing it, right? That that feeling of if you love what you do, it's so much easier, and you're going to see the best version of yourself. It's easier said than done. I think it's tough to find things uh, you love doing. Um, but I think kind of listening to your heart a bit more than your mind in terms of figuring out what you want to do, I think, I think is one of the best things I would uh, tell people. The second thing is, I mean, trying to work with people who you feel, at various points in my life, I worked with people who I felt were better than me, right? Kind of like, you know, you almost are sitting in a room talking to someone, and they're like, wow, like, you know, you know, and you want that feeling a few times, trying to get yourself in a position where you're working with people who you feel are kind of, like, stretching your abilities is what helps you grow, I think. Uh, so putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, and I think often you'll surprise yourself. So I think being open-minded enough to kind of put yourself in those positions is maybe uh, maybe another thing I would say. What lessons can we learn, maybe from an outsider perspective, for me looking at your story and gotten to know you a bit? You're humble, you're kind. Usually when I think of somebody who has had a journey like yours and climbs to the very top of leadership, they're us in a cutthroat world, they're usually going to be a bit of an So what wisdom are we supposed to draw from the fact that uh, your general approach of is of balance, of humility, of kindness, listening to everybody? What's what's what's your secret? I do get angry. I do get frustrated. I, I have the same emotions all of us do, right, in the context of work and everything. Uh, but a few things, right? I, I, I think, you know, I over time, I figured out the best way to get the most out of people. Uh, you know, you kind of find mission-oriented people who are in the shad journey, who have this inner drive to excellence, to do the best, and and you know, you kind of motivate people, and and and you can, you can achieve a lot that way, right? And so it, it often tends to work out that way. But have there been times, like, you know, I lo lose it, yeah, but you know, not maybe less often than others, uh, and maybe over the years less and less so because, you know, I find it's not needed to achieve what you need to do. So losing your has not been productive. Yeah. Less often than not, I think people respond to that. Yeah. They may do stuff to react to that, like, but you, you actually want them to do the right thing, and and and so, you know, maybe there's a bit of, like, sports, you know, you know, I'm a sports fan in football coaches, uh, in soccer, uh, that football, uh, you know, people, people often talk about, like, man management, right? Coaches do, right? I think there is an element of that in our lives, how do you get the best out of the people you work with? You know, at times you're working with people who who are so committed to achieving, if they've done something wrong, they feel it more than you do, right? So you treat them differently than, you know, occasionally there are people who you need to clearly let them know, like, that wasn't okay or whatever it is, but I've often found that not to be the case, and sometimes the right words at the right time, spoken firmly, can reverberate through time also. Sometimes the unspoken words, you know, people can sometimes see that, like, you know, you're unhappy without you saying it, and so sometimes the silence can uh, deliver that message even more. Sometimes less is more. Um, who's the greatest uh, soccer player of all time, Messi or Ronaldo or Pele or Maradona? I'm going to make, you know, in this question, is this going to be a political answer? No, I, I, I will tell the truthful answer because uh, answer it is, you know, it's been interesting because my son is a big Cristiano Ronaldo fan. And uh, so we've had to watch El Classicos together, you know, with that dynamic in there. I so admire CR7s. I mean, I've never seen an athlete more committed to that kind of excellence. And so he's one of the all-time greats, but you know, for me, Messi is it. Yeah. Yeah, when I see Lionel Messi, you just are in awe that humans are able to achieve that level of greatness and genius and artistry. When we talk, we'll talk about AI, maybe robotics and this kind of stuff, that level of genius. I'm not sure you can possibly match by AI in a long time. It's just an example of greatness. And you have that kind of greatness in other disciplines, but in sport, you get to visually see it unlike anything else. And just the the timing, the movement, this is genius. I had the chance to see him a couple weeks ago. He played in uh, San Jose. So um, against the Quake. So I went to see it, see the game. I was a fan on the had good seats. Knew where he would play in the second half, hopefully. And uh, even at his age, just watching him when he gets the ball, that movement, you know, you're right, that special quality, it's tough to describe, but you feel it when you see it. Yeah, he still got it. Uh, if we rank all the technological innovations throughout human history, let's go back uh, maybe the history of human civilizations 12,000 years ago, and you rank them by the how much of a productivity multiplier they've been. So uh, we can go to electricity or the labor mechanization of the industrial revolution, or we can go back to the first agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago in that long list of inventions. Do you think AI, when history is written a thousand years from now, do you think it has a chance to be the number one productivity multiplier? It's a great question. Look, many years ago, I think it might have been 2017 or 2018. Um, you know, I, I said at the time, like, you know, AI is the most profound technology humanity will ever work on. It'll be more profound than fire or electricity. So, I have to back myself. I, you know, I still think uh, that's the case. You know, when you asked this question, I was thinking, well, do we have a recency bias, right? You know, like in sports, it's very tempting to call the current person you're seeing the greatest player, right? And and so is there a recency bias? And you know, I do think uh, from first principles, I would argue AI will be bigger than all of those. I didn't live through those moments.\n\n\nYou know, two years ago, I had to go through a surgery, and then I processed that there was a point in time people didn't have anesthesia when they went through these procedures. At that moment, I was like, that has got to be the greatest invention humanity has ever, ever done, right? So, look, we don't know what it is to have lived through those times, but you know, and many of what you're talking about were kind of these general things, which pretty much affected everything, you know, electricity or internet, etc.\n\nBut I don't think we have ever dealt with a technology both which is progressing so fast, becoming so capable. It's not clear what the ceiling is, and the main unique thing is it's recursively self-improving, right? It's capable of that. And so the fact it is going, it's the first technology will kind of dramatically accelerate creation itself, like creating things, building new things can improve and achieve things on its own, right? I think that puts it in a different league, right? And so, different league, and so I think the impact it'll end up having will far surpass everything we've seen before. Obviously, with that comes a lot of important things to think and wrestle with, but I definitely think that'll end up being the case, especially if it gets to the point of where we can achieve superhuman performance on the AI research itself. So, it's a technology that may, that's an open question, but it may be able to achieve a level to where the technology itself can create itself better than it could yesterday. It's like the move 37 of alpha research or whatever it is, right? Like, you know, and when, when, yeah, you're right, when it can do novel self-directed research, obviously for a long time, we'll, we'll have, hopefully always humans in the loop and all that stuff, and these are complex questions to talk about, but yes, I think the underlying technology, you know, I've said this, like, if you watched seeing AlphaGo start from scratch, be clueless, and like become better through the course of a day, you know, like, you know, kind of like, you know, really it hits you when you see that happen, even our like the V3 models, if you sample the models when they were like 30% done and 60% done and looked at what they were generating, and you kind of see how it all comes together, it's kind of like, I would say it's kind of inspiring, a little bit unsettling, right? As a, as a human. So all of that is true.\n\nI think, well, the interesting thing of the industrial revolution, electricity, like you mentioned. You can go back to the, again, the agricultural, the first agricultural revolution. There's um, what's called the Neolithic package of the first agricultural revolution, that it wasn't just that the nomads settled down and started planting food, but all this other kinds of technology was born from that, and it's included in this package. It wasn't one piece of technology. It's there's these ripple effects, second and third order effects that happen. Everything from something silly, like silly profound, like pottery that can store liquids and food, uh, to something we kind of take for granted, but social hierarchies, uh, and political hierarchy. So like early government was formed, cuz it turns out if humans stop moving and have some surplus food, they start coming up with, uh, they get bored and they start coming up with interesting systems, then trade emerges, which turns out to be a really profound thing, and like I said, government there. I mean, there's just uh, second and third order effects from that, including that package is incredible and probably extremely difficult if, if you ask one of the people in the nomadic tribes to predict that, it would be impossible. It's difficult to predict.\n\nBut all that said, what do you think are some of the early things we might see in the quote unquote AI package? I mean, most of it probably we don't know today, but like, you know, the one thing which we can tangibly start seeing now is, you know, obviously with the coding progress, you got a sense of it. It's going to be so easy to imagine like thoughts in your head, translating that into things that exist. That'll be part of the package, right? Like it's going to empower almost all of humanity to kind of express themselves. Maybe in the past you could have expressed with words, but like you could kind of build things into existence, right? You know, maybe not fully today. We are at the early stages of VIP coding. You know, I've been amazed at what people have put out online with V3, but it takes a bit of work, right? You have to stitch together a set of prompts, but all this is going to get better. The thing I always think about, this is the worst it'll ever be, right? Like at any given moment in time. Yeah, it's interesting you went there as kind of a first thought. So the exponential increase of access to creativity, software creation, are you creating a program, a piece of content for to be shared with others, games down the line, all of that like just becomes infinitely more possible.\n\nWell, I think the big thing is that uh, it makes it accessible. It unlocks the cognitive capabilities of the entire 8 billion. No, I agree. Look, think about 40 years ago, maybe in the US there were five people who could do what you were doing. Mhm. Like go do an interview, you know, and you know, but today think about with YouTube and other other products, etc. Like how many more people are doing it? So I think this is what technology does, right? Like when the internet created blogs, you know, you heard from so many more people. So I think, but, but with AI, I think that number won't be in the few hundreds of thousands, it'll be tens of millions of people, maybe even a billion people, like putting out things into the world in a deeper way, and I think it'll change the landscape of creativity and makes a lot of people nervous, like for example, uh, whatever Fox, MSNBC, CNN are really nervous about this part, like you mean this dude in a who could just do this and and use and YouTube and and and thousands of others, tens of thousands, millions of other creators can do the same kind of thing. That makes him nervous. And now you get a podcast from Nobook LM. That's about five to 10 times better than any podcast I've ever done. True. I'm I'm joking at this time, but maybe not. And that changes. You have to evolve because I, on the podcasting front, I'm a fan of podcasts much more than I am a fan of being a host or whatever. If there's great podcasts that are both AIs, I'll just stop doing this podcast. I'll listen to that podcast. But you have to evolve and you have to change, and that makes people really nervous, I think. But it's also a really exciting future.\n\nThe only thing I may say is I do think like in a world in which there are two AI, I think people value and uh, choose, just like in chess, you and I would never watch Stockfish 10 or whatever and Alph Go play against each, like it would be boring for us to watch, but Magnus Carlson and Gish, that game would be much more fascinating to watch. So it's tough to say, like, one way to say is you'll have a lot more content, and so you will be listening to AI generated content because sometimes it's efficient, etc. But the premium experiences you value might be a version of like the human essence wherever it comes through, going back to what we talked earlier about watching Messi dribble the ball. I don't know, one day I'm sure a machine will dribble much better than Messi, but I don't know whether it would evoke that same emotion in us. So I think that'll be fascinating to see. I think the element of podcasting or audiobooks that is about information gathering, that part might be removed, or that might be more efficiently and in a compelling way done by AI, but then it'll be just nice to hear humans struggle with the information, contend with the information, try to internalize it, combine it with the complexity of our own emotions and consciousness and all that kind of stuff. But if you actually want to find out about a piece of history, you go to Gemini. If you want to see Lex struggle with that history, then you look, or other humans, you look, you look at that. But that the point is it's going to change the nature, uh, continue to change the nature of how we discover information, how we consume the information, how we create that information. The same way that YouTube changed everything completely, changed news, it changed, and that's something our society is struggling with. Yeah, YouTube, look, YouTube enabled, I mean, you know this better than anyone else. It's enabled so many creators. There is no doubt in me that like we will enable more filmmakers than there have ever been, right? You're going to empower a lot more people. Um, so I think there's an expansionary aspect of this which is underestimated. I think I think it'll unleash human creativity in a way uh, that hasn't been seen before. It's tough to internalize. The only way is if you, if you brought someone from the 50s or 40s and just put them in front of YouTube, you know, I think it would blow their mind away. Similarly, I think we would get blown away by what's possible in a 10 to 20 year time frame. Uh, do you think there's a future? How many years out is it that, let's say, let's put a marker on it? 50% of content in a compel good content, 50% of good content is generated by V4, 56. You know, I think depends on what it is for. Um, like, you know, maybe if you look at movies today with CGI, there are great filmmakers, like you still look at like who the directors are and who use it. There are filmmakers who don't use it at all. You value that. There are people who use it incredibly. You know, think about somebody like a James Cameron, like what he would do with these tools in his hands. But I think there'll be a lot more content created, like just like writers today use Google Docs and not think about the fact that they're using a tool like that, like people will be using the future versions of these things, like it won't be a big deal at all to them.\n\nI've gotten a chance to get to know Darren Aronowski well. He's been really leaning in and trying to figure it's, it's fun to watch a genius who came up before any of this was even remotely possible. He created Pi, one of my favorite movies, and from there just continued to create a really interesting variety of movies. And now he's trying to see how can AI be used to create compelling films. You have people like that. You have people I've gotten to just know uh, edgier folks uh, that are AI first, like Door Brothers. Both Areronowski and Door Brothers create at the edge of the Overton window of society. You know, they push whether it's uh, sexuality or or violence. It's edgy like artists are, but it's still classy. It doesn't cross that line. Uh, whatever that line is, you know. Um, Hunter S. Thommpson is this line that the uh, the only way to find out where the edge, where the line is, is by crossing it. Uh, and I think for artists that's true. That's kind of their purpose. Sometimes comedians and artists just cross that line. I wonder if you can comment on the weird place that puts Google because Google's line is probably different than some of these artists. What, what's your, how do you think about specifically Vio um, and Flo about like how to allow artists to get do crazy, but also like the responsibility of like, um, not for it not to be too crazy.\n\nI, It's a great question. Look, part of you mentioned Darren, uh, you know, he's a clear visionary, right? Part of the reason we work started working with him early on VO is he's one of those people who was able to kind of see that future, get inspired by it, and kind of showing the way for how creative people can express themselves with it. Look, I think when it comes to allowing artistic free expression is one of the most important values in a society, right? I think, you know, artists have always been the ones to push, push boundaries, expand the frontiers of thought, uh, and so look, I think I think that's going to be an important value we have, so I think we will provide tools and put it in the hands of artists for them to use and put out their work, those APIs. I mean, I almost think of that as infrastructure, just like when you provide electricity to people or something, you want them to use it and like you're not thinking about the use cases on top of it. So it's a paintbrush. Yeah. And and so I think that's how, obviously there have to be some things, and you know, society needs to decide at a a fundamental level what's okay, what's not. Uh, we'll be responsible with it. Um, but I do think, you know, when it comes to artistic free expression, I think that's one of those values we should work hard to defend. Uh, I wonder if you can comment on um, maybe earlier versions of Gemini were a little bit careful on the kind of things you would be willing to answer. I just want to comment on, I was really surprised and uh, pleasantly surprised and enjoy the fact that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a lot less careful in a good sense. Don't ask me why, but I've been doing a lot of research on Jenghask Khan and the Aztecs. Uh, so there's a lot of violence there in that history. It's a very violent history. I've also been doing a lot of research on World War I and World War II. And earlier versions of Gemini were very um, basically this kind of sense, are you sure you want to learn about this? And now it's actually very factual, objective, uh, talks about very difficult parts of human history and does so with nuance and depth. It's it's been really nice. But there's a line there that I guess Google has to kind of walk. I wonder if it's and it's also an engineering challenge how to how to do that at scale across all the weird queries that people ask. What um, can you just speak to that challenge? How do you allow Gemini to say, again, forgive, pardon my French, crazy but not too, not not too crazy?\n\nI think one of the good insights here has been as the models are getting more capable, the models are really good at this stuff, right? And so I think in some ways maybe a year ago the models weren't fully there. So they would also do stupid things more often, and so you know, you're trying to handle those edge cases, but then you make a mistake in how you handle those edge cases and it compounds. But I think with 2.5, what we particularly found is once the models cross a certain level of intelligence and sophistication, you know, they are, they are able to reason through these nuanced issues pretty well. And I think users really want that, right? Like, you know, you want as much access to the raw model as possible, right? But I think it's a great area to think about, like, you know, over time, you know, we should allow more and more closer access to it, maybe obviously let people custom prompts if they wanted to and like, you know, and you know, experiment with it, etc. Uh, I, I think that's an important direction, but look, the first principles we want to think about it.\n\n\nIt is, you know, from a scientific standpoint, like making sure the models, and I'm saying scientific in the sense of like how you would approach math or physics or something like that, from first principles, having the models reason about the world, be nuanced, etc., uh, you know, from the ground up, is the right way to build these things, right? Not like some subset of humans is kind of hard coding things on top of it. Uh, so I think it's the direction we've been taking, and I think you'll see us continue to push in that direction.\n\nYeah. I actually asked, uh, I gave these notes. I took extensive notes, and I gave them to Gemini and said, \"Can you ask a novel question that's not in these notes?\" And it wrote, Gemini continues to really surprise me, really surprise me. It's been really beautiful. It's an incredible model. Uh, the, the question it generated was, \"You,\" meaning Sundar, \"told the world Gemini is turning out 480 trillion tokens a month. Uh, what's the most life-changing five-word sentence hiding in that vast stack?\" That's a Gemini question, but it made me, it gave me a sense. I don't think you can answer that, but it gave me, it made it, woke me up to like all of these tokens are providing little aha moments for people across the globe. So that's like learning that those tokens are people are curious. They ask a question, and they find something out, and it truly could be life-changing.\n\nOh, it is. I look, I know I had the same feeling about search many, many years ago. You, you know, you, you definitely, you know, this tokens per month is like grown 50 times in the last 12 months. Is that accurate, by the way?\n\nYeah, it is. You know, it is, it is accurate. I'm glad it got it right. Um, but you know, that number was 9.7 trillion tokens per month 12 months ago, right? It's gone, gone up to 480. You know, it's a 50x increase. So there's no limit to human curiosity. Uh, and I think it's, it's one of those moments. Uh, maybe I don't think it is there today, but maybe one day there's a five-word phrase which says what the actual universe is or something like that and something very meaningful. But I don't think we are quite there yet.\n\nDo you think the scaling laws are holding strong on, um, there's a lot of ways to describe the scaling laws for AI, but on the pre-training, on the post-training fronts? So the flip side of that, do you anticipate AI progress will hit a wall? Is there a wall?\n\nYou know, it's a cherished micro kitchen conversation. Once in a while, I have it, you know, like when Demis is visiting or, you know, Dennis, Cori, Jeff, Gnome, Sergey, a bunch of our people, like we sit and, uh, you know, you know, talk about this, right? And, um, look, I, we see a lot of headroom ahead, right? I think, uh, we've been able to optimize and improve on all fronts, right? Uh, pre-training, post-training, test time, compute, tool use, right? Over time, making these more agentic. So, getting these models to be more general world models in that direction, like V3, uh, you know, the physics understanding is dramatically better than what V1 or something like that was. So, you kind of see on all those dimensions. I, I feel, you know, progress is very obvious to see, and I feel like there is significant headroom. More importantly, you know, I'm fortunate to work with some of the best researchers on the planet, right? They think, uh, there is more headroom to be had here, uh, and so I think we have an exciting trajectory ahead. It's tougher to say, you know, each year I sit and say, \"Okay, we're going to throw 10x more compute over the course of next year at it,\" and like, will we see progress? Sitting here today, I feel like the year ahead, we'll have a lot of progress.\n\nAnd do you feel any limitations, like that, the bottlenecks, compute limited, uh, data limited, idea limited? Do you feel any of those limitations, or is it full steam ahead on all fronts?\n\nI think it's compute limited in this sense, right? Like, you know, we can, part of the reason you've seen us do Flash, Nano, Flash, and Pro models, but not an Ultra model. It's like, for each generation, we feel like we've been able to get the Pro model at like, I don't know, 80, 90% of Ultra capability, but Ultra would be a lot more, uh, like slow and a lot more expensive to serve. But what we've been able to do is to go to the next generation and make the next generation's Pro as good as the previous generation's Ultra. Yeah. But be able to serve it in a way that it's fast and you can use it and so on. So I do think scaling laws are working. But it's tough to get at any given time. The models we all use the most is maybe like a few months behind the maximum capability we can deliver, right? Because that won't be the fastest, easiest to use, etc. Also, that's in terms of intelligence. It becomes harder and harder to measure, uh, performance in quotes, because, you know, you could argue Gemini Flash is much more impactful than Pro just because of the latency. It's super intelligent already. I mean, sometimes like latency is, uh, maybe more important than intelligence, especially when the intelligence is just a little bit less in Flash, not, it's still incredibly smart model. Yeah. And so you, you have to now start measuring impact, and then it feels like benchmarks are less and less capable of capturing the intelligence of models, the effectiveness of models, the usefulness, the real-world usefulness of models.\n\nUh, another kitchen question. So lots of folks are talking about timelines for AGI or ASI, artificial super intelligence. So AGI, loosely defined, is basically human expert level at a lot of the main fields of pursuit for humans, and then ASI is what AGI becomes, presumably quickly, by being able to self-improve. So becoming far superior in intelligence across all these disciplines than humans. When do you think we'll have AGI? Is 2030 a possibility?\n\nUh, there's one other term we should throw in there. I don't know who used it first. Maybe Karpati did, AJI. Have you, have you heard AJI? The artificial jagged intelligence, sometimes feels that way, right? Both there are progress, and you see what they can do, and then like you can trivially find they make numerical errors or like, you know, counting Rs and strawberry or something, which seems to trip up most models or whatever it is, right? So, uh, so maybe we should throw that term in there. I feel like we are in the AJI phase, where like dramatic progress, some things don't work well, but overall, you know, you're seeing, uh, lots of progress. But if your question is, will it happen by 2030? Look, we constantly move the line of what it means to be AGI. There are moments today, you know, like sitting in a way in a San Francisco street with all the crowds and the people and kind of work its way through, I see glimpses of it there. The car is sometimes kind of impatient, trying to work its way, uh, using Astra, like in Gemini Live, or seeing, uh, you know, asking questions about the world. \"What's this skinny building doing in my neighborhood?\" It's a street light, not a building. You, you see glimpses. That's why I use the word AJI, because then you see stuff which obviously, you know, we're far from AGI too. So you have both experiences simultaneously happening to you. I'll answer your question, but I'll also throw out this. I almost feel the term doesn't matter. What I know is by 2030, there'll be such dramatic progress. We'll be dealing with the consequences of that progress, both the positives, uh, both the positive externalities and the negative externalities that come with it in a big way by 2030. So that I strongly feel, right? Whatever we may be arguing about the term, or maybe Gemini can answer what that moment is in time in 2030, but I think the progress will be dramatic, right? So that I believe in.\n\nWill the AI think it has reached AGI by 2030? I would say we will just fall short of that timeline, right? So I think it'll take a bit longer. It's amazing in the early days of Google DeepMind, in 2010, they talked about a 20-year time frame to achieve, uh, AGI. So which is, which is kind of fascinating to see. But you know, I, for me, the whole thing, seeing what Google Brain did in 2012, and when we acquired DeepMind in 2014, uh, right close to where we're sitting in 2012, you know, Jeff Dean showed the image of when the neural networks could recognize, uh, a picture of a cat, right? And identify it. You know, this is the early versions of Brain, right? And so, you know, we all talked about a couple decades. I don't think we'll quite get there by 2030, so my sense is it's slightly after that, but I, I would stress it doesn't matter, like what that definition is, because you will have mind-blowing progress on many dimensions. Maybe AI can create videos. We have to figure out as a society, how do we, we need some system by which we all agree that this is AI generated, and we have to disclose it in a certain way, because how do you distinguish reality otherwise?\n\nYeah, there's so many interesting things you said. So, first of all, just looking back at this recent, now feels like distant history, uh, with Google Brain. I mean, that was before TensorFlow, before TensorFlow was made public and open sourced. So, the tooling matters too, combined with GitHub, ability to share code. Then you have the ideas of attention, transformers, and the diffusion now, and then there might be a new idea that seems simple in retrospect, but will change everything, and that could be the post-training, the inference time innovations. And I think Shad Cen tweeted that Google is just one great UI from completely winning the AI race, meaning like UI is a huge part of it, like how that intelligence, uh, uh, I think Logan Cop project likes to talk about this, right? Now, it's an LLM, but it become like, when is it going to become a system where you're talking about shipping systems versus shipping the particular model? Yeah, that matters too. How the system is, um, manifest itself and how it presents itself to the world, that really, really matters.\n\nOh, hugely so. There are simple UI innovations which have changed the world, right? And, uh, I absolutely think so. Um, we will see a lot more progress in the next couple of years is, I think, AI itself, uh, on a self-improving track for UI itself, like, you know, today, we are like constraining the models, the models can't quite express themselves in terms of the UI to to people, um, but that is, uh, like, you know, if you think about it, we've kind of boxed them in that way, but given these models can code, uh, you know, they should be able to write the best interfaces to express their ideas over time, right? That is an incredible idea. So the APIs are already open. So you, you create a really nice agentic system that continuously improves the way you can be talking to an AI. Yeah. But it, a lot of that is the interface, and then of course, the incredible multimodal aspect of the interface that Google's been pushing. These models are natively multimodal. They can easily take content from any format, put it in any format. They can write a good user interface. They probably understand your preferences better that over time, like, you know, and so, so all this is like the evolution ahead, right? And so, um, that goes back to where we started the conversation. I like, I think there'll be dramatic evolutions in the years ahead.\n\nMaybe one more kitchen question. Uh, this even further ridiculous concept of P-doom. So the philosophically minded folks in the AI community think about the probability that AGI and then ASI might destroy all of human civilization. I would say my P-doom is about 10%. Do you ever think about this kind of long-term threat of ASI, and what would your P-doom be?\n\nLook, I mean, for sure. Look, I've, uh, both been, uh, very excited about AI. Uh, but I've always felt, uh, this is a technology, you know, we have to actively think about the risks and work very, very hard to harness it in a way that it, it all works out well. Um, on the P-doom question, look, it's, you know, won't surprise you to say that's probably another micro kitchen conversation that pops up once in a while, right? And given how powerful the technology is, maybe stepping back, you know, when you're running a large organization, if you can kind of align the incentives of the organization, you can achieve pretty much anything, right? Like, you know, if you can get kind of people all marching in towards like a goal, uh, in a very focused way, in a mission-driven way, you can pretty much achieve anything. But it's very tough to organize all of humanity that way. But I think if P-doom is actually high at some point, all of humanity is like aligned in making sure that's not the case, right? And so we'll actually make more progress against it, I think. So the irony is, so there is a self-modulating aspect there, like I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is, I think we can get there. So because of that, you know, I, I, I think I'm optimistic take on the P-doom scenarios, but that doesn't mean I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high, but I'm, uh, you know, I have a lot of faith in humanity kind of rising up to the to meet that moment.\n\nThat's really, really well put. I mean, as the threat becomes more concrete and real, humans do really come together and get their together. Well, the other thing I think people don't often talk about is probability of doom without AI. So, there's all these other ways that humans can destroy themselves. And it's very possible, at least I believe so, that AI will help us become smarter, kinder to each other, uh, more efficient. Uh, it, it'll help more parts of the world flourish where it would be less resource constrained, which is often the source of military conflict and tensions and so on. So we also have to load into that, what's the P-doom without AI, with AI P-doom, with AI P-doom without AI, cuz it's very possible that AI will be the thing that saves us, saves human civilizations from all the other threats.\n\nI agree with you. I think, I think it's insightful. Uh, look, I felt like to make progress on some of the toughest problems, it would be good to have AI like pair helping you, right? And and like, you know, so that resonates with me for sure.\n\nYeah. Quick pause. Bathroom break. You know, let's do that. If Notebook LM was the same compel, like what I saw today with Beam, if it was compelling in the same kind of way, blew my mind. It was incredible. Oh, I didn't think it's possible. I didn't. My was like, can you imagine like the US president and the Chinese president being able to do something like Beam with the live me translation working well? So, they're both sitting and talking, make progress a bit more. Uh, yeah, just, uh, for people listening, we took a quick bath break, and now\n\n\nWe're talking about the demo I did. We'll probably post it somewhere, somehow, maybe here. I got a chance to experience Beam, and it was, it's hard to describe in words how real it felt with just, what is it, six cameras? It's incredible. It's incredible. It's one of the toughest products. You can't quite describe it to people, even when we show it in slides, etc. Like, you don't know what it is; you have to kind of experience it.\n\nOn the world leaders front, on politics, geopolitics, there's something really special again with studying World War II and how much could have been saved if Chamberlain met Stalin in person. I sometimes also struggle explaining to people, articulating why I believe meeting in person for world leaders is powerful. It just seems naive to say that, but there is something there in person. With Beam, I felt that same thing, and then I'm unable to explain. All I kept doing is what a child does: you look real, you know? And I mean, I don't know if that makes meetings more productive or so on, but it certainly makes them more, uh, the same reason you want to show up to work versus remote, sometimes that human connection.\n\nI don't know what that is. It's hard to put into words.\n\nUm, there's something beautiful about great teams collaborating on a thing that's not captured by the productivity of that team or by whatever on paper. Like, some of the most beautiful moments you experience in life is at work, pursuing a difficult thing together for many months. There's nothing like it. You're in the trenches, and yeah, you do form bonds that way, for sure. And to be able to do that like somewhat remotely in that same personal touch, I don't know, that's a deeply fulfilling thing.\n\nI know a lot of people, I, I personally hate meetings because a significant percent of meetings, when done poorly, are, are, don't serve a clear purpose. So, but that's a meeting problem. That's not a communication problem. If you can improve the communication for the meetings that are useful, that's just incredible. So yeah, I was blown away by the great engineering behind it, and then we get to see what impact that has. That's really interesting, but just incredible engineering. Really impressive. Oh, it is. And obviously, we'll work hard over the years to make it more and more accessible. But yeah, even on a personal front, outside of work meetings, you know, a grandmother who's far away from our grandchild and being able to, you know, have that kind of an interaction, right? All that, I think, will end up being very mean. Nothing substitutes being in person, but you know, it's not always possible. You know, you could be a soldier deployed, right, trying to talk to your loved ones. So, I think, uh, you know, so that's what inspires us.\n\nWhen you and I hung out last year and took a walk, I remember, I don't think we talked about this, but I remember, uh, you know, outside of that, seeing dozens of articles written by analysts and experts and so on that Sundar Pichai should step down because the perception was that Google was definitively losing the AI race, has lost its magic touch in the rapidly evolving technological landscape. And now, a year later, it's crazy. You showed this plot of all the things that were shipped over the past year is incredible, and Gemini Pro is winning across many benchmarks and products as we sit here today. So, take me through that experience when there's all these articles saying you're the wrong guy to lead Google through this. Google's lost, it's done, it's over, to today where Google is winning again. What were some low points during that time?\n\nLook, I, um, I mean, lots to unpack. Um, you know, obviously, like the main bet I made as a CEO was to really, uh, you know, make sure the company was approaching everything in an AI-first way. Really, you know, setting ourselves up to develop AGI responsibly, right? And, and, and make sure we're putting out products, uh, which embodies that, things that are very, very useful for people. So look, I, I knew even through moments like that last year, uh, you know, I had a good sense of what we were building internally, right? So I'd already made, you know, many important decisions, you know, bringing together teams of the caliber of Brain and DeepMind and setting up Google DeepMind. There were things like we made the decision to invest in TPUs 10 years ago. So, we knew we were scaling up and building big models.\n\nAnytime you're in a situation like that, a few aspects, uh, I'm good at tuning out noise, right? Separating signal from noise. Do you scuba dive? Like, have you? No. You know, it's amazing. Like, I'm not good at it, but I've done it a few times. But sometimes you jump in the ocean, it's so choppy, but you go down one foot under, it's the calmest thing in the entire universe, right? So there's a version of that, right? Like, you know, uh, running Google, you know, you may as well be coaching Barcelona or Real Madrid, right? Like, you know, you have a bad season. So there are aspects to that, but you know, like, look, I, I'm good at tuning out the noise. I do watch out for signals, you know, it's important to separate the signal from the noise. So there are good people sometimes making good points outside. So you want to listen to it. You want to take that feedback in. But you know, internally, like, you know, you're making a set of consequential decisions, right? As leaders, you're making a lot of decisions. Many of them are like inconsequential, like it feels like, but over time, you learn that most of the decisions you're making on a day-to-day basis doesn't matter. Like, you have to make them, and you're making them just to keep things moving, but you have to make a few consequential decisions, right? And, and, uh, we had set up the right teams, right leaders, we had world-class researchers. We were training Gemini internally. There are factors which were, for example, outside people may not have appreciated. I mean, TPUs are amazing, but we had to ramp up TPUs, two, that took time, right? And, and, uh, to scale, actually having enough TPUs to get the compute needed, but I could see internally the trajectory we were on, and and be, you know, I was so excited internally about the possibility. To me, this moment felt like one of the biggest opportunities ahead for us as a company. That the opportunity space ahead over the next decade, next 20 years is bigger than what has happened in the past. Um, and I thought we were set up like better than most companies in the world to go, uh, realize that vision.\n\nI mean, you had to make some consequential, bold decisions, like you mentioned the merger of DeepMind and Brain. Uh, maybe it's my perspective, just knowing humans. I'm sure there's a lot of egos involved. It's very difficult to merge teams, and I'm sure there are some hard decisions to be made. Can you take me through your process of how you think through that? Do you go to pull the trigger and make that decision? Maybe what were some painful points? How do you navigate those turbulent waters?\n\nLook, we were fortunate to have two world-class teams. Uh, but you're right, like it's like somebody coming and telling to you, take Stanford and MIT, right? And then put them together and create a great department, right? And, and easier said than done. Uh, but we were fortunate, you know, phenomenal teams, both had their strengths, you know, they were run very differently, right? Like, uh, Brain was kind of a lot of diverse projects, bottoms up, and out of it came a lot of important research breakthroughs. DeepMind at the time had a strong vision of how you want to build AGI, and so they were pursuing their direction. But I think through those moments, luckily tapping into, um, you know, Jeff had expressed a desire to be more, to go back to more of a scientific individual contributor roots. You know, he felt like management was taking up too much of his time. Uh, and, and, and Demis naturally, I think, uh, you know, uh, was running DeepMind and was a natural choice there. But I think it was, you were right, you know, it took us a while to bring the teams together. Credit to Demis, Jeff, Kai, all the great people there. They worked super hard to combine the best of both worlds. When you set up that team, a few sleepless nights here and there as we put that thing together. We were patient in how we did it so that it works well for the long term, right? And, and some of that in that moment, I think, yes, with things moving fast, uh, I think you definitely, uh, felt the pressure, but I think we pulled off that, uh, transition well, and you know, I think, I think, uh, you know, they've obviously, uh, doing incredible work, and there's a lot more incredible things ahead coming from them.\n\nLike we talked about, you have a very calm, even-tempered, respectful demeanor. During that time, whether it's the merger or just dealing with the noise, uh, did, were there times where frustration boiled over? Like, did you, uh, have to go a bit more intense on everybody than you usually would?\n\nProbably. You know, probably, right? I think, I think in the sense that, you know, it was a moment where we were all driving hard, but when you're in the trenches working with passion, you're going to have days, right? You disagree, you argue, but like all that, I mean, just part of the course of working intensely, right? And, uh, you know, at the end of the day, all of us are doing what we're doing because, uh, the impact it can have, we're motivated by it. It's like, uh, you know, for many of us, this has been a long-term, uh, journey, and so it's been super exciting. The positive moments far outweigh the kind of stressful moments. Just early this year, I had a chance to celebrate back-to-back over two days, like, you know, Nobel Prize for Jeff Finton and the next day a Nobel Prize for Dennis and John Jumper. You know, you worked with people like that. All that is super inspiring.\n\nIs there something like with view where you had to like put your foot down, maybe with less, uh, versus more, where like, I'm the CEO and we're, we're doing this? To my earlier point about consequential decisions you make, there are decisions you make people can disagree pretty vehemently, and but at some point, like, you know, you make a clear decision, and you, you just ask people to commit, right? Like, you know, you can disagree, but it's time to disagree and commit so that we can get moving. And whether it's putting the foot down or, you know, like, you know, it's, it's a natural part of what all of us have to do, and you know, I think you can do that calmly and be very firm in the direction you're making the decision. And I think if you're clear, actually, people over time respect that, right? Like, you know, if you can make decisions with clarity, I find it very effective in meetings where you're making such decisions to hear everyone out. I think it's important when you can to hear everyone out. Sometimes what you're hearing actually influences how you think about, and you're wrestling with it and making a decision. Sometimes you have a clear conviction, and you state so, look, I, uh, I, you know, this is how I feel, and you know, this is my conviction, and you kind of place the bet and you move on.\n\nOther big decisions like that, I'm kind of intuitively assume the merger was the big one. I think that was a very important decision, uh, you know, for, for the company to, to meet the moment. I think we had to make sure we were, uh, we were doing that and doing that well. I think that was a consequential decision. There were many other things. We set up an AI infrastructure team, like to really go meet the moment, to scale up the compute we needed to, and really brought teams from disparate parts of the company, kind of created it to, to move forward. Um, you know, bringing people like getting people to kind of work together physically, both in London with DeepMind and what we call Gradient Canopy, which is where the Mountain View Google DeepMind teams are. But one of my favorite moments is I routinely walk, uh, like multiple times per week to the graining canopy building where our top researchers are working on the models. Sergey is often there amongst them, right? Like, you know, just, you know, looking at, uh, you know, getting an update on the model, seeing loss curves. So all that, I think that cultural part of getting the teams together back with that energy, I think, ended up playing a big role too.\n\nWhat about the decision to recently add AI mode? So, Google Search is the, uh, as they say, the front page of the internet. It's like a legendary minimalist thing with 10 blue links. Like, that's when people think internet, they think that page, and now you're starting to mess with that. So, the AI mode, which is a separate tab, and then integrating AI in the results. I'm sure there were some battles in meetings on that one.\n\nLook, uh, you know, in some ways, when mobile came, you know, people wanted answers to more questions. So, we're kind of constantly evolving it. But you're right, this moment, you know, that evolution, uh, because the underlying technology is becoming much more capable, you know, you can have AI give a lot of context, you know, but one of our important design goals, though, is when you come to Google Search, you're going to get a lot of context, but you're going to go and find a lot of things out on the web. So that will be true in AI mode, in AI overviews, and so on. But I think to our earlier conversation, we are still giving you access to links, but think of the AI as a layer which is giving you context, summary, maybe in AI mode, you can have a dialogue with it back and forth. Mhm. On your journey, right? And but through it all, you're kind of learning what's out there in the world. So those core principles don't change, but I think AI mode allows us to push the, we have our best models there, right? Uh, models which are using search as a deep tool, really, for every query you're asking, kind of fanning out, doing multiple searches, like kind of assembling that knowledge in a way so you can go and consume what you want to, right? And, and, and that's how we think about it.\n\nI got a chance to listen to a bunch of Elizabeth Liz Reed, yeah, describe this. Two things stood out to me that you mentioned. One thing is what you were talking about is the query fan out, which I didn't even think about before, uh, is the powerful aspect of integrating a bunch of stuff on the web for you in one place. So yes, it provides that context so that you can decide which page to then go on to. The other really, really big thing speaks to the earlier in terms of productivity multiplier that we're talking about, that she mentioned was, um, language. So one of the things you don't quite understand is it, through AI mode, you make for non-English speakers, you make sort of, let's say, English language websites accessible by in the reasoning process as you try to figure out what you're looking for. Of course.\n\n\nOnce you show up to a page, you can use a basic translate. Yeah. But that process of figuring it out, if you empathize with a large part of the world that doesn't speak English, their web is much smaller in that original language. And so it unlocks, again, unlocks that huge cognitive capacity there that we don't, you know, you take for granted here with all the bloggers and the journalists writing about AI mode. You forget that this now unlocks, um, because Gemini is really good at translation. No, it is. I mean, the multimodality, the translation, uh, its ability to reason, we are dramatically improving tool use. Uh, like I, as putting that power in the flow of search, I, I think, look, I'm, I'm super excited with AI overviews. We've, we've seen the product has gotten much better. We know we measure it using all kinds of user metrics. It's obviously driven strong growth of the product, uh, and, you know, we've been testing AI mode, you know, it's now in the hands of millions of people, and the early metrics are very encouraging. So, look, I, I, I'm excited about this next chapter, chapter of search for people who are not thinking through or aware of this. So, there's the 10 blue links with AI overview on top that provides a nice summarization. You can expand it and you have sources and links now. Yep. Embedded. Yeah, I believe at least Liz said so. I actually didn't notice it, but there's ads in the AI overview.\n\nAlso, I don't think there's ads in AI mode.\n\nUh, when ads in AI mode. So now, when do you think, I mean, it's okay, we should say that in the '90s, I remember the animated gifts, banner gifts that take you to some shady websites that have nothing to do with anything. AdSense revolutionized advertisement. It's one of the greatest inventions, um, in, in recent history because it allows us for free to have access to all these kinds of services. So, ads fuel a lot of really powerful services, and at its best, it's showing you relevant ads, but also very importantly, in a way that's not super annoying. Mhm. Right. In a classy way. So, uh, when do you think it's possible to add ads into AI mode, and what does that look like from a classy, non-annoying perspective? Two things. Early part of AI mode, uh, will obviously focus more on the organic experience to make sure we are getting it right. I think the fundamental value of ads are it enables access to deploy the services to billions of people. The second is ads are the reason we've always taken ads seriously is we view ads as commercial information, but it's still information, and so we bring the same quality metrics to it. I think with AI mode, to our earlier conversation about, I think AI itself will help us over time figure out, you know, the best way to do it. I, I think, given we giving context around everything, we, I think it'll give us more opportunities to also explain, okay, here's some commercial information, like today, as a podcaster, you do it at certain spots, and you probably figure out what's best in your podcast.\n\nUm, I, I think so, there are aspects of that, but I think, you know, I think the underlying need of people, value commercial information, businesses are trying to connect to users, all that doesn't change in a AI moment, but look, we will rethink it. You've seen us in YouTube now do a mixture of subscription and ads, like, obviously, you know, we, we are now introducing subscription offerings, uh, across everything, and so as part of that, we can optim, the optimization point will end up being a different place as well.\n\nDo you see a trajectory in the possible future where AI mode completely replaces the 10 blue links plus AI overview? Our current plan is AI mode is going to be there as a separate tab for people who really want to experience that, but it's not yet at the level where our main search page is, but as features work, we'll keep migrating it to the main page, and so you can view it as a continuum. AI mode will offer you the bleeding edge experience, but it'll work, will keep overflowing to AI overviews and the main, main experience, and the idea that AI mode will still take you to the web, to the human-created web. Yes, that's going to be a core design principle for us. So, really, if users decide, right, they drive this. Yeah, it's just exciting, a little bit scary that it might change the internet because you Google has been dominating with a very specific look and idea of what it means to have the internet, and to as you move to AI mode, I mean, I, it's just a different experience. Um, I think Liz was talking about, I think you've mentioned that you ask more questions, you ask longer questions, dramatically different types of questions. Yeah. Like it actually fuels curiosity. Like I think it's for me, I've been asking just a much larger number of questions of this blackbox machine, let's say, whatever it is. And, and with AI overview, it's interesting, like I, because I still value the human, I still ultimately want to end up on the human-created web, but I, like you said, the context really helps, it helps us deliver higher quality referrals, right? You know, where people are like, they have much higher likelihood of finding what they're looking for, they're exploring, they're curious, their intent is getting satisfied more, so all that's what all our metrics.\n\nIt makes the humans that create the web nervous. The journalists are getting nervous. They've already been nervous. Like we mentioned, CNN is nervous because of podcasts. Um, it makes people nervous. Look, I, I, I think news and journalism will play an important role, you know, in the future. Uh, we're pretty committed to it, right? And, uh, so I think making sure that ecosystem, in fact, I think we'll be able to differentiate ourselves as a company over time because of our commitment there. So, it's, it's, it's something I think, you know, I definitely value a lot, and, and as we are designing, we'll continue prioritizing approaches. I'm sure for the people who want, they can have a fine-tuned AI model that's clickbait hit pieces, uh, that will replace current journalism. Uh, that's a shot of journalism, forgive me. Uh, but I, I find that if you're looking for really strong criticism of things that Gemini is very good at providing that. Oh, absolutely. It's better than anything the, for now, I mean, people are concerned that there would be bias that's introduced, that as the AI systems become more and more powerful, there's incentive from sponsors, uh, to roll in and try to control the output of the AI models. Uh, but for now, the objective criticism that's provided is way better than journalism. Of course, the argument is the journalists are still valuable, but then I don't know, the crowd search journalism that we get on the open internet is also very, very powerful. I feel like they're all super important things. I think it's good that you get a lot of crowdsourced information coming in, but I feel like there is real value for high quality journalism, right? And, and I think these are all complimentary. I think, like, I view it as I find myself constantly seeking out also, like, try to find objective reporting on, on things too. Uh, and, and sometimes you get more context from the crowdfunded sources you read online, but I think both end up playing a super important role. So, there's, uh, you spoken a little about about this, de talked about this is sort of the, the slice of the web that will increasingly become about providing information for agents. So, we can think about as like two layers of the web. One is for humans, one is for agents. Do you see the AI agents? Do, do you see the one that's for AI agents growing over time? Do you see there still being long-term, 5, 10 years value for the human-created, human-created for the purpose of human consumption web, or will it all be agents in the end? Yeah.\n\nToday, like not everyone does, but, you know, you, you go to a, you go to a big retail store, you love walking the aisle, you love shopping, uh, or grocery store, picking out food, etc., but you're also online shopping and they're delivering, right? So, both are complimentary, and like that's true for restaurants, etc. So, I do feel like over time websites will also get better for humans. They will be better designed. Uh, AI might actually design them better for humans. So, I, I expect the web to get a lot richer and more interesting and, uh, better to use. At the same time, I think there'll be an agentic web, which is also making a lot of progress, and you have to solve the business value and the incentives to make that work well, right? Like for people to participate in it, but I think both will coexist, and obviously the agents may not need the same, I mean, not may not, they won't need the same design and the UI paradigms which humans need to interact with, uh, but I think both will, both be there. I have to ask you about Chrome. Uh, I have to say, for me personally, Google Chrome is probably, I don't know, I'd like to see where I would rank it. But in this temptation, this is not a recency bias, although it might be a little bit, but I think it's up there, top three, maybe the number one piece of software for me of all time. It's just incredible. It's really incredible. The browser is our window to the web. And Chrome really continued for many years, but even initially to push the innovation on that front when it was stale, and it continues to challenge, it continues to make it more, uh, performant, so efficient, just innovate constantly. Uh, and the, the, the Chromium aspect of it. Anyway, uh, you were one of the pioneers of Chrome, pushing for it when it was an insane idea, probably one of the ideas that was criticized and doubted and so on. So, can you tell me, um, the story of what it took to push for Chrome? What was your vision? Look, it was a such a dynamic time, uh, in around 2004, 2005, with Ajax, the web suddenly becoming dynamic in a matter of few months, Flickr, Gmail, Google Maps, all kind of came into existence, right? Like the fact that you have an interactive, dynamic web. The web was evolving from simple, uh, text pages, simple HTML to rich, dynamic applications. But at the same time, you could see the browser was never meant for that world, right? Like JavaScript execution was super slow. Uh, you know, the browser was far away from being an operating system for that rich, modern web which was coming into, uh, coming into place. So, that's the opportunity we saw, like, uh, you know, it's an amazing early team. I still remember the day we got a shell on WebKit running and how fast it was. Uh, you know, we had the clear vision for building a browser, like we wanted to bring core OS principles into the browser, right? Like, so we built a secure browser sandbox, each tab was its own, not these things are common now, but at the time, like it was pretty unique. Uh, we found an amazing team in our Denmark, uh, with a leader who built a V8, the JavaScript VM, which at the time was 25 times faster than, uh, any other JavaScript VM out there. And by the way, you're right. We open sourced it all and, you know, and put it in Chromium too. But we really thought the web could work much better, um, uh, you know, much faster, and you could be much safer browsing the web. And the name Chrome came was because we literally felt people were like, the, the, the Chrome of the browser was getting clunkier. We wanted to minimize it. And so that was the origins of the project. Definitely, obviously, uh, highly biased person here talking about Chrome. Uh, but, you know, it's the most fun I've had, uh, building a product from the ground up, and, you know, it, it was an extraordinary team. Uh, had, uh, my co-founders on the project were terrific. So, definite fond memories. So, for people who don't know, Sundar, it's probably fair to say you're the reason we have Chrome. Yes. I know there's a lot of incredible engineers, but pushing for it inside a company that probably was opposing it because it's a crazy idea, because, um, as everybody probably knows, it's incredibly difficult to build a browser. Yeah. Look, I, uh, Eric, who was the CEO at the time, I think it was less that he was opposed to it. He kind of firsthand knew what a crazy thing it is to go build a browser. And so he definitely was like, this is, you know, there was a crazy aspect to actually wanting to go build a browser. But, um, he was very supportive, uh, you know, everyone, the founders were, I think, once we started, you know, building something and we could use it and see how much better from then on, like, you know, you're, you're really tinkering with the product and making it better, it came to life pretty fast. What, uh, wisdom do you draw from that from, um, pushing through on a crazy idea in the early days that ends up being revolutionary? What for future crazy ideas like it? I mean, this, this is something Larry and Sergey have articulated clearly. I really internal, internalized this early on, which is, you know, their whole feeling around working on moonshots, like, as a way, when you work on something very ambitious, first of all, it attracts the best people, right? So, that's an advantage you get. Number two, because it's so ambitious, you don't have others working on something crazy, so you pretty much have the path to yourselves, right? It's like way more self-driving. Number three, it is, even if you end up quite not accomplishing what you set out to do, and you end up doing 60, 80% of it, you'll end up being a terrific success. So, so, you know, that's the advice I would give people, right? I think, like, you know, it's just aiming for big ideas has all these advantages, and, and it's risky, but it also has all these advantages which people I don't think fully internalize.\n\nI mean, you mentioned one of the craziest, biggest moonshots, which is Whimo. Uh, it's when, when I first saw over a decade ago, a Waymo vehicle, a Google self-driving car vehicle. It was, it was for me, it was an aha moment for robotics. It made me fall in love with robotics even more than before. It gave me a glimpse into the future. So, it's incredible. I'm truly grateful for that project for what it symbolizes. But it's also crazy moonshot. Is for, for a long time has been just like you mentioned with scuba diving, just not listening to anybody, just calmly improving the system better and better, more testing, just expanding, uh, the operational domain more and more. First of all, congrats on, uh, 10 million paid robo taxi rides. Uh, what lessons do you take from Whimo about, like, the, the perseverance, the persistence on that project? I look really proud of the progress, uh, we have had with Whimo. One of the things I think we were very committed to, you know, the final 20% can look like, I mean, we always say, right, the first 80% is easy, the final 20% takes 80% of the time. I think we definitely were, we're working through that phase with Whimo, but I was aware of that, so, but, you know, we knew we were at that stage, we knew we were the technology gap between while there were many people, many\n\n\nOther self-driving companies, we knew the technology gap was there. In fact, right at the moment when others were doubting Whimo is when, I don't know, I made the decision to invest more in Whimo, right? Because so, uh, so in some ways, it's counterintuitive, uh, but I think, look, we've always been a deep technology company, and like, uh, you know, is a version of kind of building an AI robot that works well. And so we get attracted to problems like that. The caliber of the teams there, uh, you know, uh, phenomenal teams. And so I know you followed the space super closely, uh, you know, I'm talking to someone who knows the space well, but it was very obvious it's going to get there. And you know, there's still more work to do, but we, you know, it's a good example where we always prioritized being ambitious and safety at the same time, right? And and and equally committed to both and and pushed odd, and you know, couldn't be more thrilled with uh, how it's working, uh, how much people love, love the experience. And it this year is definitely, we've scaled up a lot, and we'll continue scaling up in '26. That said, uh, the competition is heating up. You've been uh, friendly with Elon, uh, even though technically is a competitor, but you've been friendly with a lot of tech CEOs in that way, just showing respect towards them and so on. What do you think about the robo taxi efforts that Tesla is doing? Do you see it as competition? What do you think? Do you like the competition?\nWe are one of the earliest and biggest backers of SpaceX, uh, as Google, uh, right? So, uh, you know, thrilled with uh, what SpaceX is doing and fortunate to be uh, investors as a company there, right? And and look, we don't compete with Tesla directly. We are not making cars, etc., right? We're building L4/5 autonomy. We're building a way driver, which is general purpose and can be used in many headings. They're obviously working on making Tesla self-driving too. I've just assumed it's a de facto that Elon would succeed in whatever he does. So like, you know, you know that that that is uh, not something I question. So, but I think we are so far from these spaces are such vast spaces, like I, I think about transportation, the opportunity space. The Whimo driver is a general purpose technology. We can apply in many situations. So you have a vast green space. Uh, in all future scenarios, I see Tesla doing well and you know, Waymo doing well. Like we mentioned with the Neolithic package, I think it's very possible that in the quote unquote AI package, when the history is written, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars is like the big thing that changes everything. Imagine over a period of uh, a decade or two, just a complete transition from manually driven to autonomous in ways we might, we might not predict. It might change the way we move about the world completely. So that, you know, the possibility of that and then the second and third order effects as you're seeing now with Tesla, very possibly you would see some um, internally with Alphabet, maybe Whimo, maybe some of the Gemini robotics stuff, it might lead you into the other domains of robotics because we should remember that Whimo is a robot. Mhm. It just happens to be on four wheels. So you, you said that the next big thing, we can also throw that into AI package. The big aha moment might be in the space of robotics. What do you think that that would look like? Dispoint team is very focused on Gemini robotics, right? So we are definitely building the underlying models. Well, so we have a lot of investments there, and I think we also pretty cutting edge in our uh, research there. So we are definitely driving that direction. We obviously are thinking about applications in robotics. We'll, we'll kind of work seriously. We are partnering with a few companies today. But it's an area I would say stay tuned. We are, you know, we are yet to fully articulate our plans outside, but it's an area we are definitely committed to driving a lot of progress, but I think AI ends up driving that massive progress in robotics. The field has been held back uh, uh, for for a while. I mean, the hardware has made extraordinary uh, progress. Uh, the software had been the challenge, but you know, with AI now and uh, and and the and the generalized models we are building, uh, you know, we are building these models, getting them to work in the real world in a safe way, in a generalized way is the frontier we're pushing pretty hard on. Well, it's really nice to see the the models and the different teams integrated to where all of them are pushing towards one world model that's being built. To from all these different angles, multimodal. You're ultimately trying to get Gemini. So the same thing that would make AI mode really effective in answering your questions, which requires a kind of world model, is the same kind of thing that would help a robot be useful in the physical world. So everything is aligned. That that is what makes this moment so unique because running a company for the first time, you can do one investment in a very deep horizontal way. On top of it, you can like drive multiple businesses forward, right? And you know, and that's that's effectively what we are doing in Google and Alphabet, right? Yeah, it's all coming together like it was planned ahead of time, but it's not, of course, it's all distributed. I mean, if uh, Gmail and sheets and all these other incredible services. I can sing Gmail praises for years. I mean, it's just just revolutionized email, but the moment you start to integrate AI Gemini into Gmail, I mean, that's the other thing. Speaking of productivity multiplier, people complain about email, but that changed everything. Email, like the invention of email changed everything. And it's been ripe. There's been a few folks trying to revolutionize email, some of them on top of Gmail, but that's like ripe for innovation, not just spam filtering, but you uh, you you demoed a really nice demo of personalized responses, right? Personalized responses. And it at first, I was like, at first I felt really bad about that. But then I realized that's there's nothing wrong to feel bad about because will you uh, the example you gave is when a friend asks, you know, you went to whatever hiking location, uh, do you have any advice? And they just searches through all your information to give them good advice, and then you put the cherry on top, maybe some love or whatever camaraderie, but the formational aspect, the knowledge transfer it does for you, I think there'll be important moments like it should be like today if you write a card in your own handwriting and send it to someone, that's a special thing. Similarly, there'll be a time, I mean, to your friends, maybe your friend wrote and said he's not doing well or something, you know, those are moments you want to save your times for writing something, reaching out, but you know, like saying, give me all the details of the trip you took, you know, to me makes a lot of sense for a AI assistant to help you, right? And so I think both are important, but I think I think I'm excited about that direction. Yeah, I think ultimately it gives more time for us humans, us to do the things we humans find meaningful. And I think it scares a lot of people because we're going to have to ask ourselves the hard question of like, what do we find meaningful? And I'm sure there's answers. I, it's the old question of the meaning, meaning of existence is you, you have to try to figure that out. That might be ultimately uh, parenting or being creative in some domains of art or writing. And it it challenges to to to like, you know, it's a good question of to ask yourself, like, in my life, what is the thing that brings me most joy and fulfillment? And if I'm able to actually focus more time on that, that's really powerful. I think that's the uh, you know, that's the holy grail. If you get this right, I think it allows more people uh, to find that. I have to ask you on the programming front, uh, AI is getting really good at programming. Gemini, both the Agentic and just the LLM has been incredible. So, a lot of programmers are really worried that their jobs, they will lose their jobs, uh, how worried should they be and how should they adjust so they can be thriving in this new world where more and more code is written by AI? I think a few things, looking at Google, um, you know, we've given various stats around like, you know, 30% of uh, code now uses like AI generated suggestions or whatever it is, but the most important metric, and we carefully measure it, is like how much has our engineering velocity increased as a company due to AI, right? And it's like tough to measure, and we kind of rigorously try to measure it, and our estimates are that number is now at 10%. Right? Like now across the company, we've accomplished a 10% engineering velocity increase using AI, but we plan to hire engineers, more engineers next year, right? So you, because the opportunity space of what we can do is expanding too, right? And so I think hopefully, you know, for at least the near to midterm term, for many engineers, it frees up more and more of the, you know, even in engineering and coding, there are aspects which are so much fun, you're designing, you're architecting, you're solving a problem, there's a lot of grunt work, you know, which all goes hand in hand, but it hopefully takes a lot of that away, makes it even more fun to code, frees you up more time to create, problem solve, brainstorm with your fellow colleagues and so on, right? So that's that's the opportunity there. And second, I think like, you know, it'll attract, it'll put the creative power in more people's hands, which means people will create more, that means there'll be more engineers doing more things. So it's tough to fully predict, but you know, I, I think in general, in this moment, it feels like, you know, you know, people uh, adopt these tools and be better programmers, like there are more people playing chess now than ever before. Right? So uh, you know, it feels positive that way to me at least, speaking from within a Google context, uh, is how I would you know, talk to them about it. I still, I just know anecdotally, a lot of great programmers are generating a lot of code. So their productivity, they're not always using all the code, just you know, there's still a lot of editing, but like even for me, it's still programming as a side thing. I think I'm like 5x more productive. I don't, I, I think that's uh, even for a large code base that's touching a lot of users like Google's does. I'm imagining like very soon that productivity should be going up even more. The big unlock will be as we make the agent capabilities much more robust, right? I think that's what unlocks that next big wave. I think the 10% is like a massive number, like you know, if tomorrow like I showed up and said like you can improve like a large organization's productivity by 10%. When you have tens of thousands of engineers, that's a phenomenal number. Uh, and you know, that's different than what others cite as statistics, saying like, you know, like this percentage of code is now written by AI. I'm talking more about like overall productivity, the actual productivity, right? Engineering productivity, which is two different things and and which is the more important uh, metric. And but I think it'll get better, right? And like, you know, uh, I think there's no engineer who tomorrow, if you magically became 2x more productive, it's just going to create more things, you're going to create more value added things, and so I think they, you'll, you'll find more satisfaction in your job, right? So, and there's a lot of aspects, I mean, the actual Google codebase might just improve because it'll become more standardized, more um, easier for people to move about the codebase because AI will help with that, and therefore that will also allow the AI to understand the entire codebase better, which makes the engineering aspect, that's I've been using cursor a lot, uh, as as a way to program with Gemini and other models is like it. One of its powerful things is it's aware of the entire codebase, and that allows you to ask questions of it. It allows the agents to move about that code base in a really powerful way. I mean, that's a huge unlock. Think about like, you know, migrations, refactoring old coal bases. Refactoring. Yeah. I mean, think about like, you know, once we can do all this in a much better, more robust way than where we are today. I think in the end, everything will be written in JavaScript and run in Chrome. I think it's all going to that uh, direction. I mean, just for fun, Google has legendary code coding interviews, uh, like rigorous interviews for the engineers. How can you comment on how that has changed in the era of AI? It's just such a weird uh, you know, the whiteboard interview, I, I assume is not allowed to have some prompts. Such a a good question. Look, I do think, you know, we're making sure, you know, we'll we'll introduce at least one round of in-person interviews for people just to make sure the fundamentals are there. I think that'll end up being important, but it's an equally important skill. Look, if you can use these tools to generate better code, uh, like you know, I think I think that's an asset. And so uh, you know, I think uh, so overall, I think it's a it's a massive positive vibe coding engineer. Uh, do you recommend uh, pe people uh, students interested in programming still get an education uh, in computer science and college education? What do you think?\nI do. If you have a passion for computer science, I would, you know, computer science is obviously a lot more than programming alone, so I would, I still don't think I would change what you pursue. You um, I think AI will horizontally allow impact every field. It's pretty tough to predict in what ways. So any education in which you're learning good first principles thinking, I think is good education. You've revolutionized web browsing, you've revolutionized a lot of things over the years. Um, Android changed the game. It's an incredible uh, operating system. And we could talk for hours about Android. What does the future of Android look like? Is it is it possible it becomes more and more AI-centric? Uh, especially now that you throw into the mix Android XR with being able to do augmented reality, mixed reality and virtual reality in the physical world? Yeah. The best innovations in computing have come when you're uh, through a paradigm IO change, right? Like you know, when when with GUI and then with a graphical user interface and then with multi-touch in the context of mobile voice later on. Similarly, I feel like, you know, AR is that next paradigm. I think it was held back both the system integration challenges of making good AR is very, very hard. The second thing is you need AI to actually kind of, otherwise the IO is too complicated for you to have natural, seamless IO to that uh, uh, paradigm. AI ends up being super important, and so this is why project Astra ends up being super critical for that Android uh, XR world, uh, but it is, I think when you use glasses and you know, always been amazed like at at the how useful these things are going to be. So I look, I think it's a real opportunity for Android. I think XR is one way it'll kind of really come to life. But I think there's an opportunity to rethink the\n\n\nMobile OS too, right? I think we've been kind of living in this paradigm of like apps and shortcuts. All that won't go away. But again, like if you're trying to get stuff done at an operating system level, you know, it needs to be more agentic so that you can kind of describe what you want to do or like it proactively understands what you're trying to do, learns from how you're doing things over and over again, and kind of is adapting to you. All that is kind of like the unlock we need to go and do with a basic, efficient, minimalist UI.\n\nI've gotten a chance to try the glasses, and they're incredible. It's the little stuff. It's hard to put into words, but no latency. It just works. Even that little map demo where you look down and you look up, and there's a very smooth transition between the two, and useful, very small amount of useful information is shown to you. Enough not to distract from the world outside, but enough to provide a bit of context when you need it.\n\nAnd some of that be in order to bring that into reality, you have to solve a lot of the OS problems to make sure it works when you're integrating the AI into the whole thing. So, everything you do launches an agent that answers some basic question. A good moonshot, you know, it's crazy. No, but, but you know, I think, uh, we are, you know, but it's much closer to reality than, uh, other moonshots. You know, we expect to have classes in the hands of developers later this year and, and you know, in consumer science next year. So, it's an exciting time.\n\nYeah. Well, extremely well executed Beam, all the stuff, you know, cuz I sometimes you don't know, like somebody commented on a top comment on one of the demos of Beam. They said, uh, this will either be killed off in 5 weeks or revolutionize all meetings in 5 years. And there's very much Google tries so many things and sometimes sadly kills off very promising projects, but because there's so many other things to focus on. I use, I use so many Google products. Google Voice I still use. I'm so glad that's not being killed off. That's still alive. Thank you, whoever is defending that, cuz it's, it's, it's awesome, and it's great they keep innovating. I just want to list off just as a big thank you. So, search, obviously Google revolutionized. Chrome and all of these could be multi-hour conversations. Gmail, I've been singing Gmail praises forever. Maps, incredible technological innovation on revolutionizing mapping. Android, like we talked about, YouTube, like we talked about. AdSense, uh, Google Translate. For the academic minded, Google Scholar is incredible when with the book and also the scanning of the books. So, making all the world's knowledge, um, accessible, even with that knowledge is a kind of niche thing which Google Scholar is. Uh, and then obviously with DeepMind, uh, with Alpha Zero, AlphaFold, Alpha Evolve, I could talk forever about Alpha Evolve. That's mind-blowing. All of that released and as part of that, uh, set of things you've released in this year when, uh, those brilliant articles were written about Google is done. Uh, and, uh, like we talked about pioneering self-driving cars and quantum computing, which could be another thing that is lowkey is scuba diving. It's way to changing the world forever.\n\nUh, so another ptheads slash, um, micro kitchen question. If you build AGI, what kind of question would you ask it? What would you, what would you want to talk about? Definitively Google has created AGI that can basically answer any question. What topic are you going to? What, where's it, where's it? Where are you going? It's a great question. Um, maybe it's proactive by then and should tell me a few things I should know. But I think if I were to ask it, I think it'll help us understand ourselves much better. Um, in a way that'll surprise us, I think. Um, and so maybe that's you already see people do it with the products and so, but you know, in a AGI context, I think that'll be pretty powerful at a personal level or or general human nature at a personal level, like you talking to AGI. I think, I think, you know, uh, there is some chance it'll, it'll kind of understand you in a, in a very deep way. Uh, I think, uh, you know, in a profound way, that's a possibility. Uh, I, I think there is also the obvious thing of like, maybe it helps us understand the universe better. Um, you know, in a way that expands the frontiers of our understanding of the world. Uh, that is something super exciting. But look, I, I really don't know. I think, you know, I haven't, haven't had access to something that powerful yet. But I think those are all possibilities. I think on the personal level, asking questions about yourself could a sequence of questions like that about what makes me happy. I think we would be very surprised to learn those kind of the, um, a sequence of questions and answers. We might explore some profound truths in the way that sometimes art reveals to us, great books reveal to us, great conversations with loved ones reveal. Uh, things that are obvious in retrospect, but are nice when they're said. Uh, but for me, number one question is about how many alien civilizations are there? 100%. Are they... That's going to be your first question. Number one, how many living and dead alien civilizations? Uh, maybe a bunch of follow-ups like how close are they? Are they dangerous? Um, if, if there's no alien civilizations, why? Uh, or if there's no advanced alien civilizations, but bacteria-like life everywhere, why? What is the barrier preventing it from getting to that? Uh, is it because that there's, uh, that when you get sufficiently intelligent, you end up, uh, destroying ourselves because you need competition in order to develop an advanced civilization. And when you have competition, it's going to lead to military conflict and conflict eventually kills everybody. I don't know. I'm going to have that kind of discuss. Get an answer to the Fermi paradox. Yeah, exactly. And like have a real discussion about it. I'm not sure it's a, um, I'm realizing now with your answer is a more productive, um, answer because I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that information, but maybe it speaks to the general human curiosity that Liz talked about that we're all just really curious and making the world's information accessible allows our curiosity to be satiated some with AI even more. We can be more and more curious and learn more about the world, about ourselves. And in so doing, I always wonder if I don't know if you can comment on like, is it possible to measure the, not the GDP productivity increase like we talked about, but maybe the whatever that increases the, the breadth and depth of human knowledge that Google has unlocked with Google Search and now with AI mode with Gemini is a difficult thing to measure. Many years ago there was a, I think it was a MIT study, they just estimated the impact of Google Search and they basically said it's the equivalent to on a per person basis, it's few thousands of dollars per year per person, right? Uh, like is the value that got created per year, right? And, and, but it's, yeah, it's tough to capture these things, right? You kind of take it, take it for granted as these things come, uh, and, and the frontier keeps moving. Think, but, uh, you know, how do you measure the value of something like AlphaFold over time, right? And, and, and so on. So, and also the increase in quality of life when you learn more. I have to say, like with, uh, some of the programming I do done by AI, for some reason, I'm more excited to program, uh, and so the same with knowledge, with discovering things about the world, uh, it makes you more excited to be alive. It makes you more curious to, and it keeps the more curious you are, the more exciting it is to live and experience the world. And it's very hard to, I don't know if that makes you more productive. It probably not nearly as much as it makes you happy to be alive. And that's a hard thing to measure. The quality of life increases some of these things do.\n\nAs AI continues to get better and better at everything that humans do, what do you think is the biggest thing that makes us humans special?\n\nLook, I, I, I think it's stuff taught in the essence of humanity. There's something about, uh, you know, the consciousness we have, what makes us uniquely human. Maybe the lines will blur over time, uh, and, and it's tough to articulate, but, uh, I hope, hopefully, you know, we live in a world where if you make resources more plentiful and make the world lesser of a zero-sum game over time, right? And, and which it's not, but you know, in a resource constraint environment, people perceive it to be, right? And, and, um, and so I hope the the values of what makes us uniquely human, empathy, kindness, all that surfaces more is the aspirational hope I have. Yeah, it multiplies the compassion, but also the curiosity, just the, the banter, the debates we'll have about the meaning of it all. And I, I, I also think in the scientific domains, all the incredible work that DeepMind is doing, I think we'll still continue to to play to explore scientific questions, uh, mathematical questions, physics questions, even as AI gets better and better at helping us solve some of the questions. Sometimes the question itself is a really difficult thing. Uh, both the right new questions to ask and the answers to them and, and, and the self-discovery process which it'll drive. I think, you know, our early work with both co-scientist and Alpha Evolve, just super exciting to see what gives you hope about the future of human civilization.\n\nI've always, I'm an optimist and you know, I, I, I look at, um, now if you were to say you take the journey of human civilization. Uh, it's been, you know, we've relentlessly made the world better, right? In many ways. At any given moment in time, there are big issues to work through. It may look, but you know, I always ask myself the question, would you have been born now or any other time in the past? I most often, not most often, almost always would rather be born now, right? You know, and so that's the extraordinary thing the human civilization has accomplished, right? And like, you know, and we, we've kind of constantly made the world a better place. And so something tells me as humanity, we always rise collectively to drive that, uh, frontier forward. So I expect it to be no different in the future.\n\nI agree with you totally. I'm truly grateful to be alive in this moment, and I'm also really excited for the future, and the work, uh, you and incredible teams here are doing is one of the big reasons I'm excited for the future. So thank you. Thank you for all the cool products you've built, and please don't kill Google Voice.\n\nThank you. We won't. Yeah. Thank you for talking today. This was incredible.\n\nThank you. Real pleasure. I appreciate it.\n\nThanks for listening to this conversation with Sundar Pichai. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfreedman.com/sponsors. Shortly before this conversation, I got a chance to get a couple of demos that frankly blew my mind. The engineering was really impressive. The first demo was Google Beam and the second demo was the XR glasses and some of it was caught on video. So, I thought I would include here some of those, uh, video clips.\n\nHey, Lex. My name is Andrew. I lead the Google Beam team, and we're going to be excited to show you a demo. We're going to show you, I think, a glimpse of something new. So, that's the idea. A way to connect, a way to feel present from anywhere with anybody you care about. Here's Google Beam. This is a development platform that we've built. So, there's a prototype here of Google Beam. There's one right down the hallway. I'm going to go down and turn that on in a second. We're going to experience it together. We'll be back in the same room. Wonderful.\n\nWa. Okay. Here we are. All right. This is real already. Wow. This is real. Good to see you. This is Google Beam. We're trying to make it feel like you and I could be anywhere in the world, but when these magic windows open, we're back together. I see you exactly the same way you see me. It's almost like we're sitting at the table sharing a table together. I could learn from you, talk to you, share a meal with you, get to know you. So, you can feel the depth of this. Yeah. Great to meet you. Wow. Wow.\n\nSo, for people who probably can't even imagine what this looks like, there's a, there's a 3D version of It looks real. You look real. It looks to me, it looks real to you. It looks like you're coming out of the screen. We quickly believe, um, once we're in beam that we're just together. Like you settle into it. You're naturally attuned to seeing the world like this and you just get used to seeing people this way, but literally from anywhere in the world with these magic screens. This is incredible. It's a neat technology. Wow. So I saw demos of this, but they don't come close to the experience of this. Yeah. I think one of the top YouTube comments on one of the demos I saw was like, why would I want a high definition? Like I'm trying to turn off the camera, but this actually is, this feels like the camera has been turned off and we're just in the same room together. This is really compelling. That's right. I, I know it's kind of late in the day, too, so I brought you a snack just in case you're a little bit hungry. But, um... So what can you push it further? And it just becomes... Let's... Let's try to float it between rooms. You know, it kind of fades it from my room into your room. And then, and then you see my hand, the depth of my hand. Of course. Yes, of course. Yeah. It feels like you, um, try this. Try give me a high five. And there's almost a sensation of feeling touch. You almost feel because you're so attuned to, you know, that should be a high five. It feeling like you could connect with somebody that way. So, it's kind of a magical experience. Oh, this is really nice. How much does it cost? Yeah, we've got a lot of companies testing it. We just announced that we're going to be bringing it to offices soon as a set of products. We've got some companies helping us build these screens. Um, but eventually, I think this will be in almost every screen. There's nothing I'm not wearing anything. Well, I'm wearing a suit tie to clarify. I ain't wearing clothes. This is not CGI. But outside of that, cool. And the audio is really good. And you can see me in the same three-dimensional way. Yeah, the audio is spatialized. So if I'm talking from here,\n\n\nOf course, it sounds like I'm talking from here.\nYou know, if I move to the other side of the room here.\nSo these little subtle cues, these really matter to bring people together.\nAll the non-verbals, all the emotion, the things that are lost today.\nHere it is.\nWe put it back into the system.\nYou pulled this off.\nHoly, they pulled it off and integrated into this.\nI saw the translation also.\nRight.\nThis is the...\nYeah, we got a bunch of things.\nLet me show you a couple kind of cool things.\nLet's do a little bit of work together.\nMaybe we could um critique one of your latest uh um so you know it's you and I work together, so of course we're in the same room, but with this superpower, I can bring other things in here with me.\nUm and it's it's nice, you know, it's like we could sit together, we could watch something, we could work.\nUm, we've shared meals as a team together in this system, but once you do the presence aspect of this, you want to bring some other superpowers to it.\nAnd so, you could do review code together.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nI've got some uh slides I'm working on.\nYou know, maybe you could help me with this.\nKeep your eyes on me for a second.\nI'll slide back into the center.\nI didn't really move, but the system just kind of puts us in the right spot and knows where we need to be.\nOh, so you just turn to your laptop, the system moves you, and then it does the overlay automatically.\nIt kind of morphs the room to put things in the spot that they need to to be in.\nEverything has a place in the room.\nEverything has a sense of presence or spatial consistency and that kind of makes it feel like we're together with us and other things.\nI I should also say you're not just three-dimensional.\nIt feels like you're leaning like out of the screen.\nYou you're like coming out of the screen.\nYou're not just in that world three-dimensional.\nYeah, exactly.\nHoly crap.\nMove back to center.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nLet let me tell you how this works.\nYou probably already have the the premise of it, but there's two things, two really hard things that we put together.\nOne is a AI video model.\nSo, there's a set of cameras.\nYou asked kind of about those earlier.\nThere's six color cameras just like webcams that we have today.\nTaking video streams and feeding them into our AI model and turning that into a 3D video of you and I.\nIt's effectively a light field.\nSo, it's kind of an interactive 3D video that you can see from any perspective.\nThat's transmitted over to the second thing and that's a light field display and it's happening bi-directionally.\nI see you and you see me both in our light field displays.\nThese are effectively flat televisions or flat displays but they have the sense of dimensionality, depth, size is correct.\nYou can see shadows and lighting are correct and everything's correct from your vantage point.\nSo if you move around ever so slightly and I hold still, you see a different perspective here.\nYou see kind of things that were occluded become revealed.\nYou see shadows that you know move in the way they should move.\nAll of that's computed and generated using our AI video model for you.\nIt's based on your eye position.\nWhere does the right scene need to be placed in this light field display for you just to feel present?\nIt's real time, no latency.\nI'm not seeing lat.\nYou weren't freezing up at all.\nNo, no, I hope not.\nI think it's it's you and I together real time.\nThat's what you need for real communication and at a at a quality level realistic.\nIs it possible to do three people?\nLike is that going to move that way also?\nYeah.\nLet me let me kind of show you.\nSo if if she enters the room with us, you can see her, you can see me.\nAnd if we had more people, you eventually lose the sense of presence.\nYou kind of shrink people down.\nYou lose a sense of scale.\nSo think of it as the window fits a certain number of people.\nIf you want to fit a big group of people, you want, you know, the boardroom or the big room, you need like a much wider window.\nUm if you want to see, you know, just grandma and the kids, you can do smaller windows.\nSo everybody has a seat at the table or everybody has a sense of where they belong and there's kind of the sense of presence that's obeyed.\nIf you have too many people, you kind of go back to like 2D metaphors that we're used to.\nPeople in tiles placed anywhere for the image I'm seeing.\nDid you have to get scanned?\nI I mean I see you without being scanned.\nSo it's just so much easier if you don't have to wear anything.\nYou don't have to pre-scan.\nYou just do it the way it's supposed to happen without anybody having to learn anything or put anything on.\nI thought you had to solve the the scanning problem, but here you don't.\nIt's just cameras.\nIt's just vision.\nIt it's video.\nYeah.\nWe're not trying to kind of make an approximation of you because everything you do every day matters.\nYou know, I cut myself shaving.\nI put on a pin.\nUm all the little kind of, you know, aspects of you, those just happen.\nUm we don't have the time to scan or kind of capture those or dress avatars.\nWe we kind of appear as we appear.\nAnd so all that's transmitted truthfully as it's happening.\nStill, how you doing?\nGood to meet you.\nNice to meet you.\nSo, um as Max mentioned, got the eye glasses here.\nWe start with um a foundation of great glasses, something stylish, lightweight, wearable.\nAnd we say, how can we build great technology and experiences on top of that?\nUm, one of the core tenants of the Android XR platform, this idea of a multimodal conversational device, see what you see, hear what you hear.\nSo, we've got a camera, you've got speakers, multiple microphones for speaker isolation.\nUm, I'll give you a chance to try these yourself.\nYeah.\nSorry, woke it up there.\nWhoa.\nYeah.\nSo, the first thing you see, it's a super uh simple, straightforward home screen.\nSo, you probably see the time, the weather, calendar, appointments there.\nThis is designed to be sort of your one-stop shop for quick glanceable information throughout the day.\nWe want to be something that's um easy to, you know, get what you need and then go back to what you're doing.\nSo, you can imagine, you know, turning on the display, getting that quick glance, and then um continuing on your way.\nYou can be fully conversational at this point.\nYou can um ask questions, for example, about the paintings.\nYou can interrupt.\nYou can ask follow-up questions.\nAnd as I mentioned before, if you want to at any time pause, you just tap there on the right.\nGemini, how much does this painting cost?\nThe painting is called the bridge of belief leap 1875 by Arman Gome.\nIt appears to be a print and it would be impossible to know its cost without finding the seller.\nOkay, so this is fake.\nI understand.\nWhy do humans pay so much money for paintings?\nPeople pay a lot for paintings because of their artistic merit, the artist, the decent rarity, and for the appreciation.\nSo, uh, a few more things that we want to show you just for, uh, sake of time.\nDid you go ahead and long press on the side again to to sleep Gemini there?\nUm, there you go.\nUm, did you catch Google IO last week by any chance?\nSo, you might have seen on stage the uh, Google Maps experience very briefly.\nWant to give you a chance to get a sense of what that feels like today.\nYou can imagine you're walking down the street.\nIf you look up like you're walking straight ahead, you get quick turn-by-turn directions.\nSo, you have a sense of what the next turn is like, sticking your phone in your pocket.\nOh, that's so intuitive.\nSometimes you need that quick sense of which way is the right way.\nSometimes.\nYeah.\nSo you, let's say you're coming out subway, getting out of a cab, you can just glance down at your feet.\nWe have it set up to translate from Russian to English.\nI think I get to wear the glasses.\nYou speak to me if you don't mind.\nI can speak Russian.\nI'm doing well.\nHow are you doing?\nTempted to swear.\nTempted to say inappropriate things.\nUh I see it transcribed in real time and so obviously you know based on the uh different languages and the sequence of subjects and verbs there's a slight delay sometimes but it's really just like subtitles for the real world.\nThank you for this.\nAll right, back to me.\nHopefully watching videos of me having my mind blown like the apes in 2001 Space Odyssey playing with a monolith was uh somewhat interesting.\nUh like I said, I was very impressed.\nAnd now I thought if it's okay, I could make a few additional comments about the episode and just in general.\nIn this conversation with Sundar Pichai, I discussed the concept of the Neolithic package which is the set of innovations that came along with the first agricultural revolution about 12,000 years ago which included the formation of social hierarchies, the early primitive forms of government, labor specialization, domestication of plants and animals, early forms of trade, large scale cooperations of humans like that required to build yes the pyramids and temples like Gobeclete.\nI think this may be the right way to actually talk about the inventions that changed human history, not just as a single invention, but as a kind of network of innovations and transformations that came along with it.\nAnd the productivity multiplier framework that I mentioned in the episode I think is a nice way to try to concretize the impact of each of these inventions under consideration.\nAnd uh we have to remember that each node in the network of the sort of fast follow-on inventions is in itself a productivity multiplier.\nSome are additive, some are multiplicative.\nSo in some sense the size of the network in the package is the thing that matters when you're trying to rank the impact of uh inventions on human history.\nThe easy picks for the period of biggest transformation at least in sort of uh modern day discourse is the industrial revolution or even uh in the 20th century the computer or the internet.\nI think it's because it's easiest to intuit it for modern-day humans the impact the exponential impact uh of those technologies.\nBut recently and I suppose this changes week to week but uh I have been doing a lot of reading on ancient human history.\nSo recently my pick for the number one invention would have to be the first agricultural revolution.\nThe Neolithic package that led to the formation of human civilizations.\nThat's what enabled the scaling of the collective intelligence machine of humanity and for us to become the early bootloader for the next 10,000 years of technological progress which yes includes AI and the tech that builds on top of AI.\nAnd of course it could be argued that the word invention doesn't properly apply to the agricultural revolution.\nI think actually uh Yuval Noah Harari argues that it wasn't the humans who were the inventors but uh a handful of plant species namely wheat, rice, and potatoes.\nThis is strictly a fair perspective, but I'm having fun like I said with this discussion here.\nI just think of the entire earth as a system that continuously transforms and I'm using the term invention in that context asking the question of when was the biggest leap on the log scale plot of uh human progress.\nWill AI, AGI, ASI eventually take the number one spot in this ranking?\nI think it has a very good chance to do so due again to the size of the network of inventions that will come along with it.\nI think we discuss in this podcast uh the kind of things that would be included in the so-called AI package but I think there's uh a lot more possibilities including uh discussed in previous podcasts in many previous podcasts including with Darede uh talking on the biological innovation side the science progress side in this podcast I think we talk about something that I'm particularly excited about in the near term which is unlocking the cognitive capacity of the entire landscape of brains that is the human species.\nMaking it more accessible through education and through machine translation making information knowledge and the rapid learning and innovation process accessible to more humans to the entire 8 billion if you will.\nSo I do think language or machine translation applied to all the different methods that we use on the internet to discover knowledge is uh a big unlock.\nBut there are a lot of other stuff in the so-called AI package like discuss with Daario curing all major human diseases.\nHe really focuses on that in the machines of love and grace essay.\nI think there will be huge leaps in productivity for human programmers and semi-autonomous human programmers.\nSo, humans in the loop, but most of the programming is done by AI agents and then moving that towards a superhuman AI researcher that's doing the research that develops and programs the AI system in itself.\nI think there would be huge transformative effects from autonomous vehicles.\nThese are the things that we maybe don't immediately understand or we understand from an economics perspective.\nBut there will be a point when AI systems are able to interpret, understand, interact with the human world to a sufficient degree to where many of the manually controlled human and loop systems we rely on become fully autonomous.\nAnd I think mobility is such a big part of human civilization that there will be effects on that that they're not just economic but are social, cultural and so on.\nAnd there's a lot more things I could talk about for a long time.\nSo obviously the integration utilization of AI in the creation of art, film, music I think the digitalization and um automating basic functions of government and then integrating AI into that process thereby decreasing corruption and cost and increasing transparency and uh efficiency.\nI think we as humans, individual humans will continue to transition further and further into cyborgs.\nSort of there's already a AI in the loop of the human condition and that will become increasingly so as AI becomes uh more powerful.\nThe thing I'm obviously really excited about is major breakthroughs in science and not just on the medical front but uh on physics fundamental physics which would then lead to energy breakthroughs increasing the chance that we become we actually become a Kardashev type one civilization and then enabling us in so doing to do interstellar exploration of space and colonization of space.\nI think they're also in the near term much like with the uh industrial revolution that led to rapid specialization of skills of expertise there might be a great sort of despization.\nSo as the AI systems become superhuman experts at particular fields, there might be greater and greater value to being the integrator of AIS for humans to be sort of generalists.\nAnd so the great value of the human mind will come\n\n\nFrom the generalists, not the specialists.\nThat's a real possibility that that changes the way we are about the world, that we want to know a little bit of a lot of things and move about the world in that way.\nThat could have, when passing a certain threshold, a complete shift in who we are as a collective intelligence, as a human species.\nAlso, as an aside, when uh thinking about the invention that was the greatest in human history, again, for a bit of fun, we have to remember that all of them build on top of each other.\nAnd so we need to look at the delta, the step change on the, I would say, impossibly to perfectly measure plot of exponential human progress.\nReally, we can go back to the entire history of life on Earth.\nAnd a previous podcast guest, Nick Lane, does a great job of this in his book Life Ascending, listing these 10 major inventions throughout the evolution of life on Earth, like DNA, photosynthesis, complex cells, sex, movement, sight, all those kinds of things.\nI forget the full list that's on there, but I think that's so far from the human experience that my intuition about, let's say, productivity multipliers of those particular invention completely uh breaks down and uh a different framework is needed to understand the impact of these inventions of evolution.\nThe origin of life on Earth or even the Big Bang itself, of course, is the OG invention that set the stage for all the rest of it.\nAnd there are probably many more turtles under that which are yet to be discovered.\nSo anyway, we live in interesting times, fellow humans.\nI do believe the set of positive trajectories for humanity outnumber the set of negative trajectories, but not by much.\nSo uh let's not mess this up.\nAnd now let me leave you with some words from French philosopher Jean Debrier.\nOut of difficulties grow miracles.\nThank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n",

    "cleanText": "And you see that manifest itself on D-Day, where you've got 6,939 vessels, of which there are 1,213 warships, 4,127 assaultcraft, 155,000 men landed and dropped from the air in a 24-hour period.\nIt is phenomenal.\nIt is absolutely phenomenal.\nThe following is a conversation with James Holland, a historian specializing in World War II, who has written a lot of amazing books on the subject, especially covering the Western Front, often providing fascinating details at multiple levels of analysis, including strategic, operational, tactical, technological, and of course, the human side, the personal accounts from the war.\nHe also co-hosts a great podcast on World War II called We Have Ways of Making You Talk.\nThis is a Lex Fridman Podcast.\nTo support it, please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfreeman.com/sponsors.\nAnd now, dear friends, here's James Holland.\nIn volume one of the war in the west, your book series on World War II, you write, \"The Second World War witnessed the deaths of more than 60 million people from over 60 different countries.\nEntire cities were laid waste.\nNational borders were redrawn.\nAnd many millions more people found themselves displaced.\nOver the past couple of decades, many of those living in the Middle East or parts of Africa, the Balkans, Afghanistan, and even the United States may feel justifiably that these troubled times have already proved the most traumatic in their recent past.\nYet, globally, the Second World War was and remains the single biggest catastrophe of modern history.\nIn terms of human drama, it is unrivaled.\nNo other war has affected so many lives in such a large number of countries.\nSo what to you makes World War II the biggest catastrophe in human drama in modern history and maybe from a historian perspective the most fascinating subject to study?\"\nThe thing about World War II is it really is truly global.\nYou know, it's fought in deserts.\nIt's fought in the Arctic.\nIt's fought across oceans.\nIt's fought in the air.\nIt's in jungle.\nIt's in the hills.\nIt is on the beaches.\nIt's also on the Russian step and it's also in Ukraine.\nSo it's that global nature of it.\nAnd I just think, you know, where there's war, there is always incredible human drama.\nAnd I think for most people, and certainly the true in my case, you get drawn to the human drama of it.\nIt's that thought that, you know, gosh, if I'd been 20 years old, how would I have dealt with it?\nYou know, would I have been in the army?\nWould I have been in the air force?\nWould I been on a Royal Navy destroyer, or you know, how would I have coped with it and how would I have dealt with that separation?\nI mean, I've interviewed people who were away for four years.\nI remember talking to a tank man from Liverpool in England called Sam Bradshaw, and he went away for four years, and when he came home, he'd been twice wounded.\nHe'd been very badly wounded in North Africa, and then he was shot in the neck in Italy.\nEventually got home, and when he came home, his mother had turned gray.\nHis little baby sister, who had been, you know, 13 when he left, was now a young woman.\nHis old school had been destroyed by Luftwaffer bombs.\nHe didn't recognize the place.\nAnd do you know what he did?\nHe joined up again, went back out of Europe and was one of the first people in Bellson.\nSo, you know, what was his justification for that for joining right back?\nHe just felt completely disconnected to home.\nHe felt that the gulf of time, his experiences had separated him from all the normalities of life.\nAnd he felt that the normalities of the life that he had known before he'd gone away to war had just been severed in a really kind of cruel way that he didn't really feel he was able to confront at that particular point, but he decided to rejoin.\nCouldn't go back to the Third World Royal Tank Regiment.\nSo, it went back to a different unit.\nWent from kind of the Italian campaign to European theater.\nDidn't see so much action at the end, but you know, like a lot of British troops, if you were in a certain division at a certain time, you know, you ended up passing very close to Bellson, and you know, you suddenly realized, okay, this was the right thing to do, you know, we did have to get rid of Nazism, we did have to do this because this is the consequence.\nIt's not just the oppression, it's just not just the secret police, it's not just the expansionism of Nazism, it is also, you know, the Holocaust, which hadn't been given its name at that point, but you know, you're witnessing this kind of untold or cruelty.\nAnd I always, you know, I've always sort of I think a lot about Sam.\nI mean, he's no longer with us, but um, he was one of the kind of first people that I interviewed, and I interviewed him at great length.\nAnd, um, and I know you like a long interview, Lex.\nAnd, um, and I totally, totally get that because when you have a long interview, you really start getting to the nuts and bolts of it.\nOne of the frustrations for me when I'm looking at oral histories of Second World War vets is usually they're kind of, you know, they're put on YouTube or they're put on a museum website, they're 30 minutes, you know, an hour if you're lucky, and there you're just scratching the surface.\nYou never, you never really get to know it, and you feel that they're just repeating kind of stuff they've read in books themselves after the war and stuff.\nAnd you know, I was kind of leave feeling frustrated that that I haven't had a chance to kind of grill them on the kind of stuff that I would grill them on if I was put in front of them.\nSo, Tank Man, what was maybe the most epic, the most intense, or the most interesting story that he told you?\nWell, I do remember him telling me, uh, funny enough, it's not really about the conflict.\nI remember him telling me about the importance of letters.\nAnd there was this guy who literally every few weeks, you know, post would arrive intermitt\n\n\nApparently, there was no kind of sort of regular post.\nSo it was supposed to be regular, but it didn't come around regularly.\nSo you might suddenly get a flurry of five all in one day.\nBut he said it was this guy and um in his tank, a member of a different tank troop.\nIt was a good friend of his in the same squadron.\nGet British Huff Squadrons for their armor and uh which as Americans would have a company.\nI should say that in your book, one of the wonderful things you do is you use the correct term in the language.\nFor the particular army involved, whether it's the German or the British or the American.\nWell, that's not to be pretentious.\nThat's really just so it because you're dealing with so many numbers and different units and it can go over your head and you can get sort of consumed by the detail if you're not careful.\nAnd as a reader, it can be very unsatisfying because you just can't keep pace of everything.\nUm, so one of the things about writing in the vernacular German or or in the American spelling armore rather than ar maua as we would Brits would um spell it is it just immediately tells the reader, okay, this is American, okay, I've got that or this is German, I've got that or Italian or whatever it might be.\nBut yeah, to go back to Sam.\nSam, this there was this guy in in in his squadron and he'd get his letters from his girlfriend, his wife, and he said it was like it was like a soap opera.\nHe said we all just waited for his letters to come in so we could find out, you know, whether his, you know, his daughter had, you know, got to school, okay, or something, you know, won the swimming contest or whatever it was.\nYou know, the sort of details of this sort of day-to-day kind of benile life was just absolute catnip to these guys.\nThey absolutely loved it.\nAnd then the letter arrived, the Dear John letter, saying, \"Sorry, I found someone else and and it's over.\"\nAnd his friend was just absolutely devastated.\nIt was the only thing that was keeping him going.\nThis sort of sense of this sort of continuity of of home, this sort of this this foundation of his life back at home.\nAnd Sam said he could see was in a really really bad way.\nMhm.\nAnd he thought, uh, he's going to do something stupid.\nAnd he went up to him and he said, \"Look, you know, I know it's bad and I know it's terrible and I know you're absolutely devastated, but you got your mates here.\nJust don't do anything silly.\nJust, you know, maybe, you know, when it's all over, you can patch things up or sort things out.\"\nAnd he said, you know, you got to understand it from her point of view.\nYou know, it's a long way.\nYou haven't seen you for 2 years.\nThis kind of stuff, you know, so just just don't do anything rash.\nAnd of course, the next next engagement, two days later, he was killed.\nAnd he said it was just a kind of he could he just knew that was going to happen.\nHe said it was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.\nThat's something I've never forgotten that story.\nAnd I just thought, you know, it's about human drama.\nYou know, that's that's that's the truth of it.\nAnd how people react to this totally alien situation.\nYou know, for the most part, the Second World War is fought by ordinary everyday people doing extraordinary things.\nAnd I think that's something that's so fascinating.\nI suspect I I think I instinctively I'm quite slap dash I think.\nSo I think I would have I'd have bought it literally.\nI don't think it would have ended well for me.\nI just I'm just a bit careless.\nYeah.\nI think I also have an element in me where I can believe in the idea of nation and fight for a nation especially when the conflict is as grand.\nThere are things worse than death.\nYes.\nAs as the propaganda would explain very clearly but also in reality.\nYes.\nSo a nation you know France, Britain was you know maybe facing the prospect of being essentially enslaved.\nThe Soviet Union was facing the prospect of being enslaved literally.\nI mean it was very very clearly stated what they're going to do.\nThey're going to repopulate the land with Germanic people.\nSo well they're not just going to do that.\nThey're also going to starve lots and lots of um Soviet individuals to death by the hunger plan, for example, which is planned, you know, really very casually and not by the, you know, this is not SS units or anything like this.\nThis is the Vermach.\nThis is the economic division of the Obert Commando de Vermac, the German combined general staff.\nGeneral Gayorg Thomas comes up with you know and Herman Baka they come up with the uh who's the kind of minister for food they come up you know what are we going to do you know we haven't got enough food you know largely because German um farming is inefficient and they think well you know this is part of we'll go in and we'll take the food and there's been this colossal urbanization of the Soviet Union since the revolution in 1917 so they're just not going to get their food you know these these people in these cities cuz we're going to take it all and that's going to lead to that's going to lead to a lot of deaths.\nYou know, teen millions is the phrase that Gail Thomas used.\nSo, let's talk about the hunger plan.\nHow important was the hunger plan and lab to Nazi ideology and to the whole Nazi war machine?\nIt's central to the whole thing.\nThis is all about this notion that is embedded into Hitler's mind and into the minds of the Nazi party right from the word go is there is a big sort of global conspiracy the Jewish bolevik plot I mean completely misplaced that Jews and Bolsheviks go hand in hand somehow dovetail they don't obviously and the whole ideology is to crush this you know part of the way the Nazis think the way Hitler thinks is there is them and there's us.\nWe are the white northern European Aryans.\nWe should be\n\n\nThe master race. We've been threatened by a global Jewish bulvic plot. We've been stabbed in the back in 1918 at the end of the First World War. We need to overcome this. This is an existential battle for future survival. It's a terrible task that has befallen our generation, but we have to do this. We have to overcome this or else we have no future. We will be crushed. It's absolutely cut and dry. And one of the things about Hitler is that he is a very kind of black and white, them or us, either or kind of person. It's always one thing or the other. It's a thousand-year Reich or it's Armageddon. There is no middle ground. There's no gray area. It's just one or the other. And that's how that's his worldview. And the reason he came to the four was because of the crystal clear clarity of his message, which is we've been stabbed in the back. There is a global plot. We have to overcome this. We are naturally the master race. We have to reassert ourselves. We have to get rid of global jewelry. We have to get rid of global Bolshevism, and we have to prevail or else. But if we do prevail, what an amazing world it's going to be. So, so he starts with this, you know, every speech he does always starts with the same way. Always starts from a kind of negative and always ends with an incredible positive, this sort of rabble-rousing crescendo of, of, of, if you're in the front row, spittle halattosis and justiculation. I mean, you've seen pictures of him. I mean, I don't know if you've ever seen, but he's, he's, he's almost, he wants to grab the air and clutch it to him. Um, you know, you can see the kind of the venom coming out of his mouth just in a single still photograph. I mean, it, it, it's amazing. There's um, apps you can get now where where you can translate his speeches, you know, just, and it just sounds, you know, by today's standards, you would just think what a load of absolute wibble. I mean, just total nonsense. But, but you have to kind of put yourself back in the shoes of people listening to him in 1922 or 23 or indeed 1933 and see how kind of captivating that is to a certain part of the part of the population. So yes, so, so the, so to go back to your original point, Lebensraum is absolutely part of it. So what you do is you crush the Bolsheviks, you crush world jewelry, then you expand, you know, Britain has had this incredible empire, global empire, you know, Germany needs that too. Germany's stuck in Europe. It doesn't have access to the world's oceans. So, we're not going to be a maritime empire. We're going to be, we're going to be a land mass empire, the whole of land mass of Europe and into Asia. That's going to be us. And we're going to take that land. We're going to take the bread basket of Ukraine. We're going to use that for our own ends. We're going to spread our, our, uh, we're going to make ourselves rich, but we're also going to spread our peoples. We're going to spread the Aryan northern master race throughout, um, throughout Europe and into the traditional Slavic areas, and we will prevail and come out on top. And so you have to understand that that that everything about Operation Barbarossa, the planned invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, is totally wrapped up in the Nazi ideology. And people, you know, I, I've read it that historians go, if only Hitler had realized that, you know, the Ukrainians had been quite happy to kind of fight on his side. You know, if only he'd actually brought some of these Jewish scientists and kind of into the Nazi fold, then Germany might have prevailed in World War II. And you kind of think, well, you're missing the entire point. That's just never going to happen because this is an ideological war. Yeah. This is not a pragmatic, rational leader. No, I mean part of his effectiveness, we should say, is probably this singular belief in this ideology. There's pros and cons for an effective military machine, probably having that singular focus is effective. Yes. Except that when you're making military decisions, if those decisions are always being bracketed by an ideology which is fundamentally flawed from a pragmatic point of view as much as a kind of ethical, you know, a kind of reasonable point of view, um, you're kind of opening yourselves up for, for trouble. I mean, this is this is a problem he has with Barbarossa. You know, they, they realize very early on in 1941 when they're, when they're wargaming this whole operation that it's not going to work. And so, you know, there people like, like General Pow who's on the uh, general staff at the time, you know, he's, he's given a kind of, you know, he's in charge of kind of wargaming this and he goes, \"This isn't going to work.\" And Keitel, who is the uh, chief of the OKW, goes, \"No, no, no, no, no. Go back and make it work.\" He goes, \"Okay.\" So he comes up with a plan that does work, but it's bogus. I mean, it's just, it doesn't work because they don't have enough. They don't have enough motorization. You know, they go into Barbarossa with 2,000 different types of vehicle. You know, every single one of those vehicles has to have, you know, different distributor caps and different leads and plugs and all sorts of different parts. You know, there's the interoperability of the of the German mechanized arm is super inefficient. And so you've got huge problems because they kind of think, well, you know, we, we took France in 1940 and that's kind of one of the most modern countries in the world with, you know, one of the greatest armies and armed forces in the world, and we did that in six weeks. So, you know, Soviet Union, look, they struggled against Finland for goodness sake.\n\n\nI mean, how hard can it be, you know, but what you're failing to understand is that attacking the Soviet Union is over a geographical land mass 10 times the size of France just on the frontage, and you haven't really got much more mechanization than you had in May 1940 when they attacked the low countries in France, and you've actually got less Luftwaffe aircraft to support you, and you just do not have the operational mechanics to make it work successfully.\nI mean, it is largely down to incompetence of the Red Army and the Soviet leadership in the summer of 1941 that they get as far as they do.\nI mean, you know, Barbarossa should never have come close to being a victory.\nLet's talk through it.\nSo, Operation Barbar Roa that you're mentioning, and we'll go back.\nYes.\nWe jump straight into it.\nI've eaten off two years of war.\nSo this is June 1941, Operation Barbar Roa, when Hitler invades the Soviet Union with I think the largest invading force in history up to that point collectively.\nYeah.\nAnd there's three prongs: Army Group North, Army Group Center, Army Group South.\nNorth is going to Leningrad.\nCenter is going, uh, it's the strongest group going directly towards Moscow.\nAnd South is going and targeting Ukraine and the caucus.\nSo can you linger on that on the details of this plan?\nWhat was the thinking?\nWhat was the strategy?\nWhat was the tactics?\nWhat was the logistics?\nNow we should, there's so many things to say, but one of them is to say that you often emphasize the importance of three ways to analyze military conflict: the strategic, the operational, and the tactical.\nAnd operation of those is often not given enough time attention, and it's the logistics that make the war machine really work successfully or fail.\nYeah, that's absolutely, um, absolutely spot on.\nAnd it's interesting because the vast majority of, uh, general histories of World War II tend to focus on the strategic and the tactical.\nSo what do I mean by that?\nWorld strategic, just for the, for those who don't know, that's your overall war aims, you know, get to Moscow, whatever it might be, conquer the world, that's your strategy.\nThe tactical side of things is that's the coalace of war, that's the attritional bit, that's the following his spitfire, the tank crew, the soldier in his foxhole, it's the actual kinetic fighting bit.\nThe operational bit is the level of war that that links the strategic to the tactical, so it is absolutely factories, it's economics, it's shipping, it's supply chains, it's how you manage your war.\nAnd one of the things where I think people have been guilty in the past, historians have been guilty in the past is by judging warfare all on the same level.\nBut obviously every competent nation has a different approach to war because of the nation they are, the size they are, their geographical location.\nSo Britain, for example, is an island nation.\nIts priority is the Royal Navy, which is why the Royal Navy is known as the senior service.\nAnd you know, in 1939, it's easy to forget it now when you see how depleted Britain is today, but 1939, it has comfortably the world's largest, um, navy, something like 194 destroyers, uh, um, I think it's 15 battleships, seven aircraft carriers, and another kind of six on the way.\nAmerica, it's got Pacific Ocean, it's got the Atlantic Ocean, it's got two seabboards, you know, it has the second largest navy in the world, but a tiny army.\nI mean, the army, the US army in September 1949 is the 19th largest in the in the world, sandwiched between Portugal and Uruguay.\nAnd it's just incredible.\nIt's like 189,000 strong, which might seem reasonably large by today's standards, but is absolutely tiny by 1939 standards, you know.\nWhereas, you know, Germany's got an army of, you know, 3 and a half million in 1939.\nSo, you know, these are big, big, big differences, but but America's coming at it from a different perspective.\nBritain's coming up about it from a different perspective.\nYou know, Britain's, Britain's empire is all about, you know, it's, it's a shipping, it's a, it's a seaborn empire.\nWhereas there's also another point which, which is having large armies is actually inherently impractical and inefficient because the larger army, the more people you got to feed, the more kind of barracks you've got to have, the more space you've got to have for training, the more people you're taking out of your workforce to produce tanks and shells and all the rest of it because they're tramping around with rifles, you know.\nSo there's an argument saying, saying actually it's really not, not a very good way of doing things.\nSo, you know, very much the, uh, the British way and and subsequently the United States way and way of Britain's dominions and and and empire is to use kind of steel, not our flesh as a as a principle.\nThis is the idea is that you use technology, mechanization, modernity, global reach to do a lot of your hard yards.\nThat's the sort of basic principle behind the the strategic air campaign.\nWhen we talk about the strategic air campaign, we're talking about strategic air forces which are operating in isolation from other armed forces.\nSo a tactical air force, for example, is is an air force which is offering close air support for ground operations.\nA strategic air force has got nothing to do with ground operations.\nIt's just operating on its own.\nSo that's your bomber force or whatever, you know, that's your your your B7s and B244s of the Aair force flying out of East England bombing the rural industrial complex of Germany or whatever it might be.\nSo it's important to understand that when you compare, you have to have the back of your mind that Britain compared to Germany, for example, is coming at it from a completely different perspective.\nAnd I would say one of the failures of Hitler is that he always views everybody through his own very narrow worldview, which is not particularly helpful.\nYou know, you want to get inside the head of your enemy, and you know, he's he's sort of guilty of not doing that.\nSo when you're talking about operation Barbarasa, to go back back to your original question, next, you're dealing with an operation on such a vast scale that that operational level of war is absolutely vital to its chances of success or failure.\nDoesn't\n\n\nNo matter how good your individual commanders are at the front. If you haven't got the backup, it's not going to work. And the problem that the Germans have is, yes, they've got their kind of, you know, three million men on the front, and they've got their kind of, you know, 3,000 aircraft and all the rest of it. But actually, what you need to do is break it down and who is doing the hard yards of that. And the way the German war machine works is that the machine bit is only the spearhead. So people always talk about the Nazi war machine. In a way, it's a kind of misnomer because you're sort of suggesting that it's highly mechanized and industrialized and all the rest of it. And nothing could be further from the truth. The spearhead is, but the rest of it is not. And this is the kind of fatal flaw of the German armed forces in the whole of World War II really, but even in this early stage because in Operation Barbarossa, you're talking about 17 Panzer divisions out of, you know, 100 odd that are involved in the initial attack. Well, 17 that a Panzer division is not a division full of panzers tanks. It is a combined arms motorized outfit. So scouts on BMWs with side cars, uh, armored cars, infantry, grenadiers, panzer grenadiers, which are infantry in halftracks and trucks, mechanized, um, it is motorized artillery, it is motorized anti-aircraft artillery. It is motorized anti-tank artillery. And of course, it is tanks as well, panzers. But those are a really, really small proportion of, you know, you're talking less than 20% of your attacking force are those spearhead forces, and inevitably they are going to be attritted as they go. You know, you are going to take casualties, and not only that, you're not going to just take battlefield casualties, you're also going to have mechanical casualties because of the huge spaces involved. You just simply can't function. So what you see is in the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa, they surge forward. The Red Army's absolutely no answers to anything. Stalin, weirdly, hasn't heeded the all the warnings that this attack is brewing, and there have been plenty, incidentally. Smolensk falls on the 15th of July, you know, in less than four weeks. It's just incredible. Three and a half weeks has gone, you know, they've done overwhelmed the rest of what had been Poland. They surged into what is now Belarus, taken all, you know, this is Army Group Center. Uh, Army Group North is thrust up into the Baltic. It's all going swimmingly well, but then the next several months, they barely go 100 miles, and that's because they're running out of steam. And the 16th Panzer division, for example, by the time it's taken Smolensk, involved in taking Smolensk on the 15th of July 1941, the following day it's got 16 tanks left, 16 out of, you know, should have 180. So it's just being attritted. They can't sustain it, and they can't sustain it because as the Russians fall back, as the Soviet Red Army falls back, they do their own scorched earth policy. They also discover that the railway line is kind of a different loading gauge. So, they've got to change it. So, it's slightly, the Russian loading gauge is slightly wider. So, every single mile, every yard, every foot, every meter of that they're capturing of Russian railway has to be moved a couple of inches to the left to make it fit the German criggs lock in the standard train of locomotive of the Reichkes bar. Just imagine what that's like. And also, Soviet trains are bigger, so they can take more water, which means the water stops in between are fewer and far between. So they have to, the Germans when they come in, their trains, their creeks lock are smaller, so they have to be rewatered more often and recalled more often. So they have to, I mean, it's it's absolutely boggling just how complicated it is and how badly planned it is because they haven't reckoned on this. They're having to kind of think on their feet. I love the logistical details of all this because yes, that's a huge component of this, especially when you cover that much territory. But there is a notion that if Hitler didn't stop Army Group Center, it could have pushed all the way to Moscow. It was it was only maybe a 100 miles away from Moscow. Is that is that a possibility? Cuz it had so much success in the early days pushing forward. Do you think it's possible that if Hitler, as we mentioned from a military blunder perspective, didn't make that blunder that uh, they could have defeated the Soviet Union right there and then? Well, my own view is that they should never have got close. The Red Army has plenty of men to be able to see off anything that the Germans can do. The capture of Kyiv, for example, in September 1941 was a catastrophe for the Soviet Union and should never have happened. I mean, Zhukov is saying to Stalin, we got to pull back across the Denipo. Stalin can't possibly do that. You can't abandon Kyiv. It's like third city in Soviet Union. No way. No, absolutely not. And he goes, well, we just, we are just going to be overwhelmed. You know, we, we can't hold this. And and he says, you know, either back me or or farm me. Back me or sack me. So Stalin sacks him. Uh, uh, yeah, obviously, as we know, Zhukov gets um, rehabilitated in pretty quick order, and Stalin does learn very quickly after thereafter to learn the lessons, but the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa has been a catastrophe. And so as a consequence of Stalin refusing to let his men retreat back across the Dunipa, which is a substantial barrier and would have been very difficult for the Germans to overwhelm had they not had they moved back in time. Um, you know, that's another kind of 700,000 men put in the bag. I mean, that's just staggering numbers. Um, but yeah, I mean, there's so many things wrong with the Barbarossa plan. You know, too much over. It's just such a vast area. I mean, you're talking about kind of, you know, 2,500 miles or something, you know, of frontage.\n\n\nYou know, maybe if you kind of put your your your Panzer groups, which are these spearheads, and you put them all in one big straight across on a kind of, you know, much more narrow front of, let's say, kind of 400 miles rather than 1,200, then they might have got, you know, they might have just sort of burnt away straight through to Moscow.\nThey really caught the Red Army unprepared.\nYeah.\nIs there um something to be said about the the strategic genius of that or was it just luck?\nNo, I don't think so.\nI mean, I think what's happened is you've had the you've had the the Soviet purges of the of the second half of the 1930s where they've you know they have executed or imprisoned 22 and a half thousand officers of which you know three out of five marshals um you know god knows how many army commanders um etc etc.\nSo so you know you've completely decapitated the Red Army in terms of its command structure.\nSo before that, would it be fair to say it was one of, if not the greatest army in the world?\nWell, there was a lot of experience.\nThere's a lot of experience there that but also technology material.\nYeah.\nThe size of the army, the number of people that they're mobilized.\nYeah.\nAnd they're the first people to kind of adapt, you know, create airborne troops, for example.\nSo yes, I think there is an argument to say that.\nBut the decapitation is is is absolutely brutal.\nIf you've decapitated an army, you've then got to put new guys in charge.\nAnd someone who who looks on paper like a a halfdecent peace time commander might not be a very good wartime commander.\nThey're different disciplines and different skills.\nAnd what comes to you don't know that until you're tested.\nIt's very hard to kind of judge.\nAnd of course, you know, Stalin is existing in a sort of, you know, a vacuum of of paranoia and suspicion all the time, which is unhelpful when you're trying to develop a strong armed forces.\nSo they go into Finland in in back end of 1939 and they get there, you know, they get really badly hammered.\nThey do take about, you know, they get the Corellia um peninsula and they do take some ground, but at huge cost.\nI mean, the casualties are five times as bad as those of the Fins and it's a humiliation.\nSo Hitler sees that and thinks, okay, we're not up to much cop.\nThen Hitler loses the Battle of Britain and he thinks I can't afford to fight a war on two fronts.\nThat's one of the reasons why Germany loses World War II is fighting on the eastern front but also fighting on, you know, the western front at the same time.\nWe've got to avoid that.\nBut I've got to get rid of Britain.\nAnd Britain hasn't come out of the fight.\nBritain is still fighting in the back end of 1940 having won the Battle of Britain.\nAnd so maybe I'll go into the Soviet Union now while the Red Army is still weak.\nYou know, we're not 100% ready ourselves, but but let's hurry the whole thing forward because originally he'd been thinking of planning an operation in 1943 or 1944.\nSo the idea is you take Poland out, you take out France and the low countries, you conquer most of Europe, you you knock out Britain.\nSo therefore, you don't have to worry so much about the United States because they're over the other side of the Atlantic.\nThat then gives it buys him the time to kind of rebuild up his strength for the allout thrust on the Soviet Union.\nThe failure to subdue Britain in 1940 changes all those plans and makes him think actually I'm going to go in early.\nAnd he's also been kind of, you know, he's hoisted by his own petard because he he starts to believe his own genius.\nYou know, he everyone told him that, you know, he wouldn't be able to, you know, he wouldn't be able to beat France and the low countries.\nEveryone told him that, you know, it wouldn't work out when he went into Poland.\nEveryone was really nervous about it.\nYou know, well, go hang you, you cautious, awful aristocratic Prussian generals.\nYou know, I'm I'm the best at this.\nI've told you.\nI've shown you.\nI'm the genius.\nUm, I can do it.\nHe starts to believe his own hype.\nAnd of course, this is a problem.\nYou know, he's surrounded by sick of fans and people who constantly telling him this he's this incredible genius.\nSo, he starts to believe it and he thinks everything is possible and and he's very much into this idea of of the will of the German people.\nYou know, this is our destiny and either will, as I say earlier on, you know, it's the thousand-y year Reich of Armageddon, but momentum is with us and we need to strike it and only by by gambling, only by being bold will will the Germans prevail and all this kind of nonsense.\nAnd so that's why he goes into into Soviet Union in June 1941 rather than you know a couple of or even three years later.\nYeah.\nHe really hated the Prussian generals.\nHuh.\nYeah.\nHe hated them.\nIs there a case to be made that there he was indeed at times a military genius?\nNo, I don't think so.\nCuz none of the plan I mean even the plan for the invasion of France and the low countries isn't his.\nIt's a the the concept is is von Mannstein's and the execution is Gerian Hines Gadderian.\nSo heiscoded is is a kind of he's the pioneer of of of the panza force the panzer thrust this idea of the ultra mechanized combined arms panzer arm spearhead doing this kind of lightning fast thrust um it's not Hitler's idea he adopts it and and takes it as his own because you know he's a fury he can do what he likes um but but it isn't his so it's not you know and up until that point until that comes into being till that that plan is put forward to France Halder who is the chief of staff of the German army at that time you know how is just thinking how do we get out of this mess this is just a nightmare because they know that France has got a larger\n\n\nArmy, they know that.\nFrance has got more tanks and know that\nFrance has got double the number of\nartillery pieces.\nIt's got par in terms\nof air forces.\nThen you add Holland, then\nyou add Belgium, then you add Great\nBritain, and that looks like a very, very\ntough nut to crack.\nI mean, the reason why\nFrance is subdued in 1940 is\n50% brilliance of the Germans and their\noperational art in that particular\ninstance and 50% French failure, really,\nand incompetence.\nI mean, there is a kind\nof genius to be able to see and take\nadvantage and set up the world stage in\nsuch a way that you have the appeasement\nfrom France and\nBritain.\nKeep the United States out of\nit.\nJust set up the world stage where\nyou could just plow through everybody\nwith no, with very little resistance.\nI mean, there is a kind of, well, yes, if\ngeopolitical genius, if it works, but it\ndoesn't, you know, that's that's a\nproblem.\nI mean, you know, I mean, he goes\ninto Poland on the assumption that\nBritain and France will not declare war.\nYou know, he\nhe is not prepared for Britain and\nFrance declaring war on Germany.\nRight.\nHe thinks they won't.\nThat's right.\nSo, miscalculation, blunder.\nBut then France does, right?\nAnd\nthen that doesn't, you know, France does\nnot successfully do anything with this\nincredible army that it has.\nIt has a\nsize, but one of the problems that\nFrance has is that it's very, very\ntopheavy.\nIt's it's very cumbersome in\nthe way it operates.\nUm, there's no\nquestion that that it's got some\nbrilliant young commanders, but, but at\nthe lot, the top, the commanders are very\nold.\nMost of them are First World War\nveterans, you know, whether you, I mean,\nVegan Gamlan, General George.\nUm, these\npeople, they're all well into their 60s.\nUm, General George is the youngest army\ncommander and he's 60.\nYou know, it's\ntoo old to be an army commander.\nYou\nneed to be in your kind of late 40s,\nearly 50s.\nAnd they're too just consumed\nby conservatism and the old ways.\nAnd\nwhat, what they assume is that any future\nwar will be much like the First World\nWar.\nIt'll\nbe attritional, long and drawn out, but\nstatic.\nBut actually, they're right on\ntwo parts of it.\nIt is, as it turns out,\nit is going to be long and drawn out and\nattritional, but it's going to be mobile\nrather than static.\nAnd that's a big\nmiscalculation.\nSo, here's, here's my\nquestion.\nI think you're, you're being\ntoo nice on France here.\nSo, when, when\nGermany invaded Poland,\nit, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels\nlike France could have just went\nstraight to Berlin.\nYeah, they\nabsolutely could have, and they, and I\nknow you said it's very topheavy, and\nyou're saying all of these things, but\nthey literally did basically nothing.\nYeah, they were pulling.\nSo, like that, uh,\nand I think a part of that, and I think\nyou described as well, maybe you can\nspeak to that, is the insanity that is\nHitler creating this psycholog with the\npropaganda, creating this feeling that\nthere's this Nazi force that's\nunstoppable.\nSo, they're, they're France\njust didn't want to like step into that.\nMaybe they were like legitimately, I, I,\nI hesitate to say these words, but scared\nof war.\n100% they are.\nThat, you know,\nbecause France has been totally\ntraumatized by the First World War.\nIt's\nfought on their land.\nIt's fought in\ntheir industrial heartland.\nYou know,\nthey lose three times the amount of\npeople killed that that Britain does.\nBritain's traumatized by it, but, but, but\nnot to the same degree that France is.\nFrance, you know, there is just no\nstomach to do that again.\nAnd so that\nmakes them risk averse.\nAnd by being\nriskaverse, you're actually taking a far\ngreater risk.\nThat, that, that's the\nirony of it.\nAnd the truth is also there\nisn't the political will.\nAnd a, a\nsuccessful military can only be\nsuccessful if there is a political will\nat the top.\nAnd the problem with France\nin the 1930s is it's very politically\ndivided.\nIt's, uh, it's, it's a time of\nmultiple governments, multiple prime\nministers, um, uh,\ncoalition\ngovernments, really extreme coalition\ngovernments from the sort of drawn from\nthe left and the right as well as the\ncenter, and you know, this is not a\ncoalition of of two parties.\nThis is a\ncoalition of multiple parties, and no one\ncan ever agree anything.\nI mean, that's\nthe problem.\nIt's amazing that the MNO\nline is even agreed, you know, this\nincredibly strong defensive position\ndown the western side of France of\nborder with, um, with Germany, which is\nkind of largely impregnable, but the\nproblem is the bit that's not\nimpregnable, which is the hinge where the\nMno line ends, and it sort of basically\nstarts turning kind of towards in a kind\nof north noy direction and the border\nwith Belgium.\nAnd you know, what they should have done\nis built kind of border defenses all\nalong the northern coast with Belgium\n'cause Belgium refused used to kind of, uh,\nallow any Allied troops into, into his\nterritory.\nIt was neutral.\nAnd France\nshould have said, \"Okay, fine.\nWell,\nthen we'll defend our, you know, we're\nnot going to come to your rescue if you\nget invaded.\nThat's your, that's your,\nwhat, that, that's that's the payoff.\"\nAnd\nand a consequence of that, we are going\nto stockpile everything that we're not\ngoing to be drawn into the neutral\nterritory should Germany invade from the\nWest.\nBut they don't do that because of\nthe psychological damage of having\nfought a war in exactly that area a\ngeneration earlier.\nAnd and that's the\nproblem.\nSo, when the, you know, there is\nGermany is so weakened by the invasion\nof Poland, there is literally nothing\nleft.\nYou know, the back door from into\nwestern Germany is completely open.\nAnd\nso they do what they call the SAR\noffensive, but it's not.\nIt's a kind of\nreconnaissance in force where they kind\nof go across the border, kind of pick\ntheir noses for, for a few days and then\nkind of trundle back again.\nAnd it's\njust it's embarrassing.\nAnd and that is\nwhat you're seeing there is is a nation\nwhich is just not ready for this, which\nis scared, which is politically divided,\nwhich is then having a knock-on effect\non, on the decision-m process, and which\nis just consumed by military\ncomplacency.\nAnd that's the big problem.\n\n\nThere is this, you know, the commanders at the very top of the French regime are complacent.\nThey haven't bought into kind of modern ways.\nThey haven't looked at how contemporary technology could help them.\nI mean it is absurd for example that there isn't a single radio in the chat Devalsen, which is you know the headquarters of the commander-in-chief of the French armed forces, which is General Marshall Morris Gamalan.\nI mean it's just unbelievable, but that is the case and there's no getting away from that.\nIt is all the more ironic when you consider that France is actually the most automotive society in Europe.\nIt's the second most automotive society in the world after the United States by some margin.\nIt has to be said as well, you know, has a fantastic transportation system.\nRailway network is superb.\nIt there are eight people for every motorized vehicle in France, which is way above Germany, which is in 1949 that figure is 47, for example.\nIt's 106 in Italy.\nSo France is very mechanized, like very mechanized.\nSo come on guys, put your finger out, get it together, and they just don't.\nThey're incredibly slow and cumbersome.\nWhat they think is when what will happen is the Germans won't think of going, you know, they won't do a pinser movement because you can't possibly take motorized forces through the Arden.\nThat just is not possible, which is the hinge area between the end of the Majinow, the northern part of the Majino line, which runs down the western, sorry, the eastern border of France and the northern bit.\nSo what we'll do with that hinge around the town of Sedan, we'll move into Belgium.\nWe'll meet the Germans before they get anywhere near France.\nWe'll hold them and while we're holding them, we will bring up our reserves and then we'll counterattack and crush them.\nThat's the idea behind it.\nBut the problem is is they don't have a means of moving fast and their communication systems are dreadful.\nAbsolutely dreadful.\nThey're dependent on conventional telephone lines which you know dive bombers and whatever are just kind of absolutely wrecking.\nSuddenly the streets are clogged with refugees and people can't move.\nSo, you know, telephone lines are down.\nThere's no radios.\nSo, you're then dependent on sending dispatch riders on little motorbikes.\nYou know, General Morris Gamalan sends out a dispatch rider at 6:00 in the morning.\nBy 12:00 he hasn't come back.\nSo, you then send another one.\nFinally, the answer comes back kind of 9:00 at night, by which time the Germans advance another 15 miles and the original message that you sent at 6:00 that morning is completely redundant and has passed its sell by date.\nThat's happening at every step of the way, you know.\nSo you've got overall commander headquarters, then you've got army group, then you've got army, then you've got core, then you've got division.\nSo the consequence of all that is that French just can't move.\nThey're just stuck.\nThey're rabbits in headlights and the Germans are able to kind of move them, destroy them in isolation.\nMeanwhile, they're able to use their excellent communications to very very good effect.\nYou were talking about the genius of war.\nIt's not Hitler that's a genius.\nIf anyone's a genius, it's Gerbles, the propaganda chief.\nIt is their ability to harness that they are the kings of messaging.\nYou know, they don't have X, they don't have social media.\nBut they do have new technology.\nThat new technology, that new approach is flooding the airwaves with their singular message, which is always the same and has been ever since the Nazis come into power.\nIt is using radios.\nI think radios are really really key to the whole story because there is no denser radio network anywhere in the world including the United States than Germany in 1939.\nSo while it's really behind the times in terms of mechanization, it is absolutely on top of its game in terms of coms.\nSo 70% of households in Germany have radios by 1939, which is an unprecedented number that is only beaten by United States and only just.\nSo it is greater than any other other nation in Europe.\nIn terms of flooding the airwaves, it is the densest because even for those who the 30% who don't have radios, that's not a problem because we'll put them in the stairwells of apartment blocks.\nWe'll put them in squares.\nWe'll put them in cafes and bars.\nThe same stuff the state, the the Nazi state controls the radio airwaves as it does the movies as it does newspapers.\nAll aspects of the media are controlled by Gerbles and the propaganda ministry and they are putting out the same message over and over again.\nIt's not Hitler's ranting.\nIt's entertainment, light entertainment, some humorous shows.\nIt is also Vagner of course and Richard Strauss.\nIt's a mixture but the subliminal message is the same.\nWe're the best.\nWe're the top dogs.\nJewish Bolevik plot is awful.\nThat needs to be, you know, that's the existential threat to us.\nWe have to overcome that.\nWe're the top dogs militarily.\nWe're the best.\nWe should feel really good about ourselves.\nWe're going to absolutely win and be the greatest nation in the world ever.\nHitler's a genius.\nThat is just repeated over and over and over and over again.\nYou know, for all the modernity of the world in which we live in today, most people believe what they're told repeatedly.\nYeah.\nThey still do.\nIf you just repeat repeat repeat over and over again, people will believe it.\nYou know, if you're a if you're a diehard Trump supporter, you you want to believe that and you'll believe everything he says.\nIf you are a diehard Bernie Sanders man, you know, you're from the left, you'll believe everything he says because it's reinforcing what you already want to what what you already want to believe.\nBut the scary thing is, you know, radio is the technology of the day.\n\n\nThe technology of the day today, which is a terrifying one for me, is, uh, um, I would say AI on social media.\nSo, bots, you can have basically bot farms, which I assume is used by Ukraine, by Russia, by US.\nI would love to read the history written about this era about the information wars.\nWho has the biggest bot farms?\nWho has the biggest propaganda machines?\nAnd when I say bot, I mean both automated AI bots and humans operating a large number of smartphones with SIM cards that are just able to boost messages enough to where they become viral, and then real humans with real opinions get excited.\nAlso, it's like this vicious cycle.\nSo, if you support your nation, all you need is a little boost, and then everybody gets real excited, and then now you're chanting, and now you're in this mass hysteria, and now it's the 1984 2 minutes of hate, and the message is clear.\nI mean, that's what propaganda does; it really clarifies the mind, and that is exactly what Hitler and the Nazis and Joseph Goebbels are doing in the 1930s.\nWell, they're doing it in the 1920s as well, but more effectively once they come into power, of course.\nAnd Hitler is so fortunate that he comes, he takes over the chancellorship in January 1943 at a time where the economy is just starting to turn, and he's able to make the most of that.\nAnd you know, if you're Germans and you've been through hyperinflation in the early 1920s, you've been through the humiliation of the Versailles Treaty, which was a terrible error in retrospect, and you've been through then having got through that, you've emerged into a kind of democratic Weimar Republic, which is based on manufacturing, you know, Germany's traditional genius at engineering and manufacturing and production of high-quality items.\nThey're merging through that.\nThen you have the Wall Street crash and the loans that are coming in from America, which is propping up the entire German economy, suddenly get cut off, and you've suddenly got depression again and massive unemployment.\nAnd suddenly Hitler comes in, and everyone's got jobs, and they're rebuilding, and they're growing their military, and the message that's coming out is, \"We're the greatest, we're the best, we're fantastic.\"\nYou know, I was telling you earlier on about pillar speeches, starting with the dark, starting dark and ending in hope and light and the sunlit uplands.\nYou know, that's what you're getting.\nYou're suddenly getting this vision of hope.\nThis sort of, you know, by God, actually, this is really working.\nYou know, okay, so, you know, I'm not sure that I particularly buy into the kind of anti-Semitic thing, but, you know, we'll sweep that under the carpet because overall, I've now got a job, I've got money, I've got my new radio, you know, and then this is the genius about the radios, for example.\nSo, they have the, uh, they have the German receiver to start off with, the Deutsche Fanger, and then they have the Deutsche Klein and Fanger, which is the German little receiver, little radio.\nThese are genius.\nThis is as outrageous as the arrival of the iPod.\nI mean, remember that, you know, suddenly you don't have to have a Sony Walkman anymore.\nYou can have something really, really small and miniature and listen to thousands and thousands and thousands of songs all at once.\nWhat a what an amazing thing.\nAnd the Deutsche Klein Fanger is 9 in x 4 in x 4 in.\nIt's made of bake light, and everyone can have one 'cause it's super cheap.\nIt's just incredible.\nAnd no one else said that because up until that point, radios, generally speaking, are aspirational.\nYou know, they've got sort of walnut lacquer at the front, and you know, you have them if you're middle class, and you show them off to your neighbors to show how kind of, you know, affluent and well-to-do you are.\nUm, but suddenly everyone can have one, and if everyone can have one, then everyone can receive the same message, and you can, and you can also, this is the whole point about the Hitler Youth as well, you know, the young guys, that's where they're, they're most impressionistic, they're, they're least risk-averse, so they're most gung-ho, they're, they're most full of excitement for the possibilities of life, and they're also their minds are the most open to suggestion, so you get the youth, you hang on, you get them, and so a whole generation of young men are brought up thinking about the genius of Hitler and how he's delivering us this much better nation and returning our, um, overhauling the humiliations of the First World War, where overcoming the back, the stab in the back that happened in 1918, etc., etc.\nAnd you know, as a young 16-year-old German, you're thinking, \"Yeah, I want a piece of that,\" and, \"Hey, guess what?\nThey got really cool uniforms,\" and, \"You know, come and join the SS,\" and, \"You know, get the throw line, what's not to like?\"\nYou know, you can see why why it's so clever.\nAnd what's so interesting is propaganda today is still using those those tenets that Joseph Goebbels was using back in the 1930s.\nAnd this is why I was say say that, you know, history doesn't repeat itself.\nOf course, it doesn't.\nIt can't possibly repeat itself because we're always living in a constantly evolving time.\nBut patterns of human behavior do.\nAnd what you always get after economic crisis is political upheaval.\nAlways, always, always, because some people are in a worse off position than they were financially before.\nThey're thinking, \"Hmm, well, you know, the current system doesn't work.\nWhat's the alternative?\"\nSo, you know, in the case of now, we in the West, you know, we face, first of all, we faced the crisis of 2008, the financial crisis of 2008.\nThen we've had the kind of double whammy of COVID, and that has been incredibly unsettling.\nAnd so, we're now in a situation of political turmoil.\nAnd whether you're whether you're whether you're pro-Trump or anti-Trump, what he's offering is something completely different.\nAnd you know, it's say, you know, he, he's saying the old ways don't work.\nYou know, I'm going to be, I'm just going to say what I think.\nI'm just going to, I'm going to come out.\nI'm not going to bother with all the sheen of diplomacy.\n\n\nAnd kind of, you know, meymouth words that politicians always use, you know, which where you can't trust anyone.\nI'm just going to tell you as it is.\nAnd obviously people respond to that.\nYou know, you you can understand why that has an appeal.\nAnd if the country already feels broken and here's someone who is going to be a disruptor and going to change the the way you go about things, you can see why a a reasonably large proportion of the population is going to go, \"I'll have a piece of that.\"\nThank you very much.\nAnd especially uh when the country is in a economic crisis like Germany was, I think you've written that the the Treaty of Versailles created Hitler and the uh the Wall Street crash and the great depression brought him to power.\nYes.\nAnd of course the propaganda machine that you describe is the thing that got everybody else in Germany on board.\nYeah.\nIt's it's it's amazing how he cuz he comes in with 33% of the vote.\nHe had 37% of the vote of the vote in July 1942.\nSo again, this is another period of of turmoil just like it is in France where you're having constant different kind of coalitions and you know different chancellors leaders of Germany.\nSo, it's very possible he he he wouldn't have come to power.\nWell, he said he he said, \"I will only, you know, we will only take our seats if if if I can be chanced.\nOtherwise, forget it.\nI'm not coming into any coalition.\"\nSo, then the uh the government falls again in January 1943.\nThey have the they have the election.\nThe Nazi vote is down from where it was the previous summer.\nBut this time, they go, \"Okay, Heather can be chancellor, but we'll manipulate him.\"\nHow wrong they were.\nYou know, he's manipulating everyone and then Hinderberg who is the president dies the following summer and uh he's able to get rid of the presidency.\nThere is no more president of Germany.\nThere is just the furer him and he gets rid of uh he has a enabling act which is where all other uh political parties have disbanded and suddenly you've got a total inherent state just like that.\nI think there's a lesson there.\nUh there's many lessons there, but one of them is don't let an extremist into government.\nYes.\nAnd assume you can control them.\nYes.\nThe arrogance of the existing politicians who just completely screwed it up.\nI mean, there is a real power to an extremist.\nLike there's uh a person who sees the world in in black and white can really gain the attention and the support of the populace.\nYes, especially when there's a resentment about like Treaty of Versailles, when there's economic hardship and if there's effective modern technology that allows you to do propaganda and sell the message.\nThere's something really compelling about the black and white message.\nIt is because it's simple and and what Hitler does throughout the 1920s is he sticks to this there there is actually when he comes out of prison in so he there's the bhole p in November 1923 he gets uh charged with treason which he has been because he's attempting a coup and he gets sentenced to 5 years which is pretty lenient for what he's done and he then gets let out after 9 months.\nThe Nazi party is is is banned at that point, but then comes back into being.\nAnd the year that follows, there is then a substantial debate about where the party should go.\nAnd there are actually a large number of people who think that actually they should be looking at how the Soviets are doing things and taking some of the some of the things that they consider to be positive out of the communist state and applying those to the Nazis.\nAnd Hitler goes, \"No, no, no, no, no, no.\nWe we we've just got to stick to this kind of Jewish bosshit thing.\nThis is this is how we're going to do it.\nThis we're going to do it.\"\nJoseph Goebbels, for example, who is who is very open.\nHe's he's very very Joseph Goebbels is a he's a he's a not very successful um journalist.\nHe is uh but he does have a PhD in German literature.\nHe's very disaffected because he was born with talipes, which is, you know, more commonly known as a club foot.\nHe's disabled.\nCan't fight in the First World War.\nHe's very frustrated by that.\nHe's in a deep despair about about the state of Germany in the first part of the early 1920s.\nHe's looking for a uh um a a political messiah as a sort of quai religious messiah.\nThinks it's Hitler, then discovers that Hitler's not open to any ideas at all uh about any deviation, but then sees the light.\nHitler recognizes that this guy is someone that he wants on his side.\nAnd so then goes to him, makes a real special effort.\nCome on, come to dinner.\nI think you're great.\nYou know, all this kind of stuff.\nWins him about over and Goebbels has this complete vault fast.\nDiscards his earlier kind of yeah, you know, Hitler's right.\nI was wrong.\nHitler is the kind of messiah figure that that I want to follow.\nI want to follow the hero hero leader.\nAnd they come on board and they absolutely work out.\nHitler completely wins out.\nAll dissenters within the what had been the German Workers Party drop becomes the German National Socialist Party becomes the Nazis.\nUm he comes out emerges as the absolute undisputed furer of that leader of that that party and what he says goes and everyone toes him behind it and part of the genius of that you know Hitler does have some genius.\nI just don't think it's military, but he does have some genius.\nThere's no question about it.\nIs this the simplicity of message what he's doing is it's that kind of us and them thing that we were talking about earlier on.\nIt's the kind of either or.\nIt's kind of it's my way or the highway.\nIt's kind of this is the only way.\nThis is how we get to the sunlet uplands.\nThis is how we we create this amazing master race of the this unification of German peoples which dominates the world which is the preeminent power in the world for the next thousand years or\n\n\nIt's decay and despair and being crushed by our enemies, and our enemies are the Jews and the Bolsheviks, the communists. And what he taps into as well is Frontgemeinschaft and Volkstumschaft. And these are, there's no direct English translation of Volkstumschaft or indeed Frontgemeinschaft, but in its most basic form, it's community, it's people, community, or front veterans community. So the Frontgemeinschaft is, we are the guys, we're bonded because we were in the trenches, you know, we were in the First World War. We were the people who bravely stuck it out, saw our friends being slaughtered and blown to pieces. We did our duty as proud Germans, but we were let down by the elites, and we were let down by this Jewish Bolshevik plot. You know, we were stabbed in the back. The myth of the stabbing in the back is very, very strong. So, we're bound, we're bonded by our experiences of the First World War and the fact that we did what we should and what we could, and we were, we didn't fail in what we were doing. We were failed by our leaders, um, and by the elites. So that's Frontgemeinschaft. Volkstumschaft is this sense of national unity. It's a cultural, ethnic bonding of people who speak German, who have a similar outlook on life. And again, that just reinforces the us and them, good and evil. It reinforces the black and white worldview. And then you add that to this very simple message, which Hitler is repeating over and over again: Communists are a big threat. Jews are a big threat. They're the enemy. You have to have an opposition in the them and us kind of process. And that's what he's doing. And people just buy into it. They go, \"Yeah, we're together. We're Germans. We're, you know, we're a brotherhood.\"\n\nWe've got our Volkstumschaft, and so he cleverly ties into that and taps into that, but they're an irrelevance by the late 1920s, you know, by 1928, you know, the, he's not going to get a deal for *Mein Kampf* part two, you know, he, he's, he's impoverished, the party's impoverished, you know, numbers are down there, they're a kind of, you know, a best, and, and a relevance, we should say. He wrote *Mein Kampf* at this time when he was in prison. He writes, he writes most of *Mein Kampf* in prison in Landsberg prison. And then he writes the rest of it in what becomes known as the Campfousel, which is this little wooden hut in the Oberalssburg, and you can still see the remnants of that, and unfortunately, there's still little candles there and stuff in the woods and, you know, by neo-Nazis and what have you, but that's where he wrote, wrote the rest of it. Um, I mean, it was John Jacqu Russo who says, \"Man has his greatest force when surrounded by nature.\" That was something that kind of Hitler took very much to heart. Um, there was a, there was a mentor of his called Dietrich Eckart. Dietrich Eckart introduced him to the Obisalsburg and the beauty of the southwest, southeast Bavarian Alps around Burkis Garden, and, um, and that was his favorite place on the planet, and, um, that's where he, that's where he eventually bought the, um, the, uh, the Burhoff with the royalties, it has to be said, from *Mein Kampf*, which went from being, you know, almost pulp to suddenly being a runaway bestseller, unfortunately.\n\nCan you actually comment on that? It's a shitty manifesto as far as manifestos go. I think there's a lot of values to understand from a first-person perspective the words of a dictator of a person like Hitler, but it just feels like that's just such a shitty. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's banned in a number of countries. You don't need to, 'cause no one's going to read it because it's unreadable, you know. Um, I mean, it's very untidy. It's, it's very incoherent. It's, it's got no, um, there's no narrative arc to use a kind of, you know, a writer's phrase. I mean, it's just, it's, but, but, but it does give you a very clear, you know, the overall impression you get at the end of it is, is the kind of communists and the Jews are to blame for everything. Yeah. But there's also the component of, you know, predicting basically World War II there. So it's not just they're to blame. He's, he's hungry for war. He, he thinks that this is, this is the natural state, that we have to have this terrible conflict, and once the conflict's over, Germany will emerge victorious, and then there will be the thousand-year Reich. I mean, you...\n\nI, I'm finding myself in, in talking to you, I keep saying this kind of, you know, it's Armageddon, all the thousand-year, right? It's because it comes up. It's, it's unavoidable because that's how he's speaking the whole time. It's just this same message over and over and over and over again. It's a pretty unique way of speaking, sort of allowing, uh, violence as a tool in this picture, that there's a hierarchy, that there's a superior race and inferior races, and it's okay to destroy the inferior ones. Yeah, usually politicians don't speak that way. They just say, \"Well, here's good and evil. We're the good guys.\" And yeah, maybe we'll destroy the evil a little bit. No, here is like there's a complete certainty about a very large number of people, the Slavic people, they just need to be removed. Well, they need to be made an irrelevance. You know, we have to take it, we have to take it, and if that, if that kills millions of them, fine. Then, then they can sort of squish their way over to Siberia. It doesn't matter where they go or whatever they go. I don't care. We just need to populate this land that belongs to the German people. Yeah. 'Cause they're the superior people. There's no question that he glorifies violence and war. You know, he's absolutely chomping at the bit. And in a way, I think he's a bit disappointed that in the 1930s, the conquests that he does undertake are...\n\n\nAlso peaceful.\nYou know, March 1948 goes straight into Austria.\nThere's the Angelus.\nYou know, not a shot is fired.\nYou know, 1946 goes into Rhineland.\nHe reconquers that, retakes that over that from the occupying allies, not a shot is fired.\nYou know, he takes the Sudan land, not a shot, barely a shot is fired.\nUm and then goes into the rest of Czechosvaka in March 1939 and again, barely a shot is fired.\nAnd you know, it's a bit disappointing.\nYou know, he wants to be tested.\nHe wants to kind of have the wartime triumph.\nYou could see him being frustrated about this in the Munich crisis in 1948.\nHe wants to fight.\nHe's absolutely spoiling for it.\nHe's desperate to go in.\nHe's all ready and gung-ho.\nHe's built his luftwaffer.\nHe's got his panzas now.\nHe's got his massive armed forces.\nYou know, he wants to test them.\nHe wants to get this show on the road and prove it.\nYou know, he is a he's an arch gambler.\nHiller, you make it seem so clear.\nBut uh all the while to the rest of the world, to Chamberlain, to France, to Britain, to the rest of the world, he's saying he doesn't want that.\nHe's making agreements.\nEverything you just mentioned, you just went through it so quickly.\nBut those are agreements that were made that he's not going to do that.\nUh and he does it over and over.\nHe violates the Treaty of Versailles.\nHe violates every single treaty, but he still is doing the meeting.\nSo may maybe can you go through it the leadup to the war September 1st 1939 like what are the different agreements what is the signaling he's doing what is he doing secretly in terms of building up the military force yes so he you know part of the treaty of size you're not you know you're allowed a very very limited um uh armed forces there's restrictions on naval expansion there's restrictions on the size of the army there's restrictions on the weapons you you can use.\nThere are um you're not allowed an air force.\nBut he starts doing this all clandestinely.\nUm you know there are people in um crop has got for example which is in the rur a sort of big um armous manufacturer they are producing tanks in elsewhere and parts elsewhere in in say the Netherlands for example and then shipping them back into back into Germany.\nThey're doing Panza training exercises actually in the Soviet Union at this time.\nThere's all sorts of things going on.\nThe Luftwaffer is being announced to the world in 1935, but it's obviously been in the process of of developing long before that.\nThe Meshmit 109 single engine fighter plane, for example, is created in 1934.\nSo that they're doing all these things against it.\nAnd and the and the truth is is he's just constantly pushing what what can I get away with here?\nWhat what will pro you know and and of course Britain, France, the rest of rest of the world, rest of the allies, you know, they're all reeling from from the Wall Street crash and and the depression as well.\nSo, have they got the stomach for this?\nNot really.\nYou know, and perhaps actually on reflection the terms of Versail are a bit harsh anyway.\nSo, you know, maybe we don't need to worry about it.\nAnd this just no political will.\nThere's no political will to kind of fight against what Germany's doing.\nThen he gets away of it.\nSo he suddenly starts realizing that that that that actually he can push this quite a long way because no one's going to stand up to him which is why he makes a decision in 1946 to go back into the you know into the rhin land you know which has been occupied by by French you know um um allied troops at that point he just walks in do your worst and no one's going to do anything cuz there isn't the stomach to do anything that was a big step in 1936 remilitarizing the Ryland I mean that that's a huge huge step of like, oh, I don't have to follow anybody's rules and they're gonna do nothing.\nAnd and he's looking at his military and he's and and he's also looking at response.\nSo, one of the things they do is they, you know, it's really it's very clever.\nSo, they get over the head of the uh army of the air, army dea, which is the um French air force, and they invite him over and they milk, who is the uh second command of the Luftwaffer, invites him over.\nSo, come and see what we're what we're up to.\nYou know, we want to be, you're our European neighbors.\nWe're all friends together, this kind of stuff.\nCome and see what we've got.\nAnd he takes him to this airfield.\nThere's a row of measures 109's all lined up, like sort of 50 of them.\nAnd the the head of the army of the air sort of looks at him and goes, &quot;G, that's impressive.&quot;\nAnd and Mil goes, &quot;Well, let me go and take you to another airfield.&quot;\nAnd they they go off the sort of the bat route out of the airfield and a long securitous route in the Mercedes.\nMeanwhile, all the measurements take off from that airfield, going to land in the next airfield.\nHere's another.\nAnd they're all the same aircraft and the commander and chief of the army of the aircraft goes back to France and goes we're never going to be able to eat Germany.\nSo you would earlier you were you were alluding to this earlier on you know how much is this sort of this this this just this hutzbar of this ability to kind of portray the the the the mechanized mollock.\nUm yeah it absolutely cows the enemy.\nSo, so they're they're they're increasing the effectiveness of their armed forces purely by propaganda and by by mind games and by talking the talk.\nAnd you know, you look at we might all think these military parades that the Nazis have looked rather silly by today's standards, but you look what that looks like if you're the rest of the world.\nYou're in Britain and you're still reading from the depression\n\n\nAnd you see the Triumph of the Will. You see some of that footage, and you see these automatons in their steel helmets, and you see the swastikas, and you see hundreds of thousands of people all lined up, and see Kyling and all the rest of it. You're going to think again before you go to war with people like that. It's also hard to put yourself in the mind of those leaders now, now that we have nuclear weapons. So nuclear weapons have created this kind of, uh, cloak of a kind of safety from mutually assured destruction. They that you think, surely you will not do, you know, a million or two million, uh, soldier army invading another land, right? Just full-on gigantic hot war. Uh, but at that time, that's the real possibility. You, you remember World War I. You remember all of that. So, you know, yeah, okay, there's a mad, uh, guy with a mustache. Uh, he's making statements that this land belongs to Germany anyway, cuz it's mostly German, uh, populated. So, and like you said, the Treaty of Versailles wasn't really fair. And you can start justifying all kinds of things yourself. And maybe they got a point about the dancing corridor. You know, they are mainly Germans, German-speaking people there. And you know, it's disconnected from East Prussia, which is just saying, you know, I can, I sort of get it, you know, maybe they've got a point, you know, and is Poland really a kind of thriving democracy anyway? Not really. By 1930, late 1930s, it's not. It's to all intents and purposes a dictatorship in Poland at that time. I mean, it, it's not right that you just go and take someone else's country. Of course, you, you can't do that. But, but you can see why in Germany people are thinking they've got a point. You can also see why in France and Britain, they're thinking, well, you know, do we really care about the polls? I mean, you know, is it worth going to war over? Um, but there's kind of bigger things at play by this point. That, that's the point. Yeah. But before we get to Poland, there is this meeting, September 1938. Uh, so Chamberlain made three trips to meet with Hitler. Yeah. Uh, which culminated in the Munich conference. Yeah. On the 30th of September. Yeah. Where was Chamberlain, Hitler, Mussolini, and Daladier, prime minister of France? They met to discuss Czechoslovakia without any of the government officials of Czechoslovakia participating. And Hitler promised to make no more territorial conquest. And Chamberlain believed him. He chose to believe him, I think, is the thing, is the point. So, so it's very interesting. So, so Chamberlain gets a very bad press. Um. Uh-oh. Well, no, I'm not. No, it's not really. Uh oh. It's, it's, I, I, I just think there's too much retrospective view on this. And, and that's fine because we, the whole point of history is you can look back and you can judge decisions that were made at a certain point through the prism of what subsequently happened, which of course the people that are making the decisions at the time can't, because they're in that particular moment. So I don't think Chamberlain did trust Hitler, but he wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Britain was not obliged to Czechoslovakia at all. France was. France had signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia in 1924, but, but Britain had not. So there was no obligation at all for Britain to do this. The only reason why Britain would go to war over Czechoslovakia is because of the threat of Nazism and what the ramifications of not going to war with him. But the problem is, is that Chamberlain's interesting because in 1935, he was, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and when they started to sort of think, okay, we really do need to rearm, um, he was very much in favor of, of substantially, um, expanding and rehabilitating the navy, so updating existing battleships, um, and so on, and also developing the air force. Mhm. There's not really much argument for having a large army because if you have a large army, you've got to maintain it. Britain is a small place. Where do you put them? You've also got to transport them. That's complicated. Um, you've got to train them. You got to embarrass. You got to feed them. All this kind of stuff. It's there's a kind of sort of impracticality about having a large army. Whereas navies are great because you can keep them at sea and they can be, you know, on the water. Air Force is slightly different. Air power is viewed in very much the same way that, that naval power is viewed. That this is, we're an island nation. We have a global, global assets, and airpower gives us a flexibility that an army doesn't. So he is all for backing the expansion of the, of the army of the air force and the navy in 1930s. Then he subsequently becomes prime minister and sticks his guns on that. It is he that enables the air force and, and the air ministry to develop the first fully coordinated air defense system anywhere in the world. There is not an air event system in Poland, nor Norway, nor Denmark, nor the Netherlands, nor Belgium, nor France. There is in Britain. Britain is the only one. And frankly, it pays off big time in the summer of 1940. So you have to give him credit for that. Britain, interestingly, is also the world's leading armaments exporter in the 1930s, which is amazing really when you think everyone complains about the fact that we weren't rearming enough. Actually, we were when we had all the infrastructure there, and, and we were expanding that infrastructure dramatically. I say we, I'm only saying that because I'm British. Uh, um, so they were doing that, but in 1938, Britain wasn't ready for war. Now you can argue that Germany wasn't ready for war either. But Chamberlain was prime minister in a democracy, a parliamentary democracy where 92% of the population were against going to war in 1938. There is, there is not a single democratic leader in the world that would go against the wishes of 92% of the population. Now you could say, well, he should have just argued it better and presented his case better and all the rest of\n\n\nIt, but at that point, there was no legal obligation to go to the defense of Czechoslovakia. You know, Czechoslovakia been was a number of these new nations have been created out of out of 1919 in the Versail treaty. You know, who was to say, you know, we in Britain are able to judge the rights and wrongs of that. You know, how fantastic it would be to go to war with a nation a long way away for people whom we know very little, etc., etc. I'm paraphrasing his quote, but I'm not saying it was the right decision. I'm just saying I can see why in September 1948, he is prepared to give him the chance. Now I do think he was a bit naive and it and what he also does is this really interesting thing is he goes over to Hitler's flat, completely ambushes him, goes to his flat on the afternoon of 30th September and says to Hitler, \"Look, I've got this, I've drawn up this agreement here, and this is to continue the naval agreement that we've already made, and by signing this, you are saying that Germany and Britain should never go to war with one another.\" And he goes, \"Yeah, whatever,\" you know, signs it. Yeah. Chamberlain comes back, lands a hand and waves his little piece of paper, you know, \"peace in our time\" and all the rest of it, which obviously comes back to bite him in a very big way. But it's interesting that when Hitler then subsequently goes and moves in, you know, that they, France and Britain, decide in rather the same way that there's been discussion about deciding that large portions of Ukraine should just be handed back to Russia without consulting Ukraine a few weeks ago.\n\nUm, it is incredible, I think, that France and Britain and Italy with Germany are deciding that yes, it's fine for Germany to go in and take the Sudatan land, you know, without really consulting the checks. It's a sort of similar kind of scenario, really, and it's equally wrong. Um, but when Germany does then go and take over the whole of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, that is that's the bottom line. That is that's the point where Chamberlain goes, \"Okay, I've given him the benefit of the doubt. No more benefits of doubt. That's it. That is he's crossed the line.\" And so you reinforce your agreement with Poland. You do a formal agreement. You go, \"Okay, we will uphold your sovereignty. You know, if you are invaded, we will go to war with you.\" You know, and that is that is a ratcheting up of diplomacy and politics in a very, very big way. And it is a it is that decision to make a treaty with the Poles is not heeded by Hitler, but it's heeded by literally every one of his commanders. And it's also heeded by Guring, who is his number two and who is obviously the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffer and is president of Prussia and you know, and all the rest of it, and you know, is the second most senior Nazi, and you know, he's going, \"This is a catastrophe. This is the last thing we want to be doing is going to war against Britain and indeed France.\"\n\nThe Munich conference is a pretty interesting moment, I would say, in all of human history because you got the leaders of these bigger than life nations and the most dramatic brewing conflict in human history. Yeah. Chamberlain, Hitler, Mussolini, Dier. It's interesting when these bigger than life leaders are in the room together. Is there something that you know about about their interactions? Yeah, I think there's I think one of the things that's interesting is that Hitler's got home advantage, cuz it's on his turf, and you know, to start off with, the first meeting is at the burg, his beloved place in the Oasisburg overlooking Burkus garden in the Alps. So he's pretty confident because this is my mana, this is my turf, you know, I'm not going to be bossed around by these guys. But Chamberlain, for example, is going there thinking, \"I've been around the blocks. No one can teach me anything. I've been a politician for ages. You know, I'm not going to be kind of capped out by this this sort of, you know, Austrian upstart.\" So, they're both coming at it with a kind of sort of slight kind of superiority kind of conflict.\n\nUm, interestingly, when you get to the actual meetings at the Bernabau in in Munich, um, a couple of weeks later, Chamberlain is cheered by the crowds when his car comes in, when he goes to his hotel, when he's moving from his hotel to the burnabout, you know, there are cows cheering him, we know, waving uni jacks, all this kind of stuff. Hillary does not like that at all. Not at all. Puts him on the back foot. And that's because the German people don't want war. In the same way that the British people don't want war, nor do the German people. The difference is that Hitler is a dictator and an autocrat and has the devotion of the people. So he can do what he wants in a way that Chamberlain can't. Chamberlain's hands are tied because he is an elected prime minister, an elected leader, political leader, and he's not head of state. So there is no question that it is Hitler and Chamberlain that are the top dogs in this particular discussion. You know, Delier takes a backseat. Even Mussolini, although he's there, he doesn't want war either. You know, he wants to be left alone to do his own thing without anyone getting in the way, but he doesn't want he doesn't want to sort of it's not in his interest to have a European war. So, he's trying to avoid it. So, it is really you you see that the kind of alpha males in the room are Chamberlain and and Hitler. And it's really interesting because Hitler's got this sort of slightly jealous voice and and very kind of pale blue eyes and such distinct things. Quite a long nose and you know he always says this is why he has mustache to kind of you know disguise the big nose you know. So I was saying to you earlier on before we started recording he does have a sense\n\n\nOf humor.\nIt's not maybe not one that you and I would kind of tap into, but he does have one.\nWhereas Chamberlain is just sort of, you know, he sounds like a sort of, you know, bit like an old man, you know, he's sort of silverhead and he looks like your sort of archetypal kind of British gentleman with his rolled up umbrella and his, you know, and his homberg hat and all the rest of it.\nSo they they're both sort of caricatures in a funny sort of way.\nAnd yet the consequence of that, these discussions, you know, these these great events happening, you know, you are you're absolutely going even which way the Munich crisis comes out, you're taking a step closer to war.\nIt's just whether the war is going to happen kind of next week or whether it's going to happen a year hence, but it's you know, the Munich crisis obviously doesn't stem the inevitability of war at all, it just heightens it.\nDo you think uh there are words that Chamberlain should have said, could have said that uh put more pressure on Hitler, intimidate Hitler more?\nYeah, it's a really tricky one.\nIt's such a difficult one because you're always looking at it through, you know, the enemy has a vote and you don't know what that vote is going to be and you don't know what it's going to look like.\nThere's no question that that Europe, the rest of Europe is is is cowed by the um kind of impression of military might that the Germans have put out, that they they certainly fear they are stronger than they actually are.\nAnd then on the other hand, they're also going, \"Yeah, but you know, Germany doesn't have natural resources, doesn't have access to the world's oceans.\nYou know, it's it's it's kind of, you know, it shouldn't be able to win a war.\"\nAnd so so they're kind of contradicting themselves at the same time, you know.\nSo on one minute they're sort of, oh god, you don't want to take on those all those Nazis and all those swastikas and those automatan stormtroopers.\nBut on the other hand, they're then saying, but actually Germany doesn't have much in its kind of, you know, in its basket.\nYou know, it's it's got actually quite a lot of weaknesses and we should be able to kind of prevail blah blah blah.\nWe'll just impose an economic blockade and then it'll be stuffed.\nAnd Britain is not ready to fight a war in in 1948, but nor is Hitler, you know, nor is Germany.\nSo, you know, one is sort of striking out the other, but it's very easy to say that in hindsight, but at the time, you know, with people kind of digging trenches in High Park in the central London and barish balloons going up over London and, you know, children being evacuated from the cities and 92% of the population not wanting to go to war.\nYou can see why he takes the course he does.\nI suppose that's that's what I'm saying.\nI'm not saying it's necessarily the right decision, but I I think it's an understandable decision.\nBut what about even just on the human level?\nIf I go into a room with a British gentleman versus go into a room with Trump, it feels like it's so much easier to read and manipulate the British gentleman because Trump is like Trump-like characters.\nIt seems like Hitler is similar.\nChurchill is similar.\nIt's like this guy can do anything.\nThere's something terrifying about the unpredictability.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt feels like there's something very predictable about Chamberlain.\nYes, I think that's true.\nBut also, one has to take a step back and think about what Britain represents.\nSo therefore, what Chamberlain represents in 1938.\nBritain has the largest empire the world has ever known in 1938.\nYou know, third of the world is pink as the saying goes, you know, and that saying comes from the kind of atlas of the world where all British territories are kind of colored pink.\nYeah.\nAnd on top of that, it has lots of extra imperial territories as well.\nSo, you know, if you look at there's there's this incredible map of global shipping in 1937.\nAnd there's these little ant lines of of ships going out and and one of the strongest antlines is going down to Argentina and South America from Britain.\nSo, down past West Africa and down the southern Atlantic and there it is.\nAnd that's because Britain owns most of Argentina.\nIt owns huge great farming estates and ranches.\nIt owns the railway system.\nIt owns many of the port facilities.\nSo, you didn't even need an empire.\nYou just need the the, you know, you need the the facilities that overseas trade and possessions can give you.\nAnd Britain not only has the largest navy, it also has the largest merchant navy, has 33% of the world's merchant shipping and access to a further 50%, you know, Greek, Norwegian, Canadian shipping that it can can access.\nSo if you've got if you got access to 80 more than in in excess of 80% of the world shipping that puts you in an incredibly strong position and actually all sorts of other things have been going on.\nWhile they might not have been creating a huge army or producing enough Spitfires that they might want to up until this point what they have also been doing is stockpiling bulk site and copper and tungsten and huge reserves.\nAnd because Britain has this huge global reach, because it has its empire and its extra imperial assets, it can strike bargains that no one else can strike.\nSo it can go into various countries around the world and can go, \"Okay, I want you to guarantee me for the next 5 years every bit of your rubber supply.\nI will pay over the over the asking price to secure that.\"\nAnd it's doing that in the 1930s.\nSo when war comes, it's got everything it possibly needs.\nNow you always need more because it's suddenly turning into a kind of you know a proper global long drawn out war.\nBut but that is a huge advantage.\nSo it is with that mindset that Chamberlain is going into those talks and thinking okay well I'm not going to get a war over the Czechov and who cares about them but but I am going to show Hitler that I mean business.\nHitler's going who's this stuffy\n\n\nGuy with his white hair? I don't give a toss about him. You know, and it's he's coming at it from a completely different perspective. And I think one of the things that's so interesting from a dramatic point of view and from a historian's point of view or even a novelist point of view in the case of Robert Harris writing his book about these negotiations, which I don't know if you've read it, but it's really it's terrifically good, um, is the fact you've got two men, two alpha males who are going to those negotiations from totally different perspectives and vantage points. And I think it's very easy for people today to forget how elevated Britain was in the late late 1930s. You know, the gold standard was tied to the pound, not the dollar. Um, and so Britain was the number one nation in the world at that time, and and it just was. And it's so diminished by comparison today that it's hard to imagine it. And I think one of the interesting things about the historioggraphy about the narrative of how we tell World War II is that so much of it has been dictated by the shift in power that took place subsequent to 1945. And when people were starting to write these sort of major narratives in the 1970s and 80s and into the 1990s is through a prism of a very very different world. And so one of the reasons why you have this narrative that that you know Britain was a bit rubbish and hanging on the shirt tells of the Americans and you know all the blood was spelt in in Eastern front and you know Germany had the best army in the world and was only defeated because Hitler was mad and blah blah blah. You know that that kind of sort of traditional narrative. It's it's that narrative emerges through the prism of of what was going on in the 1970s and what was going on in the 1980s and the changing world rather than looking at it through the prism of the late 1930s or early 1940s. So there is this moment of decision. When do you think what lesson do you take from that? When is the right time for appeasement to negotiate for diplomacy and when is the right time for military strength offensive attacking uh for military conflict? Where's that where's that line? Where's that thing? Well, I kind of think it probably was when it was. I I mean Poland. Yeah. Honestly, I I'm not sure it would have been the right decision to go to war in 1948. I just I I think it would I I'm I can't predict because you can't second guess how things are going to play out because you just don't know. But but I I I'm not sure that Chamberlain made the wrong decision. I'm not saying he made the right decision. I'm just like I'm not I'm being a bit wishy-washy about this. You could have threatened it more. Imagine Churchill in those same meetings. Yeah, but but Churchill also appeases. I mean, he appeases Stalin all the time. I mean, you know, so the idea that Churchill's this big strong man and never appeases and, you know, he's gung over war. Churchill's out of the government at that time, he he he recognizes that you can't trust Hitler, he recognizes that Nazism is bad, but he because he's out of the government, he doesn't have a window on exactly where Britain is at that particular time in the way that Chamberlain does, you know. So, so I suppose what I'm saying is Chamberlain is better placed to make those decisions than than Churchill is. Which again doesn't mean that Church that Chamberlain is right and Churchill is wrong. It's just that's a massive pump to go to war in 1938 when you still don't have, you know, you've got a handful of Spitfires, you've got a handful of huracans, you haven't got enough, you know, your air defense system isn't properly properly sorted at this point. Um, your navy is strong. But you know what's that going to look like? I mean, if you do go to war, there's not going to be armies sweeping into Germany. It's just it's going to be accelerated industrialization for a year. So, no, you know, even if you go to war in 1938 over Czechoslovakia, Czechosaka will not be saved that, you know, France and Britain will not be going and invading Germany. That, you know, that is absolutely not going to happen. So, sort of what's the point? I mean, you know, if you're not going to do that, why didn't you accelerate your rearmament thereafter? Get your ducks in a row and then you can consider it. I mean, after all, you know, even in se September 1949, they don't really do anything. I mean, we talked about the kind of the SAR offensive, which isn't really an offensive at all. It's firing a one round of machine gun and scuttling back again. But, I mean, they don't even do that then, though. They're still buying time in 1949. And you know, Britain is only just about ready to take on the onslaught of the Luftwaffer in summer of 1940. Well, nobody's ready for war. No. And you always want more than you've got at any time, even when you're winning. But like really not ready. Even like like you mentioned with with Barbar Roa, Dasi Germany's really not ready. Not ready. Nobody's really except France. I swear. France. France have radios. Fine. But come on. Come on. When when uh when Nazi Germany invades Poland, I mean, yeah, it's terrible. It's terrible because I'm absolutely I I also do think that had France gone in in some force with some British troops as well, had they gone in, what would have happened is is that would have just that easily could have brought down Hitler because most of his commanders are his senior commanders are just thinking, \"What the hell is going on? This is a catastrophe.\" I mean to a man I mean even Guring is thinking this is a terrible idea they are absolutely not convinced and when Hitler does his big talk to his his um he asked all his senior commanders to come to the burgov to brief them about the invasion of Poland it's just after the ribbon trough molotov pact of the 22nd of\n\n\nAugust, go he.\nHe calls them all to Burgoff and says, \"Come in, you know, come in mufty, come in civilian suits.\"\nThey all turn up, and he gives them this kind of huge, great speech and says, \"This is the moment, this is this is the time, this is what we're going to do.\"\nAnd they're all going, \"What? You're kidding me. What? We're going to Poland in, you know, on the 26th of August. That's the plan.\"\nLike two days time, you know, where's the plan?\nWhere's the, you know, the whole point is that, you know, they're they're emerging and growing militarily, but they were supposed to have all these exercises where they, you know, coordinating ground forces, you know, the Panza spearhead with operations in the air with the Luftwaffer.\nNone of that happens.\nSo Poland becomes the proving ground.\nAnd actually they discover that there's lots of things that don't work and lots of things that are wrong.\nUm, but but but you know, it it's flying in the face of all convention, military convention, that that they, you know, he does this without any kind of warning, and even by the first of September, where there's been this kind of sort of 5-day delay, um, at the last minute negotiations.\nThe last minute negotiations are thrust upon Hitler by people like Guring and by Mussolini and and the Italians going, \"Oh my god, don't do this, don't do this, you know, there's got to be a solution.\"\nHe's absolutely chomping at the bit.\nWell, in that case, from a dark militaristic perspective, his bet paid off, well, except that it ended in ruins in May 1945 with total collapse of Germany.\nSo you could say the worst decision he ever made was going into Poland in September 1939.\nDepends where you look at it.\nBut I mean, yes, you know, it's successful in that, you know, Poland's overrun in 18 days.\nAnd there's there's so many counterfactuals here.\nBut I mean, if you would say to Hitler on the 30th of April, you know, is he's sort of taking out the pistol from his holster on his sofa in the in the fur bunk and going, you know, so Adolf, 1st of September 1949, still backing himself on that one?\nI mean, he might might have a different view.\nThe guy's insane and full of blunder.\nSo, he probably would have said, \"Yeah, do it all over again.\"\nYeah, I'm sure he would have done as well.\nConquest.\nPoland was not a mistake.\nSoviet Union was not a mistake.\nIt's just some of the other people I was let down by, by people not being strong enough.\nYeah.\nThe Prussian generals are all Yeah.\nYeah.\nOf course.\nThat's exactly what he'd say.\nWasn't my fault.\nHe might have uh quietly done some different decisions about Barbar Roa.\nMaybe the timing would be different.\nMaybe that all out central for us rather than kind of splitting into three.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut he was very sure, it seems like, maybe you can correct me, that Britain and France would still carry on with appeasement even after he invaded Poland.\nAbsolutely.\nHe he was completely convinced by it.\nThere was clearly a kind of sort of 10 to 15% level of doubt, but what the heck, I'm gonna do it anyway.\nHe was just he ratcheted himself up into such a lav of of kind of this is the moment.\nI have to do it now.\nThis is fate.\nI'm 50 and and you know I could be taken out by an assassin's bullet.\nI've got this important life's work that I've got to do.\nWe've got to get on with it now.\nThere could be no more delay.\nThis is my mission.\nYou know, this is our mission of the German people.\nAnd either the German people have got the will and the and the spirit to be able to pull it off or you know I was wrong and and therefore you know we don't deserve to be a thousand right, we don't deserve to be the master race, black or white, us or them, either or, it's same all the time.\nSo can you tell the story of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 1939?\nSo they make an agreement, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and that leads us just like you mentioned in a matter of days.\nYeah.\nHow compact everything is.\nIt's just really, really fascinating.\nIt's a beautiful summer in Europe.\nSummer of 1949, you know, it's one of these glorious summers that sort of never rains.\nIt's just sunshine, sunny day after sunny day.\nIt's kind of, you know, it's like that sort of golden summer of 1914 as well, you know, where sky always seems to be blue, fluffy white clouds, everyone's sort of, you know, but this sort of the storm clouds of war, to use that cliche, are kind of brewing.\nThe Russians have have reached out to Britain and France and said, \"Come, come on over.\nLet's negotiate, you know, let's see what we can do.\"\nUm, and there is just no stomach for that at all.\nI I mean if ever there is a I think a mistake that's Britain and France should have been a bit more into real politics and than they were, that it's such an opportunity to to ensure that you to snooker the Third Reich and and they don't take it.\nUm because you know in many ways they see the westward spread of communism in exactly the same way that the Nazis see the threat of the westward spread of communism as something that's every bit as repellent as Nazism and and they don't want to be getting into bed with these guys.\nUm of course they kind of have to kind of change tack on that one in summer of 1941 in you know very quick order.\nUm and that's the whole point about Churchill appeasing Stalin.\nI mean, you know, it's all very well people saying, well, you know, Churchill wouldn't have appeased Hitler in the 1930s, but he does appease.\nHe appeases all the time.\nUm, and they miss that opportunity.\nAnd the and the the French and British delegation is third tier commanders, generals going over.\nIt's it's a you know, it's a shit show.\nI mean, it Yeah, excuse my French, but I mean, it's just it's it's a nonsense that they're not ready for.\n\n\nIt. They're not prepared. The British guy, um, Admiral Drax, doesn't have any authority. Um, the whole thing is a complete joke. It's it's never going to get anywhere. You tell the story of this quite beautifully, actually. Uh, again, it's such a human story. I mean, it seems like Stalin and the Soviets, they've already made up their mind. But I don't think they have. I think what they Wait, wait, wait. I mean, you described quite well that that they value in-person meeting. Yes. So, like Chamberlain should have just gone to Moscow. Yeah. Get on a plane. Like it I it's such a uh maybe it's a simplistic notion, but that could have changed the trajectory of human history right there. I really think it could have done. I think that was I think that's I think that's much more grievous mistake than than than Munich. Why are leaders so hesitant to meet? I I I'm told now by a bunch of diplomats that no no no no no there's a process you know first you have to have these diplomats meet and they have to draft a bunch of stuff and I sometimes have this simplistic notion like why not why not meet why not meet like I think there is a human element there um of course especially when there's this force that is Hitler. Well yes and because we humans we like to interact and and you like to see people in three dimensions and you know I'm sure it's why you always quite rightly insist on doing your podcast face to face cuz you want to get the cut of someone's chip and you want to be able to see them and and you want to see the intonation in their expression and the whites of their eyes and all that kind of stuff. And that that just does make a difference of course because you know we're fundamentally animals and we kind of we we want to be sizing people up and it's much easier to do that when you're a few feet away from each other than it is on a video screen or through the prism of someone else. Yeah. But there's also just you see the the humanity in in others. It's so much easier this you see this in social media. It's so much easier to talk shit about others when you're not with them. Yes. And and like military conflict is the extreme version of that. You can construct these narratives that they're not human, that they're evil, that they're you can construct a communist ideology, all these you can project onto them the worst possible uh version of a human. But when you meet them, you're like, \"Oh, they are just a person. They're just a person.\" Well, it's the world's great tragedy that that that it's only a few people that want to go to war and the vast majority want to live happily contented lives getting on with their neighbors. I mean, it has been ever thus. It's just it is those few that kind of ruin it for everybody else. But but but anyway, to go back to Leningrad um back in August 1939, they go halfcock. They're disrespectful to Soviet Union as a result of that. Um it gets nowhere. Had they been able to put on a really really firm offer there and then to the Soviet Union, Soviet Union would have would have probably come in. I mean, the big thing is is that the Soviet Union said, \"This is a big stumbling block.\" The Soviet Union said, \"Yeah, but we want to be able to march through Poland if we get threatened by Germany.\" Mhm. Both the British and the French just smell a massive rat there. They're basically saying, you know, if they agree to that, what they're what they fear is that Soviet Union will just march into Poland and go, \"Yeah, but you said we could and take it.\" Which they unquestionably would have done, but it would have stopped the World War probably. They're willing to appease Hitler. They're not willing to appease Stalin in that situation. Well, they're not willing to appease anybody by that stage. That's the point. Well, they appeased Hitler because they did for the year before, but there now there's a bottom line, you know, which is which is Poland, you know. So, it's changed. That's why right but anyway the bottom line is they don't you know there is a there is a a reluctance on the part of French and the British to negotiate with the Soviet Union because they're communists don't like them don't trust them worry about what they're going to do with Poland and they're going to be you know jumping out of the fire into the kind of water and it doesn't come off and as a consequence of that Soviet Union continue to pursue more hardly you know um more more viciferously the opportunities that the um that the Germans are offering which is this split of Poland cuz Soviet Union wants that part of Poland back in its own sphere of influence and it doesn't want to go to war just yet and the agreement that they won't attack each other essentially. Yeah. Do you think Stalin actually believed that? No, he believed it in the same way that Hitler believed it that it was a cynical kind of, you know, convenient bit of real politic for now. I mean, I I think Soviet Union was as determined to get rid of the Nazis as the Nazis were determined to get rid of the Soviet Union. I think whoever fired first was not not decided at that point. But I do think from the moment that Hiller takes power in 1943, a conflict between Soviet Union, Nazi Germany is inevitable. Yeah. So either direction you think it's inevitable. Yeah, I think I think there's Yeah, there's a huge amount of evidence for that. Stalin probably wanted it what, like in 42 43? Yeah, something like that. Yeah. And you know, they're doing exercises and stuff and building out. He's not ready yet because he knows he's done the purges and he's got to get his his army, you know, he's got to get his armed forces back into shape and all the rest of it, but you know, so they have this incredibly cynical agreement, but at that point, you know, Hitler's hands are untied. You know, he no longer has to worry about about the threat from the Soviet Union. um he\n\n\nHe's got car plans to go into Poland, and he doesn't believe that France and Britain are going to go to war over Poland.\nHe's wrong about that, obviously, but France and Britain, despite going to war with him, still do nothing.\nSo, you know, he's got away with it.\nWho was Churchill, and how did Churchill come to power at this moment?\nWell, Churchill is this absolutely towering figure in British politics.\nYou know, who's been, you know, first a minister in the kind of naughties of the 20th century and the first years of the 20th century.\nUm, first of the Liberals, then of the Conservatives.\nHe's a former chancellor, um, of the Jacka.\nUm, he's a towering figure, but he's been in the wilderness because he's out of favor with the Stanley Baldwin government.\nUm, he's out of favor with Chamberlain, but he is this towering figure, and he has been very outspoken as a backbencher, which basically means, you know, you're not a minister, you're not in the cabinet, you're just an ordinary member of parliament, but obviously you're an ordinary member of parliament, but you're also an ordinary member of parliament who has had ministries of state and who is this tyran figure.\nSo, he's listened to in a way that other backbenches aren't.\nUm, and he has been saying, you know, we need to stand up to the dictators.\nWe need to do this.\nUm, we need to rearm more more heavily, uh, and blah blah blah.\nSo when war is declared, he's brought back into the admiral, um, in charge of the navy, which is Britain's senior service, and um, suddenly he's there.\nAnd what happens is Britain doesn't really do anything.\nIt's very difficult working with France because France is so politically fractured that they can't make any decisions, and when you can't make any decisions, you're just impotent.\nUm, and so Churchill first mentions going into Norway mining the leads.\nSo, um, the idea is that you're making life very difficult for the Germans to get iron ore out of Sweden.\nTheir main source of iron ore is up in the northern part of Sweden in the Arctic Circle.\nIt then goes on a railway through northern tip of Norway and then gets shipped down the um west coast of Norway into Germany into the Baltic.\nSo, uh, Churchill suggests in September 1949, why don't we mine the leads, which are the leads are these passageways, um, out of the fjords and the in the north into the, uh, into the North Sea.\nWhy don't we mine those and stop the Germans from from from, um, taking this.\nEveryone goes, \"Well, yeah, that's quite a good idea, but they can't decide.\"\nAnd French are nervous that if they do that, the Germans retaliate and bomb France and all this kind of stuff.\nSo, no decision is made until kind of April 19, 1940.\nThey go up to start mining the leads on exactly the same day that the Germans invade Denmark and and Norway, and so they're they're caught off guards.\nAnd at that moment, really, it's seen as a failure of Chamberlain's government.\nAnd there is a kind of a mounting realization that no matter how good he was or competent he was as a peacetime prime minister, he's not a wartime prime minister.\nYou know, he's not served in the armed forces himself.\nHe doesn't really understand it.\nIt needs a different set of hands.\nAnd um, his government falls on the 9th of May.\nIt becomes inevitable that he's going to have to resign, and the obvious person to take his place is Lord Halifax, who is in the House of Lords, but you can still be a prime minister, and um, he is without question the most respected politician in the country.\nHe's um, a former viceroy of India.\nHe's seen as incredibly safe pair of hands, man of resolute sound judgment, etcetera, etcetera, um, but he doesn't want to take it.\nHe feels physically ill at the prospect, doesn't want this responsibility.\nHe's also not really a military man.\nHe's got a slightly sort of withered hand, which has prevented him from doing military service, and he just blanches at this moment.\nAnd that really leaves only one other figure that could possibly take on this position, and that's Churchill.\nSo when Chamberlain resigns on the 9th of May and Halifax says it's it's not for me, um, the only person who's going to slip into that position is Churchill, and he becomes prime minister, and he accepts it gladly.\nHe feels like it is his mission in life.\nThis is his moment cometh the outcome of the man.\nBut he comes with a huge amount of baggage.\nI mean, you know, he's known as a man who drinks too much, who's whose judgment hasn't always been great.\nYou know, he was chancellor during the time of the general strike 1926.\nYou know, he backed Edward VII over the uh monarchy crisis when the king wanted to marry Wallace Simpson, the divorcee, Catholic divorcee, etcetera, etcetera, so you know, his judgment has been brought into question.\nYou know, he is the man who was he who came up with the idea of the Gallipoli campaign, which was, you know, an ignominious failure, blah blah blah, so there are issues over him.\nYou know, he is seen as a hotthead and a man who doesn't have the kind of sound judgment of Halifax, so the jury is is very much out, and I think it's again, it's one of those things where you have to put yourself in, you have to look at this through the prism of what people were thinking in May 1940.\nYes, he he was considered a taran politician, but he is seen also as a loose cannon and by no means the right person in this hour of darkness.\nAnd it is coincidental that the 10th of May 1940, when he takes over as prime minister, becomes prime minister, not through an election, but by default of a new nationalist government.\nAnd so no longer a conservative comp government, but a nationalist cross party coalition government for the duration of the war.\nUm, which includes, you know, members of of the Liberal Party and also the Labor Party as well as Conservatives that it is by no means certain that that he's going to be able to deliver the goods.\nAnd it is also coincidentally the same day that the Germans launched case yellow, operation yellow, the invasion of the low countries in France.\nSo these are tumultuous events to put it mildly.\nAnd it is also the case that you know\n\n\nOnly a couple of weeks before, um, Paul Reo has taken over as prime minister of yet another coalition government in France from Dadier.\n\nSo, political turmoil is very much the watchword at this time for the, uh, for the Western democracies, just at the moment that the Germans are making their kind of, you know, their hammer strike into the west.\n\nThis might be a good moment to bring up this idea that has been circulating recently, brought up by Daryl Cooper, who hyperbolically stated that Churchill was the, quote, chief villain of, uh, the Second World War. To give a good faith interpretation of that, I believe he meant that Churchill forced Hitler to escalate the expansion of Nazi Germany beyond Poland into a global war. So, Churchill is the one that turned this narrow war, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, into a global one.\n\nUm, is that accurate? No, I don't think it is. I mean, not least because the decisions over Poland were made by Chamberlain's government, not when Churchill was out of government. So, you know, Churchill wasn't even involved in that decision-making process at the time. No, I, I don't think so. I mean, again, I, I go back to kind of Britain's position in in the world in 1939. If you say we are going to defend the sovereignty of Poland, and then you don't, that is that looks really bad globally. You know, Britain's prestige would plummet, would lead to all sorts of problems. Um, you are saying that you're giving car blanche to dictators to just run a mock and take whatever territory they want. You are risking a future upheaval of the global order, um, away from democracies into the hands of dictators. You know, in the west, people believe in democracy and believe in advancement of, of, and freedoms of people. This is, you know, to, to echo the words of Roosevelt in August 1941. You know, that they're aspiring to a world, um, free of want and fear. Now, obviously, there's still some issues with the form that democracy takes in the 1930s. It's not democratic for everyone. You know, try saying that if you're in Nigeria or, uh, or, or India or whatever. Um, or if you're, you know, in the black southern states of the United States. But the aspirations are there. And I think that's, that's, that's an important distinction. And I think by saying that that Churchill is the chief warmonger of the Second World War, I think is, is ludicrous. You know, it's the same thing about about the bombing, you know, the, the, the detractors of strategic air campaign always go, \"Yeah, but you know, Germans had the Holocaust, but, but weren't the, weren't the allies just as bad killing all those civilians?\" It's like, \"No, because the moment Hitler stopped the war, the bombing would stop.\" You know, the moment the war stopped in Hitler's favor, the killing would continue and be accelerated. So, the, the thing you mentioned initially is the sort of the idealist perspective of, well, Britain can't allow sort of, uh, this warmonger to break all these pacts and be undemocratic, you know, um, murder a large number of people and do conquest of territory. Okay, that's idealistic, but if we look at a realist perspective, what decisions would minimize the amount of suffering on the continent in the next 50 years?\n\nSo, one of the arguments that he's making, I happen to disagree with it, to put it mildly, is that Churchill increased the amount of suffering. So, Churchill, Churchill's presence and decisions. So, we're not talking about idealistic perspective. We're talking about realist, like the, the reality of the war of Stalin, of, of Hitler, of Churchill, of, uh, of France and FDR. Did Churchill drag Hitler into a world war? Did he force Hitler to invade the Soviet Union? Did he force Hitler to then invade, uh, attack Britain? Well, no, because, because Hitler was always going to invade the Soviet Union if, unless, unless the Soviet Union invaded Germany first. So, that was always going to happen. Um, no one asked Hitler to invade the low countries and Norway and Denmark and attack Britain.\n\nUm, he does that, of course, because he's not given a free hand in Poland, but there's no question that Hitler would have also wanted to subdue France or certainly turn France from a democracy into a totalitarian state as well. I'm absolutely certain about that. So, I think there's pretty definitive evidence. I mean, it's obvious from everything he's said, from everything he's written, from everything everywhere that he was going to invade the Soviet Union, uh, no matter what. Yeah. And France, most likely. Yes. Also, he would have done a deal with Britain. Britain could have coexisted. So, actually, there is a, is there, there is a possible reality. I don't know, maybe you can correct me on this, where Hitler basically takes all of Europe except Britain. Yes. But then he would have got so strong that he would have then turned on Britain as well. You know, because he, he would, you know, the fear is that if you let him do this and then, then he, he gets greedy, he wants the next one, then he wants the next one, then he wants the next one, and, you know, then he wants to take over the whole world. And, you know, that is that is the fear of the British. That is the fear of the Americans. That's a fear of President Roosevelt, who's got a very, we haven't even touched on this yet, but he has a very difficult, uh, um, case on his hands because he's come into power also in January 1933, um, as president of the United States on an isolationist ticket with a retrenching, with a kind of sort of, you know, step away from the European old order. It's time for the Europeans on their own. Um, it all sounds very familiar right now. Um, and, and suddenly he's got to do this gargantuan political vault, um, and prepare the nation for war because he also fears, like Churchill fears, like most, like Chamberlain feared as well, um, that that Hitler's designs are not purely on Eastern Europe and the Lebanon's there, but would get ever bigger, and I don't, I don't doubt that they're right. I think if he'd prevailed in the Soviet Union, you know, he, he'd always wanted more, you know, because his whole concept is the\n\n\nMaster race, you know.\nYeah.\nI, I think, I think it should be said, if we, if we measure human suffering, if there was not Britain on the other side, if it was not a two-front war, that the chances of Hitler succeeding in the Soviet Union is much higher, or at least a more prolonged war, and there would be more dead, more enslaved, and more tortured, and all of this.\nYes, and, and ditto, if you, you know, if the, if the allies hadn't got involved against Imperial Japan, you know, it would have been, would have been catastrophic.\nI mean, 20 to 30 million Chinese dead anyway, you know, with American and British intervention, you know, was it going to be in China without that?\nI mean, and elsewhere, you know, because, because the reason why Japan invades French Indo-China, now Vietnam, um, and Hong Kong, and, um, and Malaya, and Singapore, and, and so on, and Burma, is because it's not winning in China, and it needs more resources because it's resource poor, and America has cut off the tap.\nSo is going into these countries to, to get what it needs, its rubber and oil and natural resources and ores, precious ores, and all the rest of it.\nAnd if it had been unchecked, it would have done so.\nAnd then it would have absolutely built up its strength and overrun the whole of China with even more deaths.\nSo, you know, I, I, I think there is, I think the one of the interesting things about the Second World War is, is lots of wars and why people get involved in them are extremely questionable.\nBut I think there is a moral crusade to the Allies and what they're doing that I think is entirely justified.\nWhat I think is interesting also is that as the war progresses, you know, if the allies are supposed to be on the force of the good, how come they're doing so much bad?\nAnd at what point is doing bad stopping you from doing good?\nAnd at what point are you doing good but also doing bad at the same time?\nSuch as destruction of cities, um, destruction of monasteries on outcrops in southern Italy, you know, destruction of killing of loss of civilians, etc., etc.\nYou know, that these are, these are difficult questions to answer.\nSometimes they're also incredibly interesting, and I think that moral component starts to blur a little bit by kind of middle of the war, by 1943, you know, it's, it's kind of easy to have a, a fairly, uh, cut and dry, um, war in North Africa, in the deserts of North Africa, where, you know, the only people getting in the way are a few sort of Bedouin tribesmen or something, but, but once you start getting into Europe or getting into the kind of the, the meat of highly populated countries in the Far East, um, for example, that's a different kind of fish because the scale of destruction is absolutely immense.\nBut it is also the job of political leaders, um, to look after and defend their own peoples first and foremost.\nAnd so what you're doing is you're trying to protect your own sovereignty, your own people before you're protecting other people.\nAnd so that's what leads to, you know, the whole way in which the allies are, the Western Allies are protracting war is to try and minimize the number of deaths of their own young men as much as they possibly can whilst at the same time winning the war.\nAnd that means bringing lots of destruction to your enemies, but also trying to minimize it.\nAnd the way you bring lots of destruction by to your enemies is by using immense firepower and this concept of steal not our flesh, which I mentioned earlier on, and technology, um, so that you don't have to bring to bear too many of your young men's eyes, and you don't have a repeat of the slaughter of the First World War.\nSo, you know, it is really interesting that, that in, in our mind's eye when we're thinking of, you know, the Western Allies in, in the Second World War, probably the first thing that comes into mind is Americans jumping out of landing craft on Omaha Beach on D-Day, for example.\nThose are infantrymen.\nThey're the front line.\nThey are the cold face of that.\nThey're the first people going into the, into the fire of the enemy.\nAnd we tend to think about guys in tanks, um, infantrymen with their Garand rifles or, you know, machine guns or whatever.\nThat's, that's what springs to mind.\nYet, actually, they're a comparatively small proportion of the army.\nSo, no more than 14 to 15% of any army, allied army, is infantry.\n45% are service corps, service troops driving trucks and cooks and bottle washers and people lugging great big boxes of stuff, you know, and that's because by that stage, you know, the allies have worked out the way of war, which is, is to, is to use, is what I call big war, this concept of a very long tail, logistics, the operational art, making sure that people have the absolute best you possibly can, great medical care, huge advances in, in, in first aid and, and medical care of troops, getting them back onto the battlefield, and for using firepower and technology and mechanization to do a lot of your hard yards.\nSo, you know, that's the principle behind strategic bombing.\nYou know, if you can, if you go over and bomb and you can destroy infrastructure and civilians and households, that makes it much harder for, for corrupt to make those Panther tanks and Tiger tanks or whatever it might be and guns.\nAnd, you know, you're disrupting the transportation system in Germany, you know, you're making life difficult for them to do what they need to do, then that means it's going to be easier for those 15, 14, 15% of infantrymen who've got to jump out of anticraft to do their job.\nAnd you're trying to keep that to a minimum.\nAnd you'd have to say, broadly speaking, that's a very sensible policy that makes an awful lot of sense.\nUm, consequence of that is a huge amount of destruction.\nAnd maybe that's what Daryl Cooper's driving at, but no one asked Hitler to invade Poland.\nI mean, you know, that is the bottom line.\nNo one asked Germany to go to war.\nNo one asked Hitler to come up with these ludicrous ideology.\nYeah.\nThere's complex ethical discussions here about, uh, uh, just like as you describe, which are fascinating, which are fascinating, and, uh, war is hell, and there's many ways in which it is hell.\nUh, just for a little bit, the steel man what, uh, Daryl is where he might be coming.\n\n\nFrom is since World War II.\nThe simplistic veneration of Churchill, sort of saying Churchill good, Hitler bad, has been used as a template to project under other conflicts, to justify military intervention. And so his general, his and other people like libertarians, for example, resistance to that overly simplistic veneration of somebody like Churchill has to do with the fact that that seems to be by neocons and war-mongers in the military-industrial complex in the United States and elsewhere, using Hitler way too much, using Churchill way too much to justify invading everywhere and anywhere.\nI, well, I, I do agree with that.\nI think oversimplification of anything is a mistake.\nYou know, life is nuanced.\nThe past is nuanced.\nIt's okay to be proud about certain things, and it's okay to be disgusted by other things.\nThat's absolutely fine.\nYou know, we have a complicated relationship with our past.\nIt doesn't need to be black and white.\nAnd, um, you know, life is not a straight line.\nAnd of course, as you know, the allies make plenty of mistakes in in in World War II.\nOverall, I think they made the right calls.\nAnd I think one of the things that's really interesting is I think that that the Allies for the most part use their resources much more judiciously and sensibly than the Axis powers do, and you know, good, um, because that means they prevail.\nI think, you know, there are so many lessons, um, from World War II that could have been brought into the last, the history of the last 30 years, which weren't, you know, such as, you know, if you have, if you, if you decapitate an incredibly strong leader, you get a power vacuum, and if you don't have a solution for that power vacuum, lots of bad elements are going to sweep into that in very quick order, which of course is exactly what happens in in in Iraq.\nSo, you know, Donald Ronson going, we don't do reconstruction well, you freaking well should do.\nYou know, this, this, if you're going to, if you're going to take on this, this particular challenge, you've got to see it through.\nYou know, that's, that's simply not good enough.\nYou know, it's not good enough to go into Afghanistan and go, \"Okay, we're going to change things around.\nIt's going to be great.\nYou know, all the women are going to have education.\nThey won't have to wear kind of, you know, uh, um, won't have to cover up their bodies anymore.\nUm, anything goes.\nWe love liberalism.\nIt's great.\nUm, let's make cobble into a thriving city once more,\" and then suddenly bug out, you know, because what, what, what's going to happen?\nYou're going to undo everything.\nAnd and I remember being in, you know, this is a bit of a segue, Lex, but I, I remember being in in Northern Helman province back in, you know, when was it, January 2008, and uh, British troops had just taken over an absolute dump of a town called, um, Musakala.\nAnd I remember talking to this Afghan guy.\nHe, he just had all his willow trees chopped down to make room for a helipad that the allies wanted, which they, you know, they put their kind of sur, you know, those cages with kind of rubble in the protective wall, is it called Hesco, I think it was called.\nAnyway, I said to him, what do, what do you think about about the British being there?\nAnd he just went, shrugged at me, lifted up his hands and said, \"Well, you know, if they stay, great, but they won't.\"\nAnd he said, said, \"You know, if they stay, then brilliant, but he said, I tell you what,\" he said, \"Taliban went great.\nThey weren't fantastic.\"\nHe said, \"But I could leave my personal wall and no one would touch it.\nI could leave it on a wall for a week.\nNo one would touch it.\"\nSaid, said, \"Will they bring that kind of order?\nYou know, will, will we have, will we have peace here?\nYou know, they've just chopped down my, my willow trees.\nYou know, thanks a lot.\"\nAnd you, you know, you, you're seeing a total lack of understanding of the culture, ethnic differences, you're trying to impose a kind of western-centric view onto something which is just some, you know, onto, onto a, onto a nation which isn't, isn't ready for that.\nNow there are ways in which, you know, it looked like Afghanistan was starting to kind of emerge, and there was a path, and then just at the critical moment, the west moves out with catastrophic consequences.\nWhat you have to say though is that in the west post 1945, the rehabilitation of Italy, of Japan, of western Germany was really good.\nYou know, the consequence of of all that destruction, all that turmoil was thriving, high-producing democracies which burst forth into the kind of second half of the 20, 20th century and into the 21st century in pretty good order.\nUm, so the lessons of the previous generation from the First World War had had been, had been learned, even though the scale of destruction, the displacement of people is unprecedented in 1945.\nIn 1939, what was the state of the militaries?\nWhat were the most powerful militaries on the world stage at that time?\nWell, um, in terms of naval power, Britain, as we've already discussed, and and and the United States.\nFrance has a pretty large navy.\nUh, Japan has a pretty large navy.\nItaly has a pretty large navy.\nBut Italy's navy is by far and away its most modern aspect of its three services, air, land, and sea.\nUm, but it doesn't have any aircraft carriers and doesn't have any radar.\nSo, you know, it's, it's, they've got modern battleships and battle cruisers, but without key modern bits of technology.\nSo, Italy is really not ready for war.\nOh, it's so not.\nIt's so not.\nIt's just again, both Hitler and Mussolini, they, they lack geopolitical understanding, you know, that's because they're so kind of focused on their narrow worldview, and they view everything through that prison, but they can't see that bigger picture.\nAnd we should say that Mussolini, maybe you can correct me, but I don't think at any point he wants a war.\nHe doesn't want a war.\nWhat he does want is he wants his own new kind of Roman Empire which extends over the\n\n\nThe Mediterranean, the kind of certainly the eastern part of the Med, half of the Mediterranean, North Africa all the way down to kind of East Africa, controlling the Sewish Canal.\nThat, that's what he wants.\nAnd I think he made clear that he was, I mean, there's always like this little brother jealous of Hitler kind of situation because he, he wanted absolute power the way Hitler did, but doesn't have it.\nDoesn't have it.\nAnd describe, yeah.\nThere's a monarchy often forgotten.\nIt's amazing.\nSo there's always this limit, and Hitler, quite brilliantly, once he gets some power, he takes it all, complete.\nHe completely emasculates Mussolini.\nAnd yeah, he likes him though.\nIt's really weird.\nEven when Mussolini is about to fall in July 1943, he has a meeting at Feltree, um, just literally a few days before Muslini tumbles, and he does that because he likes Mussolini.\nHe likes him as a man and thinks he's being his friend, and you know, he respects him to a certain extent, even though he's, he definitely views himself as top dog.\nHitler does that is.\nUm, so it's kind of curious because I don't think Hitler particularly likes anyone, really, but, but he does seem to like Mussolini.\nBut anyway, the problem with Mussolini is, Muslim, Muslim Italy is, is very impoverished from the First World War, you know, and that of course leads to the rise of fascism and the overthrow of parliamentary democracy and, and why Muslim takes place in the first place, you know, again, it's that kind of, there's been this terrible disruption, there's been financial crisis that leads to kind of people looking at an alternative.\nYou know, what's the alternative?\nWell, Mussolini is going, you know, we can be proud Italians again.\nLots of chest thumping, you know, wearing great uniforms, all the rest of it.\nPeople kind of think, well, you know, I have a piece of that, and it kind of works, and, you know, preferably the trains work on time under him and, and so on and so forth.\nBut he just gets ahead of himself, you know, and, and actually the writings on the war in 1945 when he goes into Abiscinia and, and you know, again, sort of what effectively are kind of, by first world European standards, privitive tribesmen in in in Abbiscinia.\nYou know, they, they have quite a tough fight there.\nYou know, they, they do prevail, but, but it's not a complete walkover, and they get a bit of a bloody nose at times, and they shouldn't have done, and they're just not ready.\nThey don't have the industry, you know, they're, they're tied up into the Mediterranean.\nThey don't have access to the world's oceans.\nThey do have some merchant shipping, but not a huge amount.\nUm, you know, they just don't have what is required.\nThey don't, they're dependent on Britain for coal.\nBritain is the leading coal exporter in the world in the 1930s.\nSo Britain's approach to fascist Spain and approach to fascist Italy has been very much sort of stick and carrot.\nIt's like, you know, we'll let you do what you do as long as you kind of stay in your box and, and you know, we'll continue to provide you with supplies and coal and whatever is you need as long as you don't kind of go too far.\nAnd so that's why Mussolini is very anxious in 1938 and again in 1939 to kind of be the power broker and kind of not let Germany go to war.\nBut Germany's just, you know, they, they signed the the Axis Pact of Steel in May 1939 where they become formal allies.\nThis is Hitler and um Mussolini, Italy and Germany.\nBut it's always a very, very unequal partnership right from the word go.\nOne of the reasons Mussolini signs it is because he fears that Germany has designs on Italy.\nYeah.\nIt's not because he thinks, \"Oh, these guys are great.\nYou know, they're our natural bedfellows.\"\nIt's so that he can, what, what it's a mutually convenient pact whereby Germany gets on with whatever it wants to do up in Northern Europe and Eastern Europe.\nItaly is given a free hand to do whatever it wants to do.\nThey'll just kind of watch each other's backs.\nThey have borders, you know, Austria and and Italy border one another.\nUm, and they'll just do their own thing and they'll kind of help each other out with supplies and stuff.\nUm, but, but basically they won't, they'll, they'll be their own, it's, it's a kind of marriage of convenience.\nYou know, they're never expecting to be fighting alongside each other on the battlefield.\nNot really.\nThere is a kind of obligation to do so, but, but it's, it's an obligation with no expectation of ever actually happening.\nAnd so from Muslimini's point of view, the pact still is, is kind of, you know, it's just sailing your flag to one particular mass and kind of trying to cover your, cover your back.\nAnd so long as he plays his cards right, you know, he can, he can still get his coal supplies from Britain.\nHe doesn't have to worry about that.\nYou know, the pctor still doesn't make any difference to that.\nThe, the problem for him is, is that in June 1940, he thinks that France is about to be defeated and that Britain will surely follow.\nAnd so he thinks, \"Ah, I've got some rich pickings.\nI can take Malta.\nI can take British possessions.\nI can overrun Egypt.\nAnd you know, now is my time.\nBut I, I also need to kind of join the fight before France is completely out of the fight.\nOtherwise, it looks like I'm a Johnny come lately and I won't, I won't get those spoils because the Germans will go, \"Yeah, you can't have all this stuff.\nYou've turned up too late.\nYou need to be in the fight.\"\nSo, he does it what he thinks is the perfect timing.\nAnd it turns out to be a catastrophic timing because, of course, Britain doesn't exit the fight.\nYou know, Britain is still there.\nAnd you know, by February 1941, a very, very tiny British army in Egypt has overrun, you know, two entire Italian armies and taken 133,000 prisoners in North Africa.\nSo you mentioned in the sea, uh, who were the dominant armies, who were, who was\n\n\nDominant in the air?\nWell, in the air it has to be the Luftwaffe, uh, and it is also the Imperial Japanese, both in the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Imperial Japanese Army.\nThey both have air forces, and one of the reasons that is because the quality of the pilots in Japan is extremely high because it's so difficult to get to get to the top position.\nYou know, you are going to your frontline squadrons with at least 500 hours in your log book.\nTo put that into some perspective, you know, a British RAF or Luftwaffe pilot would be joining their frontline squadrons with 150 to 170 hours in the log book.\nSo it is that these guys are disciplined to within an inch of their lives.\nUm, they are, you know, there are academic tests as well as physical endurance tests.\nYou know, they are the elite of the elite, and they are extremely good.\nThe problem they have is that there is a good number of them, but there's not that many.\nThe Luftwaffe is the largest air force in the world in 1939, but it is already at a parity when in in aircraft production with Britain.\nUm, and the French have a kind of similar size army, but they're very, very badly organized.\nSo, they're also they're organized into different regions, and they one region doesn't re is not really talking to another.\nAnd one of the problems that when Case Yellow, the invasion of German invasion of the west starts, France's army of the air is spread throughout France and has its own little area.\nYou have one bunch of, you know, fighters and bombers in that block in, you know, in the Marseilles area.\nYou have another block in kind of, you know, on the Britany coast, and you have another block in around Sudan, and you have another that.\nSo, so consequently, they're never be they're never able to kind of bring their full strength to bear.\nSo it's although although they've both got about three and a half thousand aircraft on paper and about two and a half thousand that are fit to fly on any one given day, the Luftwaffe, because they're the aggressor, can choose how they mass their aircraft and where they attack and and at when.\nSo in other words, you can send Luftwaffe can send overwhelming amounts of bombers and fighter planes and pulverize a French airfield and catch them napping.\nBecause the French don't have a defense system, they can't see whether they're coming.\nSo their only hope is to kind of take off and just hope they stoogge around the sky and hope they bump into some Luftwaffe.\nAnd of course that's inherently inefficient, and they get, you know, they get destroyed.\nThey get destroyed in in penny packets rather than on mass.\nThe difference with the RAF is is the RAF is not done on an air force basis where you have each air core or air fleet has a handful of bombers, a handful of um fighters, a handful of reconnaissance planes.\nThey have different commands.\nSo they have bomber command, fighter command, training command, cursal command, and they all have very specific roles.\nSo they're they're structured in a completely different way.\nAnd the other and that's because they're an island nation, um, and because they see their role militarily in a in a in a different way, and because the rearming that Britain has done in the 1930s is all about defense.\nIt is not about aggression at this point, not about taking it to the enemy.\nIt is it is showing you're tough, but also first and foremost getting your ducks in a row and making sure that you don't get defeated.\nSo this is the principle behind the the first the world's first fully coordinated air defense system, which is the radar chain, it is the observer core, it is control rooms, it is interesting technology such as identification friend or foe IFFF, which is where you have a little pulse which so you have these control rooms and you have a map table and you have a tote board in front of you where you can see what squadrons are airborne, what state of readiness they're at, you know, whether they're engaging the enemy, little lights come on and show you, you can see weather maps, you can see see the cloud ceiling.\nYou see all of that at a glance.\nThen you're on a dis and then down in front of you is a massive great map of southern England.\nYou've got crooious sort of moving plots.\nSo you can through a combination of radar which picks up a kind of a rough idea of what's coming towards you combined with the observer core, you have overlapping observer core stations all over Britain covering every single inch of airspace over Britain looking up into the air and seeing how many aircraft there are a and at what height they are, and you have little um thing called a panagramraph, which is a a piece of equipment which helps you judge um altitude.\nYou then ring through that that all comes into the control room along with the information from the radar stations which is going into a single filter room at at fighter command headquarters which is then being pushed straight back out to the sector stations.\nSo this information is being updated all the time.\nSo you have a plot and it looks like it might be, you know, enemy bombers 30 plus, for example, that's constantly being adapted.\nSo as more information comes in, you will change that, and then you can see that actually it's only 20 aircraft or 22 aircraft or whatever.\nSo you're updating that, and that little figure is put on the on your little plot and moved across, and so you can see and then because you can identify your own aircraft, you can then see where they are moving, and you're also on um the guys in the air are on the radio to ground controllers who are in these control rooms, and they're saying okay, well, if you proceed at, you know, angels 18, 18,000 ft, you know, on a vector of, you know, 150°, you should be seeing your enemy enemy bombing formation any moment now.\nAnd what that means is that you're not on the ground when the enemy are coming towards you with their bombers to hit your airfield, which means you're in the air.\nSo that all they're doing is hitting a grass airfield, which you've already got bulldozers and diggers and graders and lots of scalpings and earth ready to fill in the potholes, and it means you're good to go.\nAnd it means as a consequence of all that when the Germans do um launch their all-out assault on Adler Eagle Day on the 13th of August 1940, the British\n\n\nare ready.\nYou know, they can see them coming.\nThey know what to expect and they can anticipate.\nAnd it means that they're not being caught with their trousers down on the ground.\nAnd as a consequence of that, of the 138 airfields there are in RAF airfields there are in Britain, only one of them is knocked out for more than 48 hours in the entire summer of 1940.\nAnd that's Manston on the tip of the Kent coast, which is abandoned for the duration.\nSo these are the two biggest air forces.\nSo Lufafa, we should say German, I mean, they're like the legendary, the terrifying air force.\nThey are maybe, maybe they're slightly believing their own hype.\nThere's no question about it.\nWell, the rest of the world is also right.\nThey've just had it too easy.\nSo they don't have ground controllers.\nThey don't have an air defense system in Germany because why would you need an air defense system?\nWe're going to be the aggressor.\nYou know, there's no scenario where we'll have to defend the airspace of the Third Reich because we're on the offensive.\nSo they just haven't prepared it.\nSo there's that clash, the Battle of Britain, the clash of air forces.\nWhat explains the success of Britain in defending?\nWell, it's, I mean, you and everyone always says, you know, the the few were the last, you know, the last line of defense against the Nazi hordes and all this kind of stuff, and it's just it's all rubbish.\nThey're the first line of defense.\nSecond line of defense is the Royal Navy, which is the world's largest.\nAnd there is absolutely no chance on earth that a German invasion force made up of Ryan river barges, one out of every three is motorized and the other two aren't, is ever going to get successfully across the English Channel.\nAnd even if they did, they will be repulsed.\nI mean, they just it's just no chance.\nAnd it is often forgotten that while the Lufra is coming over and bombing Britain every single day, so is the RAF going over and bombing Germany.\nAnd one of the problems that the Germans have is is that these bombers need fighter protection.\nYou know, fighter planes are there to protect the bombers.\nAnd they don't have much fuel.\nAnd the Mesimmit 109E, the ME as a model is of of 1940 is the main stay of the German fighter force in the summer of 1940.\nAnd they don't have much fuel.\nSo they need to conserve their fuel, which means they need to be as close to Britain as they possibly can, which is why the majority of them are all in airfields which are hastily created in July 1940 following the fall of France in the Padacall, which is the closest point, you know, that's where the channel is its narrowest and all the rest of it and also in the northern Normandy and that's where they're flying from.\nBut what that means is that even if you're completely rubbish bombing, which the British are in 1940, they haven't developed those navigational aids that create untold accuracy by the end end of the war 1940, they don't, they don't have that luxury.\nIt's a target-rich environment.\nI mean, you know, you can barely miss if you go over to the aisle of, you know, the over to the paddala, I mean, it's literally, it's just like one huge great kind of hub of of fighter airfields and consequently that means that every single German squadron, which only is 12 airplanes strong on on establishment and very often even fewer than that, always has to leave two airplanes behind to defend their own airfield and it's really interesting when you look at kind of prison of war statements from from Lufka at Crown Crew that have been downed.\nThey're all bugged at a holding place called Trent Park.\nYou can see the transcripts of these conversations.\nThey're all going about how annoying it was that the RAF were over every night and they can't sleep and you know when they if only they just shut up and leave them alone and not bomb them.\nYou know, this is just part of the narrative of the battle of Britain that's completely left out.\nIt's always the stocky, you know, the plucky few against the kind of the, you know, the Nazi hordes and all the rest of it.\nAnd it's just, it's a complete misnomer.\nAnd by that time, aircraft production in Britain is massively outpacing the Germans.\nUm, and the best ratio that the Germans achieve in July 1940 is when the British produced 496 new Huracans and Spitfire single engine fighters and the Germans only produced 240 single engine fighters.\nThat's the best ratio.\nAnd of course, you know, that is the British outproducing the Germans 2 to 1.\nAnd what that means is by the end of October 1940 when the battle of Britain is sort of, you know, officially designated as being over, the single engine fighter force of Luwaffer is less than 200 from 750 or whatever it was in beginning of July.\nWhereas the British fighter force had been 650 or whatever at the beginning of July is now well over 750.\nAnd Britain is out producing.\nYeah.\nby to a massive degree and that that continues and you know that is a a ratio that just increases as the war progresses.\nI mean, Britain produces 132 and a half thousand aircraft in the Second World War.\nAmerica produces 315,000.\nSo why is there this legend of the Luftwafa?\nWell because it's the spearhead of the Blitz Creek.\nSo it has to do with the Blitz Creek.\nIt's to do with the Blitz Creek.\nThe the the Lufa becomes the kind of the bogeymen of the Third Reich.\nYou know, they're blamed for everything, but that's because they're completely abused.\nThey're the only part of of the Third Reich's armed services.\nThe only part of the Vermach, the Vermac being the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force, that is in constant use the whole time or constant abuse, I should say.\nIn Britain and America, they rotate their their pilots really really carefully.\nBy the time that but the that that you know you got the eighth fighter command, for example, part of the mighty eighth, the eighth air force operating in Britain.\nBy the by by the end of 1943, you would have in a squadron that would have 16.\nYou would never have more than 16 airborne from a squadron at any one time.\n\n\nYou would have 40 to 45 pilots for to service 16 in the air and a similar number of aircraft, which means you're not overusing these guys. And what would happen by that stage of the war, by 1943, you know, a young fighter pilot coming to a Thunderbolt squadron or a Mustang squadron, for example, um, at the end of 1943, beginning of 1944, he'd have 350 hours of consecutive flying because you can train in America, in Florida or California or Texas or wherever. However, you've got, you, you, you can process many, many more people because the training is much more intense because you've got clear skies. So, you're not, it's not a question of, of, oh, we'd like to take you out, out, Fritz this morning, but you know, it's a bit cloudy and, and, oh, the RAF are over, or you know, the Air Force are over, so we can't fly today. So, in Germany, pilot training is constant. Air crew train is constantly being interrupted by the war, by shortage of fuel, by inclement weather, etc., etc. In America, you have none of those problems. And Britain, because of its global reach, also has training bases in what was Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, in South Africa, um, in Canada as well. And so, you're able to process these guys much better. You're able to give them more training. So, when they come, they're the absolute, the finished article as pilots. What they're not the finished article as is, say, a bomber pilot or as a fighter pilot. But that's okay because you join your squadron of 40 other guys for 16 airborne. And the old hands kind of take you up a few times. So you arrive at, I don't know, let's say some airfield in Suffolk, in East Anglia, in England, and you know, you'll have 10 days to two weeks acclimatizing, getting used to it. The, you know, the old hands will put you through your paces, give you some trip tips, you can pick their brains during kind of while you're having some cow and and listen in on some briefings. Then the first mission you do will be a milk run over to France where the danger is kind of pretty minimal, you know, and and you can build up your experience. So by the time you're actually sent over on a mission to Berlin or or Bremen or you know, the Ruhr or whatever, you're absolutely the business. So qualitatively and quantitatively, you are just vastly superior to anything the Luftwaffe has got. The Luftwaffe by that stage, in contrast, 1940, new pilots coming to frontline squadrons with, you know, 150, 170 hours on their in their log books, less than 100, 90, 92 hours, something like that. It's not enough, and and they're just being flung straight into battle, and they're getting absolutely slaughtered. And they're also, because their machines are quite complicated, there's no two-seaters really. So, no two-seater trainers. So, the first time you're flying in your FAWolf 190 or your Messerschmitt 109, it's this horrendous leap of faith, which you, as a young, bright Luftwaffe fighter pilot, know that you're not ready for this, and it can bite you. And something like a, um, a Messerschmitt 109 has a very high wing loading. So it's very maneuverable in the air, but it's got these tiny wings. It's got this incredible torque. This deep Ben's DB 605 engine with this huge amount of torque, and it just wants to flip you over. So if you're not used to it, and it's got a narrow undercarriage as well, if you're not used to it, you, you could just crash. So, in the first couple of months of 1944, they lose something like 2,400 aircraft in the air and and pilots, and about 3,400 are accidents. So, it has to do with training, really. Yeah. Not training enough. It's training and resources and supply. And the Second World War, more than any other conflict, is a war of numbers. There are differences that decisions that generals can make. There are um moments where particular brilliance and bravery can seize the day, take the bridge, you know, hold the enemy at bay or whatever. But ultimately, you know, you're talking about differences which might make a month's difference, 6 months difference, maybe even several years difference. But ultimately, there's a certain point in the Second World War where the outcome is absolutely inevitable because the guys that lose can't compete with the numbers that the guys are going to win at. So in that sense, you could think of World War II as uh as a battle of factories. Yes. What does it take to win in the battle of factories in out manufacturing military equipment against the Allies? It's it's efficiency really. So I always kind of, you know, I, I was think, let's take the example of the Sherman tank, for example, the mainstay of the Western Allied forces, and a fair number of them sent to the Soviet Union as well, for that matter. Uh, I think you've said it doesn't get the respect it deserves. Maybe doesn't get the respect it deserves. So, the Sherman tank, the 75 mm main battle gun, which a sort of medium velocity, fire a shell around kind of 2,000 ft per second, compared to the notorious, infamous German 88 mm, which can fire at kind of third fast again, like 3,000 ft per second. But on paper, a Tiger tank coming around the corner and a Sherman tank coming around the corner, it should be no match at all. Tiger tank is 58 tons. Looks scary. Is scary. It's got a massive gun. It's got really thick armor. Sherman tank doesn't have as thick armor. It doesn't have a gun that's as as big. It should, it should be an absolute walkover. And yet, at about 5:30 p.m. on Monday, the 26th of June 1944, a Sherman tank came around the corner of a road called a Rumu, a little village called Fontenay-le-Marmion in Normandy, came face to face of a Tiger tank and won. How does this happen? Well, I tell you how it happened. Because the commander of the Sherman tank was experienced, had one up the spout. So what I mean by that is he had an armor-piercing round already in the breach. Soon as he saw the the Tiger tank, he just said fire. That armor-piercing round did not penetrate the Tiger tank. It was never going to. But what it did do was it created a it\n\n\nHit the gun mantlet, which is a bit of reinforced steel that you have just as the barrel is entering the turret.\nAnd that caused spalling, which is a little shards of little bits of molten metal, which then hit the driver of the Tiger tank in the head.\nAnd he was screaming, you know, \"Gone himl,\" or whatever, and and, you know, was couldn't really see.\nThe moment they got hit, the commander of the Tiger tank retreated into the turret of the Tiger.\nThe moment you retreat into the tig into a turret, you can't see.\nYou can see because you've got periscopes, but your visibility is nothing like as good as it is when you've got your head above the turret.\nImmediately after that, the armor-piercing round from the Sherman tank was repeated by a number of high-explosive rounds, which are rounds which kind of, you know, detonate, have a little minor charge.\nThen there was a second charge which creates lots of smoke and and and in moments, in the first 30 seconds, 10 rounds from that Sherman tank had hit the Tiger tank before the Tiger tank had had unleashed a single round itself, and the crew then surrendered.\nSo, you didn't need to destroy the Tiger tank.\nYou just need to stop it operating.\nIf it hasn't got a crew, it's it's a it's a it's just a chunk of metal that's inoperable.\nSo, that's all you need to do.\nAnd what that tells you is that experience counts, training counts.\nUm, the agility of the Sherman tank also counts.\nIt's a smaller shelf, therefore it's easy to manhandle, which means you can put more in a breech quicker.\nUm, there's features on a Sherman tank, like it's the first tank to have a gun stabilizing gyro, which means it's more effective on the move.\nThere's also an override switch on the underside of the turret so that the commander, if he just sees something out of the corner of his eye, can immediately start moving the the turret before the gunner who is down in the belly of the turret can can react.\nThere's many different factors of it, but the main fact of all is there 1,347 Tigers built.\nThere were 49,000 Sherman.\nSo that means there's 36 Shermans to every single Tiger.\nSo you actually have an incredible uh uh video.\nYou talk about this a lot from different angles about the the top five tanks and and then the bottom five tanks of World War II.\nI think was it the Tiger that made both the top five and the bottom five?\nThe problem with a Tiger tank is it's really huge.\nWe should say that you keep saying the problem, but the one of the pros of the Tiger tank, it's very huge.\nIt it's I mean the psychological warfare aspect of it is terrifying.\nYes.\nSo I I don't know what the other pros, I mean I guess yeah, the the 88 mm high velocity and all the rest of it, you know, it's pretty fearsome, but but there are there are pragmatic problems.\nThe the big problems is the Germans are are incapable of mass production on a scale that Americans could do.\nFrankly, even the British can do.\nI mean, they're just they're just not in that league.\nThe reason they're not in that league is because they're in the middle of Europe.\nThey don't have access to the world's oceans.\nThey don't have a merchant fleet.\nThey can't get this stuff.\nIt hasn't gone terribly well in the Soviet Union.\nUm, you know, they can't process it and they're being bombed 24 hours a day, and so all their factories are, you know, having to split them all up, and that is inherently inefficient because you're then having to kind of move different parts around and you know, you're then having the whole process of having to travel from one place to another to get stuff, you haven't got much fuel.\nSo the consequence of that is that what you do is you think, \"Okay, we can't mass-produce, so let's make really brilliant tanks,\" but they've lost sight of what a really brilliant is.\nYou know, really brilliant to their eyes is big, scary, big gun, lots of armor, but actually what conflict in World War II shows you is is that that you need more than that.\nYou need ease of maintenance, you need reliability, and the problem with having the bigger the tank, the more complex like the maintenance equipment is, you know, you need a bigger hoist, which then means you need a bigger truck, which then uses more fuel.\nSo, for example, the Tiger tank is so big that it doesn't fit on the loading gauge of the European railway system.\nSo, they have to have different tracks to roll onto the wagons that will then transport them from A to B, you know, take them from West Germany to Normandy.\nThen they have to take them off, then they have to take off the tracks, put on combat tracks, then move them into into battle and hope that they don't break down.\nThe problem is when you have you start the war that's not very automotive and you've only got 47 people for every motorized vehicle in Germany compared to three in the United States or eight in France is that you've got lots of people who don't know how to drive.\nYou've also means you haven't got lots of garages and mechanics and gas stations and and and so on.\nAnd so you're then creating an incredibly complex beast, but you want that complex thing to be as simple as you possibly can be.\nAnd that's the beauty of the Sherman tank, you know, all those guys in America, they're used to driving stick cars, you know, one of there's three people for every automobile, you know, and that includes, you know, the old and children.\nSo almost, you know, every young man knows how to drive.\nAnd when you get into a Sherman tank, it's got a clutch, it's got a throttle, the brakes are the steering mechanism.\nUm, the clutch is where you would expect the clutch to be.\nIt's got a manual shift.\nYou put your foot on the clutch and you shove it into second gear and off you go, or reverse or whatever.\nAnd it literally couldn't be easier.\nAnyone who can drive a stick car could drive a Sherman tank.\nSeriously, not everyone can drive a Tiger tank.\nIt's incredibly complex.\nReally, really is.\nAnd that comes with a whole host of of problems.\nAnd of course, you don't have the numbers.\nYou don't have the numbers.\nYou know, you've got 1,347 of them.\n\n\nI've got 492 King Tigers, which are even bigger. And, you know, at a time where you are really short of fuel and you're really short of absolutely everything. And those shells are huge and they're harder to manhandle. And weird little things that the Germans do, you know, for all their design genius, the loader is always on the right-hand side. Now, in the 1920s and 1930s, children were taught to be right-handed. You weren't allowed to be left-handed. So, you were right-handed. So, you want to be on the right-hand side of the gun. So, you can take the shell from your right and swivel it into the breech with your right side. But the loader in a Tiger is always on the right-hand side of the bridge, which is ergonomically makes no sense whatsoever. Why do they do this? I've never found an answer to this, but you know, so there's all these little things and as a soldier coming up against, you know, you're an American GI and you're coming up against a Tiger tank, you don't care about the fact that it's difficult to maintain or the problems involved of trying to get it to the battlefield. All you care about is this monster coming in front of you. It's squeaking and clanking away and it's incredibly scary and it's about to blow you to bits. That's all you care about and quite understandably so. But those who are protracting the war at a higher level and historians that come subsequently and look at all this stuff, they do need to worry about all these things. I remember Georg Thomas, the architect of the hunger plan. I found these minutes of this meeting which I think was either on the 4th of December or the 5th of December 1941. So, it's just before the Red Army counterattacks outside Moscow in the winter of 1941. And it's a meeting about weaponry. And this is a verbatim quote. He says, \"We have to stop making such complete and aesthetic weapons.\" In other words, we've consciously been building overengineered and aesthetically pleasing weapons up until this point. And they sort of half manage it, but don't quite. We could probably talk for many hours about each of these topics. We could talk for 10 hours about tanks. I encourage people to listen to your podcast, World War II Pod, We Have Ways of Making You Talk. It's great. Oh, yeah. But we also do, we've got a new YouTube channel and website called World War II Headquarters. There are lots of walking the ground and videos of that and all sorts of stuff and little explainers of going around tanks and stuff and the weaponry and documents and photographic archives. So the idea is to sort of turn it into a kind of real hub of anyone who's interested in this subject. It's a place where they can go and find out just a whole load more. I love it. So, like I said, we could probably talk for many hours on each of these topics, but let's look at some of the battles and maybe you can tell me which jumps out at you. I want to talk to you about the Western Front and definitely talk about Normandy. But so, there was the Battle of Midway in 1942, which is a naval battle. There's Eastern Front Stalingrad, probably the deadliest battle in human history. Then there's the Battle of Kursk, which is a tank battle. The largest tank battle in history. Probably the largest battle period in history. 6,000 tanks, 2 million troops, 4,000 aircraft. And then that takes us also to the Battle of the Bulge in Normandy, the Italian campaign that you talk a lot about. So what do you think is interesting to try to extract some wisdom from before we get to Normandy? Is do you find as a historian the Battle of Kursk or Battle of Stalingrad more interesting? Stalingrad is often seen as the turning point. Well, I, yeah, I think so. I mean it's really interesting.\nSo they get through 1941. Operation Barbarossa doesn't happen as the Germans hope it will. You know, the whole point is to completely destroy the Red Army in 3 months and that just doesn't happen. And I think you can argue and argue convincingly that by, let's say, the beginning of December 1941, Germany is just not going to win. It just can't. And let me tell you what I mean by that. So if you take an arbitrary date, let's say the 15th of June 1941, Germany at that moment has one enemy, which is Great Britain, albeit Great Britain plus Dominion Empire. Fast forward 6 months to, let's say, the 16th of December. It's got three enemies. It's got Great Britain Dominion Empire, USSR and the USA. It is just not going to win. You know, for all the talks of wonder weapons and all the rest of it's just not going to, you know, it has lost that battle. Having said that, Soviet Union is still in a really, really bad situation. It is being helped out a huge amount by supplies from the United States and from Britain. You know, just unprecedented amounts of material being sent through the Arctic or across Alaska into the Soviet Union at that time. It is absolutely staggering how much is committed by Roosevelt and Churchill to try and stem the flow in the Soviet Union because for all the announcements and pride that the Soviet Union has about moving factories to the other side of the Urals and stuff which they do in 1941, huge amounts are overrun intact by the Germans in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa. I mean really, you know, colossal losses, huge amounts. So you know the grain has gone, coal has gone, entire factories have gone, steel production goes down by kind of, you know, 80% in the Soviet Union in 1941 and into 1942. So in 1942 despite the vast amount of numbers of men that they have at their hands. I mean they create 80 new divisions in the second half of 1941, for example. I mean Britain never has 80\n\n\nDivisions in the entire Second World War. Division being about rule of thumb 15,000 men. So, you know, despite that, and that is because Stalin's meddling, the awful state of the Red Army in 1941, etc., etc., which we've already sort of touched upon. So, 1942, it's is still in a really bad way, but Germany's in a really bad way, too. It's the attrition it's it suffered in 1941, it's winning itself to death in 1941. So it's having these huge great encirclements like the encirclement of KEF in September 1941 you know capturing a further kind of best part of 700,000 Red Army troops etc etc but in the process of doing that it is constantly being attitted you know both both in battle casualties but in also mechanical casualties too just can't cope it's too the scale is just too big and what happens is with every moment that the German forces that ultimate victory slips away. So Hitler's personal handling of the battle increases. And you know, you can say what you like about him, but he just hasn't had the military training to do that. He might have amazing attention to detail. He might be able to understand, you know, have an enormous capacity to remember units and where they are on a map. But he was only a half corporal in the First World War. He's never been to staff college. You know, he might have read lots about Frederick the Great. I mean, I've read lots of history, but that doesn't mean to say I'd be a competent field marshal. Um, so he is not the right person for the job at all. And he micromanages and and he looks at and and figures and doesn't understand what it's like at the actual front, the coldface. So he's he's stifling the very thing that made the German army effective, which is the ability to give commanders at the front the freedom on their leash to be able to make decisions and battle command decisions. And he's taken that away from them. So he's basically making them go into battle with decreasing amounts of supplies and and firepower and with one hand behind their back in terms of decision-m process and that is not a good combination. The other problem is that he decides rather than going for Moscow in 1942 because basically there's a kind of cooling off period in the in the winter because of the conditions. But everyone know the Soviet Union know the Red Army knows that the moment spring's come there's going to be another offensive be another major offensive in the summer. That is absolutely as certain as you know day following night etc. The problem that the Germans have is they just don't have enough. They have less than they had when they launched Operation Barbarossa the previous year. The Soviet Union has more. It is better prepared. It knows what's coming now. It's kind of learning some of the lessons, starting to absorb the lessons. Stalin, coincidentally, is pulling back from his very tight leash. And the way that Hitler is doing the opposite and increasing his micromanagement and control freaky. And what Hitler decides is rather than going for Moscow, he's going to go for the oil fields. And this is absolutely insane because what's going to happen when they get to the oil fields? I mean, does he think really that the Soviet Union are going to let those oil fields come into German hands intact? Even if he does let them get in intact, what are they going to do with that oil? I mean, oil needs to be refined. Where are you going to refine it? You know, they don't have any or they don't have many oil refineries. How are you going to ship that oil to where you need it to be in the factories in the Third Reich and into your, you know, process into into gasoline and then get it and diesel and get it to your Yubos, get it to your tanks, get it to your armored units. How are you going to do that? How do you transport it from from the uh from the Caucuses, which is a long long way away from from Berlin? How you going to do that? There's no pipelines. There's only some pipelines. They've been built by American money and American engineering and they're going backwards towards the urals, not forwards. They have no more rail capacity whatsoever. They just don't have the oil tankers. So, it's just it's it is absolute la la land. It is incredible that when you look at the detailed literature that the Germans have. No one is asking this question in the in the spring and summer early summer of 1942. the logistics question in part. No one is saying, \"Okay, it's great that we're going to go to the caucuses and get all this oil, but then what?\" No one is asking that question, nor how do you provide resources and feed and the soldiers and all that kind of stuff. I mean, it's so so the case prove first of all, they get distracted by going into the Crimea and they go, \"Well, we got to do that first.\" So, they have to get Sevastapole and the Crimea, which they do. And then they have to push on and and and at this point suddenly looming in front of them is Stalingrad on the banks of the Vular. This this city this industrial city which has Stalin's name and Hitler goes okay what I'm going to do now is I'm going to split my forces so half of you can go south towards the Caucuses and the rest of you can confront Stalenrad. And on Boach just who's the commander just goes that's nuts. That makes no sense whatsoever. you know, you're you're you're splitting the mission. So, he fires him. So, suddenly they get get into this assault for Stalingrad and it becomes this sort of street fight. Street fighting is the worst kind of fighting. I mean, the reason why the Israelis have just blown everything up in in Gaza is because otherwise you can't see. You know, you need a field of fire. This is fighting up in a fighting in a buildup area is is horrendous. Yeah. To clarify, we're talking about urban warfare, doortodoor, building to building. It's incredibly difficult and home advantage is colossal in this this instance and of course it's piping hot when they\n\n\nAttack in kind of August into early September, and then it suddenly gets very, very cold. At the same time, American mechanization, and slightly British mechanization, but primarily American trucks, are enabling Zhukov to plan this great pincer movement. So it is, you know, and Russians will hate me for saying this. Um, and I probably will get a whole load of bots on the back of it, but the truth is, it is not the street fighting that destroys the German army. It is the encirclement, the subsequent encirclement. So the Germans have been sucked into this street battle in Stalingrad. Cannot give up. We cannot back down. We cannot pull out. We've got to destroy this city. Meanwhile, while their backs are turned, and while most of their forces are going off to the Caucasus on a wild goose chase for absolutely zero oil, incidentally, um, and they never get remotely close to Baku, this huge great pincer movement is being planned, and it is only possible through mechanization from the United States. And that is the big turning point, because from that moment onwards, the Germans are on the back foot. They're basically going backwards. There are little small character attacks. There is obviously the cursed salient, for example. Um, but it's game over. You know, the catastrophe of the surrender of the final. I mean, the writing's on the wall at the end of 1942, by November 1942, when the two Soviet fronts meet up, then, you know, there is no possible chance of escape for the German army. They are consigned. They are toast. And their final strand obviously happens at the very beginning of February 1943. But that's all over. Then, at the same time that that is happening, disaster is unfolding in North Africa, because Hitler has insisted on massively resupplying the Mediterranean theater. And the problem there is the amount of equipment that is lost in North Africa is greater than it is at Stalingrad. I don't think you could argue that psychologically Tunis is a greater loss than Stalingrad. It absolutely isn't. But you have to see them in tandem, as this is two fronts. This is eastern front, southern western front, and this is the first time that the Americans have been on the ground against Axis forces, and they lose big time. The Allies become masters of the North African shores on the 13th of May 1943, and it is a catastrophe. And in that time, 2,700 aircraft have been, Luftwaffe aircraft have been destroyed over North Africa between November 1942 and May 1943, and overall the subsequent that summer as well. Um, it's really interesting, the Luftwaffe loses between June and October 1943. So this is including the Kursk battle, which that takes place in July 1943. In that period, the Luftwaffe loses 702 aircraft over the Eastern Front, but 3,704 aircraft over the Mediterranean. So I think one has to also, one of the lessons about studying the Second World War is one has to be careful not to assign strategic importance to boots on the ground. It can be of great strategic importance, but not necessarily. You know, no one would argue, for example, that the Guadalcanal is not an absolutely game-changing battle in the Pacific War, and yet the number of troops compared to, you know, what's going on in the Eastern Front, or even, you know, the Western Front, is tiny in comparison. So, it is absolutely true that the most German blood is lost on the Eastern Front, but that doesn't mean to say that it's more strategically important than the Western Front. It's a, it's, and it's not saying that the western front is more strategic either. It's just you have to kind of be balanced about this. The psychological blow of Stalingrad is immense, and you cannot belittle that. I mean, there's the, we went over it really fast, but there is a human drama element. Yes. But yes, when we're talking about the operational side, the material loss of a battle is also extremely important to the big picture of the war. And we often don't talk about that, because of course, with war, the thing to focus on is the human drama of it. Yes. Because we're humans. And I also think that what's interesting is that is the Nazi high command's response to Stalingrad, which is not to go, \"We're screwed.\" It's to double down. It's, you know, then, so, Goebbels, for example, gives his infamous speech in the sports palace in the third week of February 1943, where he goes, \"Are you ready for this? You know, this is now total war. The war is coming. This is a fight for survival. We're all in it together. You are in this as well. You know, every single one, every single German is now this is a fight for survival, and we are now in total war.\" And everyone is just so depressed by this. I mean, yeah, they realize that there is that they have, they will are going to reap what they have sown, you know, because everyone knows what's been going on in the Eastern Front, because first part of the war, Germans have loads and loads of cameras. They're really into photographing everything, taking cine footage of everything. It's all part of recording the greatness of the Reich and the triumphs of the Reich. They want it recorded. So, all this stuff is bit like the radios is made very, very cheap. So, lots of havoc, and people are sending it all back, and you know, the people that are developing the stuff are all seeing it, and people are talking about it, and then it's being sent to families, and they're all seeing it, and they're seeing pictures of Jews being rounded up and beaten, and they're seeing Ukrainian partisans being executed, and they're seeing villages being torched, and everyone knows. They all know. Yeah. This whole idea is, you know, did they really know what was going on? Yeah, they do. They do know what's going on, you know, to lesser or greater detail. Of course, you know, there's some people who don't. And, you know, a bit like people know about the news today. Some people do, some people don't. I never read a newspaper. I never listen to the news, you know. So you have that, of course, but it is widely understood and widely known that really brutal things have been going on in\n\n\nThe east and troops are coming back utterly traumatized by what they have taken part in, what they have witnessed, the kind of unspeakable brutality.\nThis is war on a completely different level to anything that's been kind of seen in recent years.\nYeah.\nWe should mention that, you know, the Western Front and the Eastern Front are very different in this regard.\nYes.\nSo a lot of the Holocaust by bullets, the Holocaust with the concentration camps and the extermination camps is not in Germany, is not in the Western Front, is in Poland, is it's in the Soviet Union.\nYeah.\nBut don't forget that even Achvitz, for example, is part of the new Reich.\nIt is part of, you know, it is part of an area which has been absorbed into Germany.\nSo as far as they're concerned, this has now got, you know, it's now no longer got the Polish name.\nIt's now called Ashvitz, which is a German name.\nIt is part of Germany and there are German people moving there into this, you know, aircom model town, and they all know exactly what's going on.\nYeah.\nYou, by the way, have a nice podcast series of four episodes on Ashwitz.\nUm, the evolution of the dream world town that becomes a camp, a work camp, then becomes an extermination camp and a big boona factory for IG Farbin, which never produces a single bit of rubber.\nSo this for sure is something I would have to dive deep in.\nThere's a book you've recommended, KL.\nYes, it's just called KL.\nIt's about the the whole concentration camp system.\nUm, cuz K is concentration, um, in German.\nLaga is a is a camp.\nUm, it's a it's an exhaustive book and I'm I'm full of admiration for him for for writing it just because cheap as it must have been.\nSo I mean, I I was very depressed doing that work on Ashvitz, that deep dive.\nI just found the whole thing utterly dispiriting.\nUm, and I've been there a few times and it's ghastly.\nUm, so how he wrote a whole book on it, I don't know.\nI think in the details there's a there's two ways I think to look at the holocaust.\nOne is uh man's search for meaning about Victor Franco, sort of this philosophical thing about how a human being can confront that and find meaning and what it mean what what does the human condition look like in the context of such uh evil.\nAnd then there is the more sort of detailed, okay, well, how how do you actually implement something like the final solution?\nSo you have this ideology of evil implemented.\nYes.\nAnd at the fine detail of what what are the different technologies used?\nWhat are the different humans in the hierarchy of humans in a camp?\nHow do they what's the actual experience of the individual person who shows up at a camp?\nJust get in the details and in those details I think there's some deep profound human truth that can emerge that the the the mundane, um, one step at a time is how you can achieve evil.\nYeah.\nSo you can get lost in the mundane.\nIt's Yes.\nThe benality of evil.\nIt's um, it's incredible.\nI I I think I think what what is so so completely horrific is is that you know, you know, half the six million were killed by kind of bullets at the back of the head.\nAnd the reason they stopped doing that and they wanted to stop doing that was because the guys said, the perpetrators were finding it so traumatic.\nYou know, him goes and visits um an execution in Ukraine and or maybe he's in the Baltic States.\nI can't remember where he goes, but he but he witnessed some in, you know, in the summer of 1941.\nHe thinks, &quot;Oh, that's horrible.&quot;\nYou know, they don't have to do that.\nI don't want my men having to do that.\nGot to find a more humane way of doing it.\nWhen you talk about more humane way of doing it, humane for the for the executors, executioners, not not for the victims because trust me, cyclone B is not a nice way to go.\nYou know, it basic basically it's bursting all the capillaries in your lungs.\nIt's extremely painful and and you you can no longer breathe and it can take up to 20, 25 minutes.\nYou know, some people it can take a couple of minutes.\nBut all of those who are standing naked in that gas chamber, first of all, extremely humiliated by this process in the first place, then there's a sudden realization of that that they're not having a shower.\nThey're actually being gassed and they're all going to die.\nImagine what you're thinking as that process is you because you might be the first, but you're still going to even the first person is going to know that I can't breathe and I'm I'm dying.\nEveryone else is going to see the first few dying and then going to realize that is what's going to happen to them.\nAnd you've got those minutes, sometimes many minutes where you've got to contemplate that that and and that's that's in extreme pain and panic.\nAnd just think about how cruel that is while being humiliated all the way through.\nWhile being humiliated all the way through.\nAnd so the inverted commas humanity of of of the gas chambers is anything but.\nIt's disgusting.\nA and the fact that people could do this is just beyond terrific.\nAnd then the fact that you are taking your Jewish prisoners and getting them to cut off all the hair, pull out the teeth of the dead before you put them on a lift and incinerate them.\nIf you go to Avitz now and you go to the collapse, the blown up gas chambers which the Germans destroyed before the Russians overran them in January 45, you can still see some of the ash ponds.\nAnd there are bits of bone there but still there from the ash.\nIt's just it is utterly repulsive.\nAnd imagine arriving from that train on that incredibly long journey where you've had no comforts whatsoever.\nYou've had again you've had humiliations and privation, you know, the privations you've had to suffer as a result of that, you know, of having to kind of defecate in a bucket in the corner in front of other people.\nIt's just horrendous.\nAnd then you get there bewildered and immediately your kids are taken away from you or your you know husband and wife who've been married 20 years.\nThey're\n\n\nSeparated just like that, sent off into different groups, straight to the gas chambers.\nI mean, you know, it is the scale of cruelty is so immense.\nIt's hard to fathom.\nAnd the thing that I find really difficult to reconcile, and this is where I think the, you know, the warning from history is important, is that Germany is such an amazing nation.\nYou know, it's the country of Beethoven and Strauss and of Goethe and incredible art and culture and some of the greatest engineers and scientists have ever lived.\nAnd look how quickly it flipped into the descent of unspeakable inhumanity, which manifested itself in the Holocaust and the gas chambers, and the executions into pits and tiny places and creeks in Lithuania or Ukraine or whatever.\nI mean, it's just horrendous.\nAnd you know, this is from a nation which a decade earlier had been a democracy.\nIt seems like as a human civilization, we walk that soldier in line between good and evil.\nIt's a thin line, and we have to walk it carefully.\nYes.\nSo, one of the great battles in World War II on the Western Front is Normandy.\nI have to talk to you about Normandy.\nD-Day, the Normandy landings, the famous on June 6th, 1944.\nThis was an Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Western Europe.\nWhat was the planning?\nAnd it was lengthy planning.\nWhat was the planning?\nWhat was the execution of the Normandy landings?\nWell, the decision to finally go into, when the Americans joined the war in December 1941, there's the Arcadia conference a few days later, a week later between the British chiefs of staff and political leader Churchill and Roosevelt and his own chiefs of staff about what the policy should be.\nAnd the policy is to get American troops over to Europe as quickly as possible, get them over to Britain, get them training, and get them across the channel ASAP and start the liberation of Europe.\nBut the reality is that in 1942, the Americans just aren't ready.\nYou know, they've gone from this incredibly tiny army.\nThey're still growing.\nThey've got no battlefield experience.\nThe British are still recovering.\nYou know, they're good on the naval power.\nThey're kind of increasingly good on air power.\nBut land power, they've had to kind of make up from the loss of their ally France and expand as well.\nSo kind of ground zero for both America and Britain has been kind of June 1940, when France is out, and suddenly that's the strategic earthquake, and that's the issue that needs settling, and they need to just completely realign everything that they'd fought in 1949.\nThey've got to start again, but it's also becomes clear that they're not really ready in 1943 either.\nAnd one of the problems is that Molotov, who is the Soviet foreign minister, has come over to Britain in May 1942 and said, you know, we need you to kind of do your bit and get on the campaign trail against the Germans and fight on the ground.\nAnd the British sort of going, well, yeah, but you know, cross-channel invasion is not really going to happen.\nWe know we're doing that in North Africa at the moment.\nThen he goes over to Washington and the Americans go, you know, we are definitely going to go and take on the attack to the Germans in 1942.\nThey've made this promise.\nSo in the summer of 1942, it becomes clear that they can't keep that.\nSo Churchill says, \"Well, look, I've got here's an idea.\nYou know, we're in, we've got already got an army in Egypt.\nWhy don't we land another one in Northwest Europe?\nWe can Northwest Africa.\nWe can, that's run by Vichy France, which is pro-French colonies.\nWhy don't we take that?\nWe can do that, and then we can meet in the middle.\nWe can pinch around.\nWe can conquer the whole of North Africa.\nYou can kill two birds with one stone because you can get some experience fighting against Axis troops.\nYou know, test some of your equipment and commanders, you know, what's not to like, and then we can sort of see how it goes.\"\nSo, this is a kind of opportunistic strategy, whereas the Americans are very much sort of, you know, we want to draw a straight line to Berlin, and that's the quickest way, and let's do it that way.\nSo, it's a kind of a different viewpoint, and but Roosevelt kind of gets that and agrees to that.\nSo that's where the whole North Africa Mediterranean campaign comes from.\nAnd as a consequence of the huge commitment to Tunisia, you know, three and a half thousand aircraft, huge navies, you know, two army allied armies in North Africa by the time Tunisia is won in mid-May 1943, they think, well, we got all this here.\nWe might as well kind of really try and get put the nail into the coffin of Italy's war, get them out of the battle.\nYou know, Sicily is an obvious one.\nLet's go in there, and then we can take a view.\nBut between Sicily happening and the fall of North Africa is the Trident Conference in Washington.\nAnd that is where the decisions made.\nThe Americans go, \"Okay, enough of this opportunistic stuff.\nLet's just, okay, we get it.\nWe buy it.\nBut no more faffing around.\nYou know, May 1944, one year hence, we are going to cross the Atlantic.\"\nAnd the British go, \"Okay, fair cop.\nWe'll do that.\"\nSo that is where Operation Overlord, as it becomes, gets given its code name, its operational name.\nThat's when the planning starts.\nSerious planning starts at the beginning of 1944.\nAnd one of the lessons from Sicily to Normandy is that you can't have commanders fighting one battle whilst preparing for the next one.\nSo you have to have a separate command structure.\nAnd that's okay because by this time you got enough people that have got experience with battlefield command that you can actually split it.\nThere are very good reasons for going into Italy, not least getting the fodder airfields so that you can further tighten the noose around\n\n\nAround Nazi Germany.\nAnd one of the great prerequisites for the Normandy invasion is total control of air of the air of the airspace, not just over Normandy, but over a large swathe of northwest Europe.\nWhy is that?\nBecause the moment you land in Normandy, the cat is out of the bag.\nAnd it's then a race between which side can build up meta material quickest.\nIs it going to be the Allies who've got to come from southern England, which is a distance of a slow journey across seas and a distance between kind of 80 and 130 mi away, or is it going to be the Germans that are already on the continent?\nWell, clearly on paper it's the Germans.\nSo, you have to slow up the Germans.\nWell, how do you do that?\nYou do that by destroying their means of getting there.\nSo, bridges, destroy all the bridges over the sane, destroy all the bridges over the RVI, hit the marshalling yards.\nThe German the glue that keeps the German war machine together is the Reichkes barn the German railway network.\nSo destroy the railway as much as you possibly can and make it difficult for the Germans to reinforce the the the Normandy British head as and when it comes.\nBut the way you do that in turn is by very low-level precision bombing and that has to be done by by twin engine faster smaller bombers going in low.\nBut the problem is is you can't go low and and and destroy those bridges if you've got fucker wolves and measure smmiths hovering above you.\nSo you've got to destroy those, which is why you need to have air superiority over this large wave of Northwest Europe to do that.\nThe problem is that while the industrial heartland of Nazi Germany is in the west is in the rural era, which is very convenient for bombers coming out of Lincolnshire or East Anglia on the east flat east side of of Great Britain.\nThe aircraft industry is much deeper into the Reich and it is beyond the the range of fighter escorts for the bombers and the American daylight bombers who are going over are discovering that despite being called flying fortresses they're not fortresses they're actually getting decimated and whenever their bombers go in strength over to try and hit the aircraft industry in Germany beyond fighter range they get decimated first infamously on the Schwin Reagers raid on the 17th of August 1943 coincidentally the same day that Sicily falls to the allies.\nUm, and also coincidentally the same day that face-to-face negotiations begin with the Italians for an armistice in Lisbon.\nBut on that day of the 324 heavy bombers that the Americans send over to hit Schweinford and Regensburg where there are mesh plant and and also a ball bearing plant which is essential for aircraft manufacturing.\nUm, they lose 60 shot down and a further 130 odd really badly damaged.\nAnd even for the vast numbers of manpower and and bombers that are coming out of America, this is too much.\nSo they can't sustain it.\nSo they've got to find a fighter escort that's going to be able to escort them all the way into the into the Reich.\nAnd the race is on because basically if they haven't got one airspace by April 1944, it's game over.\nYou can't do a cross channel invasion.\nYou have to have that control of the airspace beforehand.\nSo the race is on.\nUnfortunately, they come with a solution, which is the P-51 Mustang, which has originally been commissioned in May 1940 by the British, developed from sketches to reality in 117 days.\nIt's a work of absolute genius.\nBut Stal is harnessed with a really bad engine.\nThe Allison engine is just not not right for that aircraft.\nAnd it's not until a Rolls-Royce Merlin, which is the same one that powers the Lancaster, the Mosquito, and Spitfire and Huracan is put into the P-51 Mustang that suddenly you've got your solution because that means it can now fly with extra drop tanks and fuel tanks, it can um it's it's so aerodynamic and it's so good.\nThe higher it goes with this engine, the more fuel efficient it becomes, it can actually fly, you know, over 400 miles, which gets you not just to Berlin and back, but to Warsaw and back.\nSo, suddenly you've got that solution.\nUh and actually by April 1944 they have cleared airspace and by the end of May 1944 just on the eve of the invasion uh operation overlord the closest German aircraft that is seen fighting um allied aircraft is 500 miles from the beach head.\nSo it is absolutely job done.\nMeanwhile, new fighter, comparatively new um ground attack fighter planes like Typhoons and Tempests and adapted um uh um P-47 Thunderbolts are attacking the German radar stations all along the the coastline.\nThey now do have an air defense system.\nUm they're destroying kind of uh um 90% of their effectiveness.\nAnd in the intelligence game, they're winning that one as well.\nThey're just much better because in Germany, intelligence is power.\nSo people tend to you know and Hitler always has this kind of divide and rule thing going on.\nSo you have parallel command structures which is not conducive to bringing together of intelligence and while much play has been made about the successes of Bletchley and code breaking and all the rest of it.\nActually what you have to do is you have to see the kind of the decrypts that the Bletchley cryp analysts do as just a cog and that those various cogs together from listening services to photo reconnaissance to agents on the ground to say the cogs collectively add up to more than some of their individual parts.\nSo the intelligence picture is a broad picture rather than a than just codereing.\nBut anyway they they win that particular battle as well.\nAnd what you see really with D-Day is, I think, is the zenith of coal coalition warfare.\nWhat you've got is you've got multiple nations who have different uh overall aims, different cultures, um different attitudes, different start points, but they have all coalesced into one common goal.\nAnd for until they've achieved that common goal, they're kind of put differences to one side.\nYou know, much play has been made about kind of anglophobia amongst American um commanders and and America phobia amongst ally, you know, British commanders, but actually it's nothing.\nIt's a marriage made in heaven compared to the way Germany teach looks after its own allies, for example.\n\n\nAnd what is remarkable about the allies is they're not actually allies.\nThey're coalition partners.\nSo there's no formal alliance at all.\nAnd uh and there is a subtle difference there, but what you see them is you see them really really pulling together.\nAnd you see that manifest itself on D-Day, I think, where you've got, you know, 6,939 vessels of which there are 1,213 warships, 4,127 assaultcraft, 12,000 aircraft, you know, 155,000 men landed and dropped from the air in 24-hour period.\nIt is phenomenal.\nIt is absolutely phenomenal.\nAnd while it is still seen as a predominantly American show, all three service commanders are British.\nUm it is um most of the aircraft are two-thirds of the aircraft are British.\nUh two-thirds of the men landed are British in Dominion.\nYou never forget the Canadians who consistently punch massively above their weight in the Second World War.\nUm in all aspects, it has to be said, air, land, and sea.\nUm they're key in the Battle of the Atlantic.\nThey're key um in air power.\nTheir key D-Day and indeed in the battle for Italy as well.\nSo the Canadians should never be forgotten.\nUm but but one of the reasons it is that the the that it is the British Navy that dominates in in D-Day is because of course the the incredibly enormous strength of the Royal Navy in the first place.\nBut partly because most of the US Navy is by this stage in the Pacific fighting its own own fight.\nSo it's not slacking by any stretch of the imagination.\nIt is it is because it's elsewhere doing its bit for the kind of overall Allied cause.\nBut D-Day is just extraordinary, you know, and despite the terrible weather, uh, which is a such a debilitating factor in the whole thing.\nI mean, it puts people off course, means many more people get killed on Omaha Beach than they might have done and on other beaches besides incidentally.\nAnd actually, in terms of lives lost proportionally, it is the Canadians that suffer the worst, more so than the Americans.\nIt's just as fewer of them um, overall.\nUm D-Day has to be seen as an unqualified success.\nI mean it is absolutely extraordinary what they achieve and while they don't 100% achieve their overall D-Day objectives you know the objectives are always going to be the outer reach of what is is can be can be achieved and you'd need absolutely perfect conditions for that to happen and they don't get perfect conditions but they're so balanced they're so thought of absolutely everything and and their logistic supply and and I mean even things like the mind sweeping operation it's the biggest single mind sweeping operation of the entire war because there's huge minefields off the Normandy coast and ahead of the invasion force, the mind sweepers, which amount to I think something like 242 different mine sweepers in in five different operations AC opposite every single beach, creating lanes through these minefields through which the invasion force can go.\nNot a single ship is lost to a mine in the actual invasion.\nThat is phenomenal and and and can only be done with the greatest of skill and planning and all in a period where you know there are no computers, there's no GPS, there's nothing.\nI mean it is it is absolutely astonishing and the scale of it is just frankly mind-boggling.\nYeah.\nAnd that was really the the nail in the coffin the beginning of the end.\nYeah.\nFor for Hitler for the European theater.\nYeah.\nOnce you get the the only cause for doubt is will they be able to secure that bridge head.\nThe moment they get that bridge head it is game over.\nThere's only, you know, there is there is no other way it's going to be because of the overwhelming amount of men and material that the allies have compared to the Germans at this stage of the war.\nAnd of course, you know, you're being attacked on three fronts because there's the Italian front to the south and of course in a very major way, you've also got the Eastern front and operation which is launched that that summer as well is enormous.\nSo, let's go to the very end.\nUh the battle of Berlin.\nYeah.\nUh Hitler sitting in his bunker, his suicide, Germany's surrender.\nYou actually said that Downfall, the movie was a very accurate representation.\nI think it is really except that Joseph Goebbels took Sonide and shoot himself.\nDetails, but I think it's probably it might be my favorite uh World War II movie, which is strange to say because it's not really about World War II.\nIt's about Hitler in a bunker.\nBut I think uh was it Bruno Gance, wasn't there?\nI think I think he he nailed him.\nYeah, that's there's so many accounts of that.\nThere's so much written about Hitler.\nThere's so many of there's millions and millions of Hitler's words that you can read.\nYou know, there are translations of many of his conferences.\nYou can see what he's saying.\nHe can get inside his head in a very clear way and much more clearly than you can Stalin or just about any other leader really.\nAnd so what has a very very strong impression of what Hitler was like in the bunker in those last last days that just there's so many accounts of it and it just feels like they nailed it.\nIt just feels like they've got it spot on to me.\nI mean it's a fascinating story of a evil maniac and then and this this certainty you know crumbling right like realizing that this vision of the thousand-year Reich is uh and Hitler says says you know my reputation won't be good to start off with but I hope in a few years time that people start to realize that kind of all the good I was trying to bring.\nYeah that sort of they're all the same aren't they?\nYou always believe you're doing good.\nYeah.\nAnd there's so many deep lessons there.\nSo now you have written so much, you have said so much, you have studied this so much.\nWhat to you looking at World War II is uh the lessons we should take away.\nWell, I suppose it's it's it's what happens when you allow these individuals to take hold of great power and great authority and make these terrible decisions.\nIf you allow that to happen, you know, there are consequences and you have to be you have to recognize the\n\n\nMoments of trouble when they arise.\nSo when there are financial crisis, you know that political unrest is going to come and you need to be prepared for that.\nYou know, you need to be able to see the writing on the wall.\nYou can't be complacent.\nComplacency is such a dirty word, isn't it?\nYou've got to keep your wits and you can't take things for granted.\nYou've got to recognize, I think, um, that the freedoms we enjoy in the West are, you know, they're not necessarily permanent and you need to make the most of them while you've got them and cherish them and consider what happens if the milk turns sour and what the consequences of that are.\nI mean, actually overriding because although I don't think it'll ever be a war on the scale of the Second World War, you've only got to look at pictures of those opening days of the war in Ukraine and see sort of knocked out Russian tanks and dead bodies, bloated bodies all over the place, put that into black and white and, you know, it could be the road out of Fal in 1944.\nIt could be, you know, any number of German battlefields in World War II and the similarities and the trenches and the kind of people hiding in foxholes and, you know, that's horribly reminiscent as are the huge casualties that they're suffering on both sides, whether they be Russian or Ukrainian.\nAnd, you know, it's a shock.\nIt's a shock to see that.\nUm, and it reminds you of just how quickly I think things can descend.\nSo that's that's uh that's the other thing you know that point I was making about how quickly Germany descended from this amazing nation of arts and culture and science and development and engineering into one of the Holocaust.\nI mean life is fragile and peace is fragile and you know it's you take it for granted at your peril and you take for granted at our peril that nobody will use nuclear weapons ever again and that's not a thing we should take for granted.\nNo sir.\nWhat gives you hope about the future of human civilization?\nWe've been talking about all this darkness in the 20th century.\nWhat's the source of light?\nThe source of light is that I think the vast majority of people are good people who want to live peacefully and want to live happily and are not filled with hate.\nAnd there are some brilliant minds out there.\nAnd I think the capacity for the human brain to come up with new developments and new answers to problems and challenges is infinite.\nAnd I think that's what gives me hope.\nJames, this is uh I'm a big fan.\nThis was an honor to talk to you and please keep putting incredible history out there.\nUm I can't wait to see what you do next.\nThank you so much for talking today.\nWell, thank you, Lex.\nIt's been a It's a privilege to talk to you.\nThanks for listening to this conversation with James Holland.\nTo support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfreeman.com/sponsors.\nAnd now, let me leave you with some words from Winston Churchill.\nIf you're going through hell, keep going.\nThank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n",

The conversation also touches on conspiracy theories, the Jeffrey Epstein case, and the role of media and propaganda. Smith and Fridman also explore the current political landscape, including the influence of wokeism, the potential for political outsiders, and the importance of long-form interviews in modern politics, concluding with a message of hope for the future.",

They delve into the core tenets of their ideologies, including individualism, the ethics of capitalism, and the role of government. The conversation explores the nuances of their approaches, contrasting Rand's axiomatic philosophy with Friedman's empirical methods. The discussion extends to broader economic concepts such as monetarism, stagflation, and the impact of inflation. Burns also shares insights on the evolution of ideas, the influence of historical context, and the challenges of navigating complex intellectual landscapes, touching on topics from cryptocurrency to the dynamics of political discourse.",
